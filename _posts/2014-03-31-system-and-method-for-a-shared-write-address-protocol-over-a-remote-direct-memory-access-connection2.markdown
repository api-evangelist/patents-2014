title: System and method for a shared write address protocol over a remote direct memory access connection
abstract: The present invention provides a system and method for a shared write address protocol (SWAP) that is implemented over a remote direct memory address (RDMA) connection. Each party to a connection establishes a flow control block that is accessible to its partner via a RDMA READ operation. The novel protocol operates so that each module needs to have one outstanding RDMA READ operation at a time, i.e., to obtain the current flow control information from its partner. In operation, if data to be transmitted is less than or equal to a buffer size, an INLINE message data structure of the SWAP protocol is utilized to send the data to be target. However, if the data is greater than the buffer size, a second determination is made as to whether sufficient space exists in the message pool for the data. If insufficient space exists, the sender will wait until sufficient space exists before utilizing a novel WRITE operation of the SWAP protocol to transmit the data.

The present application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 418 180 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR A SHARED WRITE ADDRESS PROTOCOL OVER A REMOTE DIRECT MEMORY ACCESS CONNECTION filed on Apr. 3 2009 by James Lentini the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.

The present invention relates to network communication channels and more specifically to the use of remote direct memory access RDMA operations over network communication channels.

A storage system typically comprises one or more storage devices into which information may be entered and from which information may be obtained as desired. The storage system includes a storage operating system that functionally organizes the system by inter alia invoking storage operations in support of a storage service implemented by the system. The storage system may be implemented in accordance with a variety of storage architectures including but not limited to a network attached storage NAS environment a storage area network SAN and a disk assembly directly attached to a client or host computer. The storage devices are typically disk drives organized as a disk array wherein the term disk commonly describes a self contained rotating magnetic media storage device. The term disk in this context is synonymous with hard disk drive HDD or direct access storage device DASD . Storage devices may also comprise solid state devices such as flash memory battery backed up non volatile ramdom access memory etc. As such the description of storage devices being disks should be taken as exemplary only.

The storage operating system of the storage system may implement a high level module such as a file system to logically organize the information stored on volumes as a hierarchical structure of data containers such as files and logical unit numbers luns . For example each on disk file may be implemented as set of data structures i.e. disk blocks configured to store information such as the actual data for the file. These data blocks are organized within a volume block number vbn space that is maintained by the file system. The file system may also assign each data block in the file a corresponding file offset or file block number fbn . The file system typically assigns sequences of fbns on a per file basis whereas vbns are assigned over a larger volume address space. The file system organizes the data blocks within the vbn space as a logical volume each logical volume may be although is not necessarily associated with its own file system.

A known type of file system is a write anywhere file system that does not overwrite data on disks. If a data block is retrieved read from disk into a memory of the storage system and dirtied i.e. updated or modified with new data the data block is thereafter stored written to a new location on disk to optimize write performance. A write anywhere file system may initially assume an optimal layout such that the data is substantially contiguously arranged on disks. The optimal disk layout results in efficient access operations particularly for sequential read operations directed to the disks. An example of a write anywhere file system that is configured to operate on a storage system is the Write Anywhere File Layout WAFL file system available from NetApp Inc. Sunnyvale Calif.

The storage system may be further configured to operate according to a client server model of information delivery to thereby allow many clients to access data containers stored on the system. In this model the client may comprise an application such as a database application executing on a computer that connects to the storage system over a computer network such as a point to point link shared local area network LAN wide area network WAN or virtual private network VPN implemented over a public network such as the Internet. Each client may request the services of the storage system by issuing file based and block based protocol messages in the form of packets to the system over the network.

To enable high performance communications among storage systems a plurality of storage systems may be organized as nodes of a cluster that is configured to implement distributed operations to increase overall bandwidth. Intra cluster communications typically require high performance communication pathways. An example of such pathways that cluster node members may utilize is remote direct memory access RDMA networks to enable high performance communications. Typically RDMA networks use network protocol offloads and or direct access interfaces to reduce the load on a main processor of a cluster member. To achieve network protocol offload an RDMA compatible network adapter typically implements network protocol processing up to and including the transport layer. Offloading protocol processing from the cluster member s main processor provides additional compute cycles for other tasks.

In addition to its protocol offload capabilities an RDMA compatible network adapter may provide direct access interface to applications via specialized hardware and or operating system coordination. As part of its direct access interface the RDMA compatible network adapter typically provides a plurality of communication primitives e.g. RDMA READ and RDMA WRITE operations. An RDMA READ operation requests that a data buffer on a target node e.g. a remote cluster member be transferred or read into a local destination buffer of a source node e.g. a local cluster member . That is an RDMA READ operation causes data stored in a defined memory region i.e. a buffer on the target node to be transferred to a buffer that is allocated on the source node i.e. the node that originated the RDMA READ operation. An RDMA WRITE operation transfers a local data buffer to a remote destination buffer.

In a typical implementation an RDMA READ operation consumes more resources and is slower than an RDMA write operation. Unlike RDMA WRITE operations RDMA READ operations require dedicated resources on the RDMA hardware of the target and source node when transferring the data into the local destination buffer. If not managed appropriately consumption of such resources may adversely impact e.g. throttle RDMA operations. For this reason typical RDMA network adapters limit the number of RDMA READ operations that can be issued in parallel on a single connection i.e. the total number of such operations that may be outstanding at any time. For example RDMA adapters typically only allow a small number of RDMA READ operations to be outstanding at a time compared to the number of outstanding RDMA WRITE operations that may be outstanding at a time. RDMA READ operations are also typically slower than RDMA WRITE operations because they typically require a transaction on the target system s I O bus e.g. the PCI bus PCI X bus PCI Express bus etc. before the target s RDMA adapter can send an acknowledgement completing the RDMA READ operation. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art this presents a challenge to data access protocols that rely on RDMA READ operations as those protocols must use RDMA READ operations sparingly to avoid being throttled due to RDMA hardware limitations.

The present invention overcomes the disadvantages of the prior art by providing a system and method for a shared write address protocol SWAP that is implemented over a remote direct memory address RDMA connection. The system and method enables the optimized utilization of the limited number of READ operations typically imposed by RDMA hardware environments. After the connection is established between two partner modules e.g. a network element network module or disk element data module within a cluster utilizing a conventional RDMA transport protocol each of the modules transmits a novel HELLO message to its partner. The HELLO message is utilized by each module to convey appropriate flow control information using a flow control data structure that is accessible to its partner via a RDMA READ operation. The novel protocol operates so that each module has one outstanding RDMA READ operation at a time i.e. to obtain the current flow control information from its partner.

When a module receives data to be transmitted to its partner module over the RDMA connection a determination is made whether the received data is less than or equal to a defined buffer size. The buffer size is illustratively defined in the initial HELLO messages exchanged between modules. If the data to be transmitted is less than or equal to the buffer size an INLINE message data structure of the SWAP protocol is utilized to send the data to the partner. However if the data is greater than the buffer size a second determination is made as to whether sufficient space exists in a message pool for the data. If insufficient space exists the transmitting module waits until sufficient space exists before utilizing a novel WRITE operation of the SWAP protocol to transmit the data. By utilizing the principles of the present invention the use of RDMA READ requests is limited to a single outstanding RDMA READ request to obtain flow control information from the module s partner thereby obviating the need for having a plurality of outstanding RDMA READ operations for a single connection at a single time.

The clients may be general purpose computers configured to interact with the node in accordance with a client server model of information delivery. That is each client may request the services of the node and the node may return the results of the services requested by the client by exchanging packets over the network . The client may issue packets including file based access protocols such as the Common Internet File System CIFS protocol or Network File System NFS protocol over the Transmission Control Protocol Internet Protocol TCP IP when accessing information in the form of files and directories. Alternatively the client may issue packets including block based access protocols such as the Small Computer Systems Interface SCSI protocol encapsulated over TCP iSCSI and SCSI encapsulated over Fibre Channel FCP when accessing information in the form of blocks. It should be noted that in alternative embodiments additional and or differing protocols may be utilized without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. As such the description of the various file and or block based protocols should be taken as exemplary only.

Each node is illustratively embodied as a dual processor storage system executing a storage operating system that preferably implements a high level module such as a file system to logically organize the information as a hierarchical structure of named data containers such as directories files and special types of files called virtual disks hereinafter generally blocks on the disks. However it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that the node may alternatively comprise a single or more than two processor system. Illustratively one processor executes the functions of the network module on the node while the other processor executes the functions of the data module .

The memory illustratively comprises storage locations that are addressable by the processors and adapters for storing software program code and data structures associated with the present invention. The processor and adapters may in turn comprise processing elements and or logic circuitry configured to execute the software code and manipulate the data structures. Message pool is illustratively a reserved location in memory that is utilized for storing data to be transmitted to a partner using the novel shared write address protocol SWAP in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the present invention. Message pool and its use is described in further detail below.

The storage operating system portions of which is typically resident in memory and executed by the processing elements functionally organizes the node by inter alia invoking storage operations in support of the storage service implemented by the node. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that other processing and memory means including various computer readable media may be used for storing and executing program code and or instructions pertaining to the invention described herein.

The network adapter comprises a plurality of ports adapted to couple the node to one or more clients over point to point links wide area networks virtual private networks implemented over a public network Internet or a shared local area network. The network adapter thus may comprise the mechanical electrical and signaling circuitry needed to connect the node to the network. In illustrative embodiments the network adapter may comprise a RDMA adapter. Illustratively the computer network may be embodied as an Ethernet network or a Fibre Channel FC network. Each client may communicate with the node over network by exchanging discrete frames or packets of data according to pre defined protocols such as TCP IP. In alternative embodiments of the present invention the novel SWAP protocol may be utilized for client sever communications. As such the description below of server server communications should be taken as exemplary only.

The storage adapter cooperates with the storage operating system executing on the node to access information requested by the clients. The information may be stored on any type of attached array of writable storage device media such as video tape optical DVD magnetic tape bubble memory electronic random access memory micro electro mechanical solid state flash and any other similar media adapted to store information including data and parity information. However as illustratively described herein the information is preferably stored on the disks of array . The storage adapter comprises a plurality of ports having input output I O interface circuitry that couples to the disks over an I O interconnect arrangement such as a conventional high performance FC link topology.

Storage of information on each array is preferably implemented as one or more storage volumes that comprise a collection of physical storage disks cooperating to define an overall logical arrangement of volume block number vbn space on the volume s . Each logical volume is generally although not necessarily associated with its own file system. The disks within a logical volume file system are typically organized as one or more groups wherein each group may be operated as a Redundant Array of Independent or Inexpensive Disks RAID . Most RAID implementations such as a RAID 4 level implementation enhance the reliability integrity of data storage through the redundant writing of data stripes across a given number of physical disks in the RAID group and the appropriate storing of parity information with respect to the striped data. An illustrative example of a RAID implementation is a RAID 4 level implementation although it should be understood that other types and levels of RAID implementations may be used in accordance with the inventive principles described herein.

To facilitate access to the disks the storage operating system implements a write anywhere file system that cooperates with one or more virtualization modules to virtualize the storage space provided by disks . The file system logically organizes the information as a hierarchical structure of named directories and files on the disks. Each on disk file may be implemented as set of disk blocks configured to store information such as data whereas the directory may be implemented as a specially formatted file in which names and links to other files and directories are stored. The virtualization module s allow the file system to further logically organize information as a hierarchical structure of blocks on the disks that are exported as named logical unit numbers luns .

In the illustrative embodiment the storage operating system is preferably the NetApp Data ONTAP operating system available from NetApp Inc. Sunnyvale Calif. that implements a Write Anywhere File Layout WAFL file system. However it is expressly contemplated that any appropriate storage operating system may be enhanced for use in accordance with the inventive principles described herein. As such where the term ONTAP is employed it should be taken broadly to refer to any storage operating system that is otherwise adaptable to the teachings of this invention.

In addition the storage operating system includes a series of software layers organized to form a storage server that provides data paths for accessing information stored on the disks of the node . To that end the storage server includes a file system module in cooperating relation with a RAID system module and a disk driver system module . The RAID system manages the storage and retrieval of information to and from the volumes disks in accordance with I O operations while the disk driver system implements a disk access protocol such as e.g. the SCSI protocol.

The file system implements a virtualization system of the storage operating system through the interaction with one or more virtualization modules illustratively embodied as e.g. a virtual disk vdisk module not shown and a SCSI target module . The vdisk module enables access by administrative interfaces such as a user interface of a management framework see in response to a user system administrator issuing commands to the node . The SCSI target module is generally disposed between the FC and iSCSI drivers and the file system to provide a translation layer of the virtualization system between the block lun space and the file system space where luns are represented as blocks.

The file system is illustratively a message based system that allocates storage space for itself in the disk array and controls the layout of information on the array. The file system further provides logical volume management capabilities for use in access to the information stored on the storage devices such as disks. That is in addition to providing file system semantics the file system provides functions normally associated with a volume manager. These functions include i aggregation of the disks ii aggregation of storage bandwidth of the disks and iii reliability guarantees such as mirroring and or parity RAID . The file system illustratively implements the WAFL file system hereinafter generally the write anywhere file system having an on disk format representation that is block based using e.g. 4 kilobyte KB blocks and using index nodes inodes to identify files and file attributes such as creation time access permissions size and block location . The file system uses files to store metadata describing the layout of its file system these metadata files include among others an inode file. A file data container handle i.e. an identifier that includes an inode number is used to retrieve an inode from disk.

Broadly stated all inodes of the write anywhere file system are organized into the inode file. A file system fs info block specifies the layout of information in the file system and includes an inode of a data container e.g. file that includes all other inodes of the file system. Each logical volume file system has an fsinfo block within e.g. a RAID group. The inode of the inode file may directly reference point to data blocks of the inode file or may reference indirect blocks of the inode file that in turn reference data blocks of the inode file. Within each data block of the inode file are embedded inodes each of which may reference indirect blocks that in turn reference data blocks of a file.

Operationally a request from the client is forwarded as a packet over the computer network and onto the node where it is received at the network adapter . A network driver of layer or layer processes the packet and if appropriate passes it on to a network protocol and file access layer for additional processing prior to forwarding via for example a Cluster Fabric CF interface to the file system . Here the file system generates operations to load retrieve the requested data from disk if it is not resident in core i.e. in memory . If the information is not in memory the file system indexes into the inode file using the inode number to access an appropriate entry and retrieve a logical vbn. The file system then passes a message structure including the logical vbn to the RAID system the logical vbn is mapped to a disk identifier and disk block number disk dbn and sent to an appropriate driver e.g. SCSI of the disk driver system . The disk driver accesses the dbn from the specified disk and loads the requested data block s in memory for processing by the node. Upon completion of the request the node and operating system returns a reply to the client over the network .

It should be noted that the software path through the storage operating system layers described above needed to perform data storage access for the client request received at the node may alternatively be implemented in hardware. That is in an alternative embodiment of the invention a storage access request data path may be implemented as logic circuitry embodied within e.g. a field programmable gate array FPGA or an application specific integrated circuit ASIC . This type of hardware implementation increases the performance of the storage service provided by node in response to a request issued by client . Moreover in another alternative embodiment of the invention the processing elements of adapters may be configured to offload some or all of the packet processing and storage access operations respectively from processor to thereby increase the performance of the storage service provided by the node. It is expressly contemplated that the various processes architectures and procedures described herein can be implemented in hardware firmware or software.

As used herein the term storage operating system generally refers to the computer executable code operable on a computer to perform a storage function that manages data access and may in the case of a node implement data access semantics of a general purpose operating system. The storage operating system can also be implemented as a microkernel an application program operating over a general purpose operating system such as UNIX or Windows NT or as a general purpose operating system with configurable functionality which is configured for storage applications as described herein.

In addition it will be understood to those skilled in the art that the invention described herein may apply to any type of special purpose e.g. file server filer or storage serving appliance or general purpose computer including a standalone computer or portion thereof embodied as or including a storage system. Moreover the teachings of this invention can be adapted to a variety of storage system architectures including but not limited to a network attached storage environment a storage area network and disk assembly directly attached to a client or host computer. The term storage system should therefore be taken broadly to include such arrangements in addition to any subsystems configured to perform a storage function and associated with other equipment or systems. It should be noted that while this description is written in terms of a write anywhere file system the teachings of the present invention may be utilized with any suitable file system including a write in place file system.

In the illustrative embodiment the storage server is embodied as data module of the storage operating system to service one or more volumes of array . In addition the multi protocol engine is embodied as network module to i perform protocol termination with respect to a client issuing incoming data access request packets over the network as well as ii redirect those data access requests to any storage server of the cluster . Moreover the network module and data module cooperate is to provide a highly scalable distributed storage system architecture of the cluster . To that end each module includes a cluster fabric CF interface module adapted to implement intra cluster communication among the modules.

The protocol layers e.g. the NFS CIFS layers and or the iSCSI FC layers of the network module function as protocol servers that translate file based and or block based data access requests from clients into CF protocol messages used for communication with the data module . That is the network module servers convert the incoming data access requests into file system primitive operations commands that are embedded within CF messages by the CF interface module for transmission to the data module of the cluster . Notably the CF interface modules cooperate to provide a single file system image across all data modules in the cluster . Thus any network port of an network module that receives a client request can access any data container within the single file system image located on any data module of the cluster.

Further to the illustrative embodiment the network module and data module are implemented as separately scheduled processes of storage operating system however in an alternate embodiment the modules may be implemented as pieces of code within a single operating system process. Communication between an network module and data module is thus illustratively effected through the use of message passing between the modules although in the case of remote communication between an network module and data module of different nodes such message passing occurs over the cluster switching fabric . A known message passing mechanism provided by the storage operating system to transfer information between modules processes is the Inter Process Communication IPC mechanism. The protocol used with the IPC mechanism is illustratively a generic file and or block based agnostic CF protocol that comprises a collection of methods functions constituting a CF application programming interface API . Examples of such an agnostic protocol are the SpinFS and SpinNP protocols available from NetApp Inc. The SpinFS protocol is described in the above referenced U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 2002 0116593 now U.S. Pat. No. 6 671 773 on Dec. 30 2003. However in an illustrative embodiment of the present invention the CF protocol comprises the shared write address protocol SWAP described further below that operates over a RDMA compatible transport layer.

The CF interface module implements the CF protocol for communicating file system commands among the modules of cluster . Communication is illustratively effected by the data module exposing the CF API to which an network module or another data module issues calls. To that end the CF interface module is organized as a CF encoder and CF decoder. The CF encoder of e.g. CF interface on network module encapsulates a CF message as i a local procedure call LPC when communicating a file system command to a data module residing on the same node or ii a remote procedure call RPC when communicating the command to a data module residing on a remote node of the cluster . In either case the CF decoder of CF interface on data module de encapsulates the CF message and processes the file system command.

Illustratively included within the CF interface module is a shared write address protocol SWAP module that implements the novel protocol of the present invention. It should be noted that in alternative embodiments of the present invention the functionality of the shared write address protocol may be integrated directly into the CF module or may be integrated into other modules of the storage operating system . As such the description of the SWAP module residing within the CF interface module should be taken as exemplary only. In alternative embodiments the novel shared write address protocol may be implemented in non CF environments. That is the SWAP module may be utilized on any computer system desirous to utilize an RDMA connection with another system. For example a SWAP module could be integrated into the multi protocol engine alongside VI etc. Such an exemplary embodiment would allow client server environments to utilize the SWAP protocol.

Also illustratively located in the CF interface is a flow control data structure hereinafter block . The flow control block illustratively includes a completed field and a transaction ID XID acknowledgement field . The completed field is used to track the number of received operations that have been processed and reposted to the module s receive work queue not shown . The XID acknowledgment field stores the XID of the last response that has been processed by the module. This field may be utilized to determine that all write buffers used by a request identified in the XID acknowledgement field and all previous requests are no longer being utilized and are therefore available for the storage of the new data. That is by determining which XIDs have been completed the module may determine which portions of the message pool are available for reuse.

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the present invention maintenance of each flow control block is managed by the particular module on which is stored. Each module may utilize a RDMA READ operation to retrieve the contents of the flow control block and therefore identify the current status i.e. those XIDs which have been processed by its partner module. Similarly by identifying the last XID processed a module may then determine which regions of the message pool are free for reuse by new data.

In an illustrative embodiment of the present invention a data container is represented in the write anywhere file system as an inode data structure adapted for storage on the disks . is a schematic block diagram of an inode which preferably includes a metadata section and a data section . The information stored in the metadata section of each inode describes the data container e.g. a file and as such includes the type e.g. regular directory vdisk of file its size time stamps e.g. access and or modification time and ownership i.e. user identifier UID and group ID GID of the file. The contents of the data section of each inode may be interpreted differently depending upon the type of file inode defined within the type field . For example the data section of a directory inode contains metadata controlled by the file system whereas the data section of a regular inode contains file system data. In this latter case the data section includes a representation of the data associated with the file.

Specifically the data section of a regular on disk inode may include file system data or pointers the latter referencing 4 KB data blocks on disk used to store the file system data. Each pointer is preferably a logical vbn to facilitate efficiency among the file system and the RAID system when accessing the data on disks. Given the restricted size e.g. 128 bytes of the inode file system data having a size that is less than or equal to 64 bytes is represented in its entirety within the data section of that inode. However if the length of the contents of the data container exceeds 64 bytes but less than or equal to 64 KB then the data section of the inode e.g. a first level inode comprises up to 16 pointers each of which references a 4 KB block of data on the disk.

Moreover if the size of the data is greater than 64 KB but less than or equal to 64 megabytes MB then each pointer in the data section of the inode e.g. a second level inode references an indirect block e.g. a first level L1 block that contains 1024 pointers each of which references a 4 KB data block on disk. For file system data having a size greater than 64 MB each pointer in the data section of the inode e.g. a third level L3 inode references a double indirect block e.g. a second level L2 block that contains 1024 pointers each referencing an indirect e.g. a first level L1 block. The indirect block in turn that contains 1024 pointers each of which references a 4 KB data block on disk. When accessing a file each block of the file may be loaded from disk into the memory .

When an on disk inode or block is loaded from disk into memory its corresponding in core structure embeds the on disk structure. For example the dotted line surrounding the inode indicates the in core representation of the on disk inode structure. The in core structure is a block of memory that stores the on disk structure plus additional information needed to manage data in the memory but not on disk . The additional information may include e.g. a dirty bit . After data in the inode or block is updated modified as instructed by e.g. a write operation the modified data is marked dirty using the dirty bit so that the inode block can be subsequently flushed stored to disk. The in core and on disk format structures of the WAFL file system including the inodes and inode file are disclosed and described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 818 292 titled METHOD FOR MAINTAINING CONSISTENT STATES OF A FILE SYSTEM AND FOR CREATING USER ACCESSIBLE READ ONLY COPIES OF A FILE SYSTEM by David Hitz et al. issued on Oct. 6 1998.

A file system layout is provided that apportions an underlying physical volume into one or more virtual volumes or flexible volume of a storage system such as node . An example of such a file system layout is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 836 817 titled EXTENSION OF WRITE ANYWHERE FILE SYSTEM LAYOUT by John K. Edwards et al. now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 7 409 494 on Aug. 5 2008. The underlying physical volume is an aggregate comprising one or more groups of disks such as RAID groups of the node. The aggregate has its own physical volume block number pvbn space and maintains metadata such as block allocation structures within that pvbn space. Each flexible volume has its own virtual volume block number vvbn space and maintains metadata such as block allocation structures within that vvbn space. Each flexible volume is a file system that is associated with a container file the container file is a file in the aggregate that contains all blocks used by the flexible volume. Moreover each flexible volume comprises data blocks and indirect blocks that contain block pointers that point at either other indirect blocks or data blocks.

In one embodiment pvbns are used as block pointers within buffer trees of files such as file stored in a flexible volume. This hybrid flexible volume embodiment involves the insertion of only the pvbn in the parent indirect block e.g. Mode or indirect block . On a read path of a logical volume a logical volume vol info block has one or more pointers that reference one or more fsinfo blocks each of which in turn points to an Mode file and its corresponding Mode buffer tree. The read path on a flexible volume is generally the same following pvbns instead of vvbns to find appropriate locations of blocks in this context the read path and corresponding read performance of a flexible volume is substantially similar to that of a physical volume. Translation from pvbn to disk dbn occurs at the file system RAID system boundary of the storage operating system .

In an illustrative dual vbn hybrid embodiment both a pvbn and its corresponding vvbn are inserted in the parent indirect blocks in the buffer tree of a file. That is the pvbn and vvbn are stored as a pair for each block pointer in most buffer tree structures that have pointers to other blocks e.g. level 1 L1 indirect blocks Mode file level 0 L0 blocks. is a schematic block diagram of an illustrative embodiment of a buffer tree of a file that may be advantageously used with the present invention. A root top level Mode such as an embedded Mode references indirect e.g. level 1 blocks . Note that there may be additional levels of indirect blocks e.g. level 2 level 3 depending upon the size of the file. The indirect blocks and Mode contain pvbn vvbn pointer pair structures that ultimately reference data blocks used to store the actual data of the file.

The pvbns reference locations on disks of the aggregate whereas the vvbns reference locations within files of the flexible volume. The use of pvbns as block pointers in the indirect blocks provides efficiencies in the read paths while the use of vvbn block pointers provides efficient access to required metadata. That is when freeing a block of a file the parent indirect block in the file contains readily available vvbn block pointers which avoids the latency associated with accessing an owner map to perform pvbn to vvbn translations yet on the read path the pvbn is available.

Whereas the aggregate is analogous to a physical volume of a conventional storage system a flexible volume is analogous to a file within that physical volume. That is the aggregate may include one or more files wherein each file contains a flexible volume and wherein the sum of the storage space consumed by the flexible volumes is physically smaller than or equal to the size of the overall physical volume. The aggregate utilizes a physical pvbn space that defines a storage space of blocks provided by the disks of the physical volume while each embedded flexible volume within a file utilizes a logical vvbn space to organize those blocks e.g. as files. Each vvbn space is an independent set of numbers that corresponds to locations within the file which locations are then translated to dbns on disks. Since the flexible volume is also a logical volume it has its own block allocation structures e.g. active space and summary maps in its vvbn space.

A container file is a file in the aggregate that contains all blocks used by a flexible volume. The container file is an internal to the aggregate feature that supports a flexible volume illustratively there is one container file per flexible volume. Similar to a pure logical volume in a file approach the container file is a hidden file not accessible to a user in the aggregate that holds every block in use by the flexible volume. The aggregate includes an illustrative hidden metadata root directory that contains subdirectories of flexible volumes 

Specifically a physical file system WAFL directory includes a subdirectory for each flexible volume in the aggregate with the name of subdirectory being a file system identifier fsid of the flexible volume. Each fsid subdirectory flexible volume contains at least two files a filesystem file and a storage label file. The storage label file is illustratively a 4 KB file that contains metadata similar to that stored in a conventional raid label. In other words the storage label file is the analog of a raid label and as such contains information about the state of the flexible volume such as e.g. the name of the flexible volume a universal unique identifier uuid and fsid of the flexible volume whether it is online being created or being destroyed etc.

In addition to being embodied as a container file having level 1 blocks organized as a container map the filesystem file includes block pointers that reference various file systems embodied as flexible volumes . The aggregate maintains these flexible volumes at special reserved inode numbers. Each flexible volume also has special reserved inode numbers within its flexible volume space that are used for among other things the block allocation bitmap structures. As noted the block allocation bitmap structures e.g. active map summary map and space map are located in each flexible volume.

Specifically each flexible volume has the same inode file structure content as the aggregate with the exception that there is no owner map and no WAFL fsid filesystem file storage label file directory structure in a hidden metadata root directory . To that end each flexible volume has a volinfo block that points to one or more fsinfo blocks each of which may represent a snapshot along with the active file system of the flexible volume. Each fsinfo block in turn points to an inode file that as noted has the same inode structure content as the aggregate with the exceptions noted above. Each flexible volume has its own inode file and distinct inode space with corresponding inode numbers as well as its own root fsid directory and subdirectories of files that can be exported separately from other flexible volumes.

The storage label file contained within the hidden metadata root directory of the aggregate is a small file that functions as an analog to a conventional raid label. A raid label includes physical information about the storage system such as the volume name that information is loaded into the storage label file . Illustratively the storage label file includes the name of the associated flexible volume the online offline status of the flexible volume and other identity and state information of the associated flexible volume whether it is in the process of being created or destroyed .

The VLDB is a database process that tracks the locations of various storage components e.g. SVSs flexible volumes aggregates etc. within the cluster to thereby facilitate routing of requests throughout the cluster. In the illustrative embodiment the network module of each node accesses a configuration table that maps certain contents of a data container handle to a data module that owns services the data container within the cluster. The VLDB includes a plurality of entries which in turn provide the contents of entries in the configuration table among other things these VLDB entries keep track of the locations of the flexible volumes hereinafter generally volumes and aggregates within the cluster. Examples of such VLDB entries include a VLDB volume entry and a VLDB aggregate entry .

The VLDB illustratively implements a RPC interface e.g. a Sun RPC interface which allows the network module to query the VLDB . When encountering contents of a data container handle that are not stored in its configuration table the network module sends an RPC to the VLDB process. In response the VLDB returns to the network module the appropriate mapping information including an ID of the data module that owns the data container. The network module caches the information in its configuration table and uses is the data module ID to forward the incoming request to the appropriate data container. All functions and interactions between the network module and data module are coordinated on a cluster wide basis through the collection of management processes and the RDB library user mode applications .

To that end the management processes have interfaces to are closely coupled to RDB . The RDB comprises a library that provides a persistent object store storing of objects for the management data processed by the management processes. Notably the RDB replicates and synchronizes the management data object store access across all nodes of the cluster to thereby ensure that the RDB database image is identical on all of the nodes . At system startup each node records the status state of its interfaces and IP addresses those IP addresses it owns into the RDB database.

The present invention provides a system and method for a shared write address protocol SWAP that is implemented over a remote direct memory address RDMA connection. After the connection is established between two partner modules e.g. a network element network module or disk element data module within a cluster utilizing a conventional RDMA transport protocol each of the modules transmits a novel HELLO message to its partner. The HELLO message is utilized by each module to convey appropriate flow control information using a flow control data structure that is accessible to its partner via a RDMA READ operation. The novel protocol operates so that each module has one outstanding RDMA READ operation at a time i.e. to obtain the current flow control information from its partner.

When a module receives data to be transmitted to its partner module over the RDMA connection a determination is made whether the received data is less than or equal to a defined buffer size. The buffer size is illustratively defined in the initial HELLO messages exchanged between modules. If the data to be transmitted is less than or equal to the buffer size an INLINE message data structure of the SWAP protocol is utilized to send the data to the partner. However if the data is greater than the buffer size a second determination is made as to whether sufficient space exists in a message pool for the data. If insufficient space exists the transmitting module waits until sufficient space exists before utilizing a novel WRITE operation of the SWAP protocol to transmit the data. By utilizing the principles of the present invention the use of RDMA READ requests is limited to a single outstanding RDMA READ request to obtain flow control information from the module s partner thereby obviating the need for having a plurality of outstanding RDMA READ operations for a single connection at a single time.

In accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the present invention the shared write address protocol comprises a plurality of data structures e.g. header message descriptor having various formats for conveying information to thereby improve throughput over RDMA connections while limiting the number of RDMA READ operations required by the protocol. Illustratively a single RDMA READ operation is utilized to periodically obtain a copy of the partner s flow control block. In an illustrative embodiment the RDMA READ operation may be schedule when the local node s free resource count falls below a predefined threshold. In alternative embodiments the RDMA READ operation may be issued when the local node has exhausted all of the resources it has available. In further alternative embodiments additional and or differing scheduling techniques may be utilized to determine when to initiate the RDMA READ operations. It should be understood that the various protocol formats described herein should be taken as exemplary only. As can be appreciated by one skilled in the art various modifications additions and or subtractions of the various fields etc. to the protocol data structures may be accomplished without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. As such the below defined protocol data structures are to be taken as exemplary only.

A determination is made in step whether the size of the data to be transmitted is less than or equal to the previously set INLINE buffer size. As noted above the INLINE message size is established during initialization of a SWAP connection. If the size of the data is less than or equal to the INLINE buffer size the procedure branches to step where an INLINE operation is utilized to transmit the data. The procedure then completes in step . When an INLINE operation is utilized the data to be transmitted to the partner is stored within the INLINE data structure itself thereby avoiding the need to allocate WRITE data structures etc.

However if in step it is determined that the size of data to be transmitted is greater than the INLINE buffer size the procedure branches to step where a determination is made whether sufficient space exists in the message pool. By sufficient space it is meant generally that the message pool has free space to store the data to be transmitted.

If insufficient space exists the procedure branches the step and waits until sufficient space in the message pool exists. A determination of whether sufficient free space exists may be made by e.g. issuing a READ operation to the flow control block of the partner. By examining the flow control block the module may determine the last XID that was processed. All space within the message pool associated with the last XID or any earlier XIDs may be freed and reused. A WRITE operation is then utilized to transmit the data in step . The procedure then completes in step .

Upon processing received operations a particular SWAP module is configured to update the appropriate fields within the flow control block to enable its partner to identify those buffers and other resources that may be re utilized for further transactions.
