This application is a continuation of co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 222 860 entitled GENERATING CONTENT FOR TOPICS BASED ON USER DEMAND filed Aug. 31 2011 which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.

Search engines e.g. web based search engines provided by various vendors including for example Google Microsoft s Bing and Yahoo provide for searches of online information that includes searchable content e.g. digitally stored electronic data such as searchable content available via the World Wide Web WWW . As input a search engine typically receives a search query e.g. query input including one or more terms such as keywords by a user of the search engine . The search engine performs the search for the search query and outputs results that are typically presented in a ranked list often referred to as search results or hits e.g. links or Uniform Resource Locators URLs for one or more web pages and or web sites . The search results can include web pages images audio video database results directory results information and other types of data.

Search engines typically provide paid search results e.g. the first three results in the main listing and or results often presented in a separate listing on the right side of the output screen . For example advertisers may pay for placement in such paid search results based on keywords e.g. keywords in search queries . Search engines also typically provide organic search results also referred to as natural search results. Organic search results are based on various algorithms employed by different search engines that attempt to provide relevant search results based on a received search query.

For improved Internet marketing search engine optimization SEO has developed as a form of industry technical consulting often referred to as search engine optimizers provided to web site operators e.g. vendors of products services with web sites and or e commerce vendors of products services for improving the volume or quality of traffic to a web site from a search engine via organic search results e.g. to improve the web site s web presence as a paid service engagement or pursuant to a marketing campaign . Generally the higher a web site appears in the organic search results list the more users it will receive from the search engine. SEO can target different kinds of search including image search local search and industry specific vertical search engines to improve the web site s web presence. For example SEO often considers how search engines work and what people search for to recommend web site related changes to optimize a web site e.g. which primarily involves editing its content and HyperText Markup Language HTML coding to both increase its relevance to specific keywords and to remove barriers to the indexing activities of search engines .

The invention can be implemented in numerous ways including as a process an apparatus a system a composition of matter a computer program product embodied on a computer readable storage medium and or a processor such as a processor configured to execute instructions stored on and or provided by a memory coupled to the processor. In this specification these implementations or any other form that the invention may take may be referred to as techniques. In general the order of the steps of disclosed processes may be altered within the scope of the invention. Unless stated otherwise a component such as a processor or a memory described as being configured to perform a task may be implemented as a general component that is temporarily configured to perform the task at a given time or a specific component that is manufactured to perform the task. As used herein the term processor refers to one or more devices circuits and or processing cores configured to process data such as computer program instructions.

A detailed description of one or more embodiments of the invention is provided below along with accompanying figures that illustrate the principles of the invention. The invention is described in connection with such embodiments but the invention is not limited to any embodiment. The scope of the invention is limited only by the claims and the invention encompasses numerous alternatives modifications and equivalents. Numerous specific details are set forth in the following description in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. These details are provided for the purpose of example and the invention may be practiced according to the claims without some or all of these specific details. For the purpose of clarity technical material that is known in the technical fields related to the invention has not been described in detail so that the invention is not unnecessarily obscured.

A web site typically includes of a set of interconnected web pages. A web page generally includes content of any of a variety of different types. The content of a web page can include content that is searchable for example by a search engine. The content of a web page can also include one or more hyperlinks that provide navigation to other web pages and or resources. The structure of a web site is generally defined by the hierarchical organization of web pages including the web site as well as the links existing between pages of the web site. It may be desirable to enhance the content and or structure of a web site for example to improve the discoverability of the web site e.g. for user query navigation and or search engine crawling and web page rankings for various queries and to provide web pages with more relevant information.

Numerous factors can affect the discoverability of a web site and its associated web pages. In some cases key content associated with a page may not be searchable. At least some of the content of a page may be dynamically generated and provided with a page e.g. via a JavaScript widget in response to a user request for the page. For example some of the dynamic content of a page can be generated client side e.g. by a web browser executed on a client device that is a user s device . Although dynamic content may be relevant to searches it is typically not crawlable by search engines. Server side static content associated with a page may be searchable but many issues may also arise with respect to the searchable content of a page. For example the discoverability of the content of a page may be affected by language usage especially if important content of the page fails to encompass variations that may instead be used to search for or otherwise locate the content. For example the content of a page may not include all or at least a relevant subset of synonyms of important keywords terms or phrases e.g. table vs. desk colloquial variations e.g. cell phone vs. mobile phone spelling variations e.g. Hanukkah vs. Chanukah geographical variations e.g. Silicon Valley vs. Bay Area categorical variations e.g. a clothing merchandise web site that does not categorize men s dress shirts by pattern such as plaid or pin striped and or various other categorical ontological localization language or grammatical structural e.g. pages may be too deep or dynamically generated and thus not discoverable by users and or search engines and or other variations that render the web site content structure or organization to not be optimized for certain user queries. Moreover content may not be presented in a manner that is conducive to searches and or user navigation. Furthermore a fragmented distribution or organization of content across the pages comprising a web site may result in the web site content not satisfying common search terms or queries. For example a restaurant web site that indicates on a home or main page that the restaurant serves Japanese food and a San Francisco address but that has on another page a menu that includes sushi may not be provided or at least highly ranked as a search result in response to a user query for sushi San Francisco. The discoverability of a page may also be affected by the manner in which the page is linked to other pages. For example a page may not be easily accessible by a search engine or a user if it is too deeply buried or nested within the page hierarchy of a web site.

Various techniques for adding dynamic content e.g. via JavaScript to a web page exist. However such content of a web page is generally not crawlable or searchable and thus generally cannot be used by search engines to retrieve and or rank the web page.

Web site owners typically rely on Search Engine Optimization SEO consultants to optimize their web sites and or associated web pages to make them more amenable for search engine retrieval and or ranking. However such SEO consultants generally provide web site content structural change recommendations that require that the SEO consultants or the web site operator manually modify the content and or structures of web sites so that the web sites and or associated web pages can be better located by users and search engines. Such manual changes are static changes based on analysis of the web site at a particular period of time and thus such manual changes cannot account for changing user demand for content on the web site.

What is needed is content generation for topics based on user demand. Accordingly techniques for generating content for topics e.g. themes and or sub themes based on user demand are disclosed. For example the techniques described herein can significantly enhance the content and or discoverability of existing content of a web site e.g. for an entity or for a brand and its associated pages as well as make the web site and its associated pages more amenable to various third party services e.g. search engines by providing richer content on pages and or improved navigation to pages. Although some of the given examples are described with respect to web pages of a web site the techniques disclosed herein can be employed with respect to any other organization of a corpus of content whose content is desired to be improved to facilitate enhanced content for topics based on user demand e.g. web content and or other forms of content such as e mails content for mobile devices such as for web pages for mobile devices or for applications for mobile devices and or content customized based on location awareness . For example a corpus of content can include a web site a user s social networking web page content customized for mobile devices content customized based on location awareness an electronic mail message and or any other collection of digitally stored content.

In some embodiments content for topics such as for themes or related themes or sub themes e.g. thematic pages facilitate a web site capturing traffic for new category like torso and tail query traffic e.g. which are queries that can be dynamically changing over time through the generation and delivery of optimized e.g. high user value and search engine friendly landing pages that enhances for example a web site content and or structure to enable discovery of the web site s relevant content that corresponds to such category like torso and tail query traffic.

For example a merchandise web site for clothing merchandise can be enhanced include various new thematic pages that include optimized content for a user s request to view merchandise corresponding to a query for a blue pin striped men s dress shirt e.g. even if the merchandise web site does not otherwise categorize its dress shirt merchandise by patterns using various techniques described herein. As another example a furniture web site can be enhanced to include thematic pages for leather chair as a theme and also include refinements or sub themes for leather theatre seat leather club chair leather ottoman and or various other sub themes or refinements using various techniques described herein. As yet another example a travel web site that does not include a static page for flights from San Francisco to New York City can be enhanced to include a thematic page for flights from San Francisco to New York City and or various other travel patterns or sub themes related to such travel patterns e.g. hotels in New York City or car rentals in New York City using various techniques described herein.

Thus using various techniques described herein can provide for enhanced capture of natural language queries from users e.g. queries of users at search engines and or search queries from users while users are navigating within the web site such as using the search option of the web site . Using various techniques described herein can also provide for enhanced web site content to allow for bidding for keywords for landing pages. Using various techniques described herein can also improve a web site s structure and expand the web site s content and structure which can thereby improve organic search results for the web pages of the web site.

In some embodiments thematic pages e.g. landing pages for a given theme or topic or sub topic or refinement are generated dynamically based on user demand e.g. observed user demand over time and or in anticipation of user demand . For example content that reflect a user s behavior e.g. based on the user s behavior on or off the web site and that is based on the web site s content can be created e.g. as needed depending on the existing content of the web site and based on a dynamic monitoring of user activities such as user queries user navigation within the web site user s interest in particular content of the web site user s search query activities on other web sites such as search engines user s activities on social networks and or other monitored user activities .

In some embodiments thematic pages optimize torso queries and or tail queries by for example automatically generating optimized or enhanced content for the web site to attract queries for which the web site does not have adequate landing pages. In some embodiments the topic or theme is a category like torso query that has high search volume potential but for which the web site does not have a relevant existing web page. For example products and other content presented on the thematic page can be highly related and relevant to the main theme. In some embodiments the sub topic or sub theme is a tail query that has high search volume potential but for which the web site does not have a relevant existing web page.

In some embodiments thematic page content includes the following a heading or theme one or more sub themes e.g. each sub theme can be a targeted query and include for example a list of products or services widgets showing more products or services and related themes or related searches. In addition to the above product content can also include a list of related queries and product service description title and image.

In some embodiments generating content for topics based on user demand includes determining a topic based on a user demand automatically generating content for the topic and selecting the content that is contextually relevant for display within a corpus of content. In some embodiments the content is optimized for the topic. In some embodiments the corpus of content includes web content e.g. a web site social content e.g. a user s social networking web page content optimized for mobile devices e.g. content customized for mobile devices content optimized for location e.g. content customized based on location awareness or an electronic mail message e.g. e mail .

In some embodiments the content is displayed in a module of a corpus of content that includes a plurality of modules in which each module includes dynamically generated contextually relevant content. Example modules can include a Related Searches module a Most Popular Products module a Recent Viewed Products module a Your Friends Have Seen module a Refinements Related Products module and or various other modules. In some embodiments a web site page can be structurally organized to include one or more modules in which each module includes dynamically generated contextually relevant content using various techniques as described herein. In some embodiments a module can be provided for content that is delivered using mechanisms external or independent of the web site such as using e mail sent to one or more users or using mobile apps executed on user mobile devices e.g. smart phones tablets laptops and or other mobile computing devices .

In some embodiments selecting the content that is contextually relevant for display with a corpus of content further includes determining the content based on a source of the user e.g. a point of origin of the user such as whether the user is performing a web search using a social network using electronic mail using a mobile application app and or any other point of origin of the user .

In some embodiments selecting the content that is contextually relevant for display with a corpus of content further includes determining the content based on a temporal element e.g. day part week part holiday and seasonality . In some embodiments selecting the content that is contextually relevant for display with a corpus of content further includes personalizing the content based on user related data. For example user related data can include user search history user purchase history user device preference user presentation preferences content generated using pixel log related data user reviews social networking related data e.g. your friends looked at this visited information and or any other user related data.

In some embodiments selecting the content that is contextually relevant for display with a corpus of content further includes determining a placement of the content for integration with a structure or organization of the corpus of content. For example the contextually relevant content can be integrated into various existing structures of the corpus of content e.g. using various different modules and possibly various different link structures for a web site and or integrating into off site content such as e mail mobile app and or social content. In some embodiments the corpus of content includes a web site in which the content includes web page content that is configured or organized differently than on other web pages of the web site. In some embodiments the corpus of content includes a web site and the content includes contextually relevant data that does not exist on other web pages of the web site. In some embodiments for a given topic e.g. theme or sub theme a multitude of modules of contextually relevant content can be generated based on the topic. In some embodiments a selection of modules is automatically configured based on contextual relevancy e.g. based on a source of a user user behavior on the web site and or off the web site and or where the user is accessing or viewing the module s such as web browsing e mail social network mobile device and so forth .

In some embodiments the content is selected for display in a plurality of modules e.g. Related Searches module a Most Popular Products module a Recent Viewed Products module a Your Friends Have Seen module a Refinements Related Products module and or various other modules and generating content for topics based on user demand further includes displaying performance metrics associated with each of the plurality of modules in which each of the plurality of modules can be configured or automatically removed based on the performance metrics. In some embodiments each of the plurality of modules is automatically modified based on the performance metrics. For example configuration settings can be selected to automatically decrease or stop using a module or set of modules based on certain performance metric results such as based on threshold settings or performance over a period of time criteria and or any other settings or criteria. In some embodiments a charge is determined for using each of the plurality of modules based on the performance metrics associated with each of the plurality of modules.

In some embodiments generating content for topics based on user demand further includes analyzing a set of search queries to determine the topic based on the user demand in which the set of search queries include a log of search queries for the web site. In some embodiments generating content for topics based on user demand further includes analyzing an external data source to determine the topic based on the user demand in which the external data source includes social networking resources associated with the web site and includes social networking resources that include content that is similar to content included on the web site. For example twitter stream or other social data for popular shoes can be analyzed to determine thematic page content for a shoe manufacturer. As another example twitter stream data or other social data e.g. Facebook pages or Google pages for a famous cyclist or for a famous cycling event can be analyzed to determine thematic page content for a cycling manufacturer. As yet another example twitter stream data or other social data e.g. Facebook pages or Google pages that include content related to a brand or an entity e.g. which may or may not be owned managed or otherwise associated with controlled by the brand or the entity can be analyzed to determine thematic page content for the brand or the entity.

In some embodiments generating content for topics based on user demand further includes analyzing user behavior to determine topics based on user demand in which the analyzed user behavior includes user search behavior performed on other web sites e.g. user queries on search engines .

In some embodiments the corpus of content includes a web site in which a landing page of the web site includes the content and generating content for topics based on user demand further includes generating a plurality of configuration of modules for the topic for the web site in which each of the plurality of configuration of modules is optimized for a referring source of user and a display device type e.g. and or other variables such as location day part and seasonality operating system OS type an so forth . For example a thematic page for a topic such as cycling shoes for men or any other topic based on user demand can be different based on the user source such as whether the user is coming from the Google web site e mail or the Facebook web site.

In some embodiments the corpus of content includes a web site in which a landing page of the web site includes the content and generating content for topics based on user demand further includes adding a link on the web site for the topic in which the link is associated with the landing page and in which the link is crawlable by a web crawler.

In some embodiments generating content for topics based on user demand further includes automatically anticipate the user demand e.g. using various techniques described herein such as based on current events dates special dates associated with a user such as birthdays or anniversaries seasons and or holidays a scheduled or anticipated event such as a major sporting event or major entertainment event and or various other criteria parameters and or techniques .

In some embodiments generating content for topics based on user demand includes determining a topic based on a user demand and automatically generating a landing page for the topic for a web site. In some embodiments generating content for topics based on user demand further includes determining that the web site does not include existing web page content for the topic and automatically generating the landing page for the topic for the web site using new externally generated web page content. In some embodiments the landing page includes web page content that is optimized for the topic. In some embodiments the landing page includes web page content that exists on other web pages of the web site. In some embodiments the landing page includes web page content that does not exist on other web pages of the web site.

In some embodiments generating content for topics based on user demand further includes analyzing a set of search queries to determine the topic based on the user demand in which the set of search queries include a log of search queries for the web site. In some embodiments generating content for topics based on user demand further includes analyzing an external data source to determine the topic based on the user demand in which the external data source includes social networking resources associated with the web site e.g. a Facebook account or Twitter account associated with the web site .

In some embodiments generating content for topics based on user demand further includes generating a plurality of versions of the landing page for the topic for the web site in which each of the versions of the landing page is optimized for a display device type or operating system type e.g. a version for each of the following a PC browser a tablet such as an Apple iPad and a mobile phone such as an Apple iPhone mobile phone or a Google Android based mobile phone .

In some embodiments generating content for topics based on user demand further includes adding a link on the web site for the topic in which the link is associated with the landing page and in which a web crawler can crawl the link.

In some embodiments generating content for topics based on user demand includes receiving a user request for a topic at a web server for a web site in which the topic is indicated as a linked topic on a web page of the web site determining the topic based on the request sending a server request for a web page for the topic to a third party server receiving the web page for the topic from the third party server generating the web page for the topic in which a source of the web page for the topic is transparent to a web crawler. In some embodiments the server request is communicated using an application programming interface API . In some embodiments generating content for topics based on user demand further includes sending the web page for the topic to the requesting user browser. In some embodiments generating content for topics based on user demand further includes caching the web page for the topic for a period of time or until an event occurrence.

Processor is coupled bi directionally with memory which can include a first primary storage typically a random access memory RAM and a second primary storage area typically a read only memory ROM . As is well known in the art primary storage can be used as a general storage area and as scratch pad memory and can also be used to store input data and processed data. Primary storage can also store programming instructions and data in the form of data objects and text objects in addition to other data and instructions for processes operating on processor . Also as well known in the art primary storage typically includes basic operating instructions program code data and objects used by the processor to perform its functions e.g. programmed instructions . For example primary storage devices can include any suitable computer readable storage media described below depending on whether for example data access needs to be bi directional or uni directional. For example processor can also directly and very rapidly retrieve and store frequently needed data in a cache memory not shown .

A removable mass storage device provides additional data storage capacity for the computer system and is coupled either bi directionally read write or uni directionally read only to processor . For example storage can also include computer readable media such as magnetic tape flash memory PC CARDS portable mass storage devices holographic storage devices and other storage devices. A fixed mass storage can also for example provide additional data storage capacity. The most common example of mass storage is a hard disk drive. Mass storage generally store additional programming instructions data and the like that typically are not in active use by the processor . It will be appreciated that the information retained within mass storage can be incorporated if needed in standard fashion as part of primary storage e.g. RAM as virtual memory.

In addition to providing processor access to storage subsystems bus can be used to provide access other subsystems and devices as well. As shown these can include a display monitor a network interface a keyboard and a pointing device as well as an auxiliary input output device interface a sound card speakers and other subsystems as needed. For example the pointing device can be a mouse stylus track ball or tablet and is useful for interacting with a graphical user interface.

The network interface allows processor to be coupled to another computer computer network or telecommunications network using a network connection as shown. For example through the network interface the processor can receive information e.g. data objects or program instructions from another network or output information to another network in the course of performing method process steps. Information often represented as a sequence of instructions to be executed on a processor can be received from and outputted to another network. An interface card or similar device and appropriate software implemented by e.g. executed performed on processor can be used to connect the computer system to an external network and transfer data according to standard protocols. For example various process embodiments disclosed herein can be executed on processor or can be performed across a network such as the Internet intranet networks or local area networks in conjunction with a remote processor that shares a portion of the processing. Additional mass storage devices not shown can also be connected to processor through network interface .

An auxiliary I O device interface not shown can be used in conjunction with computer system . The auxiliary I O device interface can include general and customized interfaces that allow the processor to send and more typically receive data from other devices such as microphones touch sensitive displays transducer card readers tape readers voice or handwriting recognizers biometrics readers cameras portable mass storage devices and other computers.

In addition various embodiments disclosed herein further relate to computer storage products with a computer readable medium that includes program code for performing various computer implemented operations. The computer readable medium is any data storage device that can store data which can thereafter be read by a computer system. Examples of computer readable media include but are not limited to all the media mentioned above magnetic media such as hard disks floppy disks and magnetic tape optical media such as CD ROM disks magneto optical media such as optical disks and specially configured hardware devices such as application specific integrated circuits ASICs programmable logic devices PLDs and ROM and RAM devices. Examples of program code include both machine code as produced for example by a compiler or files containing higher level code e.g. script that can be executed using an interpreter.

The computer system shown in is but an example of a computer system suitable for use with the various embodiments disclosed herein. Other computer systems suitable for such use can include additional or fewer subsystems. In addition bus is illustrative of any interconnection scheme serving to link the subsystems. Other computer architectures having different configurations of subsystems can also be utilized e.g. server devices appliances with hardware configures for specific functions such as a web server or an application server and or various other types of computing devices that can execute various operating systems and or virtual machine software techniques .

In some embodiments web pages based on product and attribute information are be generated using various techniques as described herein. For example for each product on a web site product names can be analyzed to extract various attributes e.g. colors size units and or other attributes and product names. In some embodiments extracting such attributes is determined by issuing various queries against a product index for the web site two products are deemed similar if they match a threshold number of queries for each pair of similar products common strings are extracted among the extracted strings known attributes such as colors units size and or other attributes are extracted in the remaining string the longest matching string at the highest position is determined to be the product name and everything else is indicated as attributes. For each product attribute pair the number of matching products is computed. If the number of matching products exceeds a specified threshold value a page is created for this product attribute pair. For example for a running gear web site for the products All weather Men s Running Shoes and Comfortable Nike Men s Running Shoes various attributes can be extracted such as Canvas Comfortable All weather Nike can be extracted as attributes and Men s Running Shoes can be determined to be the product. In this example web pages based on product and attribute information such as the following can be generated Comfortable Men s Running Shoes and Canvas Men s Running shoes. 

In some embodiments ontology based pages are generated using various techniques as described herein. In some embodiments the navigational content of a web site e.g. menus breadcrumbs refinements etc are scraped. For each of these scraped elements the number of matching products is computed. If the number of matching products is large enough e.g. exceeds a threshold value a page is generated for this element. For example if a given web site has a category page for Dishwashers and the refinements on the page are Color and Brand then generated new pages can include as examples the following Gray Dishwashers and Kenmore Dishwashers. 

In some embodiments structured content based pages are generated using various techniques as described herein. As an example a web site s content is structured into units. Each unit can either be a single piece of information a class of information or a collection of information. Units can then be analyzed to compute as to how relevant they are to other units. This process can be manual or can be automated. If the above frequencies are high the units can be paired together. Blocks of such units can now form a page after incorporating some other meta information. For example a web site can have units of information such as Flights from LA to NY Hotels near Chicago airport Bus from LA to SFO Car Rentals near SFO airport etc. After analyzing the web site Flights from X to Y can be determined to be relevant to Car rental near Y and Hotels near Y airport but determined to not be relevant to Hotels near X airport or Bus from X to Y . As a result a page can be generated about Flights from X to Y with the determined relevant information.

At content for the topic is automatically generated. At the content that is contextually relevant for display within a corpus of content is selected. In some embodiments a potential query is discarded because the web site is determined to not have sufficient content to generate a new landing page for the query e.g. in some cases if a query meets a certain threshold but the web site lacks sufficient content to generate a landing page for the query then a notification can be sent to the web site owner and or a log can be generated to indicate this determination thus allowing the web site owner to potentially develop content for adding to the web site to manually add a page or to allow the techniques described herein to automatically generate a new landing page for a theme corresponding to such newly added web site content based on the query .

In some embodiments various modules are automatically generated for a topic or sub topic e.g. a theme or sub theme . For example the modules can be selected to provide contextually relevant content e.g. based on the web site a source of a user a device being used by the user and so forth and can provide an optimal landing page for user queries that are not otherwise optimally captured by the web site s existing content or structure. In some embodiments various modules are provided that provide the content for the topic e.g. a Related Searches module a Most Popular Products module a Recent Viewed Products module a Your Friends Have Seen module a Customer Favorites module a Refinements Related Products module and or various other modules .

In some embodiments the customer favorites module presents the highest ranking products that match the main theme e.g. based on scoring techniques as described herein . For example the customer favorite s module facilitates the display of product assortments that are most relevant to the theme and expected to generate a significant portion of user clicks. Also search engines can crawl this content which generally facilitates improved indexing and eventually ranking of the product pages linked based on the optimized keywords present in the content. In some embodiments these products are computed by analyzing user click behavior and combining that with relevancy rating to create a score. If the site has more information about products e.g. ratings reviews and or other information about products this data will also be used to compute the product s relevancy score.

In some embodiments the top refinements module presents a set of queries e.g. or sub themes that are highly relevant refinements to the base theme or main theme. For example the sub themes improve user navigation providing users with commonly used additional options for the broad theme that they are exploring. Also sub themes and their associated content can generally improve keyword density and increase search engines access and crawling of more keywords for the base theme than would be present on an existing product or category page. In some embodiments sub themes are computed by determining relatedness of the sub theme to the base theme and analyzing user click data and behavior. For example sub themes can be generated and presented with minimal overlap between each other to increase diversity on the page and maximize the number of unique keywords on the page.

In some embodiments related themes are provided as links in a sub window e.g. such as sub window . In some embodiments these are links to other thematic pages that are relevant to the present page e.g. web page . For example users can navigate to related content and explore additional products and themes that are related to the present thematic page. Also these links are crawlable and thus can help search engines discover other thematic pages. In some embodiments these links are computed based on product relevancy and product overlap e.g. and can also be presented in a Related Searches widget .

In some embodiments related searches are provided as links in a sub window e.g. such as sub window . In some embodiments these are links to other search results pages that are relevant to this page. For example the related searches can suggest searches that are common on the site related to the given theme. Also these links can help search engines discover other search pages and these links can bring in valuable and relevant content onto the given page. In some embodiments these links are computed based on product relevancy and product overlap and these searches are typically high frequency e.g. and can also be presented in a Related Searches widget .

In some embodiments More Results are provided as links in a sub window e.g. such as sub window . In some embodiments these are links to 1 other Thematic Pages if they exist or 2 search results pages if there are no relevant Thematic Pages. For example these links allow users to further explore the assortment of products presented in the Top Refinements sub themes. Also these links can facilitate crawling by search engines to search other pages and thematic pages for the web site.

In some embodiments a web site includes links to theme based landing pages for the web site e.g. links to thematic pages . For example when a user clicks a link to a thematic page the exact URL pattern used can take several forms e.g. http www..com th.html . The web site server can extract the page name field from the URL e.g. as indicated in the above example and can construct a fetch thematic API call to a third party theme content service e.g. the remote API can require an HTTP GET request that specifies and possibly authenticates the authorized web site requester using a private key and also possibly utilizes a variable number of HTTP parameters escaped using URL percent encoding conventions the requesting web site and the requested thematic page that services thematic page requests for the web site e.g. in other examples the thematic page requests can be serviced by the web site server or another service managed by the web site operator . The third party theme content service can then return the requested thematic page e.g. return the HTML for the requested thematic page possibly inside returning the HTML that should be used to construct the thematic page by placing the returned HTML inside a thematic page template . The web site server can then construct the thematic page using the returned HTML page and possibly some additional boilerplate and can then return the requested constructed thematic page to the requesting user s client browser. In some embodiments the web site server caches the thematic pages e.g. for a one day period of time or another period of time or based on an event occurrence .
