In one embodiment a system device and or method may offer bets that are dependent on a function of a primary slot machine and or any other device. For example a second window may open on a primary game screen and or any other display and or any other output device that offers a wager on the outcome of the next game e.g. spin etc. . In one example the pseudo wagering option may be whether the next game e.g. spin etc. will be a winner or a loser. The player may make the wager and play the game. If the results of the game play is consistent with the player s bet the player wins and is awarded a prize. In one example the gaming system does not determine the outcome of the future game play before the wager and or odds are accepted and or created. In this example this pseudo gaming option may not need to be approved as a gaming device and may not be subject to the rigorous standards of a regulated gaming device. In this example an accounting system that accepts bets and pays winning bets may be utilized. In these examples the player is betting on some characteristic of slot machine play and or another verifiable event outcome.

In one example the types of pseudo wagers that can be accepted are not relegated to the outcomes of the player s slot machine. In various examples the possibilities for betting options are related to the events and or occurrences that can be observed recorded and or verified by the system. For example one wagering option may be whether the progressive jackpot will be triggered and or hit in the next 3 minutes and or next 10 spins. In another example one wagering option may be whether another person e.g. a friend a wife a husband a stranger etc. will win on the next spin. In this example a loyalty card and or some other identification method may be utilized to identify the player and or a specific gaming device identification number may be utilized. In another example one wagering option may be whether the mystery progressive will be hit e.g. won before it reaches a certain number e.g. 300 1 000 etc. .

In another example the credits for the wager and the winnings may be moved to and from the primary gaming device through automatic fund transfer AFT transactions from the system. Further the system may act as the book maker for the bets. The system may meter and account for all transfers in total and by each game in which pseudo wagers have been made.

In another example the system may determine the one or more event outcomes via SAS communications communications with a class II server and or other communication protocol and or other forms of communication methods. The system may record one or more outcomes for the wager and relays the results to the player and or one or more EGMs. In addition the system may allow for a ticket to be printed as a pseudo wager receipt but this may not be necessary as the pseudo wager information is already stored on the system. In addition in cases where the pseudo wager cannot be completed the pseudo wager may be returned to the player or to the player s account. In various examples one or more rules may be implemented for pseudo wagers that depend on an event occurring over a time period and or as other events happen to prevent the player from trying to cancel wagers as a limit is approached. For example a player may want to cancel a bet that the next four spins will be winner once the second spin was not a winner. However the system may not allow this.

For example the data may include a 2D representation of the changed scene and one or more associated interpretations of what any of the bodies and or objects within the scene are and or what the bodies and or objects are doing e.g. moving hand etc. . In such an example the game logic controller may then interpret the entire scene based on and or partially based on the one or more associated interpretations and the raw data.

In another example the data may include both a 3D representation and a 2D representation of the changed scene but may not include any associated interpretations of what any of the bodies and or objects within the scene are or what the bodies and or objects are doing. In such an example the game logic controller may then interpret the entire scene and may include what any of the bodies and or objects within the scene are and what the bodies and or objects are doing.

In one embodiment the data may be basic data which may represent at a digital level the content of the scene change along with one or more associated interpretations. For example the data may include both a 2D representation and a 3D representation of the changed scene and one or more associated interpretations of what any of the bodies and or objects within the scene are and or what the bodies and or objects are doing e.g. moving hand etc. . In such an example the game logic controller may then interpret the entire scene based on and or partially based on the one or more associated interpretations and the raw data.

In another embodiment the data transmitted to the game logic controller at step may include at least some associated interpretation. For example the data received from the sensors may include interpretive data that a hand moved from a first point to a second point and then the game controller may then determine what such movement of a player s hand represents. In this example it may be possible to share the data interpretation workload amongst the sensors and the game logic controller.

At step the game logic controller may send data to one or more devices. In one embodiment the data the game logic controller forwards at step may include new data such as data resulting from interpreting the data received from the sensors. For example the game logic controller may interpret the data from the sensors and determine that a player moved their hand from a first point to a second point and then may further determine that this action is a recognized action for performing a first command in a play of a game and then may forward new data related to the first command to one or more devices.

In one example if the data indicates a first activity e.g. walking then a first action e.g. initiate a light display may be commanded by the one or more processors to be implemented on one or more gaming devices or non gaming devices and or any combination thereof . In a second example if the data indicates a second activity e.g. sitting then a second action e.g. initiate program one which may be a game overview may be commanded by the one or more processors to be implemented on one or more gaming devices or non gaming devices and or any combination thereof . In another example if the data indicates a third activity e.g. groups of people then a third action e.g. initiate a multi game presentation may be commanded by the one or more processors to be implemented on one or more gaming devices or non gaming devices and or any combination thereof . In another example if the data indicates a fourth activity e.g. groups of people playing another game then a fourth action e.g. initiate an attraction mode which may include a bonus for coming over to play this game may be commanded by the one or more processors to be implemented on one or more gaming devices or non gaming devices and or any combination thereof .

In one example one or more sensors may detect the absence of a patron e.g. an empty chair and or an empty scene in front of the cabinet and based on this detection one or more processors may initiate an attract mode an activity rest mode and or a low light mode.

In another example if the patron is seated but there are no credits present in the machine one or more sensors may prompt the game controller to present graphics and or audio presentations inviting the patron to become a player by entering credits.

In another example the overall function of the sensor system e.g. 2D 3D and or a combination thereof may be to detect the presence orientation and movement of a person and or a group of patrons within the game system area and thereby altering and or adapting the interaction of the game system with the patrons either in an attract mode during non game play and or during game play.

In another example a screen cursor may follow a player s pointing gesture and gestures to select targets under the cursor and gestures to execute those targets.

In another embodiment the data transmitted by the game logic controller at step may include at least a portion of the data the game controller may have received from the sensor at step . For example the sensor may have sent data representative of a player s hand moving to the game logic controller which then included such data representative of the player s hand moving to one or more devices.

In another embodiment the game logic controller may determine which of the one or more devices may need to perform one or more actions based on the received data and then may only forward such data to those devices. For example the game logic controller may determine that the data representative of a specific hand movement by the player should cause an associated display screen to change displays a command may be sent to the associated display screen to change displays but the command may not be sent to an associated ticket printer as the ticket does not have any associated actions to perform. In another embodiment the game logic controller may determine an appropriate command at step based on the data received at step and may then broadcast the determined command to all associated devices. The devices may have the appropriate configuration in order to determine if the broadcast command applies to each machine and or whether the device needs to perform an action based on the broadcast command.

In one example a command signal to initiate one or more actions may be transmitted to one or more gaming devices based on data from one or more scenes. In this example an attraction presentation signal may be sent to three gaming devices. However only two gaming devices e.g. the first gaming device and the second gaming device may initiate an attraction presentation because the third gaming device is already in use. The one or more scene data may be generated by any number of devices e.g. first gaming device first non gaming device second gaming device second non gaming device third gaming device etc. . In another example a command signal may be transmitted to a first gaming device a first non gaming device a second gaming device a third gaming device and a fourth gaming device. However fourth gaming device may not initiate the active requested by command signal because of the distance fourth gaming device is away from one or more locational data points e.g. the scene has moved away from fourth gaming device .

In one embodiment the one or more devices may be part of the same physical structure as the gaming system. For example the one or more devices may be at least one display screen which may also be utilized to display a play of a game on the gaming system. In another embodiment the one or more devices may not be part of the same physical structure as the gaming system. For example the one or more devices may be a separate computer located at a casino bar which may based on the data received from the game logic controller display a request for a waitress to visit the player playing at the gaming system.

In another example one or more scenes may initiate one or more activities e.g. attraction mode attraction presentation drink service food service help host request emergency response special promotion etc. . In one example based on data from one or more scenes an emergency response is required e.g. someone is ill being threatened etc. . In another example all of the gaming machines and or a portion thereof are being utilized in a specific area which generates a special promotion e.g. five free spins for everyone 10 percent extra payout for the next five minutes etc. .

At step one or more devices may perform one or more actions based on the data from the game logic controller. In one embodiment multiple devices may receive the same data and each may then have to filter the received data to determine if they need to perform any actions based on the data. In another embodiment the game logic controller may filter at least some of the data and forward data to one or more devices only if the receiving one or more devices is are required to perform an action based on the received data.

In another embodiment step may include a digital adjustment. For example one or more sensor components may include a physical lens and a picture relayed by the lens may be digitally zoomed or otherwise digitally enhanced. In another example hardware components of the one or more depth image sensing devices may be recalibrated via software instructions in order to relay better data from a viewed scene.

At step a live scene may be detected based on the data from one or more sensors. In one embodiment a live scene may include people making movements. In another embodiment a live scene may include people making movements in relation to a play of a game on an associated gaming system. In another embodiment a live scene may include multiple people making movements in relation to a play of a multiplayer game on a multiplayer gaming system. In one embodiment the detection of a human body part e.g. for example a hand may determine that a live scene is detected. In another embodiment the detection of movement within a certain distance of the one or more depth image sensing devices may determine that a live scene is detected.

At step it may be determined if one or more people are in one or more positions. In one embodiment the system may attempt to determine the location of one or more people in relation to one or more associated gaming system interfaces. For example a multiplayer gaming system may have interfaces for five different players and the system may attempt to determine the location of persons at each of the interfaces.

At step the method may include the step of transmitting the people and positional data to a logic function. In one embodiment the logic function may reside on a specifically configured processor. In another embodiment the logic function may reside on a game logic controller. In one embodiment the logic function may be a dedicated logic function wherein it may solely function to receive people and positional data. In another embodiment the logic function may have multiple tasks it is capable and or responsible to undertake.

At step the logic function may generate one or more actions. In one embodiment the one or more actions may be commands to one or more devices. In another embodiment the one or more actions may be the retransmission of part or all of the people and positional data to another logic function and or one or more devices. In another embodiment the one or more actions may include a reconfiguration of and or writing to at least one memory device.

At step the method may include determining one or more body shapes based on the scene data. In one embodiment the system may recognize body shapes. For example the system may recognize hand and fingers but may not recognize feet. In another embodiment the system may recognize each body extremity and or the entire body.

At step the system may recognize one or more body shape movements. In one embodiment the system may recognize some but not all body shape movements. For example the system may recognize a hand moving back and forth but may not recognize a head shaking. In another embodiment the system may recognize a preset number of body shape movements e.g. the system may recognize five body shape movements the system may recognize three body shape movements etc. . In another embodiment the system may expand the number of recognized movements it may recognize based on repeated observation of such movements and in a sense it may learn additional movements.

At step the method may include the step of correlating the one or more body shape movements with one or more reference models. In one embodiment the one or more reference models are preloaded on the system. In another embodiment some of the one or more reference models are preloaded on the system but the system is configured to allow for the dynamic creation of additional models. For example the system may store in memory one or more body shape movements that it was not able to determine and also store in memory a subsequent action made by a player such as an input made at the gaming system and or a different body shape movement and upon determining a pattern in such historical data add the previously unrecognized body shape movement and its associated desired action to the listing of reference models. In this sense the system may be able to learn additional body shape movements. In another example the system may be able to learn movement patterns e.g. body movements but not have any preloaded movement profiles.

In another embodiment reference models may include data representative of common movements. For example a gaming system may include a bonus feature that instructs a player to move one or both hands in the play of the bonus feature and the gaming system may include reference models which may include data representative of a player playing with a left hand only a player playing with a right hand only and or a player playing with both hands. In this example it may be possible to configure an associated game logic controller to interpret received data even if one of the player s hands is hidden from view of the one or more sensors by another body part which may help avoid incorrectly determined inputs. In one example the system may obtain data from one or more other gaming devices and or non gaming devices to fill in any data gaps.

At steps the method may include the steps of determining a response based on the correlation from step step transmitting data to one or more devices to implement the response step and or the one or more devices implementing one or more actions to implement the response step . In one embodiment the response may be selected from a listing of a plurality of possible responses and may indicate a result in a game play mechanic. For example a determined correlation may relate to a specific desired action by a player in a play of a gaming feature and the associated determine response may be an indication of the outcome of the desired action which is then transmitted at least one display device which then displays the determined outcome.

At step the method may include the step of initiating game play. In one embodiment one of a plurality of detected body movements may initiate game play. For example a movement of a player s hand in a side to side motion or a back and forth motion may initiate a new play of the game. In another embodiment the listing of movements which may initiate a new play of a game may be small. It is contemplated that due to the legal nature of initiating a new play of a game the system provider may want to take measures to insure that player movements which may be interpreted to initiate a new game play are limited and or deliberate in an effort to avoid misinterpreted player actions. In one embodiment step may initiate a play of a secondary or bonus game. In another embodiment the gaming system may allow only secondary or bonus games to be initiated by detected body movements. It is contemplated that this embodiment may be viewed as desirable in order to avoid unintentional initiations of new games by players which could have legal ramifications.

At step the method may include the step of generating and displaying the game play results. In one embodiment step may include the generating and displaying of results for a primary game. In another embodiment step may include the generating and displaying of results for a secondary or bonus game. In one embodiment the detected body movement from step may influence the generated and displayed game results. In another embodiment the detected body movement may influence the displaying of the game results but not the results themselves. For example if a detected body movement included a player s hand moving from bottom to top the reels of a video slot game may then spin from bottom to top based on the detected hand movement but the results may be the same even if the player had caused the reels to spin in the opposite direction. In such an example the detected body movement may still provide value in allowing the player to perceive control over the spin without actually allowing the player to control and or affect the actual outcome. In another embodiment the detected body movement may only cause the game play to be initiated and may not affect how the game play is displayed and or the results of the game play.

In another example the method may include determining one or more responses and may include receiving scene data from one or more sensors. In one embodiment the data may be basic data which may represent at a digital level the content of the scene with no associated interpretation. For example the data may only include a 3D representation of the scene but may not include any associated interpretation of what any of the bodies and or objects within the scene are or what the bodies and or objects are doing. In another embodiment the data transmitted may include at least some associated interpretation. For example the data received from the one or more sensors may include interpretive data that a hand moved from a first point to a second point. In this example it may be possible to share the data interpretation workload amongst the sensors and a separate logic device.

The method may include the steps of determining one or more responses based on the received scene data and implementing one or more actions on one or more gaming devices based on the one or more determined responses. In one embodiment the determined response and or implemented action may be made apparent to the player. For example in response to a player moving his hand in a certain movement a new play of a base game may be initiated. In another embodiment the determined response and or implemented action may not be made apparent to the player. For example a repeated movement by a player may be determined to be a security risk and the implemented action may be to send an electronic message to a security station so that security personnel may be dispatched to further investigate and or any other action may be taken.

Some of the embodiments disclosed may utilize one or more of the processes disclosed herein and or may utilize one or more of the depth image sensing devices disclosed herein.

In one example a player may pick a symbol by tapping the air. In another example the player may move an object located on the gaming system e.g. a ship a horse a person etc. by turning their body.

In one embodiment a gaming system may utilize one or more depth image sensing devices in order to initiate one or more sequences used to attract players. In one example the one or more depth image sensing device may detect people walking by the machine and the gaming system may utilize the information received from the one or more depth image sensing device to cause an associated display device to display images that are specific to the detected people. For example four people may walk by the machine and the gaming system utilizing one or more depth image sensing devices may cause an associated display device to display any four images e.g. monkeys GODS woman cars etc. walking across the screen at approximately the same rate. In another example each of the monkeys may have a characteristic that is visually similar to one of the people walking by e.g. hair length relative height to the other people monkeys posture gender age etc. . In another example the images may move from one or more gaming devices to one or more other gaming devices.

In another example a gaming system may utilize such detection data to use an audio system to direct sound and or speech based on the detection data. For example if a tall male is walking by slowly the gaming system may utilize related detection data to cause an audible Hey tall guy. Why don t you come play me and or other such personalized sound and or speech. For example the player may be wearing a cowboy hat and the message may be Hey Cowboy. Why don t you sit for a spell and give this game a roll .

In a similar example the one or more depth image sensing devices may detect that a person is looking at the game screen and the gaming system may detect that the game is not actively being played so the gaming system may initiate activities that are directed to inform the person about how the game mechanics may work. For example at least one display device associated with the gaming system may start displaying a tutorial on the game play mechanics. In another example the audio system may cause information on the game play mechanics to be broadcast. In one example the gaming system may offer a free play bonus e.g. five spins 10 percent of inserted credits etc. .

In another embodiment the gaming system may utilize one or more depth image sensing devices in order to determine the state of the gaming system. For example if the gaming system does not detect any people moving within a defined area around the gaming system the gaming system may cause one or more components to go into a sleep mode and or otherwise cause them to utilize less power. In another example the gaming system may cause one or more components to awake if the gaming system detects movement in close proximity to the gaming system. In such example the one or more depth image sensing devices could be beneficial in allowing the gaming system to use less energy and or increasing the useful life of associated gaming system components.

In another embodiment a gaming system may utilize one or more depth image sensing devices for security purposes. In one example the one or more depth image sensing devices may detect a repetitive pattern of unusual movements by a player. In another example the one or more depth image sensing devices may detect a player attempting to access secure parts of the gaming system. In another example the gaming system may analyze data received from the one or more depth images sensing devices and determine a security threat. In still another example the gaming system may cause a message to be sent to a security system and or a communication terminal at a security personnel location which may be utilized to have security personnel further investigate.

In one embodiment the gaming system may utilize one or more depth image sensing devices for player security purposes. In one example the one or more depth image sensing devices may detect that a person has suspiciously walked up behind a player and may cause an associated audio visual device to alert the player of such an action. In another example the gaming system may cause an associated display device to display a video likeness of the scene behind a player as sort of a digital rear view mirror so that the player can become aware of his her surroundings. In another example the gaming system via the one or more depth image sensing devices may determine that a person walking by has taken something from the player s chair e.g. a purse etc. and may alert the player and or security personnel.

In one embodiment the gaming system may utilize one or more depth image sensing devices for drink service purposes. For example the gaming system may based on data received from one or more depth image sensing devices cause a casino waitress to visit the player at the machine with a new drink and or in order to take a new drink order. In one example the gaming system may recognize a specific gesture made by a player to indicate the player s desire to have drink service. In another example the gaming system may then alert a nearby waitress station about the request. In another example the gaming system may then cause an associated display device to display a plurality of drink choices and allow the player to make a further input as to which drink they desire and then may cause the selected choice to be communicated to a nearby bar station. In another example the gaming system may recognize certain movements made by the player that may indicate that the player desires another drink. For example it may have been detected that the player raised an object to his mouth a predetermined number of times e.g. 3 times and or for a predetermined amount of time e.g. 5 seconds which the game logic controller may have been configured to determine that this action means that the player has taken a drink enough times to possibly be ready for a new drink and so the game logic controller may then cause an associated display screen to display a drink order screen and or alert a nearby waitress station.

In one embodiment the gaming system may utilize one or more depth image sensing devices for food service purposes. In one example the gaming system via the one or more depth image sensing device may detect a certain player movement and determine that the player wishes to order food. In one example the gaming system may cause a food menu to be displayed. In another example the gaming system may then detect an input made by the player indicating their food selection. In another example the gaming system may communicate with a casino kitchen and or other food provider which may then cause a person to visit the player.

In one embodiment a gaming system may utilize one or more depth image sensing devices for host service purposes. In one example the gaming system via the one or more depth image sensing device may recognize one or more specific gestures made by a player as indicating that the player desires assistance by casino personnel. In another example the gaming system may cause a casino host page to be displayed on an associated display device and or cause a communication to casino host personnel in regards to the request. In another example the gaming system may recognize certain movement by the player as indicative of a player that may need assistance and may notify casino personnel. For example the gaming system may determine that a player s head moving left then right and then back to left in repeated fashion may indicate the player is looking around for assistance and the gaming system may then communicate to a nearby casino host station the location of the detected movement. In another example the player may take a predetermined amount of time e.g. 1 minute 2 minutes 5 minutes etc. that may indicate the player is losing interest in the game which the gaming system may then communicate to a nearby casino host station electronic gaming device and or electronic gaming system that the player needs some incentive e.g. a free spin a free drink etc. to keep them interested.

In one embodiment a gaming system may utilize one or more depth image sensing devices for play of a primary wagering game. For example the gaming system may recognize certain gestures made by a player as indicating one or more commands to the gaming system. In another example the gaming system may allow a player to begin a spin of reels by utilizing hand gestures. In another example the gaming system may display the spinning of the reels based on the hand gesture detected by the one or more depth image sensing device. For example a detected first hand gesture may cause the reels to spin in a traditional top to bottom fashion while a detected second hand gesture may cause the reels to spin in a nontraditional bottom to top fashion. In another example the gaming system may recognize one or more gestures made by a player to cause the reels to stop spinning which may be referred to as slamming the reels or otherwise causing the reels to suddenly stop spinning prior to their default stop time.

In another embodiment a gaming system may provide educational resources to players about utilization of the one or more depth images sensing devices. In one example the gaming system could provide an informational display such as a help screen which may provide information on player gestures and their intended interpretation by the gaming system. In another example the gaming system could provide one or more audio visual resources such as a tutorial video in order to communicate to a player information on player gestures and their intended interpretation by the gaming system.

In one embodiment a gaming system may utilize one or more depth image sensing devices for play of a secondary and or bonus game. In one example the gaming system may allow a player to make an input in space without physically touching the machine. For example in a traditional pick and reveal game a player was required to touch the screen of a gaming system in order to make inputs as to which selection to pick but in accordance with the present disclosure the player may be allowed to make such an input in space without ever physically touching the gaming device.

In another example the gaming system may be able to detect the player s gestures in a 3D plane which may then allow the game to offer gaming mechanics which require 3D interaction. For example a gaming system may provide a game with a 3D representation of a playing board and the player may be able to manipulate game pieces around the virtual 3D board via 3D movements that the gaming system is able to detect. In another example the gaming system may allow a player to make 3D gestures which may then be represented on a virtual 3D screen in similar 3D movements of a piece. For example a player may make both up and down and front to back gestures and the gaming system may represent a bottle of champagne being shaken in similar up and down and front to back gestures until the cork explodes which may then reveal an award.

In one embodiment a gaming system may utilize one or more depth image sensing devices for use in a multiplayer game offering. In one example a plurality of gaming systems are linked together in a multiplayer offering.

In another embodiment the gaming system determines the game outcome based on the pulled random numbers and then causes the game to present an associated outcome to the player.

At step the gaming system determines if a secondary or bonus game may be triggered. In one embodiment the bonus game is triggered by the display of a plurality of matching symbols at a plurality of predetermined symbol positions within a play of the primary game. In one example the bonus game may be triggered if a plurality of matching symbols is displayed on the 2 3and 4reel. In another example the bonus game may be triggered if matching symbols are displayed on the 1 2and 3reels. In a further example the bonus game may be triggered if matching symbols occur at predetermined symbol positions that include consecutive and non consecutive reels. In another example a bonus game e.g. secondary game may be triggered in any way e.g. one special symbols in any locations one special symbol in one or more predetermined locations two special symbols in any locations two special symbols in one or more predetermined locations three special symbols in any locations three special symbols in one or more predetermined locations etc. .

If it is determined that a bonus or secondary game was not triggered the process continues to step where the base game may be fully presented to the player. As discussed above the orders of step and can be changed without affecting the novel concepts disclosed herein.

At step the win or loss outcome of the primary game may be identified for the player. In one embodiment this step can include additional messaging which provides information related to the win or loss such as why the player won or lost. In another embodiment this step can include identification of the amount of any award earned by the player

If it is determined at step that a bonus or secondary game was triggered then process continues to step where the secondary game may be presented to the player. As discussed above there are numerous ways to present the secondary or bonus game to the player.

At steps and the outcome of the secondary game may be evaluated and presented to the player. In one embodiment the outcome of the bonus game will always be a winning outcome. In another embodiment the outcome of the secondary game will cause a significant award to be provided to the player. In one example of such an embodiment the award may not be provided by the gaming system as a casino operator may need to verify tax information before allowing such an award to be provided to the player. In one embodiment instead of the process ending after step the process continues to step so as to finalize the primary game outcome presentation to the player.

In a flow diagram is shown according to one embodiment. The method may include generate positional data step via one or more near field sensor far field sensors GPS and or any other positional system. The method may include performing one or more near field functions based on the positional data step .

The method may include determining that the player is interacting with the gaming device step . The method may include performing one or more gaming activities e.g. initiating game play transferring funds etc. step . The method may include determining that the player has left the gaming device step . The method may include transferring any remaining funds to the player s account step . The method may include resetting the electronic gaming device step .

In a flow diagram is shown according to one embodiment. The method may include tracking one or more individuals via a location tracking system step . The method may include generating one or more messages and or one or more warnings based on the locational data step . The method may include transmitting and or displaying one or more messages and or warnings step .

The method may include generating one or more step by step directions step . The method may include displaying and or transmitting the one or more step by step directions step .

In one example one or more data points e.g. programming data updates etc. may be transferred from a first electronic gaming device to an Nth electronic gaming device via one or more near field devices. Therefore a programmer may only need to update one machine which then this update machine may update one or more other electronic devices via one or more near field devices. Further one or more credit amounts may be transferred from a first electronic gaming device to an Nth electronic gaming device via one or more near field devices.

In one example a new method of player tracking utilizing wristbands and near field communication may be employed. For example using Near Field Communication technology NFC an NFC tag may be embedded into a wristband and tag readers into any machines which would make use of the bands. This wristband is then given to the player rather than a traditional player loyalty card. All a player must do now is bring their hand close to a machine s button panel or screen as they would do normally to play any game to have it recognize them and perform any other desired actions just as if they had inserted a card such as cashing in. When they are done all they have to do is walk away. The machine can then recognize this as well and take any desired actions. This provides multiple benefits over a traditional card. It is one less step for the player as it tracks them based on the natural actions of moving their hand to the play area and walking away when done. Since it is worn on the wrist it would prevent a player from accidentally dropping or losing it as easily as a traditional card as well as being more difficult to steal over a traditional card. The wristbands themselves may then be branded which could catch the attention of other potential customers as it is out in the open bringing in more business for the casino
