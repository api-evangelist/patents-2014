Bromodomains refer to conserved protein structural folds which bind to N acetylated lysine residues that are found in some proteins. The BET family of bromodomain containing proteins is comprised of four members BRD2 BRD3 BRD4 and BRDt . Each member of the BET family employs two bromodomains to recognize N acetylated lysine residues found primarily but not exclusively on the amino terminal tails of histone proteins. These interactions modulate gene expression by recruiting transcription factors to specific genome locations within chromatin. For example histone bound BRD4 recruits the transcription factor P TEFb to promoters resulting in the expression of a subset of genes involved in cell cycle progression Yang et al. Mol. Cell. Biol. 28 967 976 2008 . BRD2 and BRD3 also function as transcriptional regulators of growth promoting genes LeRoy et al. Mol. Cell 30 51 60 2008 . BET family members were recently established as being important for the maintenance of several cancer types Zuber et al. Nature 478 524 528 2011 Mertz et al Proc. Nat l. Acad. Sci. 108 16669 16674 2011 Delmore et al. Cell 146 1 14 2011 Dawson et al. Nature 478 529 533 2011 . BET family members have also been implicated in mediating acute inflammatory responses through the canonical NF KB pathway Huang et al. Mol. Cell. Biol. 29 1375 1387 2009 resulting in the upregulation of genes associated with the production of cytokines Nicodeme et al. Nature 468 1119 1123 2010 . Suppression of cytokine induction by BET bromodomain inhibitors has been shown to be an effective approach to treat inflammation mediated kidney disease in an animal model Zhang et al. J. Biol. Chem. 287 28840 28851 2012 . BRD2 function has been linked to predisposition for dyslipidemia or improper regulation of adipogenesis elevated inflammatory profiles and increased susceptibility to autoimmune diseases Denis Discovery Medicine 10 489 499 2010 . The human immunodeficiency virus utilizes BRD4 to initiate transcription of viral RNA from stably integrated viral DNA Jang et al. Mol. Cell 19 523 534 2005 . BET bromodomain inhibitors have also been shown to reactivate HIV transcription in models of latent T cell infection and latent monocyte infection Banerjee et al J. Leukocyte Biol. doi 10.1189 jlb.0312165 . BRDt has an important role in spermatogenesis that is blocked by BET bromodomain inhibitors Matzuk et al. Cell 150 673 684 2012 . Thus compounds that inhibit the binding of BET family bromodomains to their cognate acetylated lysine proteins are being pursued for the treatment of cancer inflammatory diseases kidney diseases diseases involving metabolism or fat accumulation and some viral infections as well as for providing a method for male contraception. Accordingly there is an ongoing medical need to develop new drugs to treat these indications.

If a moiety is described as substituted a non hydrogen radical is in the place of hydrogen radical of any substitutable atom of the moiety. Thus for example a substituted heterocycle moiety is a heterocycle moiety in which at least one non hydrogen radical is in the place of a hydrogen radical on the heterocycle. It should be recognized that if there are more than one substitution on a moiety each non hydrogen radical may be identical or different unless otherwise stated .

If a moiety is described as being optionally substituted the moiety may be either 1 not substituted or 2 substituted. If a moiety is described as being optionally substituted with up to a particular number of non hydrogen radicals that moiety may be either 1 not substituted or 2 substituted by up to that particular number of non hydrogen radicals or by up to the maximum number of substitutable positions on the moiety whichever is less. Thus for example if a moiety is described as a heteroaryl optionally substituted with up to 3 non hydrogen radicals then any heteroaryl with less than 3 substitutable positions would be optionally substituted by up to only as many non hydrogen radicals as the heteroaryl has substitutable positions. To illustrate tetrazolyl which has only one substitutable position would be optionally substituted with up to one non hydrogen radical. To illustrate further if an amino nitrogen is described as being optionally substituted with up to 2 non hydrogen radicals then a primary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to 2 non hydrogen radicals whereas a secondary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to only 1 non hydrogen radical.

The terms treat treating and treatment refer to a method of alleviating or abrogating a disease and or its attendant symptoms.

The terms prevent preventing and prevention refer to a method of preventing the onset of a disease and or its attendant symptoms or barring a subject from acquiring a disease. As used herein prevent preventing and prevention also include delaying the onset of a disease and or its attendant symptoms and reducing a subject s risk of acquiring a disease.

The phrase therapeutically effective amount means an amount of a compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof sufficient to prevent the development of or to alleviate to some extent one or more of the symptoms of the condition or disorder being treated when administered alone or in conjunction with another pharmaceutical agent or treatment in a particular subject or subject population. For example in a human or other mammal a therapeutically effective amount can be determined experimentally in a laboratory or clinical setting or may be the amount required by the guidelines of the United States Food and Drug Administration or equivalent foreign agency for the particular disease and subject being treated.

This invention also provides for pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier diluent or excipient therefor. The phrase pharmaceutical composition refers to a composition suitable for administration in medical or veterinary use.

The pharmaceutical compositions that comprise a compound of formula I alone or or in combination with a second active pharmaceutical agent may be administered to the subjects orally rectally parenterally intracisternally intravaginally intraperitoneally topically as by powders ointments or drops bucally or as an oral or nasal spray. The term parenterally as used herein refers to modes of administration which include intravenous intramuscular intraperitoneal intrasternal subcutaneous and intraarticular injection and infusion.

The term pharmaceutically acceptable carrier as used herein means a non toxic inert solid semi solid or liquid filler diluent encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any type. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are sugars such as but not limited to lactose glucose and sucrose starches such as but not limited to corn starch and potato starch cellulose and its derivatives such as but not limited to sodium carboxymethyl cellulose ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate powdered tragacanth malt gelatin talc excipients such as but not limited to cocoa butter and suppository waxes oils such as but not limited to peanut oil cottonseed oil safflower oil sesame oil olive oil corn oil and soybean oil glycols such a propylene glycol esters such as but not limited to ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate agar buffering agents such as but not limited to magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide alginic acid pyrogen free water isotonic saline Ringer s solution ethyl alcohol and phosphate buffer solutions as well as other non toxic compatible lubricants such as but not limited to sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate as well as coloring agents releasing agents coating agents sweetening flavoring and perfuming agents preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition according to the judgment of the formulator.

Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral injection comprise pharmaceutically acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions dispersions suspensions or emulsions as well as sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers diluents solvents or vehicles include water ethanol polyols such as glycerol propylene glycol polyethylene glycol and the like vegetable oils such as olive oil injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate and suitable mixtures thereof. Proper fluidity can be maintained for example by the use of coating materials such as lecithin by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions and by the use of surfactants.

These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives wetting agents emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents for example paraben chlorobutanol phenol sorbic acid and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents such as sugars sodium chloride and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.

In some cases in order to prolong the effect of the drug it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which in turn may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form may be accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.

Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly orthoesters and poly anhydrides . Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues.

BiTE antibodies are bi specific antibodies that direct T cells to attack cancer cells by simultaneously binding the two cells. The T cell then attacks the target cancer cell. Examples of BiTE antibodies include adecatumumab Micromet MT201 blinatumomab Micromet MT103 and the like. Without being limited by theory one of the mechanisms by which T cells elicit apoptosis of the target cancer cell is by exocytosis of cytolytic granule components which include perforin and granzyme B. In this regard Bcl 2 has been shown to attenuate the induction of apoptosis by both perforin and granzyme B. These data suggest that inhibition of Bcl 2 could enhance the cytotoxic effects elicited by T cells when targeted to cancer cells V. R. Sutton D. L. Vaux and J. A. Trapani 1997 158 12 5783 .

SiRNAs are molecules having endogenous RNA bases or chemically modified nucleotides.

Examples of chemical modifications include phosphorothioate groups 2 deoxynucleotide 2 OCH containing ribonucleotides 2 F ribonucleotides 2 methoxyethyl ribonucleotides combinations thereof and the like. The siRNA can have varying lengths e.g. 10 200 bps and structures e.g. hairpins single double strands bulges nicks gaps mismatches and are processed in cells to provide active gene silencing. A double stranded siRNA dsRNA can have the same number of nucleotides on each strand blunt ends or asymmetric ends overhangs . The overhang of 1 2 nucleotides can be present on the sense and or the antisense strand as well as present on the 5 and or the 3 ends of a given strand.

Multivalent binding proteins are binding proteins comprising two or more antigen binding sites. Multivalent binding proteins are engineered to have the three or more antigen binding sites and are generally not naturally occurring antibodies. The term multispecific binding protein means a binding protein capable of binding two or more related or unrelated targets. Dual variable domain DVD binding proteins are tetravalent or multivalent binding proteins binding proteins comprising two or more antigen binding sites. Such DVDs may be monospecific i.e. capable of binding one antigen or multispecific i.e. capable of binding two or more antigens . DVD binding proteins comprising two heavy chain DVD polypeptides and two light chain DVD polypeptides are referred to as DVD Ig s. Each half of a DVD Ig comprises a heavy chain DVD polypeptide a light chain DVD polypeptide and two antigen binding sites. Each binding site comprises a heavy chain variable domain and a light chain variable domain with a total of 6 CDRs involved in antigen binding per antigen binding site. Multispecific DVDs include DVD binding proteins that bind DLL4 and VEGF or C met and EFGR or ErbB3 and EGFR.
