This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 262 468 filed Oct. 31 2008 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Computer systems and networks have facilitated the tasks of buying selling and transferring goods. For example global computer networks such as the Internet have allowed purchasers to relatively quickly and efficiently seek and purchase goods online. Similarly global computer networks provide an efficient and cost effective medium for sellers to advertise offer provide and sell their goods. Electronic commerce companies provide buyers and sellers with online services and the infrastructure to accept orders of goods from remote purchasers to perform the financial transactions necessary to confirm and complete the sale of goods to ship or distribute the goods to remote purchasers and to perform other related logistics. For these reasons sellers actively use the Internet to offer sell and distribute a wide variety of goods to take advantage of the many benefits provided by the Internet and electronic commerce.

One example of a market for goods within the realm of electronic commerce is the secondary ticket market. The secondary ticket market encompasses all instances in which live event tickets trade after the original point of purchase. This market exists for several reasons. First event tickets have an especially time sensitive nature. Numerous tickets expire unused each year because there is no efficient mechanism to buy and or sell secondary event tickets. When a ticket expires after an event has passed it loses all of its intrinsic value. As a result if the ticket holder cannot attend the event the only way to realize value for a ticket is to sell it in the secondary market. For example many venues universities and or sports franchises offer season tickets which are often packaged in bulk requiring a buyer to purchase several tickets at once. As a result season ticket holders often possess a number of tickets for events that they cannot attend and therefore desire to sell on the secondary market.

Additionally event venues have only a fixed supply of seating. Therefore the number of available tickets for a particular event is limited which means that high demand events can have significant volumes of secondary trading. Buyers who would like to sit only in certain seat locations further create a supply and demand imbalance. Particularly each seat location in a venue is totally unique which means there could be demand for a specific seat location that exceeds supply even when the venue is not sold out in the primary market thereby favoring the secondary market. Moreover while tickets for certain events e.g. football games of a team in the same venue may be similarly priced the actual supply and demand for such events may be substantially different thereby favoring the secondary market.

StubHub provides a network based system which implements an online secondary ticket marketplace for buyers and sellers of tickets for live events such as sports concerts theater and other entertainment events. The StubHub online secondary ticket marketplace enables legitimate convenient reliable and secure transactions at fair market value and provides ticket fulfillment services even for sold out events. Accordingly the StubHub online secondary ticket marketplace provides benefits for fans who wish to buy sell or otherwise transfer secondary tickets as well as for teams artists and venues.

For example the buyer may browse active event listings by clicking and following links for various event categories and subcategories such as sports tickets concert tickets theater tickets cities sports teams artists show type e.g. Broadway opera ballet comedy event names and so forth. The buyer also may search for events using a search engine interface and or one or more pull down menus. For example the buyer may enter one or more keywords into a search engine text entry box and view results comprising active events that satisfy the query. In various implementations the buyer may be presented with a ticket finder screen comprising a plurality of pull down menus for allowing the buyer to quickly formulate a search by selecting a category e.g. sports concert theater etc. a location e.g. city and a number of tickets from the pull down menus.

Once a buyer has located and selected an event the tickets being offered for sale for the event may be presented to the buyer. In various embodiments the user may view the details of tickets being offered for sale and the location of tickets in the event venue as described in co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 552 782 titled Method and System for Illustrating Where a Ticket is Located in an Event Venue which was filed on Oct. 25 2006 and is incorporated by reference in its entirety. In such embodiments the buyer may be presented with an interactive event venue seat map and details of available tickets according to criteria specified by the buyer.

In one implementation for example after selecting an event the buyer may be presented with an interactive event venue seat map and an initial listing of all event tickets for sale. The event listings may include details such as section row quantity and price and may be sorted by the buyer according to such details. The sections of the interactive event venue seat map for which tickets are available may be displayed in color while sections having no available tickets may be displayed in white.

Within the interactive event venue seat map comparable or similarly located e.g. upper level sections having available tickets may be displayed in the same color while sections having available tickets that are not comparable or similarly located may be displayed in different colors. For example the colors used in the sections may correspond to zones for the sections with each zone comprising several comparable or similarly located sections. Along with the interactive event venue seat map the buyer may be presented list comprising the different zone names and the color used for each zone. The names of zones having available tickets may be displayed in black text while the names of zones having no available tickets may be displayed in gray text.

When presented with the interactive event venue seat map the buyer may roll over a particular section causing a roll over screen to appear indicating the quantity and price range of tickets available in that section. By clicking on a particular section the event listings may be filtered to display only the event listings in the selected section along with the specific details e.g. section row quantity price for such tickets. The buyer also may zoom in zoom out drag and or rotate the interactive event venue seat map.

When presented with the initial listing of all event tickets for sale the buyer may filter the initial listing by inputting criteria such as one or more price ranges e.g. 75 286 286 349 349 442 442 559 and 559 and up . Once the buyer selects a price range the event listings are filtered to display only the event listings in the selected price range. Additionally the interactive event venue seat map is modified to display sections in color for which tickets are available in the selected price range.

Each event listing may include ticket attributes such as section row quantity and price. Each listing also may include a link to view additional details that when clicked may display the ticket attributes along with further ticket details e.g. seat numbers time remaining to purchase the tickets seller comments delivery options a selectively enlargeable image of the event venue for reviewing the location of the seats and an action button for initiating purchase of the tickets.

To place an order for the tickets the buyer may provide a delivery location select a method of payment e.g. credit card confirm the transaction details e.g. description of the tickets delivery method delivery location payment amount and method of payment and the complete the purchase. When the buyer places the order a confirmation e mail is sent to the buyer and the seller is notified of the order request via e mail and requested to confirm the availability and delivery of the tickets. Upon receiving confirmation from the seller that the tickets have been sent the buyer is notified as to when delivery can be expected. It can be appreciated that upon the sale of the tickets one or more delivery options may be available depending on the locations of the buyer and the seller the time remaining before the event and or the form of the tickets e.g. physical tickets electronic tickets .

The listing catalog server implemented by one or more of the application servers may be arranged to receive and respond to queries and or to provide access to event information stored in the active events database . A query to the listing catalog server may comprise for example a search query web query web feed request e.g. RSS feed request ATOM feed request API request HTTP request e.g. Get Post etc. a web form submission e.g. XHTML HTML form and or suitable request mechanism in accordance with the described embodiments. In various implementations a query may be submitted to the listing catalog server via one or more communications servers from one or more client devices client programs a third party server and or a third party application . Queries also may be submitted to the listing catalog server internally from other application severs of the network based system .

In one embodiment the listing catalog server may be implemented by a distributed architecture comprising a plurality of distributed indexing modules. Each of the distributed indexing modules may provide an interface for receiving queries from front end servers such as the communications servers . The distributed indexing modules may store and build updatable indexes against which a query can be checked to expedite retrieval of a query result. The indexes may comprise for example common keywords or search terms and event IDs linked to such keywords or search terms. The distributed indexing modules also may cache common query results.

The distributed indexing modules may be arranged to receive updated indexing information brokered via a message bus from a local gatherer module. The local gatherer in turn may be coupled to and collect indexing information from the active events database . The indexing modules may update and or filter the indexes based on the updated information received from the local gatherer module and or information from other indexing modules.

The local gatherer module may be arranged to periodically scan items stored in the active events database and obtain updated indexing information. For example the local gatherer module may request items from the active events database that have changed within a given time period. The event information stored in the active events database may change frequently as new event listings for upcoming events are added and then removed when the tickets for such events listings are purchased. Furthermore the active events database may store relatively static information for an event such as category e.g. sports concerts theater as well as real time dynamic information such as current event listings and true levels of ticket inventory. It can be appreciated that the event information maintained by the active events database may be extremely dynamic especially in cases where LMS and electronic ticketing services are provided by the network based system .

The listing catalog server may receive and respond to the queries with event information for upcoming events that satisfy such queries. The event information may be provided locally from the listing catalog server if available e.g. cached and or may be retrieved by the listing catalog server from the active events database . In various implementations event information from the listing catalog server may be communicated via one or more communications servers to one or more client devices client programs a third party server and or a third party application . The event information from the listing catalog server also may be provided internally to other application severs of the network based system .

The dynamic content management server implemented by one or more of the application servers may be arranged to provide a user with relevant and or related dynamic content customized according to a particular context of the user. In various embodiments the dynamic content management server may be structured arranged and or configured to bind dynamic information to a particular node and or combination of nodes defining the context of the user. Exemplary nodes may include for example geography nodes e.g. event cities category nodes e.g. sports concerts theater sports nodes e.g. baseball football basketball sports subcategory nodes e.g. professional college music genre nodes e.g. jazz rock alternative theater subcategory nodes e.g. musical comedy ticket subcategory nodes e.g. regular season playoff bowl conference nodes team nodes artist nodes theater show nodes venue nodes event nodes and so forth. It can be appreciated such nodes may be arranged e.g. hierarchically and or in other ways in accordance with the described embodiments.

The dynamic content management server may be configured bind dynamic content such as relevant and or related categories and subcategories event listings for upcoming events promotional or advertising content UI graphics and or various other types of customized content to a node or combination of nodes. When navigating a web site provided by the network based system for example the user may be presented with links for selecting from among various locations categories and or subcategories and for viewing content associated with such selections. When the user makes a particular selection the context of the user may be defined by one or more nodes associated with such selection and the user may be presented with dynamic content customized to the context of the user.

In various embodiments the dynamic content management server may implement a front end query tool and presentation layer to query the listing catalog server according to the context of the user. In response to the query the dynamic content management server may receive dynamic content e.g. XML content from the listing catalog server and provide the dynamic content to one or more dynamic content modules embedded in a web page presented to the user. Accordingly the content associated with event listings may change based on the context of the user configurable parameters and or available inventory.

In one example a user selects a particular city and the dynamic content management server has bound dynamic content to a geography node associated with the particular city. Upon selection of the particular city by the user the context of the user may be defined at least in part by the geography node of the selected city and the user may be presented with the dynamic content that is bound to the geography node. In this case the user may be presented with a web page including dynamic content customized for the particular city such as graphics e.g. pictures background and advertising content e.g. banner ads for the particular city relevant and or related categories and subcategories e.g. links for local sports teams artists performing in concert in the city theater shows playing in the city a list of event names and dates for upcoming events in the city arranged by category and or other type of dynamic content that changes according to the city selected by the user.

In another example a user selects a particular football team and the dynamic content management server has bound dynamic content to a team node associated with the particular football team. Upon selection of the team by the user the context of the user may be defined at least in part by the team node and the user may be presented with the dynamic content that is bound to the team node. In this case the user may be presented with a web page including dynamic content customized for the particular team. For example the web page presented to the user may be dynamically branded with graphics e.g. pictures background advertising content e.g. banner ads and or news associated with the particular team. The user also may be presented with event listings for upcoming games for the team as well as relevant and or related categories and subcategories e.g. links for road games playoff games for the team. In this implementation the context of the user may be defined by one or more other nodes in a hierarchical path to the team node such as a category node e.g. sports sports nodes e.g. football sports subcategory node e.g. professional and ticket subcategory node e.g. regular season . As such the user may be presented with dynamic content bound to one or more of such nodes such as links to other professional football teams for which regular season tickets are available.

It can be appreciated that the embodiments are not limited to the foregoing examples and that dynamic content may be bound to a particular nodes and or a combination of nodes for customizing that content displayed to a user based on the context of the user. Accordingly the dynamic content management server may be used to create dynamic content campaigns including a various types of static and dynamic content and to bind such campaigns to nodes or groups of nodes that define a context of the user. It also can be appreciated that a node and or combination of nodes can be detected as a user selects one more links and or in other ways such as when a query is submitted e.g. text entry selection of checkboxes selection from a pull down menu a search result is returned or in any other way in accordance with the described embodiments.

The delivery server implemented by one or more of the application servers may arrange the delivery of goods from the seller to the buyer. For the delivery of time sensitive goods such as a single or multiple event tickets the network based system may determine and present delivery options that ensure that an event ticket is delivered to the buyer before an event and the costs associated with such delivery options.

In various embodiments the network based system may coordinate the delivery of event tickets as described in co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09 867 171 titled System and Method for Providing Logistics for a Sale of Goods which was filed on Sep. 27 2001 and is incorporated by reference in its entirety. In such embodiments the network based system may automatically arrange and or facilitate the logistics for the delivery of event tickets from the seller to the buyer.

In one implementation for example when the buyer places an order available delivery options are presented to the buyer that ensure that the event tickets can be delivered before the event either to the buyer or to a pick up location e.g. event venue will call or an office of the network based system in proximity to the buyer. The network based system may determine all available delivery options based on the form of the tickets e.g. physical tickets electronic tickets the time remaining before the event the location of the goods the location of the buyer pick up locations in proximity to the buyer and or the capabilities one or more couriers e.g. air land couriers express couriers local couriers or runners that can execute the delivery within the time remaining before the event.

When a physical ticket is to be delivered the network based system may determine and present shipping options to the buyer. The buyer may provide a delivery or pick up location and the network based system may automatically determine couriers capable of ensuring delivery and present a list identifying the couriers the available shipping methods e.g. two day one day overnight same day for each courier and the associated cost of each shipping method.

When a courier and shipping method is selected by the buyer the seller may be notified and presented with a printable shipping label for the courier and logistics for providing the tickets to the courier. For example the network based system may automatically determine the closest courier facility in proximity to the seller and may allow and arrange for the courier to retrieve the tickets. In such cases the network based system may communicate relevant information e.g. seller address delivery address pick up day and time frame to the courier in order to coordinate ticket retrieval. If the courier cannot service any of the selected locations at any of the selected times the network based system may require the seller to drop off the tickets at the nearest courier facility. The seller also may select to drop off the tickets at the nearest courier facility. If the seller selects or is required to drop off the tickets the buyer may be provided with the location of the courier facility driving or walking directions to the courier facility and or a map showing the courier facility.

Upon confirmation by the seller that the tickets have been sent or picked up the network based system may communicate delivery tracking information to the buyer and or seller. The network based system may notify the buyer of the delivery location and expected time and date of delivery. If the delivery location is at a pick up location such as the event venue will call or an office associated with the network based system the buyer may be provided with the pick up location driving or walking directions to the pick up location and or a map showing the pick up location.

To ensure delivery to the buyer before an event a last sale time may be associated with an event listing. In some cases for example the last sale time for an event listing may be three business days before the event to provide sufficient transit time to ensure completion of delivery. In such cases the event listing will expire at the last sale time. It can be appreciated however that both sellers and buyers may desire the last sale time to be as close to the event start time as possible in order to maximize the opportunity to make a sale and the opportunity to witness an event. Accordingly the network based system may provide sellers and buyers with various last minute services LMS for maintaining an event listing and the ability to sell and purchase listed tickets right up to the start of the event.

In one implementation for example the network based system may allow tickets to be sold on consignment and may maintain an event listing until the start of the event. When a seller requires delivery of physical tickets for an upcoming event the seller may select to sell the tickets using LMS provided by the network based system . The seller may request LMS and provide the network based system with contact information e.g. name address telephone number e mail address ticket information e.g. event name event venue ticket event dates closest city to the event and authorization to release the tickets.

In response to the LMS request the seller may be contacted by an agent of the network based system via telephone or other contact method and provided with additional selling information. Depending on the time remaining before the event the seller may be instructed to ship or physically deliver the tickets to an LMS center associated with the network based system . Typically the location of the LMS center will be in close proximity to the event venue. The seller also may select to physically deliver the tickets to the LMS center. When physical delivery of the ticket to the LMS center is required or selected the seller may be provided with the location of the LMS center driving or walking directions to the LMS center and or a map showing the LMS center.

Once the tickets are delivered to the LMS center the event listing may be maintained until the start of the event and the subsequent delivery of the tickets to a buyer is handled by the network based system . For example the LMS center and or the network based system may handle the responsibility of shipping the tickets to the buyer delivering the tickets to the event venue will call and or the keeping the tickets at the LMS center until pick up by the buyer. It can be appreciated that the LMS provided by the network based system may facilitate delivery and allow the network based system to defer the last sale time until the start of the event.

In various embodiments the network based system also may defer the last sale time until the start of the event by providing various electronic ticketing options. In such embodiments the network based system may provide the buyer with an electronic ticket that can be used at the event venue. Upon receiving the electronic ticket from the network based system the buyer may print out a paper copy of the electronic ticket and the bar code of the electronic ticket can be scanned from the paper copy of the electronic ticket at the event venue. In some cases the electronic ticket may be displayed by a mobile device of the buyer and the bar code of the electronic ticket can be scanned from the screen of the mobile device at the event venue.

In various implementations the network based system may communicate with an electronic ticketing system e.g. at the event venue to associate an electronic ticket with the buyer. For example the network based system may instruct the ticketing system to activate new electronic tickets with new bar codes for the buyer and to deactivate the original electronic tickets and original bar codes of the seller. The new electronic tickets can be delivered to the buyer by the network based system and or the electronic ticketing system for printing and or display.

Alternatively or additionally the network based system may instruct the ticketing system to associate identification and or authorization information e.g. credit card swipe card password pin code of the buyer with the electronic ticket and to deactivate identification and or authorization information of the seller from the electronic ticket. Upon providing the required identification and or authorization information to the electronic ticketing system to a kiosk at the event venue and or to the network based system the buyer can print and or display the electronic ticket.

The payment server implemented by one or more of the application servers may be arranged to effectuate and or manage payments between buyers and sellers and to post and track financial transactions for users of the network based system . Transaction information for past and pending transactions may be stored by the network based system in the transaction database . The payment server also may provide dispute resolution mechanisms to handle payment disputes arising between transacting parties and or fraud prevention mechanisms to prevent fraudulent transaction unauthorized use of financial instruments non delivery of goods abuse of personal information and so forth. While the payment server is shown in as forming part of the networked based system it will be appreciated that the payment server may form part of a third party payment system that is separate and distinct from the network based system in alternative embodiments.

In various implementations the payment server may account for a transfer of funds and or financial value by debiting the a source of funds and or financial value linked to the subscriber account of the buyer and crediting a source of funds and or financial value linked to the subscriber account of the seller. For example the network based system may securely communicate with one or more financial institutions such as a bank or credit card company over one or more networks and arrange the transfer of funds and or financial value from the buyer to the seller. It can be appreciated that while certain settlement mechanisms may be described for purposes of illustration the embodiments are not limited in this regard and a variety of settlement networks and modalities may be used in accordance with the described embodiments.

In one embodiment after the buyer reviews and confirms an order the account e.g. credit card of the buyer is verified and the sale amount e.g. ticket price plus delivery cost is authorized. The seller is notified of the proposed purchase by e mail or other notification mechanism and requested to confirm that the tickets are still available and that the transaction can be completed.

Upon receiving confirmation from the seller the account e.g. credit card of the buyer is charged. Funds from the account of the buyer may be electronically transferred into a merchant account associated with the network based system and a transaction fee may be deducted. The remaining proceeds are then directed to the seller by issuing a payment in accordance with the payment method selected by the seller such as via check deposit to a third party payment services account e.g. PayPal account Season Ticket Account and or other type of source capable of receiving funds and or financial value and or donation to a third party such as a non profit organization or entity.

It can be appreciated that the network based system may provide a double blind complete ticket sale transaction without interaction between buyer and seller. Namely the network based system may facilitate an entire ticket sale transaction without requiring any interaction between the seller and the buyer. The network based system controls and or facilitates the entire sale and purchase process and serves as an intermediary between the buyer and seller effectively isolating the participation of the seller in the transaction from the participation of the buyer in the transaction. Accordingly the identity of one transacting party can remain concealed from the other.

The notification server implemented by one or more of the application servers may be arranged to generate and send various types of notifications to users of the network based system . The notification server may communicate with users over one or more types of networks e.g. the Internet a WAN a WWAN a WLAN a mobile telephone network a landline telephone network a VoIP network etc. via interfaces provided the communications servers such as the web server API server and or messaging server . It can be appreciated that in some implementations notifications may be forwarded to users via an intermediary such as an Internet Service Provider ISP online service provider OSP web based e mail service provide message aggregator e.g. SMS aggregator mobile transaction network entity and so forth.

The notifications may comprise messages delivered to users via e mail IM SMS MMS video message telephone call as well as messages delivered to the subscriber account of the user. In some cases the notifications may provide the user with information related to various online marketplace transactions. For example notifications may be sent to sellers for indicating the status of event listings informing the seller of offers e.g. auction bids for event listings or sales of similar tickets and allowing the user to modify the prices of event listings notifying the seller of placed orders and requesting confirmation of the availability of tickets for such orders providing delivery instructions and requesting confirmation of delivery tracking shipped orders providing the status of payments and so forth. Notifications may be sent to buyers for tracking ticket purchase transactions e.g. active bids auctions lost for event listings and allowing the buyer to modify offers confirming an order and delivery tracking shipped orders providing pick up instructions and requesting confirmation of receipt downloading and print electronic tickets and so forth.

In accordance with various embodiments the user may subscribe to receive customized alert notifications for upcoming events in a variety of ways such as via e mail IM SMS MMS and or other suitable delivery mechanism. In such embodiments the notification server may be arranged to generate and send an alert notification comprising a text message including relevant static or dynamic event information as well as an embedded hyperlink. The hyperlink may comprise a hyperlinked telephone number for allowing the user to place a telephone call to an agent of the network based system for transacting a mobile purchase. Alternatively or additionally the hyperlink may comprise a URL or URI for navigating to the network based system for transacting the mobile purchase. Further details of such embodiments are provided in greater detail below with reference to .

As shown the client devices may comprise a PC and a mobile device . In the illustrated embodiment a user may employ the PC to communicate with a network based system to request alert notifications for upcoming events that are to be received at the mobile device of the user. For example the user may employ the PC to send a registration request that is received by the account server at the network based system . In response to the registration request the user may be registered with the network based system to receive one or more alert notifications receive a confirmation from the account server .

While in this embodiment the user employs the PC during registration it can be appreciated that the mobile device also may be used to send the registration request and receive the confirmation in some implementations. Furthermore while the account server of the network based system may handle registration of alert notifications other servers such as the selling server the buying server and or the notification server may perform one or more registration operations independently of and or in conjunction with the account server in various usage scenarios.

The registration request generally may comprise user information and alert event information identifying one or more upcoming events for which the user desires to receive alert notifications. The user information may include for example a user identifier UserID such as an e mail address or username associated with a subscriber account a telephone number e.g. MSISDN for the mobile device and a unique valid identifier of a mobile carrier OperatorID mapped from a mobile carrier identified by the user. The alert event information may include for example one or more upcoming events a unique event identifier EventID for each upcoming alert event and a hierarchical path list of parent identifiers AncestorGenreIDs indicating the browsing path e.g. category and subcategories traversed to reach each upcoming alert event.

In various embodiments registration may be accomplished via HTTP request response using an XML based protocol such as SOAP. In one such embodiment the registration request may be implemented as follows 

In this embodiment each alert event listed in the registration request may be associated with a unique number e.g. id 1 2 3 . . . used to identify the particular alert event in the confirmation when providing a registration status e.g. success or failure for the alert event. The AncestorGenreIds may be used to link an alert event to a particular alert template used when generating the alert notification. For example the AncestorGenreIds may be used to map an event to a particular category e.g. sports concerts theater and different alert templates may be used for different categories.

Upon registration of the user with the network based system to receive one or more alert notifications a confirmation sent in response to the registration request may be implemented as follows 

In this embodiment the confirmation may comprise the UserID e.g. e mail address or username passed in the registration request and the registration status e.g. success or failure for each alert event. The confirmation also may include a user registration status code indicating whether the user has successfully registered to receive all requested alert notifications the user has successfully registered but one or more requested alert notifications failed or that user registration has failed such as when the mobile telephone number passed in the registration request is registered. It can be appreciated that for some mobile telephone carriers it may be necessary to send an invitation text message to the user and complete registration when the user sends an affirmative reply to the invitation.

In various usage scenarios as the user separately or simultaneously selects multiple upcoming events such selections may be converted into a list of EventIDs and inserted into the registration request . In such scenarios the registration request submitted to the network based system may comprise a unique EventID for each upcoming alert event selected by the user. It can be appreciated that a user can request to receive alert notifications for a single upcoming event or multiple upcoming events such as all upcoming games for one or more sports teams all upcoming events in one or more cities and so forth.

As described above the network based system may allow the user to set notification preferences and may provide the user with buying services. To facilitate the user when setting such notification preferences and or when browsing available tickets for sale the network based system may present information to and or receive information from the user in a variety of ways such as by displaying and receiving information via GUIs e.g. web pages interactive screens . In various embodiments one or more GUIs presented to the user by the network based system may allow the user to select alert events for which the user desires to receive alert notifications.

In one implementation for example when presented with a list of upcoming events that satisfy certain search criteria the user may request to receive alert notifications by selecting one or more upcoming events from the list and adding the selected events as alert events. For example GUIs presented to the user when setting notification preferences and or browsing events may provide a search engine interface e.g. text entry box input fields checkboxes clickable hyperlinks pull down menus for searching and or filtering active events using queries keywords checkbox selections menu selections and so forth.

It can be appreciated that the embodiments are not limited in this context and that an alert notification may be requested whenever an upcoming event is presented to the user whether in response to a search or when navigating to an event listing by following one or more links. In some cases for example event listings presented to the user may be displayed with and or include an alert link clickable icon or banner right click functionality and so forth for allowing the user to request an alert notification for the one or more listed events and or a category or subcategory associated with the context of the user.

In some implementations the user may request to receive alert notifications based on a variety of event criteria such as an event name category city venue artist genre team player e.g. starting pitcher favorite player theater date range date number of tickets price range ticket attributes e.g. zone range zone section range section row range row seat number range seat number and or combination thereof. Accordingly the alert information included in the registration request may comprise the EventIDs as well as one or more alert conditions associated with the EventIDs. Alert notifications for such upcoming events will be generated only when such alert conditions are met.

It can be appreciated that various combinations of event criteria are possible in accordance with the described embodiments. For example a user may request to receive an alert notification whenever a certain number of tickets for an upcoming event are available below a specified price whenever a particular artist is performing in a certain city whenever a certain player will be playing at a particular event venue and so forth. A user also may request to receive alert notifications based on one or more ticket attributes. For instance a user may request to receive an alert notification whenever a certain number of tickets for an upcoming event are available in one or more specified zones sections rows and or or seats. Additionally event criteria may be applied alone or in combination across one or more events. A user may request for example to receive alert notifications when tickets in a certain row e.g. front row or row range e.g. rows 1 5 within a specified zone e.g. club infield or section e.g. section are available for a designated team e.g. professional baseball team and or for one or more games e.g. particular opponent rivalry game . The embodiments are not limited in the regard.

It also can be appreciated that in some cases an upcoming event may not satisfy all event criteria specified by the user. For example tickets for an upcoming event may be available but not within a price range specified by the user. Additionally there may be no upcoming events that satisfy the event criteria specified by the user when there are no available tickets such as when no sellers have listed tickets for an event and or before tickets for an event go on sale. In such cases the user may be informed that there are no search results satisfying the search criteria and then perform a new search with relaxed search criteria. Alternatively or additionally the network based system may automatically relax the search criteria and provide the user with one or more event listings that substantially satisfy the search criteria. The network based system then may allow the user to select to receive an alert notification for one or more upcoming events for such event listings conditioned on the complete satisfaction of the search criteria.

In some implementations the network based system may receive the search criteria specified by the user and allow the user to select to receive an alert notification whenever an upcoming event that substantially and or completely satisfies the search criteria is listed. For example the user may select to receive on sale alert notifications when tickets that satisfy one or more preferences of the user become available. In such implementations the network based system may provide the user with various capabilities e.g. preference settings and options to allow the user to receive on sale alert notifications for preferred tickets and to allow the user to automatically and or optionally purchase such preferred tickets.

Once the user has registered to receive one or more alert notifications the selected alert events may be associated with the user and or stored in the subscriber database . In some embodiments the subscriber account of the user maintained by the subscriber database may be updated with the EventIDs corresponding to the selected alert events and or the alert conditions and event criteria associated with the selected alert events . In general when separate and or subsequent requests are received from the user to register additional alert notifications for the mobile device the subscriber account of the user will be updated to reflect the registration of the additional alert notifications. In some cases the user may be informed when attempting to register an alert event that is already registered. Alternatively or additionally duplicate requests for an alert event may be ignored by the network based system .

After alert notifications have been sent by the network based system the EventIDs for such events may be removed from the subscriber account of the user and or the subscriber database . Alternatively or additionally the subscriber account of the user may be updated to store copies of alert notifications which have been sent such as in a message folder or inbox of the user.

In various embodiments the subscriber database may be implemented as a relational database including a number of tables for storing records that are linked by indices and keys. The tables in turn may be utilized by and support various services provided by the application servers including the account server the listing catalog server and the notification server . The database structure implemented by the subscriber database may comprise for example a user table for subscriber account records an alert event table linked to the user table for registered alert events an alerts table linked to the alert event table for alert notifications and or other tables in accordance with the described embodiments.

The user table may include for example a UserID primary key field for uniquely identifying a user and fields for username mobile telephone number e.g. MSISDN OperatorID status messages received this month total messages received and date created. The alert event table may include for example an AlertEventID primary key field to uniquely identify a registered alert event a UserID foreign key field to link to the user table and fields for EventID processed status template used parent genre category and date created. The alert table may include for example an AlertID primary key to uniquely identify an alert notification an AlertEventID foreign key field to link to the alert event table and fields for message status date created processing start processing finish transaction identifier processing server and number of retries.

It can be appreciated that while information for the selected alert events may be stored in the subscriber database and or a subscriber account of the user the embodiments are not limited in this context. For example information for the selected alert events may be stored separately from the subscriber account of the user and or in various other storage locations within the network based system such as within the account server the notification server or a separate database directory or file system configured to store user information and event information for the alert events .

In periodic and or configurable intervals the notification server may send a query to the listing catalog server for requesting event information for upcoming events. The query received by the listing catalog server may comprise for example a search query web query web feed request e.g. RSS feed request ATOM feed request API request HTTP request and or suitable request mechanism in accordance with the described embodiments.

The listing catalog server may be arranged to receive and respond to the query with a response including the requested event information for the upcoming events. In some embodiments the response provided by the listing catalog server may include event information delivered via a web feed or other suitable delivery mechanism. While the event information may be received by the notification server via a request response mechanism it can be appreciated that alternatively and or additionally the listing catalog server may periodically push event information to the notification server in some implementations.

In various embodiments the query may comprise starting and ending date parameters to limit the response to event information for upcoming events occurring within a particular date range. In some cases for example the response to the query may include event information for all active events occurring within the next seven days for which tickets are available.

The response may comprise an event identifier for each upcoming event occurring within the date range as well as a variety of other event information parameters to provide details of the upcoming events. Exemplary event information parameters that may be included in the response are described below in the following table.

It can be appreciated that in some implementations not all of the event information parameters included in the table may be necessary to provide alert notifications. Accordingly when all of the event information parameters are included in the response the notification server may parse the response and extract only those event information parameters that are needed. In the table above for example fields with a gray background may be parsed and discarded from the response . After parsing the response the notification server may store the parsed version of the event information. Alternatively the query and or the response may be configured to request and respond with only those event information parameters necessary to provide alert notifications. It also can be appreciated that the response may include different event information parameters and or additional event information parameters that described in the table.

The notification server may store the some or all of the event information received in the response and then process the event information in periodic and or configurable intervals. In some implementations the notification server may update the stored event information with new event information received via subsequent communications from the listing catalog server . For example the stored event information may be updated to include additional upcoming events or to reflect event details that have changed.

In various embodiments the notification server may automatically process the event information by determining whether an active event identified in the response occurs within a certain time threshold. For example the notification server may determine whether the difference between the current time and the starting time is less than the threshold amount of time for each active event. It can be appreciated that the time threshold can be configured to schedule and control a default amount of time when alert notifications for upcoming events are sent such a certain number of hours e.g. 72 hours before the event takes place.

After determining that an active event is occurring within the time threshold the notification server may communicate with the subscriber database for performing alert processing and generation . In various implementations the alert processing and generation may involve determining whether any user has registered to receive an alert notification for an upcoming event occurring within the time threshold. For example the notification server may check the EventID for the upcoming event against EventIDs of all alert events including the selected alert events registered by users and stored in the subscriber database .

The alert processing and generation also may involve determining whether an alert notification for an upcoming event has already been processed and or sent to the user. For example when the EventID for the upcoming event matches an EventID of an alert event registered by a user the notification server may determine whether an alert notification for the upcoming event has already been processed for the user. If an alert notification has been sent to the user further processing may be discontinued in some implementations. In other implementations the notification server may determine whether a subsequent notification alert is to be sent. For example if an alert notification was sent previously via an e mail message a subsequent alert notification may be sent via an SMS message. A subsequent alert notification of the same type also may be sent to the user as a reminder. In such cases however the subsequent alert notification may be tailored as a reminder message or to include different content than the prior alert notification.

If an alert notification has not been processed for an upcoming event having an EventID matching an EventID associated with the user and or a subsequent alert notification is to be sent further alert processing and generation is performed. In various implementations the notification server may determine whether the user has specified alert conditions for generating an alert notification and if so whether the event information of the upcoming event satisfies such alert conditions. For example if the minimum price of available tickets is not within a price range specified by the user and or the number of tickets available is lower than the number of tickets requested by the user an alert notification will not be generated.

In some cases the notification server also may determine if a user has already purchased tickets for the upcoming event and if so how many and when the tickets were purchased. It also may be determined whether the purchase of such tickets occurred prior to or after the user registered to receive an alert notification for the upcoming event. If it is determined that a user registered to receive an alert notification for the upcoming event after making a purchase an alert notification for the event will be sent. An alert notification also will be if the user registered to receive an alert notification for a number of tickets greater than the number of tickets already purchased by the user. If the notification server determines conclusively that a user has already purchased the tickets for which the user registered the alert notification the notification server may discontinue further processing or may send an alert notification tailored for such case. For example the alert notification may include content recognizing the fact that the user has purchased tickets e.g. Thank you message Have a Good Time message and informing the user that more tickets are available.

Once it is determined that an alert notification is to be generated and sent to a particular user the notification server may retrieve user information e.g. mobile telephone number of the mobile device and event information e.g. static or dynamic content for generating the alert notification . In various embodiments the content of the alert notification may be configured automatically by the notification server and or by an administrator of the network based system .

In some implementations for example the alert notification may be generated using a predefined alert notification template. The alert notification template may be selected for example according to an event category e.g. sports concerts theater linked to a registered alert event e.g. category field in alert event table and or an upcoming event e.g. category parameter . The templates may be stored in a table that includes for example a TemplateID primary key field to uniquely identify the alert notification template and fields for title text category and target split. When the alert notification is generated a TemplateID matched to a particular category may be selected. To improve marketing efforts a particular category may be associated with a plurality of TemplateIDs. Each template in turn may be used for a certain percentage of a target group. A history of all templates may be maintained and processed alert notifications may be associated with a TemplateID. By tracking which templates ultimately result in ticket purchases the content and or selection of templates may be modified and or optimized to increase sales.

In various embodiments the templates for alert notifications can be created managed and or modified by an administrator of the network based system . For example an administrator may view a list of categories the number of alert events associated with each category and the number of alert notifications that have been sent for each category. By selecting a particular category the administrator can create view and or modify the alert notification templates associated with the particular category and can preview alert notifications to be sent to users. Each alert notification template may comprise for example static text and placeholders e.g. fields for embedding dynamic values when generating alert notifications.

When the alert notification is generated dynamic event information for the upcoming event may be retrieved and embedded into the alert notification . The dynamic event information may comprise for example event description date and time of the event location of the event e.g. city or venue current number of available tickets event criteria or alert conditions specified by the user and or any other type of relevant or related dynamic content in accordance with the described embodiments.

It can be appreciated that the amount of content contained in the alert notification may depend on the type of message to be communicated. For example SMS messages generally may include only up to 160 characters including spaces. For messages types without such size limitations alert notifications can include a variety of dynamic content including multimedia objects e.g. images video sounds music advertisements static or interactive maps e.g. city map showing event venues or pick up locations event venue seat map delivery options and or other relevant or related content.

In accordance with various embodiments the alert notification may be sent by the notification server to the mobile device of the user. In one of such embodiments for example the alert notification may comprise a text message e.g. SMS text message to be communicated to the mobile device over a mobile telephone network via a messaging interface provided by the messaging sever . In some implementations the alert notification may be forwarded to the mobile device via an intermediary such as a message aggregator e.g. SMS aggregator mobile transaction network entity and so forth. In such cases the notification server may maintain an open connection to the intermediary for the runtime of the alert processing process alert notifications in bulk and receive status updates from the intermediary for determining whether the alert notification has been successfully processed is in process or has failed.

The alert notification may comprise a text message including static and or dynamic event information for the upcoming event and a hyperlink for allowing the user to transact a mobile purchase. The hyperlink may comprise for example a hyperlinked telephone number for allowing the user to place a telephone call to an agent of the network based system for transacting a mobile purchase. The agent of the network based system may be a customer service representative and or an IVR system. By communicating with the agent the user may order and purchase tickets for the upcoming event identified by the alert notification . In some cases the user also may inquire as to the availability of additional tickets and or different tickets than those identified by the alert notification . For example if the alert notification was associated with an alert condition such as a specified number of tickets e.g. 2 tickets price range e.g. below 25 and or date range e.g. this week the user may ask for details regarding additional tickets better tickets or tickets to a similar event e.g. different game of the same series and may purchase such tickets in addition to and or instead of those identified by the alert notification .

Alternatively or additionally the hyperlink included in the text message may comprise a URL or URI for navigating to the network based system for transacting the mobile purchase. By clicking on the hyperlink the user may be directed to a web interface the network based system and display a webpage using the mobile device . In various implications the content of the webpage displayed by the user may be configured by the network based system in accordance with the web browsing capabilities of the mobile device

The web page displayed by the mobile device in response to clicking the URL or URI may comprise for example event information for the upcoming event identified by the alert notification such as the name of the event the date and time of the event the event venue event listings including ticket attributes e.g. section row quantity price a link to purchase electronic tickets and or a link to view additional details. By clicking the link to purchase electronic tickets the user may initiate a purchase and receive the electronic tickets at the mobile device and or the PC for printing. By clicking the link to view additional details a subsequent web page may be displayed by the mobile device including ticket attributes along with further ticket details e.g. seat numbers time remaining to purchase the tickets seller comments delivery options a selectively enlargeable image of the event venue for reviewing the location of the seats and an action button for initiating purchase of the tickets. In some cases one or more of the web pages displayed by the mobile device may include a link to view delivery options such as a location of driving or walking directions to and or a map showing a pick up location.

As described above the network based system may communicate with users over one or more types of networks via interfaces provided the communications servers and provide various services to users such as online marketplace and ticket fulfillment services via the application servers and databases . When servicing a user the network based system may present information to and or receive information from the user in a variety of ways such by displaying and receiving information via GUIs e.g. web pages interactive screens sending and receiving messages e.g. e mail IM SMS MMS video message placing and or receiving telephone calls e.g. landline mobile VoIP IVR calls and so forth.

As shown the web page comprises an alert preferences area including checkboxes for allowing the user to subscribe to receive one or more types of alert notifications for events teams artists and or venues. The web page also comprises a search engine interface including pull down menus for selecting event criteria such as location category date range number of tickets and price range. By conducting a search the user may be presented with event listings that satisfy the selected search criteria and request to receive alert notifications by selecting one or more upcoming events from the event listings and adding the selected events as alert events. In this exemplary representation the user has subscribed to receive e mail alerts and SMS text message alerts for events. When adding an event from the event listings the user may select to receive an e mail alert and or an SMS text message alert for the added event.

As shown the text message comprises an SMS text message communicated over a mobile telephone network and associated with a common short code number of the network based system .
