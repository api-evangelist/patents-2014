Unless otherwise indicated herein the materials described in this section are not prior art to the claims in this application and are not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.

Portable computing devices such as personal computers laptop computers tablet computers smart phones wearable computers and countless types of Internet capable devices are prevalent in numerous aspects of modern life. For example it is common for a single consumer to operate a smartphone a laptop computer a keyboard and a mouse possibly simultaneously. With an increasing number of consumers operating multiple portable devices the demand for wireless technology continues to play a role in the use of such portable devices. As such various forms of wireless technology have evolved to locally connect these portable devices for numerous applications. One wireless technology standard for exchanging data between multiple portable devices is popularly known as Bluetooth.

Bluetooth is commonly used to wirelessly connect a portable device with one or more other portable devices over a short range. For example Bluetooth may be used to connect a cell phone to a wireless headset possibly allowing for hands free use of the phone. In some instances Bluetooth may also be used to connect the cell phone to the audio speakers and a microphone of a motor vehicle possibly allowing for hands free use of the phone while operating the vehicle. Thus numerous applications have allowed Bluetooth to grow as the standard wire replacement protocol. In multiple applications Bluetooth remains particularly attractive due to its low cost solutions and protocols designed for low power consumption.

Example embodiments herein disclose methods computing devices and computer readable media capable of creating virtual Bluetooth controller VBC interfaces for a number of applications of a Bluetooth device.

In addition the system may include means for transmitting via a radio associated with the Bluetooth device the one or more advertising packets for the number of VBC interfaces.

These as well as other aspects advantages and alternatives will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art by reading the following detailed description with reference where appropriate to the accompanying figures.

The following detailed description describes various features and functions of the disclosed methods computing devices and systems with reference to the accompanying figures. In the figures similar symbols identify similar components unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative methods computing devices and systems embodiments described herein are not meant to be limiting. It may be readily understood that certain aspects of the disclosed methods computing devices and systems can be arranged and combined in a wide variety of different configurations all of which are contemplated herein.

As noted Bluetooth continues to grow as a wire replacement protocol and remains particularly attractive due to its protocols designed for low power consumption. In particular Bluetooth Low Energy BLE provides protocols for low power devices to communicate with multiple other computing devices. For example consider a smartwatch that can be powered by one or more coin cell batteries. Further consider that the smartwatch utilizes BLE s protocols for communicating with other computing devices such as a wireless headset. For example a music playing application on the smartwatch may stream music to the wireless headset. In particular BLE s protocols may include a BLE advertising protocol possibly referred to herein as an advertising protocol . As such the smartwatch may advertise or announce its presence to other computing devices such as the wireless headset. Further the smartwatch may pair or connect with the wireless headset for streaming music to the wireless headset. As such advertising protocols may be designed to allow the smartwatch to pair with the wireless headset while maintaining the smartwatch s low power consumption.

There are several other advantages to BLE s advertising protocols. For example considering the scenario above the smartwatch may pair with the wireless headset faster using advertising protocols than by using other protocols. In particular advertising protocols may be fixed to three channels of the 802.11 frequency range e.g. the 2.4 GHz frequency range. Thus without scanning the entire 2.4 GHz frequency range the wireless headset may receive advertising packets from the smartwatch over the three fixed channels. In particular the wireless headset may receive BLE advertising packets faster.

Yet one of the challenges of using advertising protocols is related to possible limitations of the advertising packets. For example consider another scenario in which the smartwatch has both a music playing application and a keyboard application. The keyboard application may allow a user to type words into a wireless keyboard such that the typed words may appear on the display of the smartwatch possibly for typing notes. In such instances the smartwatch may attempt to send a single advertising packet to both the wireless headset and a wireless keyboard possibly for advertising the music playing application and the keyboard application respectively. Yet the advertising packet may have a data limitation of 31 bytes and therefor the packet may have limited space for data in the advertising packet. As such the packet may be limited to advertising for just one application either the music playing application or the keyboard application.

Another challenge may be related to the smartwatch having a single Bluetooth controller with a single Bluetooth static random BSR address for sending advertising packets. For example considering the scenario above the smartwatch may send a first advertising packet to advertise for the music playing application and a second advertising packet to advertise for the keyboard application. Since the single controller of the smartwatch may be limited to a single BSR address the smartwatch may encounter additional difficulties when attempting to pair the smartwatch to both the wireless headset and the wireless keyboard.

In particular once the wireless headset receives the first advertising packet the smartwatch may begin the pairing process with the wireless headset using the single BSR address. Further once the portable keyboard receives the second advertising packet the smartwatch may begin the pairing process with the wireless keyboard also using the single BSR address. Thus since the smartwatch may attempt to pair with both the wireless headset and the wireless keyboard using the same BSR address the smartwatch may encounter difficulties in differentiating the data from the wireless headset and the data from the wireless keyboard.

Example embodiments herein disclose methods for creating virtual Bluetooth controller VBC interfaces for a number of applications of a Bluetooth device. For example by creating a VBC interface for each application an advertising packet may be transmitted for each application of the Bluetooth device. As such multiple advertising packets may be transmitted by the applications to pair the Bluetooth device with multiple other computing devices. For example a single advertising device e.g. the smartwatch may send multiple advertising packets for a number of applications e.g. the music playing application and the keyboard application.

Further each of the VBC interfaces may enable the smartwatch to send advertising packets where each advertisement packet may be assigned a unique BSR address. Thus the listening devices e.g. the wireless headset and the portable keyboard may perceive each advertising packet as being sent from a different advertising device. As such the smartwatch may advertise and pair with multiple listening devices. Thus the smartwatch may enable both the music playing application for streaming music the keyboard application for typing information into the smartwatch as well as other applications on the smartwatch in additional contexts.

Further as shown in computing device may pair or connect with a number of other computing devices. For example computing device may pair or connect to computing device through connection . Further computing device may also pair or connect with computing device through connection . Yet further computing may also pair or connect with computing device through connection .

Further application may be a presentation application a word application and or a spreadsheet application for sending information from computing device to computing device possibly for modifying the information using the graphical user interface GUI of computing device and or the pointing device illustrated with computing device . Yet further application may be a smart phone application for transmitting phone data between computing device and computing device .

Data storage in turn may comprise volatile and or non volatile data storage and can be integrated in whole or in part with processor . Data storage can hold program instructions executable by processor and data that may be manipulated by these instructions to carry out the various methods processes or functions described herein. Alternatively these methods processes or functions can be defined by hardware firmware and or any combination of hardware firmware and software. By way of example the data in data storage may contain program instructions perhaps stored on a non transitory computer readable medium executable by processor to carry out any of the methods processes or functions disclosed in this specification or the accompanying drawings.

Network interface may take the form of a wireless connection such as BLUETOOTH . In particular network interface may enable one or more Bluetooth standards or protocols including BLE protocols and related advertising protocols. Further network interface may include a radio for transmitting advertising packets to other computing devices. For example referring back to computing device may also include a network interface such as network interface to pair with computing devices and . In addition network interface may take the form of other wireless connections such as IEEE 802.11 Wi Fi or a wide area wireless connection. Further other forms of physical layer connections and other types of standard or proprietary communication protocols may be used over network interface . Yet further network interface may comprise multiple physical interfaces. Further network interface may take the form of a wireline connection such as an Ethernet connection.

Input output function may facilitate user interaction with computing device . Input output function may comprise multiple types of input devices such as a keyboard a mouse a touch screen and so on. Similarly input output function may comprise of multiple types of output devices such as a screen monitor printer or one or more light emitting diodes LEDs .

In some embodiments the computing device may include a device platform or operating system not shown . In some instances the device platform and or the operating system may be compatible with Bluetooth protocols Bluetooth Low Energy BLE protocols and or BLE advertising protocols. In some instances the device platform and or the operating system may be configured as a multi layered Linux platform or operating system. The device platform may include different applications and an application framework as well as various kernels libraries and runtime entities. In other examples other formats or systems may operate the computing device as well.

In some embodiments one or more computing devices may be deployed in a networked architecture possibly as illustrated in . The exact physical location connectivity and configuration of the computing devices may be unknown and or unimportant to other computing devices. Accordingly the computing devices in may be referred to as cloud based devices that may be housed at various remote locations.

For example server devices may be configured to perform various computing tasks of computing device . Thus computing tasks can be distributed among one or more of server devices . To the extent that these computing tasks can be performed in parallel such a distribution of tasks may reduce the total time to complete these tasks and return a result.

Cluster data storage may be data storage arrays that include disk array controllers configured to manage read and write access to groups of hard disk drives. The disk array controllers alone or in conjunction with server devices may also be configured to manage backup or redundant copies of the data stored in cluster data storage to protect against disk drive failures or other types of failures that prevent one or more of server devices from accessing units of cluster data storage .

Cluster routers may include networking equipment configured to provide internal and external communications for the server clusters. For example cluster routers may include one or more packet switching and or routing devices configured to provide i network communications between server devices and cluster data storage via cluster network and or ii network communications between the server cluster and other devices via communication link to network .

Additionally the configuration of cluster routers can be based at least in part on the data communication requirements of server devices and cluster data storage the latency and throughput of the local cluster networks the latency throughput and cost of communication link and or other factors that may contribute to the cost speed fault tolerance resiliency efficiency and or other design goals of the system architecture.

In this example Bluetooth device includes application manager host stack controller and radio . In particular application manager may be coupled to host stack by system bus or a similar mechanism. Further host stack may be coupled to controller by system bus or a similar mechanism. Yet further controller may be coupled to radio by system bus or similar mechanism.

Controller may include a physical Bluetooth controller interface. Further the physical Bluetooth controller interface may correspond to physical Bluetooth static random BSR address A possibly for transmitting an advertising packet for an application downloaded on the Bluetooth device . For example referring back to the scenarios above consider that Bluetooth device is incorporated with the smartwatch. As such the music playing application may be downloaded to Bluetooth device . Further controller may correspond to BSR address A for transmitting an advertising packet for the music playing application.

In some embodiments BSR address A may be 48 bit randomly generated addresses. For example BSR address A may meet a number of requirements. For example the two most significant bits of the BSR address may be equal to 1 . Further bits of the random part of the BSR address may or may not be equal to 1 . In addition bits of the random part of the BSR address may or may not be equal to 0 .

Bluetooth device may operate in different modes depending on the functionality. In some instances the functionality of Bluetooth device may be controlled by a user of Bluetooth device . Considering the scenarios above the user may provide an input to computing device possibly the smartwatch that may be combined with Bluetooth device . In particular the user may provide an input to input output function possibly a graphical user interface GUI to initiate the music playing application and stream music to a wireless headset. As such the operating modes of Bluetooth may include an advertising mode among other possible modes.

In some embodiments the advertising mode involves Bluetooth device transmitting advertising packets. In some instances such advertising packets may be received by one or more listening devices. Further such listening devices may receive the advertising packets and request more information from Bluetooth device . As such Bluetooth device may respond with more information upon such requests from these listening devices. In addition Bluetooth may have other modes such as a scanning mode a master device mode and a slave device mode. In some embodiments the scanner mode involves other devices listening for advertising packets transmitted by other devices.

In some embodiments the Bluetooth device may be in advertisement mode to establish a connection with another computing device. For example referring again to the scenarios above consider that Bluetooth device is combined with the smartwatch. As such the wireless headset may scan for advertising packets sent by Bluetooth device . Upon receiving the advertising packet the wireless headset may send a pairing request to Bluetooth device . Once a connection is established for pairing the wireless headset with Bluetooth device the wireless headset may become the slave device and the Bluetooth device may become the master device.

Applications and may be downloaded on Bluetooth device and or on a computing device combined with Bluetooth device . In some instances applications and may for example take the form of any applications described above possibly in relation to . For example applications and may take the forms of applications and respectively as described above in relation to . Further applications and may exchange advertisement data with application manager through application interfaces and respectively. Further additional applications may attempt to exchange advertisement data with application manager as illustrated by the ellipses between applications and . Yet further applications and may communicate with application manager to exchange advertising packets with other devices not shown in .

In some embodiments Bluetooth device may enter advertisement mode to transmit one or more advertising packets over the air for applications and . As noted in relation to controller of may be assigned a single Bluetooth static address A for transmitting advertising packets to other computing devices. For example Bluetooth device may create advertising packet that includes BSR address A. As such advertising packet may be transmitted by radio possibly for a number of applications and . For example consider that application is a music playing application. In such instances advertisement packet may be transmitted to a wireless headset for pairing Bluetooth device with the wireless headset. As such music data from application may be streamed to the wireless headset.

In addition PDU may include header and advertisement payload with approximately 6 to 37 bytes. Further advertisement payload may include header MAC address and advertising data with approximately up to 31 bytes. As noted in the scenarios above this 31 byte space may limit the quantity or amount of advertisement data that may be transmitted for applications and . For example in some instances computing device may transmit a single advertising packet for possibly one or two of applications and possibly due to the 31 byte limitation. In particular the 31 byte space may provide enough space for the advertising data of applications and but possibly not application . Yet in some instances additional applications may be present as illustrated by the ellipses between applications and in . As such additional applications may encounter delays to transmit advertisement data due to the 31 byte space limitation.

In some instances the single BSR address A of Bluetooth device may also limit the advertisement data that may be transmitted for applications and . For example consider that application may be a music playing application. As such Bluetooth device may send advertising packet with the BSR address A possibly to pair with a wireless headset and stream music to the wireless headset. Yet Bluetooth device may send a second advertising packet not shown in with the same BSR address A to pair with a wireless keyboard. As such since the same BSR address A may be used in both pairing processes with the wireless headset and the wireless keyboard the Bluetooth device may be unable to differentiate data between the two pairing processes.

Further for example the wireless headset may receive both the first and second advertising packets possibly disrupting a pairing process for the wireless headset. In particular the wireless headset may receive the first and second advertisement packets such that each packet corresponds to the same BSR address A. As such in some instances the wireless headset may begin pairing with Bluetooth device in response to the first advertisement. Further the wireless headset may receive the second advertisement packet that may disrupt the pairing process initiated by the first advertisement packet.

As such host stack may save this number as max advertiser . Further Bluetooth device may initialize a variable advertiser count to compare with the max advertiser. Yet further the number of applications and may be represented in advertiser count and compared with max advertiser.

Since advertiser count is less than max advertiser additional VBC interfaces may be created for advertising packets.

In some embodiments one or more requests by the applications to transmit advertising packets may be granted. For example Bluetooth device may grant a request from at least one of applications and to advertise information. Thus Bluetooth device may increment or add one to the advertiser count. Further in instances where advertiser count is less than the max advertiser Bluetooth device may continue granting additional requests from applications and among other applications. In some instances advertiser count may reach the number represented as the max advertiser. In such instances Bluetooth device may reject additional requests for BluetoothLeAdvertiser instances.
