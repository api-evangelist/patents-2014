This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 864 478 filed Aug. 9 2013 entitled SLOTS GAME WITH IMPROVING BONUS WINNING ODDS U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 917 871 filed Dec. 18 2013 entitled CHALLENGING PLAYERS IN ONLINE GAME TO COMPETE IN MODULAR GAME and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 917 874 filed Dec. 18 2013 entitled SLOTS GAME WITH IMPROVING BONUS WINNING ODDS all of which are herein incorporated by reference.

This application is related by subject matter to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 253 777 filed Apr. 15 2014 entitled Challenging Players in Online Game to Compete in Modular Game which is incorporated herein by reference.

The present embodiments relate to methods for improving game interactions and more particularly methods systems and computer programs for challenging other players in a game.

The popularity of casino games has extended to casino games played online. Online games such as poker slots blackjack etc. are played by a large number of users on a computer. However most of the slot games in the market are very similar to the real life slot games that have been around for a long time and the online slot games merely seem to copy the user interface provided by the real slot machines without adding much to the online experience. Because of this differentiation between game providers is very small.

Additionally social interaction in online games is appealing to many users that wish to share some of their gaming experience with other friends or other potential friends that may be made online. But existing slots online games do not currently provide many opportunities for social interaction with other players nor they provide gaming interactions with other players as the game of one slots player does not relate to the game of other slots players.

Methods devices systems and computer programs are presented for executing an online game. It should be appreciated that the present embodiments can be implemented in numerous ways such as a method an apparatus a system a device or a computer program on a computer readable medium. Several embodiments are described below.

While playing a slots game users have a chance to win a bonus game also referred to herein as a minigame or a modular game. The bonus game provides additional variety to the slots game and users look forward to entering bonus games. The bonus games may include other types of slots games with different wheels or with different wheels or may also include other types of games such as selecting objects from a plurality of objects where each object has an associated reward or games of skill e.g. memory challenge trivia game etc.

In one embodiment the odds winning the bonus game may be improved if a player does not win the bonus game for a predetermined number of spins. In this case the player is changed to a different tier where the odds of winning the bonus game are increased. In another embodiment the expected payback from the bonus may also change as the player changes tiers.

In one embodiment a method includes an operation for providing an interface to a first player for challenging a second player to compete in the modular game after detecting completion of the modular game by the first player. The modular game is played within an online game. Further the method includes operations for sending a challenge to the second player and for detecting that the second player completed the modular game in response to the challenge. The first player is rewarded a challenge award if the first player obtained a higher score than the second player in the modular game. In another embodiment the operations of the method are executed by a processor.

In another embodiment a method includes an operation for notifying a second player that a challenge has been received from a first player to compete in a modular game. In addition the method includes operations for detecting an acceptance by the second player to play the modular game in response to the challenge and for providing the modular game to the second player in response to the acceptance. The second player is awarded a challenge award if the second player obtained a higher score than the first player in the modular game. Further the method includes an operation for notifying the first player that the second player completed the challenge.

In yet another embodiment the method includes an operation for providing a modular game to a first player after the first player wins a bonus to play the modular game where the first player wins the bonus during play of a slots game. The method further includes an operation for providing after completion of the modular game by the first player an interface to the first player for challenging a second player to compete in the modular game. A challenge is sent to the second player to play the modular game within the slots game. Additionally the method includes operations for detecting that the second player completed the modular game in response to the challenge and for awarding the first player a challenge award if the first player obtained a higher score than the second player in the modular game.

In one embodiment a method includes an operation for receiving user input during a session of an online slots game the user input defined to spin wheels of the online slots game. In addition the method includes an operation for defining an initial tier and one or more additional tiers for play of the online slots game during the session each tier being assigned an odds value that changes with each assigned tier and each tier being defined to have a set of spins. The method further includes operations for assigning tiers with changed odds when an option to play a bonus game is not presented during the set of spins for each tier and for assigning the initial tier upon determining that the bonus game was played during the session. In one embodiment the operations of the method are executed by a processor.

In another embodiment a method includes operations for initializing a spin counter in a slots game and for setting a first tier from a plurality of tiers as a current tier to play the slots game. Each tier from the plurality of tiers defines a bonus winning odds an average reward and a spin count where the bonus winning odds identifies a probability of winning a chance to play a bonus game. In addition the method includes an operation for setting a second tier as the current tier when the spin counter reaches the spin count of the first tier. The second tier defines higher bonus winning odds than the first tier and the second tier has a lower average reward than the first tier to keep an expected payback for winning the bonus game constant across all tiers. Further the method includes operations for setting a third tier as the current tier when the spin counter reaches the spin count of the second tier and for providing an interface to play the bonus game when a player wins the chance to play the bonus game. After the player plays the bonus game the spin counter is reinitialized and the first tier is set as the current tier. In one embodiment the operations of the method are executed by a processor.

In yet another embodiment a non transitory computer readable storage medium stores a computer program and the computer readable storage medium includes program instructions for receiving user input during a session of an online slots game the user input defined to spin wheels of the online slots game. Further the storage medium includes program instructions for defining an initial tier and one or more additional tiers for play of the online slots game during the session. Each tier is assigned an odds value that changes with each assigned tier and each tier is defined to have a set of spins. The storage medium further includes program instructions for assigning tiers with changed odds when an option to play a bonus game is not presented during the set of spins for each tier and program instructions for assigning the initial tier upon determining that the bonus game was played during the session.

Other aspects will become apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

The following embodiments describe methods devices systems and computer programs for playing casino games more specifically for playing an online slots game.

It will be apparent that the present embodiments may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances well known process operations have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present embodiments.

In one embodiment there is a plurality of slots games associated with the interactive game. The interface provides for a lobby like access page where the user may select from a plurality of different slots games having different themes. For example the themes may be from a popular TV show a popular movie nature a children story etc.

In addition each slots game provides the opportunity to the player to win a bonus game which is also referred to as a minigame a module a modular game or a supplemental game. When the player wins the bonus the player enters the modular game and upon completion of the modular game the player is rewarded with some asset which is referred to herein as modular game bonus or minigame bonus. Of course the reward may be zero if the player loses in the modular game. In other embodiments the player always gets some reward at the end of the modular game.

In one embodiment the modular game is played within the online game and the right to play the modular game is won by achieving a requirement in the online game. For example in a slots game the player wins the right to play the modular game when a certain combination of symbols comes up in the slot wheels.

Further in one embodiment the initial state of the modular game is independent of a state of progress in the online game which means that the modular game is initiated always from the same state. This means that when a player challenges another player to play the modular game the second player will play the same game although it may vary due to a randomness factor included in a game of chance. However even when chance is part of the modular game the odds of winning the modular game are always the same so when multiple players play the modular game the odds for winning are the same.

In one embodiment the modular game is a game that is played with similar conditions e.g. odds of winning starting position difficulty level etc. for each of the player that plays the modular game. Therefore when a player challenges another player the odds of winning are fair because both players have the same odds. This is different than other competition games where players take turns playing the game. For example two players playing a chess game will alternate playing but this is not considered a challenge because every time that a player takes a turn the position of the board is different therefore the odds of winning and the structure of the game at a given turn are different. In a challenge game the initial state and the odds of winning are the same for both players.

However chess can also be used as a modular game to challenge another player if both players are given the same scenario. For example a challenge game may include a chess problem that includes a chess board and a question such as White moves and mates in three moves. The amount of time required to solve the chess problem is measured and the player that solves the problem in the least amount of time would be the winner of the challenge.

The minigame accessed when winning the bonus is a modular game which is different from the slots game played by the user for a limited amount of time or for a limited number of player actions e.g. spin the wheels five times . Typically the player exits the slots game plays the minigame and then returns back to the slots game. Some minigames require the player to select objects and each object provides a mystery reward. Other minigames require spinning different set of wheels etc. In general users get excited to play the bonus game because the expected payback for playing the minigame is higher than the payback for playing the regular slots game. Some embodiments of minigames are described in more detail below with reference to A C and A N. Further some users enjoy playing minigames because it gives the users a chance to challenge other players.

In one embodiment each slots game provides minigames that are exclusive to the slots game but in other embodiments one or more of the minigames may be accessed from two or more of the slots games.

The interactive online game logic interfaces with one or more social networks to gather relationship information for the players of the online game. In addition the interactive online game logic may also have its own information regarding relationships established within the game for the players. Therefore the first player may have a second player as a friend where the second player is a friend in the social network of the first player and the first player may have a third player as a friend where the first player and the third player are not related in the social network.

A bonus winning logic component manages the logic behind bonus game rewards. The bonus winning logic component manages the odds of winning the bonus the paybacks for winning the bonus as well as which type of minigame is played when the bonus is won.

In one embodiment the bonus winning logic includes playing the slots game using different tiers at different times where the different tiers provide different odds of winning the bonus in the slots game. More details are provided below regarding the use of tiers in .

The payback control logic manages the average payback over time to the player when playing the online game. In one embodiment the payback on the game is measured as the ratio of the cost of one bet to the expected return on one bet.

In one embodiment the player gets paid when winning on the slots game or when winning in the bonus game or when winning a challenge game. The payback control logic manages the paybacks in both aspects of the game in order to keep the payback at a desired level. For example in one embodiment the payback is kept at an average of 95 ratio. This means that over a long period of time the player will get back about 95 of the money that the player has bet. In other embodiments different paybacks are possible such as paybacks in the range of 80 to 100 although other values are also possible. For example in one embodiment the payback may be over 100 if the players play with virtual money and the game is sponsored by a commercial entity which allows the player to exchange the virtual winnings for some promotional materials.

The game illustrated in includes five different wheels also referred to as reels and each reel at the end of each spin shows three symbols. In other words there are three rows of symbols top middle and bottom rows. Sometimes an icon may occupy more than one row such as the icon on the right wheel of . This icon is a large wild icon which is interpreted as having a wild icon in the top row a wild icon in the middle row and a wild icon in the bottom row.

The game provides a chance to win a bonus game when a predetermined combination comes up. In the exemplary embodiment of the winning combination consists of the icon Bonus appearing in the center row in wheels and . As used herein the wheels are numbered from to going from left to right. In other embodiments other combinations or other icons may be used to obtain the bonus. In yet other embodiment there could be a plurality of different bonuses and different combinations may be utilized to win one bonus from the plurality of different bonuses.

Embodiments presented herein provide methods for managing the frequency and payback of bonus games. Due to the excitement created when a user wins the bonus having slots game that provide bonus games more often enhances user enjoyment of the game. However since bonus games usually result in high paybacks it is necessary to manage the frequency and payback of bonus games in order to keep the overall payback for the slots game at a desired level.

In one embodiment players can send gifts to friends in the online game as illustrated in . The player may define friends in the online game or friend information may be obtained from a social network with the permission of the player. When the player selects the send gifts option the interface allows the player to select one or more friends from all the friends defined in the social network or in the game tab All Friends or to select friends defined in the game tab Game Friends etc.

As the player advances in the High Roller program the player is given new status badges showing progress. In addition the program may provide additional gifts and benefits to the player rewarding the player for playing the slots game.

It is noted that the embodiments illustrated in are exemplary. Other embodiments may utilize different number of wheels different number of rows visible on the slots game providing different rewards utilize a plurality of virtual currencies utilize real money etc. The embodiments illustrated in should therefore not be interpreted to be exclusive or limiting but rather exemplary or illustrative.

In one embodiment the slots game includes a plurality of tiers where each tier has different odds for winning the bonus game. In another embodiment each of the tiers has a different payback ratio but it s also possible to have the same payback ratio in each of the tiers.

In one embodiment the tiers are defined based on the number of times the player has spun the wheels in the slots game since the player started the session or since the player last won the bonus game. More details regarding tier definition are provided below with reference to .

In operation the player is playing the game in bonus tier . In one embodiment when the player starts playing the slots game the player starts playing in tier but in other embodiments the player may start playing the game in other tiers.

From operation the method flows to operation where a check is made to determine if the player has won the bonus while in tier . If the player has won the bonus while in tier the method flows to operation but if the player has not won the bonus in tier then the method flows to operation . For example the player may move to tier after spinning 15 times in tier without winning the bonus but other number of spins are also possible as well as some other condition to trigger the change to tier e.g. a special promotion presented by the game provider .

In operation the player plays the slots game with the functionality defined for tier . If the player has won the bonus while in tier in operation the method flows to operation and if the player has not won the bonus while in tier the player moves to operation to start playing the slots game in tier .

In one embodiment the slots game has three tiers but other games may have a different number of tiers. In the embodiment described in the slots game has three tiers therefore the player keeps playing in tier operation until the player wins the bonus unless the player quits the game before winning the bonus.

When the player wins the bonus in tier or in any other tier as described above the method flows to operation where the game checks for what type of bonus the player has won. In one embodiment the minigames associated with the bonus may be of different types and have different behaviors. In the embodiment of the bonus games are of three types common bonus gifting bonus and challenge bonus.

The common bonus game in one embodiment provides a minigame to the player after winning the bonus game. The minigame may be of any kind and be based on chance or skill e.g. a memory game . Therefore in operation the player plays the common bonus game collects a reward at the end of the bonus game in operation and then the method flows back to operation where the player continues playing the game in tier . In other words the spin counter that determines the tiers for the player is reset after winning the bonus.

The gifting bonus provides the player with the opportunity to win virtual currency using free spins on a slots game which may be the same or different wheels as in the base slots game. Therefore in operation the player uses the free spins to win currency and collects her winnings in operation . After completion of the gifting bonus the method flows back to operation to continue playing the main game in tier 1.

The challenge bonus provides a minigame that requires the user to make selections or to use some other skill. In some challenge games there is a skill component such as a challenge game based on memory. Therefore the result of the challenge bonus is variable. In one embodiment the results depend on which objects the user selects when given a plurality of options. More details on challenge games are given below with reference to and A N.

After playing the challenge game in operation the player collects the rewards from playing the minigame in operation and then the game asks the player if the player desires to challenge a friend see operation . If the player decides to challenge a friend the method flows to operation and if the player does not desire to challenge a friend the method flows to operation .

In operation the player selects one or more friends for the challenge. When a friend accepts the challenge the friends play the same challenge minigame as the player although the setup of the game may be different while keeping the winning odds the same. In one embodiment the player that gets the most points for playing the challenge game gets an additional reward e.g. 100 chips . Therefore the player is motivated to challenge friends because if the friends cannot beat the player the player will get additional chips. In another embodiment the player that challenges other players will always get a consolation reward every time a friend plays the challenge game.

From operation the method flows to operation where the challenge is sent to the selected one or more friends. After operation the method flows back to operation where the player resumes to play the slots game in tier mode.

In other embodiments the bonus game may be awarded after a predetermined number of spins. This way the player is guaranteed to play a bonus game at least every predetermined number of spins.

In another embodiment the number of spins between bonus games may be predetermined in advance. For example a list is defined where each member of the list identifies the number of spins of the wheels before playing the bonus game. If the list starts with the sequence 20 35 15 45 . . . after the player starts playing the slots the bonus game will be awarded after 20 spins then if the player continues playing another bonus game is awarded after an additional 35 spins a third bonus game after an additional 15 spins etc.

In yet another embodiment the tier may change at each spin. For example the tier assigned to each spin may be randomized whereas in each turn a tier number is assigned with its respective odds for winning the bonus game. This way the tier may change upwards or downwards during play.

In one embodiment the game keeps a spin counter which counts the number of spins of the wheel since the player started the game or since the player won the bonus game. That is the spin counter is initialized when the game starts and is reinitialized every time the player wins the bonus game.

If the player completes all the spins within a tier without winning the player is then taken to the next tier unless the player has reached the last tier . In the next tier the odds for winning the bonus are improved in one embodiment.

Initially the player has a first probability P of winning the bonus e.g. 1 60 . This probability P stays constant for a fixed number of spins N e.g. 15 unless the player wins the bonus. If the player has not won the bonus after N spins then the player is changed to a new tier and the odds are improved for the player to a new probability P e.g. 1 50 that is better than P.

In one embodiment the slots game has three tiers related to bonus rewards which are defined by the following table.

In one embodiment the online game includes a plurality of variables the spin count as described above the bonus playing tier the bonus winning odds and the bonus average payback. The bonus playing tier indicates the tier the player is currently in. The bonus winning odds indicate the probability of winning the bonus and the bonus average payback indicates the expected value of the payback to the user after playing the minigame.

In one embodiment the bonus average payback changes according to the tier. For example the bonus average payback may decrease as the player goes to higher tiers in order to keep the desired payback at the desired level.

In operation the variables identified above are reset. In one embodiment the spin count is set to 0 the bonus playing tier is set to 1 the bonus winning odds are set to 1 60 and the bonus average payback is set to 30 . However other values are also possible for initializing these variables. When the player starts playing the slots game the player starts in operation and after the player wins the bonus the player goes back to operation after playing the minigame.

From operation the method flows to operation where the spin counter is increased each time the player spins the wheels. From operation the method flows to operation where the game spins the wheels.

After spinning the wheels the method checks in operation if the player has won the bonus. If the player has won the bonus the method flows to operation and if the player has not won the bonus the method flows to operation .

In operation the game checks to see if the player has reached the last spin in the tier before the player is promoted to another tier. In other words the game checks to see if the spin count is equal to the number defined in the upper range of spins within the tier. Of course in the last tier the upper level is infinity because there are no more tiers to promote the player to.

From operation the method flows to operation if the player has reached the last spin in the tier and the method flows to operation otherwise. In operation the game changes tiers for the player. In one embodiment the tier count variable is incremented the bonus winning odds are changed in operation e.g. from 1 60 to 1 50 when going from tier to tier and the bonus average payback is also changed. In one embodiment the bonus average payback stays constant. From operation the method flows back to operation to continue playing the slots game.

In operation the game provides the minigame to the player and gives the player the reward obtained in the minigame. From operation the method flows to operation where the game is reset including resetting the variables defined above. For example the spin counter is reset to 0.

In one embodiment the game provider wishes to maintain a constant payback over time for players of the game. The payback for the game also referred to herein as global payback includes two factors the payback for playing the slots game slots payback and the payback for playing the bonus games bonus payback . payback slots payback bonus payback 1 

In one embodiment the game keeps both slots payback and bonus payback constant over time that is slots payback is constant and bonus payback is constant. For example a payback of 95 might be divided into 65 payback for playing slots and 30 playback for playing bonus games. For example in a 10 000 bet 6500 would be paid back on the base game and 3000 would be paid on the bonus game on average. However other values for global payback are also possible and different splits between slots and bonus paybacks are also possible.

The slots payback is controlled by managing the probabilities associated with the different winning combinations in the slots and their respective payouts. In one embodiment the slots payback is controlled by adjusting the number of symbols in each of the reels as well as the frequency of occurrence of the different symbols.

In a computer game the number of symbols in each reel is not limited physically as in the case of a real physical slots machine. For example a physical slots machine may have 22 different stops which may be weighted. However an electronic slots game may have reels with hundreds of stops. For example the number of stops in one reel may be 750 or in the range from 100 to 1000 although other values are also possible.

Managing the slots payback may not require adjustments because the slots payback is kept constant. However managing the winning combinations for the bonus games may require adjustments if the odds of winning the bonus changes as the player changes tiers.

In one embodiment the odds for winning the minigame are changed by increasing the number of bonus symbols in the reels. For example in a reel with 700 symbols the game may have a first number of bonus symbols in tier a different number of bonus symbols in tier and yet a different number of bonus symbols in tier . For example the game may start with 75 bonus symbols in the reel in tier increase the number to 175 in tier and increase the number to 350 symbols in tier .

In one embodiment to keep the bonus payback constant the expected bonus payback is adjusted to compensate for the increase in odds for winning the bonus game. The expected payback may be calculated as follows expected payback probability winning average reward 2 

Therefore if the probability of winning increases the size of the average win must decrease to keep the expected payback constant. For example the following table describes the average reward for the different tiers described above with reference to Table 1 for a one dollar bet.

In other embodiments the reward distribution may be performed differently across the different tiers. The example of Table 2 provides a constant payback within each tier. However other embodiments may provide different bonus paybacks in the different tiers but the overall bonus payback when considering all the tiers is kept in the desired level e.g. 30 .

It is noted that the embodiments illustrated in are exemplary. Other embodiments may utilize different number of tiers different probabilities different expected paybacks etc. The embodiments illustrated in should therefore not be interpreted to be exclusive or limiting but rather exemplary or illustrative.

In operation the player is playing an online game e.g. a slots game . Embodiments presented herein are described with reference to a slots game but the same principles may be utilized for other online games or other computer games.

When the player wins the chance to play the modular game the method flows to operation where the player is able to play the modular game. As a result of playing the modular game the player will receive a score. The score indicates the degree of success obtained by the player in the modular game. For example the score of the module game may be one of a raw score number obtained in the game a number of coins collected a time spent to complete a task distance traveled enemies defeated etc.

In addition in one embodiment the player is given other options to get the chance to play the modular game and challenge other players. For example the player may be able to buy challenges using virtual currency or real currency or the player may win the opportunity to challenge as an incentive for making a purchase in the online game or for reaching a milestone in the online game or as part of a loyalty reward for playing a plurality of days in a row etc.

The modular game may be of different types and not necessarily of the same kind as the online game. For example while playing slots the player may win a chance to play a modular game that is a trivia game e.g. a trivia game about facts of a movie or a game of chance but with alternative methods to win coins or a game of speed e.g. performing a given task as fast as possible or solving a puzzle etc. More details regarding the possible modular games are provided below with reference to .

After completing the modular game in operation the player is given the options to challenge other players. If the player decides to challenge the method flows to operation and if the player skips the options to challenge the method flows back to operation . In one embodiment if the player decides not to challenge a counter indicating the number of challenges available to the player is increased.

In operation an interface is provided to the player to select one or more friends to challenge. In one embodiment the players that can be challenged include friends of the player in a social network or friends of the player in the online game. In another embodiment the player is also given the option to challenge other people that are not currently friends of the player.

In another embodiment the player is provided the option to challenge an unknown player e.g. an open challenge that is challenging anyone e.g. does anyone want to accept my challenge . In this case a board with open challenges is providers to players of the online game and the players of the online game may access the board to accept challenges from other players or even to add their own open challenges. In one embodiment the game may charge the player for posting open challenges e.g. charging currency against the account of the player .

In one embodiment the player may choose a jeopardy wager as part of the challenge. This means that when the other player accepts the challenge a bet is made and the winner of the challenge will win the jeopardy wager from the loser. For example if the jeopardy wager includes a number of units of currency used in the game the loser will give the winner the amount of units of currency associated with the jeopardy wager. Further in one embodiment the game will charge a wager fee to the winner of the challenge. For example if the wager fee is 5 the winner will get 95 of the jeopardy wager and the game i.e. the house will get 5 of the jeopardy wager. Other types of wager fees may also be used such as within the range from 0.5 to 20 .

After the player selects one or more players for the challenge the game sends the challenge to the selected one or more players. After the challenges are sent in operation the method flows back to operation where the player continues playing the slots game.

If the player receives a notification that the challenge has been completed by another player operation the player is given an option to check the status of the challenge. In operation a check is made to determine if the player has won the challenge. If the player has not won the challenge the method flows to operation an if the player has won the challenge the method flows to operation .

In operation the player collects the reward for winning the challenge. For example the player may collect a predetermined amount of game currency. In other embodiment the player also wins some currency even if the player loses. This causes a viral reinforcement so when friends play challenges the player still gets a reward for the viral interaction even if the player loses.

In another embodiment not shown the player is given an option to re challenge e.g. double or nothing where the amount of the reward is doubled and the challenge is re sent to the other player. The scenario is more likely in games where a wager is placed as both players have the incentive and the risk to replay the challenge.

From operation the method flows to operation where the player is given an option to send a message to the other player. If the player chooses to send a message the method flows to operation to send the message and if the player chooses not to send a message the method flows to operation taking the player back to the game.

In operation the challenged player plays the slots game. When the player receives the challenge and the player accepts the challenge the method flows to operation where the modular game is played by the challenged player. As a result of playing the modular game the player receives a score and in operation a check is made to determine the winner of the challenge.

If the challenged player has won the challenge the method flows to operation where the player collects the challenge reward. If the player has not won the challenge the method flows to operation . In another embodiment a consolation reward is also given to the challenged player when the challenged player loses.

From operation the method flows to operation when an option is presented to the player for sending a message to the challenger. If the player decides not to send a message the method flows to operation to go back to playing the slots game. If the player decides to send a message the method flows to operation where an interface is provided to enter a message and then send the message to the challenger.

In operation the challenged player starts the modular game i.e. the challenge . In one embodiment the game sets up the challenge depending on the type of modular game for the challenge. For example some games will provide an identical scenario to the challenged player while other games will have different outcomes but with the same probabilities of winning e.g. both players roll dice and the outcome depends on the points obtained with the dice although both players may get different rolls of the dice the odds when rolling the dice are the same for both players .

In operation a check is made to determine if the modular game will have an exact same set up as the setup for the challenger when the challenger played the modular game. In the setup is exactly the same the method flows to operation and otherwise to operation .

In operation the game provides the challenged player the same exact set up as given to the challenger. For example a modular game may be a memory game with a plurality of cards face down and the player has to make pairs of cards by picking up two cards at a time. In this embodiment the layout of the cards is exactly the same for both players. In another example the modular game is a trivia game and the challenged player is given the same questions in the same order as the questions given to the challenger. From operation the method flows to operation .

In operation a check is made to determine if a shuffle is needed. As used herein a shuffle is referred to herein as the change of a distribution of results for a set of options presented to the player. If a shuffle is required the method flows to operation and if a shuffle is not required the method flows to operation where the shuffle is done.

The result of the shuffle is a modular game with the same options provided to the challenger but in a different order or layout. For example the modular game may ask the player to select one hidden prize from a list of 9 choices see for example with options to peak a basket out of nine possible baskets where each basket covers a different prize to be given when selected .

In the shuffle operation the prizes associated with each of the choices are redistributed among the choices where the prizes are the same but associated with different possible picks for the user. From operation the method flows to operation .

In operation a check is made to determine if the modular game is a game of chance. As used herein a game of chance is a game that requires no particular player skills and whose outcome only depends on random events given predetermined winning odds.

If the modular game is a game of chance the method flows to operation and if the modular game is not a game of chance the method flows to operation . In operation the game of chance is set up with the same winning odds as provided to the challenger when the challenger played the modular game. For example in a slots game the slots wheels will be set up with the same winning odds as the slots wheels were set for the challenger. From operation the method flows to operation .

In operation the game is set up for a skill game which is a game whose outcome at least in part depends on a level of skill of the player. For example skill games may include trivia games problem solving games puzzles shooting games crossword puzzles games that depend on reaction times etc.

In one embodiment the skills game is a trivia game and the skills game is set up with a different set of trivia questions obtains from a database. In other embodiments other types of tests may be set up for the skills game. In yet another embodiment the skill game may also be played as an exact same game e.g. a car race .

From operation the method flows to operation where the challenged player plays the modular game after the setup of the modular game is completed.

It is noted that the embodiments illustrated in are exemplary. Other embodiments may utilize different types of modular games have additional types of modular games combine multiple setup operations e.g. shuffle some choices and get new trivia questions etc. The embodiments illustrated in should therefore not be interpreted to be exclusive or limiting but rather exemplary or illustrative.

In another embodiment not shown an additional option is provided to send a new challenge to the second player if the second player won the challenge. In other words the user is able to re challenge the other player e.g. double or nothing . Sometimes the user may incur a cost e.g. game currency to be able to re challenge or one of the challenges available to the player is spent to re challenge.

In yet another embodiment the game keeps track of the head to head challenges between two players and gives a tally of the results. For example at the end of one challenge the game may display Your overall score of challenges with John is 5 3. The tally may keep track of all the challenges between the two players and the score in head to head may be the result of a lifetime of challenges or the result for a period of time e.g. in the current month . Thus the head two head score may be reset periodically.

In operation an interface is provided to a first player for challenging a second player to compete in a modular game after detecting completion of the modular game by the first player the modular game being played within an online game see for example .

From operation the method flows to operation where the challenge is sent to the second player if the first player decided to challenge. From operation the method flows to operation for detecting that the second player completed the modular game in response to the challenge. The game then determines who the winner of the challenge is and in operation if the first player obtained a higher score than the second player in the modular game then the first player is awarded a challenge award.

In operation user input is received during a session of the online slots game the user input defined to spin wheels of the online slots game. From operation the method flows to operation for defining an initial tier and one or more additional tiers for play of the online slots game during the session. Each tier is assigned an odds value that changes with each assigned tier and each tier is defined to have a set of spins.

Further from operation the method flows to operation where tiers with changed odds are assigned when an option to play a bonus game is not presented during the set of spins for each tier. Further yet from operation the method flows to operation for re assigning the initial tier upon determining that the bonus game was played during the session.
