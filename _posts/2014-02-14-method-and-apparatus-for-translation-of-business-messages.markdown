This application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 043 076 filed Oct. 1 2013 and claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119 e of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 808 430 filed Apr. 4 2013 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 792 388 filed Mar. 15 2013 the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates generally to systems and methods for translation of messages and more particularly to debuggable and fixable systems and processes for translating messages between business partners in a supply chain or trading network.

Supply chains involve large numbers of parties each of whom will generally need to communicate with multiple other parties. Numerous message exchange standards exist to facilitate these supply chain communications but only certain standards will be supported by the business systems of each party. Mismatches in supported standards may make communications more costly less efficient or less accurate or even lead to an inability to conduct business between the parties.

What is needed is a system and associated methods for efficiently and accurately transmitting messages between trading partners in a trading network without requiring modification to the systems or message exchange formats of the parties.

A system and method are provided for controlling access to resources and facilitating correction of access issues. A two factor authentication method comprises receiving a credential associated with a connection request determining a resource identifier associated with the connection request identifying a user associated with the resource identifier determining whether the received credential is valid for the identified user and responsive to a determination that the credential is not valid for that user denying access to resources associated with the resource identifier and communicating information regarding the failure to the identified user.

Certain terminology is used in the following description for convenience only and is not limiting. The words lower bottom top and upper designate directions in the drawings to which reference is made. The terminology includes the above listed words derivatives thereof and words of similar import. Additionally the words a and an as used in the claims and in the corresponding portions of the specification mean at least one. 

Referring to the drawings in detail wherein like reference numerals indicate like elements throughout a preferred message translation system for transmitting messages between network partners is described.

Referring to message translation system provides for communications between two exemplary trading partner messaging clients and . Messaging clients and may be communications specific software or message handling components of other business systems such as Enterprise Resource Planning ERP systems. Message translation system provides for example translation of messages from the message exchange format used by messaging client to and from the message exchange format used by messaging client .

The message translation system includes an interconnection component Redundant Interchangeable Connectivity Array RICA a user management interface Portal a data storage and management component Scribe a message processing system Service Fabric and an exception handling component FIXME . The Portal preferably includes a management interface for interacting with users at remote locations. RICA provides the interconnection s between the network partners and the network for incoming and outgoing data. The Scribe is the data storage and management system. The Service Fabric is preferably configured through the Portal gets input from RICA and uses Scribe for data retrieval and storage. The lower levels of the system are created by the Service Fabric and Scribe integrated by RICA and viewed and configured by the Portal . Together the components create a generalized Process Semantics Aware High Performance data store.

Messages may be any data or information stream related to a process preferably a business process. The translated messages are generally business messages for instance purchase orders acknowledgments advance shipping notices delivery receipts invoices or any other messages related to the buying selling manufacture distribution maintenance and repair of goods as well as other operations. In a preferred embodiment types of messages may include but are not limited to Application Advice Booking Confirmation Booking Response Booking Request Certificate of Analysis Custom Document Delivery Receipt Demand Forecast Email Outbound Envelope Financial Information Report Forecast Freight Bill General Purpose Goods Receipt Inventory Inventory Actual Usage Invoice Invoice Adjustment Load Tender Motor Load Tender Ocean Load Tender Response Lockbox Ocean Schedule Order Change Order Create Order Response Organization Relationships Ownership Transfer Report Payment Details Planning Schedule Product Activity Report Product Data Message Product Movement Report Receipt Notice Receiving Advice Self Invoice Ship Notice Shipment Information Shipment Instructions Shipment Status Shipping Schedule and Supply Plan.

Messages are generally received in one of many message exchange formats and translated to another message exchange format selected based upon the capabilities of the receiver. Message formats may include for example UN EDIFACT ANSI X12 CIDX PIDX IDOC xCBL EBXML cXML GUSI ODETTE OAGIS or other XML formats. Messages may be transmitted to and from the message translation system using a variety of methods such as email FTP SFTP HTTP HTTPS SOAP REST or an API. Messages may be transmitted completely asynchronously or a requestor may synchronously wait for a reply which is created within Service Fabric . Other methods for transmitting messages over a network are known to those skilled in the art and are within the scope of this disclosure.

RICA is a self service content agnostic multi protocol messaging broker. RICA decouples the incoming message processing from the protocol used by a networked system to transmit the message. That is once the message has been received the method by which it was received is generally no longer considered in its processing. RICA functions as a gateway offering connections in and out of the message translation system and comprises an incoming system and an outgoing system.

The incoming system of RICA defines how messages enter the message translation system. Messages enter the system from a networked partner or web API enabled partner are authenticated and then securely stored before acknowledgement. A two step authentication process described further below is utilized in authenticating the networked partner in order to reduce the friction in troubleshooting connectivity issues for the normally troublesome certificate based connectivity methods.

The outgoing system of RICA defines how messages destined for recipients leave the message translation system. The outgoing system may receive incoming connections pull or it may actively make connections to the receiving client system push to deliver messages.

The system has the ability to receive messages via any number of endpoints across a horizontally scalable service. Endpoints are provisioned at run time. The system may queue messages in an arbitrary number of priority or process oriented queues. After messages are received via a connected partner they are stored for processing. RICA Scribe and the Portal can be used to assign priority or specific processing characteristics e.g. messages from a specific partner must be processed in under 3 minutes .

RICA is preferably an acknowledgment based system. In operation a trading partner submits a message to RICA which acknowledges receipt of the message. After RICA receives the message regardless of the user or protocol type a process between RICA and Scribe is initiated. RICA transmits an Authorize command to Scribe passing the certificate of the user. Scribe returns a Business Unit result associated with the transmitted certificate. In response RICA transmits the message to Scribe along with additional information relating to the message. The message is passed from RICA to Scribe by a Put Message command which is acknowledged to RICA by Scribe . Preferably messages are only acknowledged by RICA to the Networked System after Scribe has acknowledged to RICA so that the system does not accept responsibility for a message until it has been securely persisted. The processed message and a Delivery Book associated with the message are finally returned from Scribe to RICA .

Portal includes a user interface accessible to users of the message translation system over a network such as the Internet or other Wide Area Network. Portal stores and manages data in the Scribe system and manages configuration information used by RICA and the Service Fabric . Generally the message translation system is accessible through a Portal available to service providers e.g. logistics and the customer.

Portal includes options for Master Data configuration administration and maintenance of the system such as provisioning debug and enablement of connections. The Master Data area contains relevant business information including contact information and other relevant details related to business payments networks and processing. The configuration area includes connectivity details for RICA and data enhancement transformation information for the Service Fabric including how messages are passed in and out of the system. The administration area includes details about the client as well as related business units connections with partners network management and other details. Maintenance functions include the ability to observe the use of communications the health of the system and metrics such as which messages and how many messages have been processed by the message translation system.

The system may also contain components for operations management and maintenance of the various components and their connection and use. In a preferred embodiment an Operations module manages and maintains the systems and their operation. This includes oversight for development of the system technical support documentation of systems and process system administration and other details related to regular operation and metrics. A supervisor process may also preferably be implemented to monitor the proper functioning of one or more of the other components.

The Service Fabric picks up messages coming in to the system from RICA . The Service Fabric acts as the integration platform for the message translation system. It handles message processing transformation validation and other value added services. The Service Fabric does the work of the network by facilitating communication of messages in through and out of the system. The Service Fabric uses Scribe for persistent data storage and retrieval. Configuration is retrieved via Scribe and managed via the Portal . Results and metrics may be observed via the Portal .

In a preferred embodiment the Service Fabric includes 1 actors in a framework including a Warden a Mouse and a Guide and 2 a set of services . The Warden is preferably a supervisor process that monitors the system for receipt of new messages and upon receipt of new messages calls or creates a Mouse . The Warden may create numerous Mice for completing operations in accordance with the preferred system . If unprocessed messages are found a Mouse is created for each unprocessed message. The Mouse is preferably a worker process or a supervisor process that receives or requests a service from the Guide . The Guide is preferably a service for the worker process or the Mouse . Service Fabric is preferably implemented in a multi paradigm programming language such as SCALA.

Service Fabric may perform steps of de queuing messages from an arbitrary number of message queues storing messages in their initial state extracting Concepts from Messages recognizing messages via extractions routing messages via recognition output and optionally based on the route performing custom extractions Canonical transformation data enrichment database lookups master data validation and cross referencing content based validations business rules and alerting reporting and analytics populating messages through reversal of extraction delivering messages to arbitrary number of endpoints and relating messages via a correlation service.

Each message received by RICA is processed by an independent mouse which retrieves a Routing Slip that specifies Services in a route to analyze modify validate or deliver the message. These routes can be combined to enable a high level of flexibility and customizability. The process begins by obtaining configurations for the sender receiver and message type. If the configurations are found a routing slip heuristic is applied and an unambiguous match is searched for. If an unambiguous match is found the routing slip is returned. If the configurations are not found or no unambiguous match is found troubleshooting is initiated to address the problem.

At RICA requests authentication of the certificate or login password and URI from Scribe . Scribe searches for the authentication in its storage based on the configurations stored from the Portal at . Scribe sends authentication information to RICA at .

At RICA compares the authentication information from Scribe to the stored information which was received in the initial direction of the message from the trading partner to RICA at . If authenticated or the information is confirmed RICA accepts the payload of the message itself into the system stores the message as a new message in Scribe and creates a delivery book that includes information about the trading partner at .

The full message is preferably not allowed into the system until the initial authorization is completed and confirmed. Accordingly messages from unknown individuals or organizations are not received and or stored in the system until the identity of the trading partner is confirmed or authorized. If the trading partner is not authenticated the payload or message is rejected and an error is sent to the exception handling FIXME component .

At Warden is preferably configured to repeatedly poll Scribe for new messages in need of processing. If a new message is found and the Scribe notifies the Warden at . The Warden then creates a Mouse and pulls the message and delivery book at and sends the message and the delivery book to the mouse at for processing of the message and delivery book by the Mouse in the Service Fabric . The Mouse requests a routing slip at from the Guide and creates a flipbook which includes the delivery book. The Guide sends a request at to the Scribe for the configuration of the message based on the contents of the flipbook. The Scribe sends the configuration to Guide at . If no configuration is present or pre existing then the flipbook is sent to the error handling FIXME process .

The Guide then sends a routing slip that is based on the configuration received to the Mouse at . The Mouse appends the flipbook based on the process. The Mouse executes the routing slip based on the Services contained in the routing slip at . At the Mouse saves output from each service to the flipbook. Once the routing slip and its indicated tasks are completed the mouse sends the flipbook to the Guide and requests a new routing slip at . The Guide looks up the configuration to determine if additional Services are needed. If additional services are needed the Guide then sends a new routing slip to the mouse at and the mouse executes the routing slip at . Once no routing slip is needed the Guide sends the flipbook and delivery book to the Scribe detailing the receiver of the processed message at .

RICA polls the Scribe for any finished messages as is represented by arrow . If a new message is found RICA pulls the flipbook and delivery book from Scribe at . RICA then sends the translated message contained in the flipbook to the receiving trading partner based on the instructions contained in the delivery book at . If an error occurs then the flipbook is sent to the FIXME .

Partners connecting to the message translation system are assigned a unique endpoint for message delivery. These endpoints can be provisioned dynamically at run time and will enable loading and associating authentication information to an endpoint without having to restart or redeploy the message translation system. This allows more directed testing and analysis when there are issues connecting to the message translation system.

Partners have the ability to associate client certificates or username password authentications with their endpoints. Certificates will be stored via Scribe and associated by the authenticated user. Optionally certificates may be generated for users that do not have the requisite knowledge. While authentication is generally discussed below with respect to certificates it is to be understood that any other combination of uniquely identifying characteristics may be used such as for instance a combination of IP address and recipient address.

As described above a two step authentication process is utilized in authenticating the Networked Partner in order to reduce the friction in troubleshooting connectivity issues associated with certificate based connectivity methods. The message translation system may use information regarding authentication failures to assist in this troubleshooting. The two step authentication is described briefly with respect to then in detail with respect to .

In a preferred embodiment each valid user or group of users of the message translation system performs a registration process either indirectly or via Portal . At the time the user account is established the user is preferably assigned a credential such as an encryption key or certificate at . The certificate is preferably an SSL or TLS client certificate. The user is also preferably assigned a unique resource identifier or address for accessing the system such as a unique URI or root URI at . The credential and resource identifier preferably a certificate and URI are provided to Partner at . The certificate or the public key from the certificate and URI are also provided to Scribe for storage for later use in authentication. In some cases the Partner may provide its own certificate for use with the system.

At Partner attempts to connect to send a message. In this example Partner presents an incorrect certificate along with the correct assigned URI for the account encrypted within the request. The connection attempt of may comprise a number of exchanges and may follow the general steps of for instance a client authenticated TLS connection handshake process. The certificate may be in X.509 form and contain a public key for the client.

RICA accesses the received credential at to establish an SSL tunnel and access the URI within the request at . RICA may use the certificate presented with the request without regard to whether it is valid for the system using it merely to establish the tunnel and gain access to the URI associated with the request. In other embodiments RICA may require that the certificate at least be associated with the message translation system to perform any action.

At RICA passes the URI and certificate to Scribe . Scribe then identifies a user associated with the URI at . Scribe retrieves the stored certificate associated with the identified user at and compares the stored certificate associated with the user with the received certificate at . Through the comparison of certificates the message translation system determines whether the received certificate is valid for the user associated with the requested URI. If the credential is not valid for the identified user associated with the URI the system denies access to resources associated with the resource identifier thereby causing the associated message to be refused. Scribe then sends an indication of the failed authentication to RICA at .

The presence of the valid resource identifier inside the request however may be an indication that an otherwise valid user is simply using the wrong credential. Thus the RICA may initiate troubleshooting and for instance at communicate information to the user associated with the requested URI via a previously stored contact address to convey the fact that the received credential is not valid for the user associated with the resource identifier in the request. The user may then attempt the request again using the correct credential or perhaps indicate that the connection request did not originate with that user.

At Extraction is performed. During the extraction phase the source data is converted from its native format into a data format understood by the system. This early representation of the message is still in the shape of the inbound message but the data elements have begun to be named.

At Transformation is performed. Transformation allows changing the structure or shape of a message as well as to change the extracted names to canonical names of Business Concepts. Business Concepts are descriptors relating to a transaction. They are preferably semantically meaningful names such as Purchase Order Number and Delivery Date. Business concepts are the standard communication method for all services and applications of the message translation system. After data is decoupled from standard based formatting all services can use the set of business concepts to determine how to operate on a message.

The semantically meaningful names may be further transformed into universal business concepts. Universal business concepts are business concepts that allow association of additional parameters. Examples of universal business concepts include Reference Date Partner Pricing Contact Quantity Currency Location Instructions Payment Terms Transport Details Packaging Identifier Equipment Details Purchase Order Type Unit Of Measure Country Language Code Product Information and Transport Mode. The semantically meaningful name buyer for instance may be transformed into the universal business concept Partner buyer where buyer is a parameter clarifying the type of Partner. Services such as validation business rules applications correlation alerting notification extraction code conversion enrichment master data validation and cross referencing reporting dashboard error handling and support message routing and orchestration and data enrichment may be performed on the universal business concepts.

At Code Conversion is performed. Most business messages use codified values to represent commonly used data elements. Units of measure are typically chosen from an existing industry standard set e.g. UNEDIFACT Rec. 20 or ANSI X12 . Code conversions are both standard and configurable as typically a partner will support only a subset of a particular code list. The values found in the message are converted to those supported in the Canonical message.

At if the message does not have the information necessary to satisfy the Services of the routing slip data enrichment is used to fill in the missing pieces.

In order for all message transformations to be reversible the side or portion of the message with a missing element is assigned a virtual or remainder element which corresponds to the missing element. At runtime the preferred system uses a configuration to supply this information or initiates a fix or repair process by sending the message to the FIXME . This process is meant to be exemplary and not limiting and the system may otherwise or alternatively address a message that has missing sides or portions such as by requesting additional information from the trading partner who sent the message searching for appropriate information that may otherwise be available for access by the system or otherwise similarly addressing the missing information.

The enrichment step causes the remaining actions to be taken that are required for a message to fit the Canonical form. This may include for example the conversion of a date format or the addition of leading zeros. Sometimes not all the required canonical data elements are included in an inbound message. The Enrichment step may therefore provide the ability to hard code values or programmatically insert calculated or inferred values. This step can also be used to add Business Data to the message based on how it is configured in the system. For example a location identifier can be used to load an address into the message or a product ID may be used to load its product identifier.

Rationalization is preferably configurable by partner and by message. These Rationalizations e.g. extractors or Populators are stored as configuration information and are searchable reusable reversible and reportable. Storing this information as a configuration allows creation of a learning system that will leverage existing data to simplify future Business Message Transformation. The gap between two connected partners can be analyzed or the required data elements for a new partner connecting to an existing partner may be explicitly stated. Furthermore specific sets of concept requirements may be defined by business processes or applications that can be used at design time. Rationalization may also handle message formatting code lists and other requirements specific to the origin destination message.

The Rationalization is also preferably reversible. That is once a message has been transformed through the Rationalization process through the fabric not only is the configuration process that the message has gone through stored preferably so that it can be repeated but the configuration can also be used by the Services in reverse order to transform a message to its original format. The system is preferably able to use a configuration in its native sequence and in a reverse sequence such as the mouse executing the routing slips arrow and the mouse saving the output arrow which helps to eliminate a significant amount of duplicated effort when working with an existing message set. Directionality of the message inbound or outbound is generally not a factor as would be apparent to one having ordinary skill in the art based on a review of the present disclosure.

Business Concept requirements and validations can be managed at the edges of the system but communicated through the processing layer. This will allow a user to decide which standards they will support at design time or to quickly analyze the impact of a new partner on boarding.

After the four phases of rationalization of process are completed the Canonical message is achieved. The Canonical is the message translation system s internal format of a Business Message on which applications and reporting and analysis services are built. The Canonical is flexible at a content level and not limited as to what data it can contain. However requirements are defined based on partner or process that can be enforced dynamically to ensure proper communication.

During on boarding of each new trading partner a reusable mapping or configuration for translation of messages from the trading partner message exchange format to the Canonical format may be created. Creating such mappings however may be time consuming and costly. In some embodiments therefore the capability may be provided to accept messages without prior development of a mapping for a particular trading partner. Fields from incoming messages with known or determinable meanings may be mapped to business concepts on the fly. EDI messages for instance may be particularly amendable to being ingested without a specific trading partner onboarding process due to their known predictable format. In some cases only a subset of the fields of a message with known meanings may be mapped. If the fields that can be mapped are sufficient for conveying key aspects of a message such as key terms of a purchase order interaction with the trading partner may continue without the need for onboarding.

The Canonical may preferably be represented in the form of an XML file on disk. However in some embodiments operational efficiency may be achieved by bypassing the steps of writing an XML file to storage and reading it for subsequent delivery. Instead the intermediate format may be held in memory.

As the volume of message handling increases over time it becomes increasingly difficult to know what the system was doing exactly during normal operation and especially when an error occurs. Therefore the message translation system is designed to provide knowledge regarding the operation of the system while it is running. Data structures such as the flipbook that are self documenting and immutable are used to record all actions. They cannot be changed once they are created.

Using a flipbook like data structure all actions initiated regarding an incoming message are recorded on a separate page of the flipbook. Each page of a particular flipbook represents a state change during message processing of that message. As a result when processing for a specific message fails it is always clear what happened and where the processing stopped or failed so that corrective actions may be taken.

Authorized users are provided the ability to fix problems while the full context of a failure is still known. The FIXME process implements a path to resolve normal system issues that are due to configuration errors. This makes sure that most errors that can occur will be quickly detected and fixed. All failed messages and their flipbooks are registered with the FIXME . An authorized user can then inspect a flipbook in order to decide how to resolve an issue. If the failure is due to an erroneous configuration the user can change this configuration while the system is running. Preferably the new configurations can then be tested on the failed message in simulation mode without side effect. Once the erroneous setup has been fixed the original message can be reprocessed using the new configuration.

By eliminating the need to do data preparation and processing the preferred system enables rapid development of messaging applications to support automate or optimize any sort of process. While in the preferred embodiment the message translation system is applied to automating and optimizing Supply Chain communications it may similarly be used in a variety of other applications requiring automating and integrating the exchange of information such as in the medical and regulatory fields.

As would be understood by one skilled in the art the message translation system may be implemented using a variety of hardware configurations. A single computer may provide all functions or functions may be allocated amongst multiple machines physical or virtual. For instance data storage may be allocated to a specific machine or group of machines running database software. Portal may utilize one or more separate web servers or load balancers. Each computer in the system may comprise a process for executed stored program code for performing the processes and methods described herein. Each computer may also comprise one or more network interfaces for communicating information as described. Each computer may also comprise one or more memories and storage devices for storing program code and data.

It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes could be made to the embodiments described above without departing from the broad inventive concept thereof. It is understood therefore that this invention is not limited to the particular embodiments disclosed but it is intended to cover modifications within the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the present disclosure.
