The present technology pertains to content delivery and more specifically pertains to enabling user to delivery content via a content management system in return for payment.

Content stored in an online storage account with synchronized content management system can be accessed on computing devices in a variety of ways such as through a stand alone application one or more application plug ins a web browser etc. Users can thus upload content items such as pictures songs documents etc. from a computing device to their online storage account and later access the content items from different computing devices. A synchronized content management system can also facilitate the sharing of content between users. For example a user can create a link to a content item that can be used to access the content item the user intends to share. The user can then provide the link to other uses to provide access to the content item. Therefore such a synchronized content management system can facilitate the easy delivery of digital content from one individual user to another.

Instead of merely sharing digital content some users may want to provide digital content for sale in return for a payment. Users are accustomed to shopping for and purchasing items online through electronic marketplaces many of which enable individual users i.e. third party sellers to sell items through their websites. In order to become a third party sell an individual user must among other things register with and run each transaction through the electronic marketplace thereby adding an additional layer to this process. This is not always convenient for the average person who may sell only a few items each month. Therefore it could be advantageous to enable users storing digital content in a content management system to share their digital content in return for a payment.

Additional features and advantages of the disclosure will be set forth in the description which follows and in part will be obvious from the description or can be learned by practice of the herein disclosed principles. The features and advantages of the disclosure can be realized and obtained by means of the instruments and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. These and other features of the disclosure will become more fully apparent from the following description and appended claims or can be learned by the practice of the principles set forth herein.

The disclosed technology addresses the need in the art for delivering digital content via a synchronized content management system in return for a payment. The content can include for example an E book photos music or service invoices such as tax returns commissioned digital artwork and the like. For example a first user could send a share link containing a content item to a second user. Upon attempting to open the content item by selecting the share link the second user could be prompted to input payment information. In response to providing the payment information the second user can then select the share link and download the content item.

In at least one embodiment a content management system CMS receives a first request to share a content item for a payment. In order to facilitate the sharing function the CMS generates a link corresponding to a path identifying the stored location of the content item in the CMS. Once the link is generated the CMS sends the link to the user along with payment request information provided in the first request. In this example a second request to access the content item via the link is received i.e. the user has selected the link . In response the user prompted to input payment information for accessing the content item. Upon receiving the payment information the CMS can either authorized the payment or have payment authorization performed by a third party. Accordingly when the payment is authorized the content item is made accessible to the user and can be stored to a folder associated with their user account at the CMS.

Various embodiments of the disclosure are discussed in detail below. While specific implementations are discussed it should be understood that this is done for illustration purposes only. A person skilled in the art will recognize that other components and configurations may be used without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure.

The disclosed technology addresses the need in the art for delivering digital content via a synchronized content management system CMS in return for a payment. For example the CMS can receive a request from a first user to share a content item for payment with a second user. In one example the content item is sent to the CMS with the request or alternatively the content item could already reside with the CMS in a user account of the first user. In at least one embodiment the first user can define what price they want to charge for the content item by providing information such as the price and a desired location for the payment when received from the second user into a price interface. In order to share the content item the CMS can generate a link which essentially points to the location of the content item at the CMS and when selected enables the selecting user to open the content item.

Accordingly in this example the link is sent to the second user which upon being selected prompts the user for payment information before the content item can be viewed or downloaded. Once the second user s payment information is received the payment information is processed. In one example the CMS is able to process the payment information. Alternatively the CMS can cause the payment information to be sent to a third party payment facilitator such as a bank online payment provider credit card company or any other financial institution capable of processing payments. Accordingly in response to the payment information being authorized the content item is made accessible to the user on the computing device such as by downloading the content item locally.

Various other functions and advantages are described and suggested below as may be provided in accordance with the various embodiments.

Accordingly show such an example process where a content item is shared via the CMS in accordance with various embodiments. shows an example screenshot of computing device displaying content item which a first user would like to share with a second user in return for a payment in accordance with at least one embodiment. In this example the first user is viewing content item through webpage provided by the CMS. For example the first user can login to their account with the CMS via a web browser from any computer and view their content items. Alternatively a client side application associated with the CMS can be installed on computing device and integrated into the device s file system. In other examples the client side application can be integrated through a webpage displayed using a web browser or may include CMS specific components that can be for example a stand alone application one or more application plug ins and or a browser extension. However the user can also interact with the CMS via a third party application such as a web browser that resides on computing device and is configured to communicate with the CMS. Since the first user is viewing content item through webpage the user can choose to locally download content item by selecting Download button .

In this example the second user could have commissioned the first user as an independent contractor to capture content item which is an image of a cityscape for a personal webpage or the like. In one example the transfer of digital content such as images graphic designer work product articles and the like for payment from independent contractors typically requires two independent transactions e.g. sending the file via email and sending payment via an online payment service etc. where the first party to transact must trust the second party to follow through with their end of the deal. Accordingly there is a need for simplifying the transaction process and providing a more reliable means of ensuring each user follows through on their end of the deal when delivering digital content for payment.

In order to simplify the transaction process and hold each party equally accountable to the transaction the first user can choose to deliver content item via the CMS by selecting Share button which will not enable the second user to access content item until payment has been received. Accordingly upon selecting Share button share user interface UI for the first user to provide a recipients information is displayed which is shown in . In this example share UI includes recipient fields for the user to provide a recipient s information e.g. email user name phone number etc. a message field in which the user can introduce content item to the recipient options button to select various content item options and send button to send content item .

Accordingly shows an example screenshot of share user interface UI after options button has been selected in accordance with at least one embodiment. In this example options button expands options dropdown that includes a Preview Only option enabling the user to share content item without enabling the recipient to download content item a Signature option enabling the user to send content item to the recipient in order to obtain the recipient s signature a Secure option enabling the user to password protect content item or set a time after which content item is no longer available for the recipient to view and a Payment Required option . Various other options can also be provided within the scope of various embodiments.

Accordingly in this example the first user has selected Payment Required option causing price interface UI to be displayed as shown in . Price UI in this example enables the first user to provide asking price for which they want to charge for content item and payment destination dropdown which includes one or more destinations e.g. checking account savings account online payment service etc. for the payment once it is received from the second user. Once the first user has provided the price information for content item via price UI and the delivery information via share UI and selected send button content item along with the price and delivery information can be sent to the CMS.

In one example CMS can include a sharing index that lists each sharing link along with a content path identifying the location of a respective content item associated with a sharing link. CMS can thus use the sharing link received from a requesting client device to search the sharing index and return the content item. A sharing link can be provided to a user in multiple ways. In some embodiments the sharing link can be visually presented to the user. For example the sharing link can be presented as text on the computing device that the user can copy to an e mail social networking post etc. to share the content item. Alternatively in some embodiments the sharing link can be stored to a data buffer on a computing device such as a clipboard. The user can thus access the sharing link by using for example a paste function to enter the sharing link into an e mail social networking post etc.

Accordingly the link is sent to the second user using the delivery information provided by the first user via share UI . In this example CMS is capable of processing and authorizing payment for the first user. Therefore when CMS sends the share link the second user of computing device is prompted to input payment information. Upon receiving the payment information from the second user CMS can process the second user s payment and either unlock activate the share link or if the payment is declined keep the link inactive until the second user provides a suitable means of payment.

Accordingly if the user s payment is declined the link will remain inactive and they will be prompted to provide an alternate means of payment. If however the payment goes through the link will become active thereby enabling the second user to download content item on computing device as shown in where the cityscape image i.e. content item is shown displayed on computing device . In this example computing device is a laptop computer that includes a client side application that communicates with CMS to synchronize a copy of content items stored locally on each computing device with copy of those content item stored with CMS . In this example the client side application could include a folder containing each of a user s content items that is synchronized with CMS when a new content item is added to the folder or an existing content item is modified. Thus when the second user s payment is authorized via computing device content item is downloaded and stored in the second user s account CMS will synchronize the user s account across all the second user s devices and store a copy of content item locally on computing device as shown in which is a tablet computer.

In this example the second user is prompted for payment in order to access the content item . In this example the second user inputs and provides their payment information which is received by the content management system . Accordingly in this example the content management system authorizes the payment . In response to authorizing the payment the content management system causes the content item to be accessible to the second user . Accordingly the content management system also provides the first user with the payment for the content item. In this example the content item is stored in a folder associated with the second user s account with the content management system which synchronizes the content item on each device of the user .

In this example the second user is prompted for payment in order to access the content item . In this example the second user inputs and provides their payment information which is received by the content management system . Accordingly in this example the content management system causes the payment to be authorized by a third party such as a bank credit card company or online payment service . In response to receiving authorization from the third party the content management system causes the content item to be accessible to the second user . Accordingly the content management system also provides the first user with the payment for the content item. In this example the content item is stored in a folder associated with the second user s account with the content management system which synchronizes the content item on each device of the user .

An exemplary system configuration for enabling access to content of a compressed content item from a variety of computing devices is shown in wherein computing devices communicate via a network for purposes of exchanging content and other data. The system can be configured for use on a wide area network such as that illustrated in . However the present principles are applicable to a wide variety of network configurations that facilitate the intercommunication of electronic devices. For example each of the components of system in can be implemented in a localized or distributed fashion in a network.

In system a user can interact with content management system through computing devices . . . collectively connected to network by direct and or indirect communication. Content management system can support connections from a variety of different computing devices such as desktop computers mobile computers mobile communications devices e.g. mobile phones smart phones tablets smart televisions set top boxes and or any other network enabled computing devices. Computing devices can be of varying type capabilities operating systems etc. Furthermore content management system can concurrently accept connections from and interact with multiple computing devices .

A user can interact with content management system via a client side application installed on computing device . In some embodiments the client side application can include a content management system specific component. For example the component can be a stand alone application one or more application plug ins and or a browser extension. However the user can also interact with content management system via a third party application such as a web browser that resides on computing device and is configured to communicate with content management system . In either case the client side application can present a user interface UI for the user to interact with content management system . For example the user can interact with the content management system via a client side application integrated with the file system or via a webpage displayed using a web browser application.

Content management system can make it possible for a user to store content as well as perform a variety of content management tasks such as retrieve modify browse and or share the content. Furthermore content management system can make it possible for a user to access the content from multiple computing devices . For example computing device can upload content to content management system via network . The content can later be retrieved from content management system using the same computing device or some other computing device .

To facilitate the various content management services a user can create an account with content management system . The account information can be maintained in user account database . User account database can store profile information for registered users. In some cases the only personal information in the user profile can be a username and or email address. However content management system can also be configured to accept additional user information.

User account database can also include account management information such as account type e.g. free or paid usage information e.g. file edit history maximum storage space authorized storage space used content storage locations security settings personal configuration settings content sharing data etc. Account management module can be configured to update and or obtain user account details in user account database . The account management module can be configured to interact with any number of other modules in content management system .

An account can be used to store content such as digital data documents text files audio files video files etc. from one or more computing devices authorized on the account. The content can also include folders of various types with different behaviors or other mechanisms of grouping content items together. For example an account can include a public folder that is accessible to any user. The public folder can be assigned a web accessible address. A link to the web accessible address can be used to access the contents of the public folder. In another example an account can include a photos folder that is intended for photos and that provides specific attributes and actions tailored for photos an audio folder that provides the ability to play back audio files and perform other audio related actions or other special purpose folders. An account can also include shared folders or group folders that are linked with and available to multiple user accounts. The permissions for multiple users may be different for a shared folder.

The content can be stored in content storage . Content storage can be a storage device multiple storage devices or a server. Alternatively content storage can be a cloud storage provider or network storage accessible via one or more communications networks. Content management system can hide the complexity and details from computing devices so that computing devices do not need to know exactly where the content items are being stored by content management system . In one variation content management system can store the content items in the same folder hierarchy as they appear on computing device . However content management system can store the content items in its own order arrangement or hierarchy. Content management system can store the content items in a network accessible storage SAN device in a redundant array of inexpensive disks RAID etc. Content storage can store content items using one or more partition types such as FAT FAT32 NTFS EXT2 EXT3 EXT4 ReiserFS BTRFS and so forth.

Content storage can also store metadata describing content items content item types and the relationship of content items to various accounts folders or groups. The metadata for a content item can be stored as part of the content item or can be stored separately. In one variation each content item stored in content storage can be assigned a system wide unique identifier.

Content storage can decrease the amount of storage space required by identifying duplicate files or duplicate segments of files. Instead of storing multiple copies content storage can store a single copy and then use a pointer or other mechanism to link the duplicates to the single copy. Similarly content storage can store files more efficiently as well as provide the ability to undo operations by using a file version control that tracks changes to files different versions of files including diverging version trees and a change history. The change history can include a set of changes that when applied to the original file version produce the changed file version.

Content management system can be configured to support automatic synchronization of content from one or more computing devices . The synchronization can be platform agnostic. That is the content can be synchronized across multiple computing devices of varying type capabilities operating systems etc. For example computing device can include client software which synchronizes via a synchronization module at content management system content in computing device s file system with the content in an associated user account. In some cases the client software can synchronize any changes to content in a designated folder and its sub folders such as new deleted modified copied or moved files or folders. The client software can be a separate software application can integrate with an existing content management application in the operating system or some combination thereof. In one example of client software that integrates with an existing content management application a user can manipulate content directly in a local folder while a background process monitors the local folder for changes and synchronizes those changes to content management system . Conversely the background process can identify content that has been updated at content management system and synchronize those changes to the local folder. The client software can provide notifications of synchronization operations and can provide indications of content statuses directly within the content management application. Sometimes computing device may not have a network connection available. In this scenario the client software can monitor the linked folder for file changes and queue those changes for later synchronization to content management system when a network connection is available. Similarly a user can manually stop or pause synchronization with content management system .

A user can also view or manipulate content via a web interface generated and served by user interface module . For example the user can navigate in a web browser to a web address provided by content management system . Changes or updates to content in the content storage made through the web interface such as uploading a new version of a file can be propagated back to other computing devices associated with the user s account. For example multiple computing devices each with their own client software can be associated with a single account and files in the account can be synchronized between each of the multiple computing devices .

Content management system can include a communications interface for interfacing with various computing devices and can interact with other content and or service providers . . . collectively via an Application Programming Interface API . Certain software applications can access content storage via an API on behalf of a user. For example a software package such as an app on a smartphone or tablet computing device can programmatically make calls directly to content management system when a user provides credentials to read write create delete share or otherwise manipulate content. Similarly the API can allow users to access all or part of content storage through a web site.

Content management system can also include authenticator module which can verify user credentials security tokens API calls specific computing devices and so forth to ensure only authorized clients and users can access files. Further content management system can include analytics module module that can track and report on aggregate file operations user actions network usage total storage space used as well as other technology usage or business metrics. A privacy and or security policy can prevent unauthorized access to user data stored with content management system .

Content management system can include sharing module for managing sharing content publicly or privately. Sharing content publicly can include making the content item accessible from any computing device in network communication with content management system . Sharing content privately can include linking a content item in content storage with two or more user accounts so that each user account has access to the content item. The sharing can be performed in a platform agnostic manner. That is the content can be shared across multiple computing devices of varying type capabilities operating systems etc. The content can also be shared across varying types of user accounts.

In some embodiments content management system can include a content item management module for maintaining a content directory. The content directory can identify the location of each content item in content storage . The content directory can include a unique content entry for each content item stored in the content storage.

A content entry can include a content path that can be used to identify the location of the content item in a content management system. For example the content path can include the name of the content item and a folder hierarchy associated with the content item. For example the content path can include a folder or path of folders in which the content item is placed as well as the name of the content item. Content management system can use the content path to present the content items in the appropriate folder hierarchy.

A content entry can also include a content pointer that identifies the location of the content item in content storage . For example the content pointer can include the exact storage address of the content item in memory. In some embodiments the content pointer can point to multiple locations each of which contains a portion of the content item.

In addition to a content path and content pointer a content entry can also include a user account identifier that identifies the user account that has access to the content item. In some embodiments multiple user account identifiers can be associated with a single content entry indicating that the content item has shared access by the multiple user accounts.

To share a content item privately sharing module can be configured to add a user account identifier to the content entry associated with the content item thus granting the added user account access to the content item. Sharing module can also be configured to remove user account identifiers from a content entry to restrict a user account s access to the content item.

To share content publicly sharing module can be configured to generate a custom network address such as a uniform resource locator URL which allows any web browser to access the content in content management system without any authentication. To accomplish this sharing module can be configured to include content identification data in the generated URL which can later be used to properly identify and return the requested content item. For example sharing module can be configured to include the user account identifier and the content path in the generated URL. Upon selection of the URL the content identification data included in the URL can be transmitted to content management system which can use the received content identification data to identify the appropriate content entry and return the content item associated with the content entry.

In addition to generating the URL sharing module can also be configured to record that a URL to the content item has been created. In some embodiments the content entry associated with a content item can include a URL flag indicating whether a URL to the content item has been created. For example the URL flag can be a Boolean value initially set to or false to indicate that a URL to the content item has not been created. Sharing module can be configured to change the value of the flag to or true after generating a URL to the content item.

In some embodiments sharing module can also be configured to deactivate a generated URL. For example each content entry can also include a URL active flag indicating whether the content should be returned in response to a request from the generated URL. For example sharing module can be configured to only return a content item requested by a generated link if the URL active flag is set to or true. Thus access to a content item for which a URL has been generated can be easily restricted by changing the value of the URL active flag. This allows a user to restrict access to the shared content item without having to move the content item or delete the generated URL. Likewise sharing module can reactivate the URL by again changing the value of the URL active flag to or true. A user can thus easily restore access to the content item without the need to generate a new URL.

While content management system is presented with specific components it should be understood by one skilled in the art that the architectural configuration of system is simply one possible configuration and that other configurations with more or less components are also possible.

To enable user interaction with the computing device an input device can represent any number of input mechanisms such as a microphone for speech a touch sensitive screen for gesture or graphical input keyboard mouse motion input speech and so forth. An output device can also be one or more of a number of output mechanisms known to those of skill in the art. In some instances multimodal systems can enable a user to provide multiple types of input to communicate with the computing device .
