The present application claims the benefit of priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 800 778 filed Mar. 15 2013 entitled SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR FACILITATING APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT UTILIZING PLUGINS which is incorporated by reference in its entirety in the present application.

An understanding of embodiments described in this disclosure and many of the related advantages may be readily obtained by reference to the following detailed description when considered with the accompanying drawings of which 

According to some embodiments described in this disclosure a client device or other type of network device may request a web application from a server via a network. In one or more embodiments a client device comprises an electronic device e.g. under the control of a user capable of requesting and receiving resources over the network. In some embodiments a client device may comprise a user application such as a web browser to facilitate the sending and receiving of data over the network. For example a web browser may enable a user e.g. via a user interface to display and interact with text images videos music web applications and other information e.g. located on a web page at a website on the World Wide Web or a local area network .

In one embodiment a client device may send a request for a web application e.g. an on line bingo game application to a server e.g. a game server the request including an identifier that indicates the requested web application. For example a web browser on a client device requests a web page from a server using a universal resource locator URL and receives a hypertext markup language HTML file from the server. The HTML file may include for example a script e.g. JavaScript script that sends a web application request to the server for the web application associated with the requested URL. In some embodiments the server hosts a plurality of different web applications e.g. created by one or more respective developers and identifies the requested web application based on an identifier in the web application request. In accordance with one or more embodiments the server may include a plurality of plugins used to provide information and or services in one or more web applications and the server further comprises specifications for a plurality of web applications the specifications including respective plugin identifiers that identify any one or more plugins associated with a given web application.

In accordance with one or more embodiments described in this disclosure one plugin associated with a given web application may be developed by a first development team while a second plugin associated with the same web application may be developed by a second different development team. Also in accordance with one or more embodiments a given plugin may be associated with more than web application. Accordingly it is desirable that where plugins may be developed by different developers for use within a common application platform e.g. a client delivery system any platform standards are enforced before the plugin code is released to the platform in order to avoid potential conflicts or errors in functional performance and or stylistic considerations.

Applicants have recognized that distributed development and maintenance provide unique challenges during both the development process and runtime integration. For example maintaining the consistency of coding style across different plugins may become an issue in a distributed development model. Further at the integration rendering layer many types of browsers do not currently support any kind of CSS sandboxing so it is possible to encounter unexpected user interface UI problems at runtime without developer discipline. Also some of the fundamentals of the JavaScript JS language design may lead to similar functional issues. Some of these types of problems with plugin development may be solved in part by sandbox functionality e.g. separating plugin processes at runtime and or by standard UI design templates as may be defined in a library or style guide of web components available to developers .

Applicants have recognized however that while a style guide may provide a library of consistent device aware HTML templates and conventions it cannot enforce how such templates are actually utilized in the plugins defined by plugin developers. Further a style guide cannot address any potential functional issues with additional plugin code developed independently by developers such as for example additional bespoke CSS written specifically for skinning a website to produce a desired visual layout e.g. of a unique website or group of websites . A final implementation of a plugin may contain a number of issues including but not limited to one or more of CSS selector specificity separation of structure CSS and skin CSS changes to the state of global variables in a global environment shared among multiple plugins naming conventions coding style syntax formatting and or performance issues.

According to some embodiments of the present invention a plugin architecture and or plugin certification process of a client delivery platform addresses issues associated with parallel distributed development and or maintenance of plugins. Applicants have recognized that problems related to plugins developed in the above manner for deployment on a common platform may be better approached by the enforcement of policies and conventions referred to in this disclosure as platform standards agreed upon for example by development teams working on various features and element of the common platform. According to some embodiments enforcement may comprise an automated plugin certification process e.g. implemented when plugins are compiled from source code to verify that plugin code conforms to the platform standards. In one embodiment a plugin certification process addresses these issues as an automated series of build time checks on plugins using static code analysis to ensure conformance of plugin code to agreed upon platform standards also referred to in this disclosure as platform plugin standards PPS .

In accordance with some embodiments of the present invention one or more systems apparatus methods articles of manufacture and or computer readable media e.g. a non transitory computer readable memory storing instructions for directing a processor provide for one or more of i determining plugin data defining one or more plugins e.g. receiving source code for a web application plugin ii determining one or more platform standards for plugins e.g. specifications agreed upon by developers for plugins used in a software platform production environment iii initiate a compile or build process for one or more plugins e.g. for generating executable software instructions based on source code iv performing a plugin certification process e.g. for verifying that a plugin specification or source code meets one or more requirements for an application environment .

In accordance with some embodiments of the present invention one or more systems and or apparatus provide for one or more of i a plugin certification system comprising one or more of a user interface a plugin repository a plugin certification program and a plugin compiler ii a platform production environment for serving applications utilizing plugins to users e.g. a gaming platform production environment for providing web applications to on line game players and iii build tools for use in developing plugins and or other types of software components.

In accordance with some embodiments of the present invention one or more systems apparatus methods articles of manufacture and or computer readable media provide for one or more of i receiving source code defining at least one plugin ii determining at least one platform plugin standard for certifying plugins iii determining at least one platform plugin standard for CSS e.g. predetermined requirements for CSS selector structural CSS and or skinning CSS iv determining at least one platform plugin standard for document object model DOM elements v reviewing and or analyzing one or more plugins based on at least one platform plugin standard and or vi certifying plugins passing at least one platform plugin standard and or rejecting any plugins failing one or more platform plugin standards.

Various types of plugin platform standards may be implemented for use in a client delivery platform and or verified in a plugin certification process. Some examples are discussed in this disclosure and others will be readily apparent to those skilled in the relevant art in light of the present disclosure. In some embodiments a plugin platform standard may comprise a standard for a CSS selector. Due to the cascading nature of CSS if a CSS selector for a given plugin is too general it may affect the CSS of other plugins at runtime e.g. due to a lack of boundaries within the browser . On the other hand if it is too specific it may be difficult to override or extend when necessary. Accordingly a platform standard may be established as to the appropriate type of CSS selectors to use in order to minimize problems that may arise as a result of inappropriate CSS selector specificity.

In one or more embodiments a platform standard may comprise a standard to address the potential for incorrect separation of structural CSS and skin CSS also referred to in this disclosure as skinning CSS . In one embodiment a build process may encourage appropriate re use of CSS by including a style guide within the final CSS build of a website. However a style guide may assume appropriate separation within plugins of different CSS e.g. structural CSS skinning CSS making it possible for a developer to violate the presumed separation e.g. by adding skinning attributes to the wrong file and cause undesirable behavior especially when plugins are shared across sites .

In one or more embodiments while a sandbox may restrict the particular DOM elements and or global JavaScript variables available to runtime code e.g. JavaScript code it is still possible to change global state e.g. due to developer error as a result of the default variable scoping rules of the JavaScript language e.g. in which a variable is global unless prefixed with the var tag . When running plugins in isolation this may not be an issue but where a global environment is shared between all plugins in use in a browser unintended consequences may occur. In some embodiments one or more static code analysis tools e.g. JavaScript analysis tools such as jshint may be utilized to find and warn of these types of violations e.g. as part of an automated plugin certification process .

In one or more embodiments a plugin certification process may include standards for consistency in naming conventions coding style and or syntax formatting e.g. across HTML CSS JS and or other language . Such standards are desirable from the long term view of promoting ease of understanding and maintenance of plugins and may be implementing as check within a plugin certification process.

In addition to functional concerns related to plugins certain policies and standards with respect to non functional considerations e.g. performance optimization of plugins may also be verified in accordance with some embodiments in a plugin certification process. In some embodiments a certification process may include performance standards related to download speeds memory consumption and or the like particularly on mobile devices and networks . In one example a plugin platform standard may require a verification check that any bitmap image assets within a plugin not exceed more than predetermined size e.g. in kilobytes due to the detrimental impact of larger bitmaps on downloads and memory consumption.

In some embodiments upon committal of source code to the relevant repository a plugin certification process runs as part of a build process a series of pre defined checks against established plugin standards in order to provide a level of confidence that the final built artefact does not contain any known violations. If the code passes all checks the build may be made available upstream e.g. in a production environment . If any checks are failed an indication of the error may be output e.g. to a developer via a user interface the build may correspondingly fail and or the artefact may be prevented from being released until the indicated error is fixed. After a subsequent commit is made the checks are re run and the plugin certification process may be repeated until all checks are passed.

Applicants have recognized in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention that it may be advantageous to provide for an application development and delivery system in which 

1. Plugins can be deployed developed and scaled independently of each other. Accordingly plugins may be developed as separate codelines or applications by different development teams using separate source control repositories for example but that can be compiled into a single code artefact repository e.g. accessed for use and or deployed to different machines .

2. Separate plugins can be delivered as different runtime code deployable into different datacenters. For example specific plugins may be deployed e.g. a deposit function for receiving customer deposits into customer financial accounts into a datacenter local to a particular jurisdiction e.g. should regulations so require .

3. A set of development tools allows for the providing of plugins and or other types of applications e.g. by a gaming provider that maintain consistent design and user experience UX values e.g. in application interfaces even though plugins may be developed by different codelines and or teams such that plugins run independently but appear to an end user as one integrated piece of software e.g. due to the compliance with style guides and or platform standards for plugins enforced at compile time .

According to one or more embodiments a client delivery platform or client delivery system primarily solves a problem of scale and complexity in application development. Problems associated with scaling development may be addressed in accordance with some embodiments by effectively breaking a website typically a single executable or deployable application maintained by a single often large team into a composite of smaller applications e.g. including one or more plugins maintained by multiple smaller development teams. By ensuring plugin compliance with platform wide standards e.g. at compile time each development team is able to move at its own pace address respective areas of responsibility and make sensible technology decisions to solve its own particular problem s .

According to some embodiments a client delivery system allows for the building of a fully functional gaming website from a number of discrete plugins e.g. client side applications aggregated by a Home App system for assembling the plugins and any layout elements and run in a user s browser. In some embodiments plugins may be isolated from each other e.g. at run time by a sandbox and may only communicate by responding for example to events emitted by other plugins. Plugins are intended to be run on different hardware and may be owned by different software teams for purposes of maintenance modification and or development.

According to some embodiments in order to maintain visual consistency of a particular implementation of a web application a suite of tooling known as Bootstrap a user experience UX pattern guide CSS styles JavaScript JS sample code and compile time tools may be utilized to enable disparate teams who may be employed by a variety of different companies to maintain a cohesive UX across their plugins.

In one example implementation the problem of application scaling i.e. handling more concurrent users may be addressed by mandating that plugins are stateless. Accordingly caching available across the Internet may be leveraged for example at one or more caches of content delivery networks CDNs Internet service providers ISPs and or user browsers. Stateless applications typically perform more efficiently than a stateful one. Accordingly the client delivery platform may be configured to minimize the expense of both bandwidth and computing power as demand grows.

In solving these problems a solution according to some embodiments introduces the complexity of managing the UX when the application effectively has multiple owners such as by providing bootstrap tool chain to maintain a consistent UX across disparate plugins.

According to some embodiments a client delivery platform comprises a Home App for providing customized configurations of available plugins for specific implementations or propositions e.g. for particular websites games game providers and or jurisdictions . This is done for example by requesting resources from the configured plugin provider URLs and combining them into a single HTML document plus single CSS and JS files. These may be player agnostic and may be cached advantageously at the application CDN ISP and or browser level for a significant period of time.

In one embodiment once requested by a client device the plugins are instantiated. The plugin API makes certain functionality available to the plugin and prevents the plugin from reaching outside of its sandbox changing the document object model DOM or behavior of another plugin for example.

Visual consistency may be maintained by plugin authors adhering to style guides published in the bootstrap. In some embodiments tools may be available 1 to verify at build time that a plugin s definition e.g. HTML markup is consistent with the style guide and or 2 to build proposition specific customizations of that style guide e.g. making buttons red .

In accordance with one or more embodiments problems of scale both of development and users may be addressed by providing a new framework in which to build applications that allows separate concerns of development deployment and even technology choice to be addressed by separate development teams. For example it does not matter whether a team wants to write in Java Scala Ruby or Assembler programming languages so long as the markup and JS to be delivered to the client is valid e.g. according to the verification by the build tools the plugin will work. Accordingly running software may be scaled horizontally on a very granular level. Further development may be scaled horizontally by building different teams around different plugins.

Some embodiments may be utilized advantageously by full stack gaming providers who experience a unique problem of scale. Some providers typically attempt to manage scale by outsourcing pieces of their functionality. For example some providers may only offer certain functionality e.g. a chat plugin with a specific web proposition e.g. a particular bingo game because it executes in a web application also referred to as a console delivered by software vendor A whereas a different web proposition e.g. a slots game is delivered by a different vendor B and does not have that functionality. In contrast with respect to some embodiments of the present invention the flexibility and sandboxing of a client delivery system allows for common functions to be provided by a provider across a variety of services games websites hardware devices and jurisdictions irrespective of what vendor or developer developed the plugins.

Although some non limiting examples are discussed in this disclosure with respect to applications e.g. on line games made available e.g. by a gaming provider to players of a gaming platform e.g. via a game server it will be readily understood that various embodiments discussed in this disclosure are not limited to such examples. Various features of a client delivery system plugin certification system and or plugin certification process may be implemented with respect to the development and or distribution of applications for various different types of application systems and platforms e.g. providing web applications to on line users .

Numerous embodiments are described in this disclosure and are presented for illustrative purposes only. The described embodiments are not and are not intended to be limiting in any sense. The presently disclosed invention s are widely applicable to numerous embodiments as is readily apparent from the disclosure. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the disclosed invention s may be practiced with various modifications and alterations such as structural logical software and electrical modifications. Although particular features of the disclosed invention s may be described with reference to one or more particular embodiments and or drawings it should be understood that such features are not limited to usage in the one or more particular embodiments or drawings with reference to which they are described unless expressly specified otherwise.

The present disclosure is neither a literal description of all embodiments nor a listing of features of the invention that must be present in all embodiments.

Neither the Title set forth at the beginning of the first page of this disclosure nor the Abstract set forth at the end of this disclosure is to be taken as limiting in any way as the scope of the disclosed invention s .

The terms an embodiment embodiment embodiments the embodiment the embodiments one or more embodiments some embodiments one embodiment and the like mean one or more but not all disclosed embodiments unless expressly specified otherwise.

The terms the invention and the present invention and the like mean one or more embodiments of the present invention. 

A reference to another embodiment in describing an embodiment does not imply that the referenced embodiment is mutually exclusive with another embodiment e.g. an embodiment described before the referenced embodiment unless expressly specified otherwise.

The terms including comprising and variations thereof mean including but not limited to unless expressly specified otherwise.

The term in this disclosure means in the present disclosure including anything which may be incorporated by reference unless expressly specified otherwise.

The phrase at least one of when such phrase modifies a plurality of things such as an enumerated list of things means any combination of one or more of those things unless expressly specified otherwise. For example the phrase at least one of a widget a car and a wheel means either i a widget ii a car iii a wheel iv a widget and a car v a widget and a wheel vi a car and a wheel or vii a widget a car and a wheel.

The phrase based on does not mean based only on unless expressly specified otherwise. In other words the phrase based on describes both based only on and based at least on .

Where a limitation of a first claim would cover one of a feature as well as more than one of a feature e.g. a limitation such as at least one widget covers one widget as well as more than one widget and where in a second claim that depends on the first claim the second claim uses a definite article the to refer to the limitation e.g. the widget this does not imply that the first claim covers only one of the feature and this does not imply that the second claim covers only one of the feature e.g. the widget can cover both one widget and more than one widget .

Each process whether called a method algorithm or otherwise inherently includes one or more steps and therefore all references to a step or steps of a process have an inherent antecedent basis in the mere recitation of the term process or a like term. Accordingly any reference in a claim to a step or steps of a process has sufficient antecedent basis.

When an ordinal number such as first second third and so on is used as an adjective before a term that ordinal number is used unless expressly specified otherwise merely to indicate a particular feature such as to distinguish that particular feature from another feature that is described by the same term or by a similar term. For example a first widget may be so named merely to distinguish it from e.g. a second widget . Thus the mere usage of the ordinal numbers first and second before the term widget does not indicate any other relationship between the two widgets and likewise does not indicate any other characteristics of either or both widgets. For example the mere usage of the ordinal numbers first and second before the term widget 1 does not indicate that either widget comes before or after any other in order or location 2 does not indicate that either widget occurs or acts before or after any other in time and 3 does not indicate that either widget ranks above or below any other as in importance or quality. In addition the mere usage of ordinal numbers does not define a numerical limit to the features identified with the ordinal numbers. For example the mere usage of the ordinal numbers first and second before the term widget does not indicate that there must be no more than two widgets.

When a single device or article is described in this disclosure more than one device or article whether or not they cooperate may alternatively be used in place of the single device or article that is described. Accordingly the functionality that is described as being possessed by a device may alternatively be possessed by more than one device or article whether or not they cooperate .

Similarly where more than one device or article is described in this disclosure whether or not they cooperate a single device or article may alternatively be used in place of the more than one device or article that is described. For example a plurality of computer based devices may be substituted with a single computer based device. Accordingly the various functionality that is described as being possessed by more than one device or article may alternatively be possessed by a single device or article.

The functionality and or the features of a single device that is described may be alternatively embodied by one or more other devices that are described but are not explicitly described as having such functionality and or features. Thus other embodiments need not include the described device itself but rather can include the one or more other devices which would in those other embodiments have such functionality features.

Devices that are in communication with each other need not be in continuous communication with each other unless expressly specified otherwise. On the contrary such devices need only transmit to each other as necessary or desirable and may actually refrain from exchanging data most of the time. For example a machine in communication with another machine via the Internet may not transmit data to the other machine for weeks at a time. In addition devices that are in communication with each other may communicate directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries.

A description of an embodiment with several components or features does not imply that all or even any of such components and or features are required. On the contrary a variety of optional components are described to illustrate the wide variety of possible embodiments of the present invention s . Unless otherwise specified explicitly no component and or feature is essential or required.

Further although process steps algorithms or the like may be described in a sequential order such processes may be configured to work in different orders. In other words any sequence or order of steps that may be explicitly described does not necessarily indicate a requirement that the steps be performed in that order. The steps of processes described in this disclosure may be performed in any order practical. Further some steps may be performed simultaneously despite being described or implied as occurring non simultaneously e.g. because one step is described after the other step . Moreover the illustration of a process by its depiction in a drawing does not imply that the illustrated process is exclusive of other variations and modifications thereto does not imply that the illustrated process or any of its steps are necessary to the invention and does not imply that the illustrated process is preferred.

Although a process may be described as including a plurality of steps that does not indicate that all or even any of the steps are essential or required. Various other embodiments within the scope of the described invention s include other processes that omit some or all of the described steps. Unless otherwise specified explicitly no step is essential or required.

Although a product may be described as including a plurality of components aspects qualities characteristics and or features that does not indicate that all of the plurality are essential or required. Various other embodiments within the scope of the described invention s include other products that omit some or all of the described plurality.

An enumerated list of items which may or may not be numbered does not imply that any or all of the items are mutually exclusive unless expressly specified otherwise. Likewise an enumerated list of items which may or may not be numbered does not imply that any or all of the items are comprehensive of any category unless expressly specified otherwise. For example the enumerated list a computer a laptop a PDA does not imply that any or all of the three items of that list are mutually exclusive and does not imply that any or all of the three items of that list are comprehensive of any category.

Headings of sections provided in this disclosure are for convenience only and are not to be taken as limiting the disclosure in any way.
