This application is a continuation application of International Application No. PCT JP2012 074963 filed Sep. 27 2012 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Further this application claims priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2011 212874 filed Sep. 28 2011 and Japanese Patent Application No. 2011 289796 filed Dec. 28 2011 the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

The present invention relates to a conductive composition a conductive member and a production method thereof a touch panel and a solar cell.

In recent years touch panels have been installed as input devices in display devices such as liquid crystal panels and electronic papers. Regarding the configuration of touch panels various configurations such as a resistant film system a surface acoustic wave system and an electrostatic capacitance system are known and the electrostatic capacitance system is known to be a system in which multi point touch operation is possible and increase in area can be easily achieved. For example an electrostatic capacitance type touch panel in which ITO indium tin oxide is used as a transparent conductive material has been disclosed see Information DISPLAY Vol. 26 No. 3 pp. 16 21 .

However there are problems in that indium which is a raw material of ITO is expensive and there are limitations on stable supply of indium the production cost is high because a vacuum process is required for the production of thin films and ITO films are brittle and have poor bending resistance. Therefore substitute substances such as metal nanowires carbon nanotubes PEDOT and polyaniline have also been suggested.

A conductive member having a conductive layer containing conductive fibers such as metal nanowires carbon nanotubes and complexes of carbon nanotubes and metals has been proposed see for example Japanese National Phase Publication No. 2009 505358 . The conductive member includes on a base material a conductive layer containing plural metal nanowires and when a photocurable composition is incorporated as a matrix into the conductive layer the conductive member can be easily processed into a conductive member having a conductive layer that contains a preferable conductive region and non conductive region by patterned exposure and development subsequent thereto.

As a different mode of the conductive member containing conductive fibers as described above a conductive member having a conductive layer that includes a preferable conductive region and non conductive region can be easily processed by a method of incorporating a non photocurable composition as a matrix into a conductive layer performing drying and or optionally crosslinking by a condensation reaction or a polymerization reaction to form a conductive layer subsequently further forming a resist layer imagewise as an upper layer to the conductive layer using an etching resist or the like and then performing an etching treatment a method of partially disconnecting the conductive network in a uniformly formed transparent conductive layer by irradiation of laser light or the like see for example Japanese National Phase Publication No. 2010 507199 and Japanese Patent Application Laid Open JP A No. 2010 44968 .

Furthermore as still another mode of the conductive member containing conductive fibers as described above there has also been proposed a conductive layer transferable conductive member in which a conductive layer containing conductive fibers is formed on a provisional support the conductive layer is transferred to a glass substrate or the like and then patterning by a photolithographic method or the like is optionally performed see for example JP A Nos. 2006 35771 and 2009 251186 .

Regarding the conductive fibers that are preferably used in the conductive members described above various materials are known such as metal nanowires and nanorods of silver gold copper or the like and carbon nanotubes carbon nanorods and composites of carbon nanotubes and a metal. Among them it is known that metal conductive fibers fainted from a metal such as silver gold or copper more preferably provide an excellent conductive member having low resistance and high transparency and silver nanowires that are excellent in the balance among low resistance properties durability and cost are particularly preferably used.

However there are cases in which when a conductive member using such metal conductive fibers are exposed for a long time to harsh conditions such as high temperature conditions high humidity conditions or the presence of ozone an increase in resistivity that is speculated to be attributable to oxidation or morphological change of the metal may occur and there are cases in which depending on the application an improvement of weather resistance is demanded.

Regarding the method for enhancing weather resistance of a transparent conductive material containing metal conductive fibers methods of using a metal adsorbing compound having a specific structure have been disclosed see for example Japanese National Phase Publication No. 2009 505358 and JP A No. 2009 146678 . The method exhibits effectiveness depending on specific storage conditions but there have been cases in which since a metal adsorbing compound exhibits strong adsorptive property to metal conductive fibers problems occur such as in that deterioration of conductivity or transparency of the conductive layer may occur as aggregation of the metal conductive fibers occurs at the time of production of a transparent conductive material to deteriorate homogeneity of the conductive layer and in that contact resistance between metal conductive fibers is increased whereby conductivity of the conductive layer is decreased.

Regarding a method for producing an aqueous dispersion containing metal nanowires a method of adding a metal complex solution or a metal ion solution into an aqueous solvent containing a halogen compound and a reducing agent has been disclosed see for example JP A No. 2010 84173 . In the producing method a desalting treatment is preferably carried out for the purpose of increasing the purity of the metal nanowires and it is speculated that when a desalting washing treatment disclosed in the Examples section is carried out most of the reducing agent that did not contribute to the formation of the metal nanowires is eliminated. JP A No. 2010 84173 has no description that the reducing agent that has been added at the time of reducing the metal complex intentionally remains nor of effects thereof.

As discussed above stable maintenance of the conductivity of a transparent conductive material containing metal conductive fibers even under harsh conditions such as high temperature conditions high humidity conditions or the presence of ozone has not been sufficiently achieved with the related art and there has been a demand for an improvement in weather resistance.

A problem to be solved by the invention is to provide a conductive composition containing metal conductive fibers which has excellent conductivity and transparency even if exposed to harsh conditions such as high temperature conditions high humidity conditions or the presence of ozone a conductive member having a conductive layer containing the conductive composition and a production method thereof and a touch panel and a solar cell each of which uses the conductive member.

wherein in Formula 2 Rrepresents a hydrogen atom an OH group an alkyl group an alkenyl group an alkynyl group an aryl group or a heterocyclic group.

The conductive composition according to the invention contains metal conductive fibers having an average minor axis length of from 1 nm to 150 nm. The metal conductive fibers may employ any of a solid structure a porous structure and a hollow structure but it is preferable that any one of a solid structure and a hollow structure is employed. In the invention a fiber having a solid structure may be referred to as a wire and a fiber having a hollow structure may be referred to as a tube.

Examples of the conductive metal material that forms the fibers include metal oxides such as ITO zinc oxide and tin oxide metallic carbon simple metal elements composite structures formed from plural metal elements and alloys formed from plural metals. Furthermore the conductive metal material may be fabricated into a fibrous form and then be surface treated and for example a plated metal fiber and the like can also be used.

From the viewpoint that a transparent conductive film can be easily formed it is preferable to use metal nanowires as the metal conductive fibers. The metal nanowires according to the invention are preferably metal nanowires having an average minor axis length of from 1 nm to 150 nm and an average major axis length of from 1 m to 100 m.

The average minor axis length average diameter of the metal nanowires is preferably from 1 nm to 50 nm more preferably from 5 nm to 30 nm and particularly preferably from 5 nm to 25 nm. When the average minor axis length is less than 1 nm there is a case that oxidation resistance is deteriorated and durability is poor. When the average minor axis length is greater than 150 nm there is a risk that deterioration of optical characteristics such as an increase in haze due to light scattering or the like may occur which is not preferable.

The average major axis length may be referred to as average length of the metal nanowires is preferably from 1 m to 40 m more preferably from 3 m to 35 m and particularly preferably from 5 m to 30 m. When the average major axis length of the metal nanowires is longer than 40 m there is a risk that aggregates may be generated at the time of production of the metal nanowire and when the average major axis length is shorter than 1 m there is a case that sufficient conductivity cannot be obtained.

Here the average minor axis length average diameter and the average major axis length of the metal nanowires can be determined by for example observing a transmission electron microscope TEM image or an optical microscope image using a TEM or an optical microscope. In the invention the average minor axis length average diameter and the average major axis length of the metal nanowires are determined such that 300 metal nanowires were observed using a transmission electron microscope TEM manufactured by JEOL Ltd. JEM 2000FX and the average values were defined as the average axis lengths of the metal nanowires. Regarding the average minor axis length in a case in which the cross section in the minor axis direction of the metal nanowires was not circular the length of the longest site measured in the minor axis direction was defined as the average minor axis length. Furthermore when the metal nanowire was bent in consideration of a circle having the bent segment as an arc a value calculated from the radius and curvature of the circle was defined as the average major axis length.

The coefficient of variation of the average minor axis length diameter of the metal nanowires used in the conductive layer according to the invention is preferably 40 or less more preferably 35 or less and particularly preferably 30 or less.

When the coefficient of variation is set to 40 or less conductivity with excellent durability can be easily secured.

The coefficient of variation of the average minor axis length diameter of the metal nanowires can be determined by for example measuring the average minor axis lengths diameters of 300 nanowires from a transmission electron microscopic TEM image and calculating the standard deviation and the average value.

Regarding the shape of the metal nanowires for example any arbitrary shape such as a cylindrical shape a cuboid shape or a pillar shape with a polygonal cross section can be employed and for applications where high transparency is required a cylindrical shape or a pillar shape having a cross section shape which is a polygon having 5 or more angles and does not have any acute angled angle is preferred.

The cross section shape of the metal nanowires can be detected by applying an aqueous dispersion liquid of the metal nanowire onto a base material and observing the cross section with a transmission electron microscope TEM .

There are no particular limitations on the metal for the metal nanowires and any metal may be used. One kind of metal may be used or two or more kinds of metals may be used in combination. The metals may also be used as alloys.

As the metal at least one metal selected from the group consisting of the metals of the 4th period the 5th period and the 6th period of the Long Periodic Table IUPAC 1991 is preferred at least one metal selected from Group 2 to Group 14 is more preferred at least one metal selected from Group 2 Group 8 Group 9 Group 10 Group 11 Group 12 Group 13 and Group 14 is even more preferred and it is particularly preferable that the metal include these metals as a main component.

Specific examples of the metal include copper silver gold platinum palladium nickel tin cobalt rhodium iridium iron ruthenium osmium manganese molybdenum tungsten niobium tantalum titanium bismuth antimony lead and alloys thereof. Among these copper silver gold platinum palladium nickel tin cobalt rhodium iridium and alloys thereof are preferred palladium copper silver gold platinum tin and alloys thereof are more preferred and particularly silver or an alloy containing silver which contains silver in an amount of from 50 mol to 100 mol more preferably containing silver in an amount of from 90 mol to 100 mol is preferred.

The metal nanowires may be produced by any method without any particular limitations and it is preferable to produce the metal nanowires by reducing metal ions in a solvent in which a halogen compound and a dispersant are dissolved in a manner such as shown below. Furthermore once metal nanowires are formed it is preferable to carry out a desalting treatment by a conventional method from the viewpoints of dispersibility and stability over time of the photosensitive layer.

Furthermore regarding the method of producing a metal nanowire the methods described in JP A Nos. 2009 215594 2009 242880 2009 299162 2010 84173 2010 86714 and the like can be used.

As the solvent used in the production of the metal nanowires hydrophilic solvents are preferred and examples thereof include water alcohols ethers and ketones. These may be used singly or two or more kinds may be used in combination.

When heating is performed at the time of producing the metal nanowires the heating temperature is preferably 250 C. or lower more preferably from 20 C. to 200 C. even more preferably from 30 C. to 180 C. and particularly preferably from 40 C. to 170 C.

If necessary the temperature may be changed during the process of particle formation and the change of temperature in the middle of the course may be effective in the control of nucleation suppression of renucleation and enhancement of monodispersity as a result of the promotion of selective growth.

There are no particular limitations on the reducing agent and the reducing agent can be appropriately selected among those agents capable of reducing a metal ion. Examples thereof include metal borohydride salts aluminum hydride salts alkanolamines aliphatic amines heterocyclic amines aromatic amines aralkylamines alcohols organic acids reducing sugars sugar alcohols sulfurous acid salts hydrazine compounds dextrin hydroquinone hydroxylamine ethylene glycol and glutathione. Among these reducing sugars sugar alcohols as derivatives thereof and ethylene glycol are more preferred and reducing sugars sugar alcohols as derivatives thereof and ethylene glycol are particularly preferred. In the reducing agent there are compounds which also function as dispersants or solvents and these compounds can be used preferably in a similar manner.

It is preferable to remove the reducing agent used in the formation of metal nanowires such that a residual amount is less than 0.1 by mass with respect to silver after the formation of the metal nanowires by techniques such as ultrafiltration dialysis gel filtration decantation and centrifugation.

At the time of producing the metal nanowires it is preferable to perform the production with adding a dispersant and a halogen compound or metal halide fine particles.

The timing of the addition of the dispersant and the halogen compound may be before the addition or after the addition of the reducing agent or may be before the addition or after the addition of a metal ion or metal halide fine particles. However in order to obtain nanowires having superior monodispersity two or more separate steps of addition of the halogen compound is preferable.

The dispersant may be added to the reaction solution before the preparation of particles or may be added after particle preparation. The addition of the dispersant may be carried out in a single step or may be divided into two or more steps.

Examples of the dispersant include amino group containing compounds mercapto group containing compounds sulfide containing compounds amino acids or derivatives thereof peptide compounds and polymers such as polysaccharides natural polymers derived from polysaccharides synthetic polymers and gels derived therefrom.

Preferable examples of polymer compounds that are suitably used as dispersants include hydrophilic polymers such as gelatin polyvinyl alcohol methyl cellulose hydroxypropyl cellulose polyalkyleneamines poly meth acrylic acid salts thereof or partial alkyl esters thereof polyvinylpyrrolidone copolymers containing a polyvinylpyrrolidone structure and poly meth acrylic acid derivatives having an amino group or a mercapto group which are polymers having protective colloid properties.

The polymer used as a dispersant preferably has a weight average molecular weight Mw as measured by a gel permeation chromatographic method of from 3 000 to 300 000 and more preferably from 5 000 to 100 000.

In regard to the structure of the compound that can be used as a dispersant for example reference can be made to the descriptions in Ganryo no Jiten Dictionary of Pigments edited by Seijiro ITOH published by Asakura Publishing Co. Ltd. 2000 .

The shape of the metal nanowires to be obtained can be controlled by the kind of the dispersant used.

The halogen compound is preferably a compound containing bromide ion chloride ion or iodide ion. For example metal halides such as sodium bromide sodium chloride sodium iodide potassium iodide potassium bromide and potassium chloride or the following halide ion salts of onium salts that also function as dispersants are preferred.

As a substitute of the halogen compound silver halide fine particles may be used and both a halogen compound and silver halide fine particles may also be used.

Furthermore a single substance having the functions of both a dispersant and a halogen compound may also be used. That is the functions of both a dispersant and a halogen compound are exhibited by a single compound.

Preferred examples of the halogen compound having functions as a dispersant include halide ion salts of oniums preferably ammonium or phosphonium .

Examples thereof include hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide HTAB hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride HTAC dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride stearyltrimethylammonium bromide stearyltrimethylammonium chloride decyltrimethylammonium bromide decyltrimethylammonium chloride dimethyldistearylammonium bromide dimethyldistearylammonium chloride dilauryldimethylammonium bromide dilauryldimethylammonium chloride dimethyldipalmitylammonium bromide and dimethyldipalmitylammonium chloride.

These compounds may be eliminated as necessary after the formation of the metal nanowires by techniques such as ultrafiltration dialysis gel filtration decantation and centrifugation.

It is preferable that the metal nanowires do not contain inorganic ions such as alkali metal ions alkaline earth metal ions halide ions and the like as much as possible. The electrical conductivity at the time when the metal nanowires are dispersed in an aqueous dispersion is preferably 1 mS cm or less more preferably 0.1 mS cm or less and even more preferably 0.05 mS cm or less.

The viscosity at 20 C. when the metal nanowires are dispersed into an aqueous dispersion is preferably from 0.5 mPa s to 100 mPa s and more preferably from 1 mPa s to 50 mPa s.

Preferred examples of the metal conductive fibers other than metal nanowires include metal nanotubes which are hollow fibers.

There are no particular limitations on the material for the metal nanotubes and any metal may be used. For example the materials for the metal nanowires described above can be used.

Regarding the shape of the metal nanotubes the metal nanotubes may have a single layer structure or may have a multilayer structure however from the viewpoint having excellent conductivity and thermal conductivity a single layer structure is preferable.

The thickness difference between the outer diameter and the inner diameter of the metal nanotube is preferably from 3 nm to 80 nm and more preferably from 3 nm to 30 nm. When the thickness is 3 nm or more sufficient oxidation resistance can be obtained and when the thickness is 80 nm or less the occurrence of light scattering caused by the metal nanotubes is suppressed.

In the invention the average minor axis length of the metal nanotubes is 150 nm or less similarly to the case of the metal nanowires. The preferred average minor axis length is the same as that of the metal nanowires. Furthermore the average major axis length is preferably from 1 m to 40 m more preferably from 3 m to 35 m and even more preferably from 5 m to 30 m.

The method of producing the metal nanotubes is not particularly limited and can be appropriately selected according to the purpose. For example the method described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005 0056118 and the like can be used.

The aspect ratio of the metal conductive fibers used in the invention is preferably 50 or greater. The aspect ratio generally means the ratio of a longer side to a shorter side of a fibrous material ratio of average major axis length average minor axis length .

The method of measuring the aspect ratio is not particularly limited and can be appropriately selected according to the purpose. Examples thereof include a method of measurement using an electron microscope.

When the aspect ratio of the metal conductive fibers is measured with an electron microscope it may be confirmed in one field of view of the electron microscope whether the aspect ratio of the metal conductive fibers is 50 or greater. Furthermore the overall aspect ratio of the metal conductive fibers can be estimated by separately measuring the average major axis lengths and the average minor axis length of the metal conductive fibers respectively.

When the metal conductive fibers have a tube shape the outer diameter of the tubes is used as the diameter for calculating the aspect ratio.

The aspect ratio of the metal conductive fibers can be appropriately selected according to the purpose and the aspect ratio is preferably from 50 to 1 000 000 and more preferably from 100 to 1 000 000.

When the aspect ratio is 50 or greater the formation of a network by the metal conductive fibers is facilitated and sufficient conductivity can be easily secured. Furthermore when the aspect ratio is 1 000 000 or less a stable liquid having excellent production suitability without having the metal conductive fibers entangled at the time of formation of the metal conductive fibers or during handling of the metal conductive fibers thereafter may be readily obtained.

As the method for producing a compound represented by Formula 1 or 2 any known method can be used. The conditions such as the temperature at the time of producing these compounds selection of the solvent and the kinds and amounts of reaction reagents can be easily set by those ordinarily skilled in the art and can be experimentally determined. Thus a person skilled in the art can easily produce those compounds.

The amount of addition of the compound represented by Formula 1 or 2 is from 0.1 by mass to 1000 by mass with respect to the metal conductive fibers. When the amount of addition is in the above range a conductive composition with which a conductive layer having high conductivity and transparency is obtained even if the composition is stored under conditions such as high temperature conditions high humidity conditions or the presence of ozone. That is when the amount of addition is less than 0.1 the effects of the invention are not sufficiently exhibited and when the amount of addition is more than 1000 there is a case that inhibition of conductivity occurs or that transparency is deteriorated due to a problem with solubility in the coating liquid thus is not preferable. From the viewpoint of achieving both the basic characteristics such as conductivity and transparency that are required in a transparent conductive material and resistance properties in a high temperature and high humidity environment the amount of addition is preferably from 0.1 by mass to 100 by mass more preferably from 1 by mass to 50 by mass and particularly preferably from 2 by mass to 30 by mass.

The method for adding the compound represented by Formula 1 or 2 into the conductive layer can be selected from an arbitrary method that can be carried out. Preferred examples thereof include a method of adding the compound represented by Formula 1 or 2 into a conductive composition a method of forming on a base material a layer containing metal conductive fibers in advance and immersing the layer into a solution containing the compound represented by Formula 1 or 2 and a method of adding the compound represented by Formula 1 or 2 in advance into a separate layer other than the conductive layer and introducing the compound into the conductive layer by diffusing the compound from the separate layer into the conductive layer at the time of coating and drying of the conductive layer is applied and dried.

More preferred examples thereof include a method of adding the compound represented by Formula 1 or 2 into a conductive composition and a method of forming on a base material a layer containing metal conductive fibers in advance and immersing the layer into a solution containing the compound represented by Formula 1 or 2 . A particularly preferred examples thereof include a method adding the compound represented by Formula 1 or 2 into a conductive composition.

There is a case that a method of adding the compound represented by Formula 1 or 2 in advance at the time of producing metal conductive fibers adversely affects the control of the form of the metal conductive fibers and most of the compounds are removed during the washing process after the formation of the metal conductive fibers and as a result of which the amount becomes smaller than the amount required to exhibit the effects according to the invention so that a shortfall thereof needs to be replenished again thus is not efficient.

The conductive composition according to the invention is provided on a base material to serve as a conductive layer. As the conductive layer contains the compound represented by Formula 1 or Formula 2 described above a distinct and unexpected effect of suppressing the decrease in conductivity that occurs when the conductive layer is exposed for a long time to harsh conditions such as high temperature conditions high humidity conditions or the presence of ozone is exerted.

The detailed mechanism of the effect described above has not been fully revealed. However the compound represented by Formula 1 is an organic compound exhibiting reducing properties that are known to follow the Kendal Pelz rule or a reducing organic compound that is known as a main developer agent for a thermally developing photographic sensitive material. The general structural formula of the compound is illustrated in for example T. H. James The Theory of the Photographic Process 4th ed. Macmillan Publishing Co. Inc. p. 299 and U.S. Pat. No. 4 845 019 column 12 lines 22 to 34. Representative compounds are illustrated in T. H. James The Theory of the Photographic Process 4th ed. Macmillan Publishing Co. Inc. pp. 298 327 Japanese Patent No. 2788831 p. 6 Japanese Patent No. 2890055 pp. 1 4 Japanese Patent No. 4727637 pp. 12 15 and the like. Furthermore the compound represented by Formula 2 is an aldehyde compound or a precursor thereof and is a compound exhibiting reducing properties.

It is assumed that when the compound represented by Formula 1 or Formula 2 exhibiting reducing properties exists in a certain amount or more in the vicinity of the metal conductive fibers the compound reacts with chemical species that cause oxidation of the metal conductive fibers such as oxygen ozone and peroxides prior to the metal conductive fibers under conditions such as high temperature conditions high humidity conditions or the presence of ozone so that the compound itself is oxidized and thus the decomposition of the metal conductive fibers induced by oxidation is suppressed and as a result of which a decrease in conductivity is suppressed.

It is assumed that due to such a mechanism when the compound represented by Formula 1 or Formula 2 is contained in an amount of 0.1 by mass or more with respect to the metal conductive fibers the effect according to the invention such as described above is exhibited.

Furthermore in the invention from the viewpoint of enhancing durability of the metal conductive fibers under high temperature conditions or high humidity conditions or in the presence of ozone which is the effect of the invention among the compounds represented by Formula 1 and Formula 2 a compound represented by Formula 1 is preferably selected. Furthermore among the compounds represented by Formula 1 compounds represented by Formula 3 to Formula 17 are preferably selected and compounds represented by Formula 3 Formula 4 Formula 7 Formula 8 Formula 11 Formula 12 Formula 13 or Formula 14 are more preferably selected and a compound represented by Formula 11 or Formula 12 is particularly preferably selected. The compounds of Formula 1 to Formula 17 all exhibit the effect of the invention by exhibiting reducing properties. However in addition to reducing properties the extent of exhibition of the effect is also influenced by factors such as stability of the compounds affinity or adsorbability to the metal conductive fibers compatibility with the binder dissolubility in the solvent and resistance to bleed out at the time of drying of the conductive composition thus it is assumed that in a preferable compound these factors are combined to preferably exhibit the effect.

It is preferable that the conductive composition according to the invention further contain c a compound capable of adsorbing to a metal or a compound capable of coordinating with a metal ion. The compound capable of adsorbing to a metal or the compound capable of coordinating with a metal ion is not particular limited and can be appropriately selected according to the purpose however suitable examples thereof include azole compounds benzotriazole 4 methylbenzotriazole 5 methylbenzotriazole 4 ethylbenzotriazole 5 6 dimethylbenzotriazole tolyltriazole benzyltriazole 5 6 dimethylbenzimidazole thiadiazole tetrazole and the like triazine compounds ammonium compounds phosphonium compounds mercapto compounds 2 mercaptobenzoxazole 2 mercaptobenzothiazole 2 mercaptotetrazole 2 mercaptopyrimidine or 2 mercaptobenzimidazole dithiothiadiazole alkyldithiothiadiazole alkylthiol and the like sulfide compounds and disulfide compounds.

These compounds capable of adsorbing to a metal or compounds capable of coordinating with a metal ion can further enhance the effect of the invention by adsorbing to a metal surface or forming a complex to form a coating film and thereby preventing corrosion or exhibiting an anti rusting effect.

The method for adding a compound capable of adsorbing to a metal or a compound capable of coordinating with a metal ion can be selected from any methods and for example the compound may be added alone or as a solution in which the compound is dissolved or dispersed in an appropriate solvent into a composition for conductive layer formation or a conductive layer that has been produced may be immersed in a solution of a compound capable of adsorbing to a metal or a compound capable of coordinating with a metal ion.

A preferred amount of addition of the compound capable of adsorbing to a metal or the compound capable of coordinating with a metal ion is preferably from 0.1 to 100 more preferably from 1 to 50 and particularly preferably from 2 to 25 with respect to the mass of the metal conductive fibers. When the amount of addition is adjusted to from 0.1 to 100 corrosion of the metal conductive fibers or the occurrence of rusting is effectively prevented while high conductivity is maintained.

When the conductive composition according to the invention is prepared into a coating liquid containing a solvent and the coating liquid is applied onto a surface of a base material to form a conductive layer whereby a conductive member can be obtained.

The conductive composition according to the invention preferably contains a solvent for formation onto a preferable base material by application. In the production of metal conductive fibers when an aqueous dispersion liquid in which metal conductive fibers are dispersed in an aqueous medium is prepared using water as a solvent the compound represented by Formula 1 or Formula 2 described above may be incorporated into the aqueous dispersion liquid in an amount in the range of from 0.1 by mass to 1000 by mass with respect to the metal conductive fibers.

When a solvent which is different from the solvent used in the production of the metal conductive fibers for example water for example an organic solvent such as propylene glycol monomethyl ether propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate or the like is preferred as a solvent for the conductive composition coating liquid the compound represented by Formula 1 or Formula 2 described above may be incorporated in an amount in the range of from 0.1 by mass to 1000 by mass with respect to the metal conductive fibers after carrying out solvent replacement of replacing a part of or entire solvent used in the production of the metal conductive fibers for example water with a preferable solvent for example propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate .

In this manner the conductive composition coating liquid in the invention can be prepared. Examples of the solvent for a coating liquid include the solvents described above and further examples thereof include alcohol based solvents such as methanol ethanol 1 propanol 2 propanol butanol 1 methoxy 2 propanol and 3 methoxybutanol ketone based solvents such as acetone methyl ethyl ketone methyl isobutyl ketone and cyclohexanone ester based solvents such as methyl acetate ethyl acetate propyl acetate isopropyl acetate butyl acetate ethyl 3 ethoxypropionate methyl 3 methoxypropionate ethyl lactate butyrolactone and propylene carbonate amide based solvents such as N methyl 2 pyrrolidinone and N ethyl 2 pyrrolidinone benzene based solvents such as toluene and xylene and mixture solvents thereof.

The concentration of the metal conductive fibers in the coating liquid described above is appropriately selected in the range of from 0.001 by mass to 50 by mass according to the preferable thickness of the conductive layer.

The conductive member of the invention has on a base material a conductive layer containing at least a metal conductive fibers having an average minor axis length of from 1 nm to 150 nm and b a compound represented by Formula 1 or Formula 2 .

The conductive layer may be provided directly on the base material or may be provided on a single or a plurality of other layers such as an undercoat layer an intermediate layer a cushion layer or the like that is provided on the base material. Furthermore other layers such as a surface protective layer a hard coat layer an oxygen barrier layer and an antistatic layer may be further provided on the conductive layer.

As the base material there are no particular limitations on the shape structure size and the like as long as the base material is capable of carrying the conductive layer and the base material can be appropriately selected according to the purpose. Examples of the shape include a plate shape a film shape and a sheet shape. Examples of the structure include a single layer structure and a layered structure. The base material may be transparent or may be opaque.

The material of the base material is not particularly limited and can be appropriately selected according to the purpose. Examples thereof include a transparent glass substrate a sheet film made of a synthetic resin a metal substrate a ceramic plate and a silicon wafer that is used in semiconductor substrates.

Examples of the transparent glass substrate include super white glass blue sheet glass and silica coated blue sheet glass. Also a thin layer glass base material having a thickness of from 10 m to several hundred micrometers m which has been developed in recent years may also be used.

Examples of the sheet made of a synthetic resin include a polyethylene terephthalate PET sheet a polycarbonate sheet a triacetyl cellulose TAC sheet a polyether sulfone sheet a polyester sheet an acrylic resin sheet a vinyl chloride resin sheet an aromatic polyamide resin sheet a polyamideimide sheet and a polyimide sheet.

Examples of the metal substrate include an aluminum plate a copper plate a nickel plate and a stainless steel plate.

The base material can be optionally subjected to a pretreatment such as a chemical treatment with a silane coupling agent or the like a plasma treatment ion plating sputtering a vapor phase reaction method or vacuum deposition.

The average thickness of the base material is not particularly limited and can be appropriately selected according to the purpose. Generally the average thickness is preferably selected in the range of from 1 m to 500 m more preferably from 3 m to 400 m and particularly preferably from 5 m to 300 m. When the average thickness of the base material is adjusted to 1 m or greater handling of the conductive member is easier and when the average thickness is adjusted to 500 m or less adequate flexibility of the base material is obtained handling is easier and even in a case in which the conductive member is used as a transfer type conductive member transfer uniformity is easily secured.

When transparency is required in the conductive member a base material having a total visible light transmittance of 70 or higher is preferred a base material having a total visible light transmittance of 85 or higher is more preferred and a base material having a total visible light transmittance of 90 or higher is particularly preferred.

In the invention a base material that has been colored to the extent that the purpose of the invention is not impaired can also be used as the base material.

The conductive layer according to the invention contains a metal conductive fibers having an average minor axis length of from 1 nm to 150 nm and b a compound represented by Formula 1 or Formula 2 .

The average thickness of the conductive layer in the invention is preferably from 0.01 m to 2 m more preferably from 0.02 m to 1 m even more preferably from 0.03 m to 0.8 m and particularly preferably from 0.05 m to 0.5 m. When the average thickness of the conductive layer is 0.01 m or greater it is more likely to achieve a conductive layer having sufficient durability or film strength and in plane distribution of conductivity becomes uniform. Furthermore when the average thickness of the conductive layer is set to 2 m or less a conductive layer having high transmittance and high transparency can be easily obtained.

As the method for forming a conductive layer on a base material a general coating method can be carried out using the conductive composition coating liquid described above. The method is not particularly limited and can be appropriately selected according to the purpose. Examples thereof include a roll coating method a bar coating method a dip coating method a spin coating method a casting method a die coating method a blade coating method a gravure coating method a curtain coating method a spray coating method and a doctor coating method.

In the conductive layer according to the invention another conductive material for example conductive fine particles can be used in combination in addition to the metal conductive fibers as long as the other conductive material does not impair the effect of the invention. From the viewpoint of the effect the proportion of the metal conductive fibers described above is preferably 50 or more more preferably 60 or more and particularly preferably 75 or more as a volume ratio in the conductive layer. The proportion of the metal conductive fibers may be hereinafter referred to as a proportion of the metal conductive fibers .

When the proportion of the metal conductive fibers is adjusted to 50 or more sufficient conductivity can be easily secured and durability tends to be favorable. Furthermore particles having a shape other than that of the metal conductive fibers are not preferable since the particles do not contribute significantly to conductivity and has absorption. Particularly in the case of a metal when the particles have a shape with strong plasmon absorption such as a spherical shape there is a case that transparency is deteriorated.

Here regarding the proportion of the metal conductive fibers for example in a case in which the metal conductive fibers are silver nanowires the proportion of the metal conductive fibers can be determined by filtering an aqueous dispersion liquid of the silver nanowire to separate the silver nanowires from other particles and measuring the amount of silver remaining on paper and the amount of the conductive material that has penetrated through the filter paper respectively using an ICP atomic emission spectrometer. The proportion is determined by observing the metal conductive fibers remaining on the filter paper by TEM observing the average minor axis length of 300 metal conductive fibers and examining the distribution of the metal conductive fibers.

The method for measuring the average minor axis length and the average major axis length of the metal conductive fiber is as described above.

The conductive layer of the conductive member may further contain a matrix. Here the term matrix is a general name for a substance that forms a layer containing metal conductive fibers and has a function of stably maintaining the dispersion of the metal conductive fibers. The matrix may be a non photosensitive material or may be a photosensitive material.

When the conductive layer is configure to include a composition containing only metal conductive fibers and a compound represented by Formula 1 or Formula 2 an embodiment in which an adhesive layer is provided on a base material in advance and a conductive layer configured to have the composition described above is provided on the adhesive layer is preferable. When the conductive layer contains a matrix dispersion of the metal conductive fibers in the conductive layer is maintained in a stable manner and strong adhesion between the base material and the conductive layer is secured even in a case in which the conductive layer is formed on the surface of the base material without interposing an adhesive layer therebetween thus is more preferable.

When the conductive layer contains a matrix the content ratio of the matrix metal conductive fibers is appropriately in the range of from 0.001 1 to 100 1 in a mass ratio. When the content ratio is selected in such a range a conductive layer having appropriate adhesive force to the base material and having an appropriate surface resistance can be obtained. The content ratio of the matrix metal conductive fibers is in a mass ratio more preferably in the range of from 0.01 1 to 20 1 even more preferably in the range of from 1 1 to 15 1 and particularly preferably in the range of from 2 1 to 8 1.

Regarding the alkoxides one kind of compound may be used alone or two or more kinds of compounds may be used in combination.

A conductive layer containing a sol gel cured film as a matrix is preferably formed by forming a coating liquid film by applying onto a base material a water containing solution containing metal conductive fibers and a specific alkoxide compound as a coating liquid hereinafter also referred to as sol gel coating liquid causing a reaction of hydrolysis and polycondensation hereinafter the reaction of hydrolysis and polycondensation are also referred to as a sol gel reaction of the specific alkoxide compound in the coating liquid film and further heating the reaction product as needed to evaporate water and dry the reaction product.

In order to accelerate the sol gel reaction it is preferable to add an acidic catalyst or a basic catalyst. Hereinafter the catalyst is explained.

As the catalyst any catalyst can be used as long as the reaction of hydrolysis and polycondensation of an alkoxide compound is accelerated.

Examples of such a catalyst include acids and basic compounds and these compounds may be used as they are or may be used in a state of being dissolved in a solvent such as water or alcohol hereinafter these are also collectively referred to as acidic catalysts and basic catalysts respectively .

There are no particular limitations on the concentration when an acid or a basic compound is dissolved in a solvent and the concentration may be appropriately selected in accordance with the characteristics of the acid or basic compound used the desired content of the catalyst and the like. Here when the concentration of the acid or the basic compound that forms a part of the catalyst is high the rate of hydrolysis and polycondensation tend to increase. However when a basic catalyst having an excessively high concentration is used there is a case in which a precipitate is produced and appears as defects in the conductive layer. Therefore in the case of using a basic catalyst the concentration is preferably 1 N or less as calculated in terms of the concentration in an aqueous solution.

The kind of the acidic catalyst or basic catalyst is not particularly limited. When it is necessary to use a catalyst at a high concentration a compound in which a residual amount is few in the conductive layer after drying is preferred.

The dissolving liquid that dissolves the metal conductive fibers in the patterning method described in the above item 2 can be appropriately selected depending on the metal conductive fibers. For example when the metal conductive fibers are silver nanowires a bleaching fixing liquid that is used mainly in the bleaching and fixing process of a photographic paper of a silver halide color photosensitive material in the so called photographic science industry examples thereof include a strong acid an oxidizing agent and hydrogen peroxide. Among these the bleaching fixing liquid dilute nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide are more preferred and the bleaching fixing liquid and dilute nitric acid are particularly preferred. Regarding the dissolution of silver nanowires using a dissolving liquid that dissolves the metal conductive fibers a part of the silver nanowires to which the dissolving liquid is applied need not be completely dissolved and a part of the silver nanowires may remain as long as conductivity is lost.

Regarding the bleaching fixing liquid for example the treatment material or the treatment method described in page 26 lower right column line 1 to page 34 upper right column line 9 of JP A No. H02 207250 and page 5 upper left column line 17 to page 18 lower right column line 20 of JP A No. H04 97355 can be preferably applied.

The bleaching fixing time is preferably 180 seconds or shorter more preferably 120 seconds or shorter and 1 second or longer and even more preferably 90 seconds or shorter and 5 seconds or longer. Furthermore the water washing or stabilization time is preferably 180 seconds or shorter and more preferably 120 seconds or shorter and 1 second or longer.

The bleaching fixing liquid is not particularly limited as long as it is a photographic bleaching fixing liquid and can be appropriately selected according to the purpose. Examples thereof include CP 48S and CP 49E bleaching fixing agents for color paper manufactured by Fujifilm Corp. EKTACOLOR RA bleaching fixing liquid manufactured by Eastman Kodak Co. and bleaching fixing liquids D J2P 02 P2 D 30P2R 01 and D 22P2R 01 manufactured by Dainippon Printing Co. Ltd. Among these CP 48S and CP 49E are particularly preferred.

The viscosity at 25 C. of the dissolving liquid that dissolves the metal conductive fibers is preferably from 5 mPa s to 300 000 mPa s and more preferably from 10 mPa s to 150 000 mPa s. When the viscosity is adjusted to 5 mPa s or greater it is easier to control the diffusion of the dissolving liquid to a desired range and patterning with clear boundaries between a conductive region and a non conductive region is secured. On the other hand when the viscosity is adjusted to 300 000 mPa s or less implementation of printing of the dissolving liquid without any load can be secured and also the treatment time required for the dissolution of the metal conductive fibers can be completed within a desired time.

Patterned application of the dissolving liquid that dissolves the metal conductive fibers is not particularly limited as long as the dissolving liquid can be applied in a patterned manner and the method can be appropriately selected according to the purpose. Examples thereof include screen printing inkjet printing and a method of forming an etching mask in advance using a resist agent or the like and performing coater coating roller coating dipping coating or spray coating thereon using a dissolving liquid. Among these screen printing inkjet printing coater coating and dip immersion coating are particularly preferred.

The kind of the pattern is not particularly limited and can be appropriately selected according to the purpose. Examples thereof include characters symbols shapes figures and wiring patterns.

The size of the pattern is not particularly limited and can be appropriately selected according to the purpose. The size may be any size ranging from a nanometer size to a millimeter size.

In the first preferred embodiment and the second preferred embodiment of the invention it is preferable to have at least one intermediate layer between the base material and the conductive layer. When an intermediate layer is provided between the base material and the conductive layer an enhancement of at least one of the adhesiveness between the base material and the conductive layer the total light transmittance of the conductive layer the haze value of the conductive layer and the film strength of the conductive layer can be achieved.

Examples of the intermediate layer include an adhesive layer for enhancing the adhesive force between the base material and the conductive layer and a functional layer for enhancing the functionality by an interaction with the components contained in the conductive layer. These layers are appropriately provided according to the purpose.

There are no particular limitations on the material used in the intermediate layer as long as a material enhances at least any one of the characteristics described above.

For example when an adhesive layer is provided as an intermediate layer a material selected from the polymers silane coupling agents and titanium coupling agents that are used in adhesives and a sol gel film obtained by hydrolysis and polycondensation of an alkoxysilane compound is included.

Furthermore it is preferable that the intermediate layer that is in contact with the conductive layer that is referring to the intermediate layer when the intermediate layer is a single layer and referring to an intermediate layer that is in contact with the conductive layer when the intermediate layer includes a plurality of layers is a functional layer containing a compound which has a functional group capable of interacting with the metal conductive fibers contained in the conductive layer from the viewpoint that a conductive layer having excellent total light transmittance haze value and film strength is obtained. In the case of having such an intermediate layer when the conductive layer contains metal conductive fibers and a matrix a conductive layer having excellent film strength is obtained.

The mechanism for this is not clear but it is contemplated that when an intermediate layer containing a compound which has a functional group capable of interacting with the metal conductive fibers contained in the conductive layer is provided by the interaction between the metal conductive fibers contained in the conductive layer and the compound which has the above described functional group and is contained in the intermediate layer aggregation of conductive materials in the conductive layer is suppressed so that uniform dispersibility is improved a decrease in transparency or haze that is caused by aggregation of the conductive materials in the conductive layer is suppressed and also an increase in the film strength is achieved due to the adhesiveness. An intermediate layer that is capable of exhibiting such an interaction may be hereinafter referred to as a functional layer.

As the functional group that is capable of interacting with the metal conductive fibers for example in a case in which the metal conductive fibers are silver nanowires the functional group is more preferably at least one selected from the group consisting of an amide group an amino group a mercapto group a carboxylic acid group a sulfonic acid group a phosphoric acid group a phosphonic acid group or salts thereof. Even more preferably the functional group is preferably an amino group a mercapto group a phosphoric acid group a phosphonic acid group or a salt thereof and most preferably an amino group.

Examples of the compound having such a functional group described above include compounds having an amide group such as ureidopropyltriethoxysilane polyacrylamide and poly N methylacrylamide compounds having an amino group such as N aminoethyl aminopropyltrimethoxysilane 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane bis hexamethylene triamine and poly 2 aminoethylacrylamide compounds having a mercapto group such as 3 mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane and 2 mercaptoethyltrimethoxysilane compounds having a group of sulfonic acid or a salt thereof such as poly sodium p styrenesulfonate and poly acrylamido 2 methylpropanesulfonic acid compounds having a carboxylic acid group such as polyacrylic acid polymethacrylic acid and polyacrylic acid partial sodium salt compounds having a phosphoric acid group such as poly 2 phosphonoxyethyl methacrylate and compounds having a phosphonic acid group such as polyvinylphosphonic acid.

When these functional groups are selected aggregation of the metal conductive fibers at the time of drying is suppressed by the occurrence of an interaction between the metal conductive fibers and the functional group contained in the intermediate layer after application of a coating liquid for conductive layer formation whereby a conductive layer in which the metal conductive fibers are uniformly dispersed can be formed.

The intermediate layer can be formed by applying onto a substrate a liquid in which a compound that forms the intermediate layer is dissolved or dispersed and emulsified and drying the liquid. Regarding the coating method a general method can be used. There are no particular limitations on the method and the method can be appropriately selected according to the purpose. Examples thereof include a roll coating method a bar coating method a dip coating method a spin coating method a casting method a die coating method a blade coating method a gravure coating method a curtain coating method a spray coating method and a doctor coating method.

When the glass transition temperature is lower than 40 C. there is a case in which the cushion layer is excessively soft at room temperature and handling ability is poor. When the glass transition temperature is higher than 150 C. there is a case in which the cushion layer is not softened in a thermal lamination method and transferability of the conductive layer is poor. The glass transition temperature may be adjusted by adding a plasticizer or the like.

Examples of the other components include the organic polymer materials described in paragraph 0007 and thereafter of JP A No. H05 72724 various plasticizers for adjusting the adhesive force to the base material overcooling materials adhesion improving agents fillers oxidation inhibitors surfactants mold releasing agents thermal polymerization inhibitors viscosity adjusting agents and solvents.

Examples thereof include a roll coating method a bar coating method a dip coating method a spin coating method a casting method a die coating method a blade coating method a gravure coating method a curtain coating method a spray coating method and a doctor coating method.

Conductive members 2 1 to 2 3 were produced according to a method that was different from the method for producing the conductive members 1 25 1 2 and 1 35 of Example 1 only in that Ag 2 was used instead of Ag 1 as the silver nanowire aqueous dispersion liquid. Furthermore similarly conductive members 2 4 to 2 6 were produced using Ag 3 as the silver nanowire aqueous dispersion liquid.

From Table 3 it is understood that the effect of the invention is also effective for thicker silver nanowires having increased average minor axis lengths of silver nanowires. It is understood that along with the increase in the average minor axis length of silver nanowires heat resistance moist heat resistance and ozone resistance are improved in a conductive member that does not contain the compound according to the invention however such improvement is insufficient. It is also understood that when the average minor axis length of silver nanowires increases the haze value increases thus silver nanowires having a smaller average minor axis length exhibit more preferable optical characteristics as a transparent conductive film.

That is it is understood that in order to realize more preferable optical characteristics as a transparent conductive film it is effective to use silver nanowires having a shorter average minor axis length that is thinner and as a means for improving heat resistance moist heat resistance and ozone resistance that are present at that time the invention is particularly effective.
