Increasingly enterprises are deploying Self Service Terminals SSTs at various locations for use by consumers. The locations can include financial institutions grocery stores retail stores government venues entertainment venues gaming venues transportation venues and the like.

The SSTs save the enterprises money by reducing onsite support staff and increasing the operational throughput by servicing consumers more efficiently.

However the SSTs are electromechanical devices that include a variety of hardware and software modules which do fail on occasion requiring onsite service. Moreover the SSTs can from time to time require new modules updated modules or require that some modules been removed from the SSTs. Thus a support staff of service engineers technicians must be maintained by the enterprises.

Moreover some SSTs lack any network connection such that remote monitoring and management becomes problematic such as a typical vending machine. While other SSTs have very restrictive and secure network connections due to the very nature of the business associated with these SSTs such as an Automated Teller Machine ATM . For example ATM networks may be owned and operated by one company for security reasons while a different company manages and services the ATM. This means that the servicing company for the ATM has limited and in some cases no access to the ATM s network for supporting the ATM.

Thus remote network monitoring and maintenance of some SSTs is problematic for an enterprise. Moreover even when an enterprise relies on its service engineers in the field to report back issues however insignificant the information for those issues is often incomplete misleading or in some cases even completely missing a service engineer neglects to report the information . So monitoring and managing a particular SST is inefficient and obtaining a system wide perspective on all SSTs serviced by the enterprise becomes a next to impossible feat.

In various embodiments methods and systems for out of band monitoring and management of Self Service Terminal SSTs are presented.

According to an embodiment a method for out of band monitoring and management of SSTs is provided. Specifically a connection to a SST that is made by a portable memory device is detected. Next a background process is executed to write terminal information related to operation metrics of the SST to the portable memory device as a service engineer interacts with an interface of the SST. The portable memory device is subsequently interfaced to a different processing device that utilizes a network connection to connect to a server and provide the operational metrics for analysis without interaction of the service engineer.

Furthermore the various components that are identified in the are illustrated and the arrangement of the components is presented for purposes of illustration only. It is to be noted that other arrangements with more or less components are possible without departing from the out of band monitoring and managing of SSTs presented herein and below.

The methods and system presented herein and below for out of band monitoring and managing of SSTs can be implemented in whole or in part in one all or some combination of the components shown with the architecture . The methods and system are programmed as executable instructions in memory and or non transitory computer readable storage media and executed on one or more processors associated with the components.

Specifically the architecture permits out of band monitoring and managing of a SST utilizing a portable memory device to transfer information to and from the SST and transfer information to and from an enterprise server using the enterprise system and through a processing device . The details of this approach and in view of the components within the architecture are now presented with reference to an embodiment of the within the context of ATM maintenance and support systems where the SST is referred to as an ATM and the portable memory device is a secure Universal Serial Bus USB device .

Furthermore the phrase out of band refers to electronic communications that occur outside traditional network communications for an ATM .

However before discussion of the architecture is presented it is to be noted that the methods and system presented herein are not limited to ATM solutions that is any SST terminal kiosk vending machine check in and or check out terminal such as those used in retail hotel car rental healthcare or financial industries etc. for any industry can benefit from the out of band managing mechanisms discussed herein including SSTs that lack a network connection entirely such as some vending machines.

The architecture includes a USB device a processing device an enterprise server and an ATM . The USB device includes a security key ATM information A and enterprise information B all residing in secure storage of the USB device . The processing device which in this embodiment is a laptop personal computer includes a device port which in this embodiment is a USB port and a transfer software module . The enterprise server includes an enterprise system . The ATM includes a device port in the form of a USB port in this embodiment and a system application which includes a secure storage .

The USB device is a USB key dongle. Although it is noted that the portable memory device in other embodiments can be any device having memory that can be accessed when interfaced to the ATM . For example the portable memory device can be a smart phone a memory stick a Secure Digital SD card a tablet a laptop personal computer or a wearable processing device having a secure mechanism to authenticate using the security key and securely push and pull the information from the ATM or securely push and pull the information from the enterprise system utilizing the processing device .

The USB key dongle includes secure storage for storing a security key ATM information and enterprise information B A and B discussed more completely below . Moreover in an embodiment the USB key dongle includes a mechanism not depicted in the that permits authentication of the USB key dongle with the ATM using the security key and an identifier associated with the USB key dongle in order to permit a service engineer to access an administrative interface a graphical or text based interface not shown in ATM to access functions of the system application .

For the present embodiment the processing device is a laptop personal computer . However it is to be noted that the processing device is any device capable of storing and processing data having networking capabilities to connect to the enterprise server . So the processing device can be a tablet a laptop a smartphone a wearable processing device and the like.

Moreover the laptop personal computer includes a USB port capable of interfacing the USB key dongle . For purposes of the discussion and examples that follow within the context of ATM maintenance and support the processing device is a laptop . However in other embodiments the device port can be any other wired or wireless device port.

The laptop personal computer also includes a transfer software module for interacting with the enterprise system . The transfer software module is configured to establish an automatic connection with the enterprise system when the USB key dongle is interfaced to the USB port and the laptop personal computer has or is capable of obtaining a network connection wired or wireless . This is done without input on the part of the service engineer although it is noted in some instances the connection between the personal laptop computer and the enterprise system can be achieved via an interface graphical or text based interface not shown in the associated with the transfer software module that the service engineer activates and interacts with to establish the connection.

The enterprise server is a processing environment that executes and provides access to the laptop personal computer through the enterprise system . The enterprise server can be a secure cloud environment that spans multiple physical locations and creates a single logical processing environment that represents the enterprise server . In another case the enterprise server is any server located at a specific physical location operated by an enterprise.

The enterprise server includes an existing enterprise system that monitors and manages ATMs can manage other types of SSTs in other embodiments the existing enterprise system is modified to include the features discussed herein and is the enterprise system depicted in the .

During operation of the components of the architecture within the context of ATM solutions for the present embodiments a service engineer employed contracted by an enterprise is in possession of and operates the USB key dongle and the laptop personal computer . The service engineer utilizes the USB key dongle and the laptop personal computer to make connections to the ATM and to the enterprise server . For purposes of the discussion these connections occur at separate points in time when the USB key dongle is being utilized by the service engineer. It is noted that the connection to the enterprise server via the laptop personal computer with the USB key dongle interfaced to the USB port can occur before or after the service engineer connects to the ATM via USB port . Similarly the connection of the USB key dongle to the ATM can occur before or after the laptop personal computer connects to the enterprise server using the transfer software module . A service engineer may connect the USB key dongle to the laptop personal computer at the start of his her day may connect to one or more ATMs to maintain those ATMs and then may connect to the laptop personal computer at the close of his her day.

When the service engineer connects to the enterprise server to interface with the enterprise system the USB key dongle is interfaced to the USB port of the laptop personal . The transfer software module which is secure and executes some functions in kernel mode and other functions in user mode of an Operating System OS of the laptop personal computer validates the USB key dongle and connects the laptop personal computer to the enterprise server and then activates the enterprise system . At this point or just after the USB key dongle is coupled to USB port the service engineer may be required to provide credentials to authenticate himself herself.

This establishes the connection between the laptop personal computer and the enterprise server . Some features that the enterprise system performs on the laptop personal computer may be visible and capable of being interacted with by the service engineer utilizing various aspects of the transfer software module .

Other features that the enterprise system performs on the laptop personal computer are invisible transparent to the service engineer utilizing portions of the transfer software module . For instance the enterprise system may renew the security key on the USB device .

A particular and novel feature performed by the enterprise system during the connection with the laptop personal computer is to push enterprise information B to the USB key dongle or pull ATM information A that exists on the USB key dongle from the USB key dongle . In some embodiments the transfer software module of the laptop personal computer pushes the ATM information A from the USB key dongle to the enterprise system and may request a pull of or receive a push from the enterprise information available to the service engineer for the enterprise system which is then written to the USB key dongle as the enterprise information B.

ATM information A may include data representing operational metrics captured by the USB key dongle when it was connected to the ATM referred to as ATM operational information . Such ATM operational information may include but is not limited to performance metrics for the ATM such as percentage of uptime or percentage of downtime specific device issues that the ATM is configured to trap and log details of a number of transactions performed transaction information software inventory lists ATM identifier last service date and time last reboot date and time number of faults contents of device logs of the ATM and tallies for example number of printer operations performed by a print head number of pick operations performed by a pick unit in a currency dispenser and the like of the ATM and others.

Any enterprise information B written to the USB key dongle may include data that the enterprise wants the service engineer to know or have access to referred to as service engineer alerts . Such service engineer alerts may include but is not limited to tips of the day that the enterprise wants the service engineer to know about recent regional frauds operations to be performed on the ATM or on all ATMs serviced by the enterprise and other data that the enterprise deems relevant for the service engineer to know or have access to. The service engineer alerts may be different depending on the configuration of the ATM so that an ATM only presents the enterprise information B to the service engineer if the service engineer alerts are relevant to that ATM . This can be achieved by including an ATM identifier with the service engineer alerts so that if the ATM does not have an ATM identifier matching the ATM identifier in the enterprise information B then the associated service engineer alerts are not displayed by that ATM .

It should be appreciated that the ATM information A and enterprise information B permit the enterprise to achieve out of band monitoring and management of the ATM since no remote management software utility is needed to acquire the ATM information A and enterprise information B via the ATM s existing network connection. Moreover the enterprise can acquire information A and B from all its managed ATM s worldwide as the case may be and even if those ATMs are owned and operated by different competitor banks and use manual and or automated analysis mechanisms to identify support issues with all ATMs subsets of ATMs or a particular ATM such as ATM . Graphical presentations of the information A and B may also be utilized to visualize and analyze the information A and B as well. In fact the enterprise can utilize the information A and B captured out of band for any purpose desired by the enterprise. The information A and B may be anonymized prior to being presented so that owner of the ATM is not identifiable from the information A and B just a type of ATM the configuration of the ATM and the like.

Moreover and as will be discussed below the service engineer is entirely unaware in the sense of not having to do any additional tasks to initiate or complete the transfers of information A and B however the status of any transfer or the fact that a transfer has occurred may be provided to the service engineer although in some embodiments even this type of status information may be hidden from the service engineer of the fact that the information A was captured by the USB key dongle during a connection to the ATM and unaware of the fact that the information B was acquired by the enterprise system during a connection to the enterprise server .

The enterprise may require that the service engineer make the connection to the enterprise server on a daily basis weekly basis or any desired time interval deemed appropriate by the enterprise for efficient monitoring and management of the enterprise s ATMs.

When the service engineer connects to the ATM the service engineer interfaces the USB key dongle to the USB port of the ATM . The system application detects this and performs authentication. In an embodiment the system application encrypts a message that is sent to the USB key dongle . The USB key dongle utilizing a cryptographic processor not shown in the on the USB key dongle decrypts the message using the security key and sends a response message back to the system application utilizing an Application Programming Interface API associated with communicating to the USB key dongle . This permits one form of authentication and activates an administrative interface on a display not shown in the of the ATM for the service engineer to interact with and perform whatever task the service engineer is attempting to do at the ATM .

Once the authentication is achieved the novel features presented herein of the system application are activated some of which the service engineer may be aware of such as service engineer alert information and can affirmatively select and some of which the service engineer is unaware of.

Initially once the connection is made and authenticated the system application send a request to the USB key dongle to receive information B if any is present from the USB key dongle . Assuming information B is present the USB key dongle returns that information B to the system application for handling. The returned information B is then made available in memory of the ATM for use by the system application . In an embodiment the request identifies a specific storage location or offset from a starting storage location where the system application is configured to expect information B to be located within the secure storage of the USB key dongle . In another embodiment the system application formulates the request to look for a specific file assuming file system access is available from the USB key dongle here the system application is configured to look for a specific file within the secure storage .

In an embodiment the system application presents the enterprise information B on a display not shown in the when also displaying diagnostic data from the ATM . The user interface presented by the system application may be modified to present a continue button to the service engineer to force him her to select it to move on from the presentation of the enterprise information B.

Alternatively the system application presents the enterprise information B once loaded to memory on the display or one of the displays that is the service engineer display where there is also a customer display present on the ATM of the ATM . In another case the interface screens of the system application overlay a different screen having a button that the service engineer can activate to view the enterprise information B.

In an embodiment when the enterprise information B identifies a requirement that the service engineer perform some required operation the system application can record whether the service engineer actually performs such operation in the ATM information A. This may be implemented by the system application pushing writing an indication that the required operation was performed to the USB key dongle for subsequent communication to the enterprise system when the service engineer connects to the enterprise server discussed above. This can be achieved by the system application identifying an instructions included in the enterprise information B or in third type of information not shown in the . Identification can be achieved via a flag or token placed in the enterprise information B that identifies the data that follows it until a next separation character in the enterprise information or a closing token identifying an end to the instruction such that the system application can parse the instruction from other data included in the enterprise information B. Recordation as to whether the service engineer performed the required operation is unknown not visible to the service engineer. The enterprise information B presented to the service engineer is something the service engineer is obviously aware of and in some embodiments the system application may require the service engineer to confirm that he she has read the information B by pressing a button on a user interface.

So not only passive information A and portions of B when instructions are present can be passed to the system application via the USB key dongle but active information B portions of B representing instructions can also be passed that requires evaluation or execution by the system application . Similarly the USB key dongle allows two way communication of information A between the ATM and the enterprise system .

The system application can be configured to write the information A to the USB device at any point during the connection of the USB key dongle to the ATM such as at the start of the connection at the end of the connection during some event detected during the connection and other points in time during the connection configured in the enterprise application of the enterprise system .

Capturing the ATM information A in a manner that the service engineer is unaware of subject to exceptions discussed above and in manner defined by the enterprise the types of data to be captured in the ATM information A is configured within the enterprise application of the enterprise system removes the subjectivity communication skills and competency of the service engineering from this aspect of ATM monitoring desired by the enterprise. This also alleviates the service engineer from accounting for the ATM information A to the enterprise based on policy or procedure. So the ATM monitoring tasks of an enterprise our improved based on what exists in the industry today.

Moreover the communication and analysis of the enterprise information B as described above provides for efficient and improved support of ATMs serviced by an enterprise than has heretofore been achieved in the industry.

Further the improved monitoring and management are achieved via out of band communications with the ATM and the enterprise via the enterprise server .

Some embodiments of the architecture and other embodiments of the out of band monitoring and managing of SSTs are now discussed with the descriptions of the .

In an embodiment the device that executes the SST information manager is an ATM such as ATM presented above with respect to architecture of the . In another embodiment the device that processes the SST validator is a different type of kiosk. The different type of kiosk can be associated with transactions for retail venues government venues entertainment venues gaming venues or transportation venues. In one case the different type of kiosk is a vending machine that lacks a network connection. According to an embodiment the SST information manager is identified as the system application in the .

At the SST information manager detects a connection to the SST which executes the SST information manager made by a portable memory device such as USB dongle SD card and others . This is done in an automated manner such that when the portable memory device is inserted into a communication or device port of the SST.

According to an embodiment at this SST information manager authenticates the portable memory device to the SST information manager and or the SST. Typically this is done without input of the SST information manager via API calls between the SST and the portable memory device. One mechanism for authentication utilizing messages and a security key was presented above with reference to the .

In some situations at the SST information manager also authenticates the user who presents interfaces the portable memory device to a device port of the SST the portable memory device to the SST. In an embodiment the interfaces the portable memory device to a device port of the SST presents an interface graphic or text based interface on a display of the SST to receive service engineer credentials and perform authentication on the service engineer.

In an embodiment at the SST information manager obtains the service engineer alert information from the portable memory device without any action being required by a service engineer. This was described in detail above.

For example at the SST information manager designates an appropriate location on the portable memory device as having the service engineer alert information from a predefined storage address or offset address within secure storage of the portable memory device. In another case of the SST information manager designates the service engineer alert information using an API of the portable memory device and passing an identifier for the service engineer alert information to the portable memory device the identifier a handle or name for the service engineer alert information .

At the SST information manager presents at least a portion of the service engineer alert information on a display of the SST.

According to an embodiment at the SST information manager presents a button on at least one screen of the display for the SST. The button when activated by the service engineer presents another portion of the service engineer alert information not originally presented by . For example more details instructions can be activated by the service engineer if the service engineer needs to know those details.

In an embodiment at the SST information manager presents a button on at least one screen of the display for the SST that when activated by the service engineer removes the presented portion of the service engineer alert information from the display of the SST.

At the SST information manager executes a background process to write terminal information related to operational metrics of the SST to the portable memory device. This can be done as the service engineer interacts with the interface of the SST performing other unrelated operations on the SST. The portable memory device is subsequently interfaced to a different processing device such as laptop personal computer that utilizes an entirely different network connection to connect to a server such as enterprise server and provide the operational metrics by interacting with enterprise system for analysis without interaction of the service engineer.

In an embodiment the operational metrics are the ATM information A described above with reference to the .

According to an embodiment at the SST information manager dynamically evaluates a policy to define types of data to include as the terminal information. So data definitions such as schemas and policy conditions with actions can be defined in files that can be evaluated by the SST information manager to define what types of data to include as the terminal information. In this way changes to the types of data collected by the SST information manager can be made by replacing or modifying a file having the policy and or schema.

According to an embodiment at the SST information manager acquires enterprise information new instance of the service alert information identified as information B in the related to content provided by an enterprise from the portable memory device without interaction of the service engineer. This too can be achieved via the background process or another background process. The enterprise information can be in a same file as the previously stored operational metrics was on the portable memory device same file or same memory location with a bit flag that when set indicates to the SST information manager that the enterprise information is available so A and B are being used in the same locations within secure storage of the . In another case the enterprise information is identified by a different storage memory location within the portable memory device from that which is associated with the previously stored operational metrics or can have a different file name embodiment shown in the where enterprise information is B and ATM information A operational metrics are stored in different locations within the secure storage .

In an embodiment the SST information manager identifies an instruction from the enterprise information or from a different memory location or different file on the portable memory device . The instruction directs the SST information manager to record a notification as to whether the service engineer performed a particular action on the SST via the interface. Moreover the SST information manager writes the notification to the portable memory device using the background process or another background process.

In an embodiment the device that executes the key distributor is a server such as server presented above with respect to architecture of the . In an embodiment the enterprise information manager is identified as at least one portion of the enterprise system in the .

At the enterprise information manager obtains operational metrics for the SST such as ATM of the from a background process executing on the portable memory device. The operational metrics stored on the portable memory device utilizing the techniques presented above with respect to the .

According to an embodiment at the enterprise information manager adds the operational metrics with other operational metrics previously obtained for the SST or one or more other SSTs. So a data repository of operational metrics is established by the enterprise information manager.

In one case of and at the enterprise information manager analyzes the operational metrics to identify a potential maintenance issue associated with the SST and or the one or more other operational metrics. Any custom or existing data relationship application or service can be used to perform the analysis in an automated or semi automated manner receiving input from a data analyst . It is noted that a data analyst can also perform manual analysis of the data repository.

In one situation of and at the enterprise information manager generates enterprise information related to the potential maintenance issue and directs the background process to write the enterprise information to the portable memory device. In generating the enterprise information portions of existing enterprise information may be collected and assembled to form the enterprise information or entirely new enterprise information or some new and existing enterprise information can be produced.

In an embodiment at the enterprise information manager directs the background process to write the enterprise information related to at least one maintenance issue that may be associated with the SST to the portable memory device. This is a data push from the enterprise information manager to the portable memory device via the background process executing on the processing device such as laptop .

Alternatively at the enterprise information manager receives a request from the background process to provide the enterprise information to the background process for the background process to write to the portable memory device. This is a data pull from data stores accessible to the enterprise information manager since the data request is initiated by the processing device via the background process.

The SST includes a display a portable device port and a system application software module having a user interface software module .

The SST has the system application software module programmed within memory and or a non transitory computer readable storage media as executable instructions of the SST .

In an embodiment the SST is an ATM such as ATM . In another embodiment the SST is a different type of kiosk. In an embodiment the SST is a vending machine that lacks a network connection.

The system application software module is operable to authenticate a portable device coupled to the portable device port retrieve alert information from the coupled portable device and present the retrieved alert information on the display of the SST . It is noted that the SST can have multiple displays one for user access and one for service engineer access the display is intended to be the display of the SST that the service engineer uses for access.

In an embodiment the portable device port is the UBS device port of the . In other cases the portable device port can be any wired or wireless device port.

In an embodiment the portable device is a USB dongle device such as the USB key dongle of the . In other embodiment the portable device is a SD card. In other cases the portable device can be any portable storage device.

The user interface software module operable to present the retrieved alert information on the display and to present a confirmation control such as the buttons discussed herein and above that is operable to a service engineer to indicate that the alert information has been viewed by the service engineer.

In another case the system application software module is further operable to write information relating to operational activities of the SST to the portable device port for delivery and execution on the portable device.

In still another situation the system application software module is further operable to retrieve an instruction from the alert information that the system application software module is to monitor to ensure that the service engineer performed a particular operation.

One now appreciates how SSTs can be monitored and managed via out of band techniques that utilize a portable memory device interfaced to a SST without a network connection to gather operational metrics which are reported back to an enterprise for analysis during a network connection to systems of the enterprise. Moreover proactive enterprise information that assists a service engineer to service SSTs can be provided during the network connection to the systems and provided on a display of the SST when the service engineer interfaces the portable memory device to the SST. These out of band monitoring and managing techniques are achieved without interaction and in some cases knowledge of the service engineer.

It should be appreciated that where software is described in a particular form such as a component or module this is merely to aid understanding and is not intended to limit how software that implements those functions may be architected or structured. For example modules and are illustrated as separate modules but may be implemented as homogenous code as individual components some but not all of these modules may be combined or the functions may be implemented in software structured in any other convenient manner.

Furthermore although the software modules are illustrated as executing on one piece of hardware the software may be distributed over multiple processors or in any other convenient manner.
