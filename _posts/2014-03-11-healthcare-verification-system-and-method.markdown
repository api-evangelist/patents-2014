In one embodiment one or more electronic records concerning a plurality of patients may be stored and made available to clinicians.

Healthcare worker data may be stored to the computer system . As used herein a healthcare worker may be any individual assigned with a healthcare related task. Healthcare workers may be employed by an organization contract workers temporary workers part time workers etc. In one embodiment each healthcare worker may be provided with an electronic device capable of determining and transmitting its geographical location and thus the healthcare worker s geographical location to the computer system via one or more computer networks .

In one embodiment the electronic device may be a laptop smart phone tablet or other suitable device. The electronic device may track its location worldwide using triangulation between 3G 4G towers using GPS WI FI or other suitable methodology. The electronic device may also be equipped with one or more software application s capable of capturing a location identification as well as a user ID of the healthcare worker associated therewith. Such application s may be further capable of displaying data necessary to complete any number of healthcare related tasks as described in more detail below.

In one embodiment healthcare worker data may include information such as the geographical location of the worker the worker s skill training and or experience the status of the worker i.e. whether the worker is on duty off duty working after hours on vacation etc. a listing of medical equipment available to the worker and or in their possession and or the transportation available to the worker.

In one embodiment the system provides electronic visit verification functionality capable of confirming that 1 the clinician visited the patient at or near the scheduled time and 2 the clinician provided the required healthcare services to the patient. In one embodiment the verification process may include a determination of the patient s location as well as a confirmation that the information relating thereto is accurate.

In one embodiment the patient s location may be identified by accessing the patient s medical record s stored by the system as illustrated by Box of . illustrates an example graphic user interface GUI that may be utilized to provide the healthcare worker with information regarding the patient s location. In the context of a home healthcare visit the patient s location may be where the services are to be rendered and may include the patient s home address A along with a map B illustrating the patient s home address.

Driving directions may also be provided to the clinician in order to help him or her arrive at the patient s home at the scheduled time. The system may utilize a location service such as Google Maps . The system may also employ one or more address verification services such as those provided by the U.S. Postal Service to confirm that the patient s address is directed to a real world address.

Once the patient s location has been determined and or confirmed the location of the clinician may be determined and compared to the location of the patient as illustrated by Boxes and of . This may involve the use of a GPS enabled smart phone tablet or other suitable device. In one embodiment the clinician may be provided with a GPS enabled smart phone tablet or other suitable device so that his or her location may be determined and compared to the patient s location at or near the time of the scheduled home healthcare visit.

The system may utilize electronic signature data to confirm home healthcare visits. In one embodiment the system provides a graphic user interface to display one or more signature screens through which the patient may enter his or her electronic signature at any point during the home healthcare visit. illustrates an example signature screen that may be utilized in conjunction with one or more embodiments.

In one embodiment the electronic signature of the patient may be obtained at the conclusion of the visit in order to provide confirmation that the clinician provided the required home healthcare services to the satisfaction of the patient. The electronic signature may be stored and associated with the electronic record for the patient. The electronic signature may take the form of a digital signature. In one embodiment the system may provide a check box or other functionality to indicate circumstances where the patient was unable or unwilling to provide an electronic signature.

In one embodiment the comparison of the patient s location and the healthcare worker s location may be utilized in order to determine the geographical distance between the patient and the worker. This distance value may be utilized by the system in order to enable disable the electronic signature screen where appropriate. For example if a distance threshold value of 100 meters has been entered or set by default by the system the system may check to see if the calculated distance value between the patient and the clinician is equal to or less than the 100 meters as illustrated by Box of .

If the distance value falls inside the threshold value i.e. is equal to or less than 100 meters the electronic signature screen may be enabled and displayed upon the clinician s device as illustrated by Box . The patient may then enter his or her e signature into the space on the graphic user interface provided on the clinician s device and the signature may be stored by the system. In this example a calculated distance value outside the threshold value i.e. greater than 100 meters may result in the electronic signature screen being disabled as illustrated by Box of .

In one embodiment a time stamp may be generated at or near the time when the patient s e signature is obtained by the system as illustrated by Box of . In this example the time stamp provides further confirmation as to the time that the patient s electronic signature was obtained. Further stored location information gleaned from the clinician s GPS enabled smartphone tablet or other suitable device may be cross referenced with the time stamp of the patient signature in order to provide further confirmation that the clinician met with the patient at the proper time and place. The time stamp may also be utilized to indicate when the electronic signature screen was enabled or disabled depending on the circumstances.

Clinician location data may be recorded and stored throughout the day or any other suitable time period to ensure that the clinician visits each patient at the proper time and place. A time stamp may be utilized to confirm the location of the clinician at any point in the clinician s work cycle.

Upon receipt or non receipt of an electronic signature the system may update the patient s medical record to indicate the status of the medical visit in question as illustrated by Box of . In this example receipt of the patient s e signature at or near the patient s location provides verification that the health care visit took place. Further alert s and or report s regarding the healthcare visit may be generated and provided to authorized personnel as illustrated by Box of and as described further below.

In one embodiment the system provides one or more graphic user interfaces through which authorized personnel may enter distance threshold values for use during the verification process. Authorized personnel may also utilize the graphic user interface to pick and choose which home healthcare visits will require verification and or may disable electronic visit verification functionality for selected healthcare visits healthcare workers and or patients. Further authorized personnel may toggle the map geo location and driving direction features on and off for individual healthcare visits clinicians and or patients as they see fit.

A stylus touch screen or other suitable device may be utilized to obtain the patient s signature. An image and or video capture feature may also be utilized such that a picture and or video of the patient is collected at the conclusion of the visit when he or she signs the electronic verification and or when the e signature screen is enabled or disabled. This feature along with the time stamp provides further proof that the clinician met with the patient and provided the required healthcare services to the satisfaction of the patient. This feature may be especially helpful in circumstances where the patient is unable or unwilling to sign thus providing proof that the clinician visited with the patient even though an electronic signature was not obtained.

In one embodiment an audio capture feature may be utilized to enable audio recording at the conclusion of the visit when the patient signs the electronic verification and or when the e signature screen is enabled or disabled. In this example an event such as the disabling of the e signature screen by the system would trigger an automatic audio recording feature on the healthcare worker s electronic device. In this example the audio recording would provide additional information regarding the circumstances surrounding the collection or non collection of the e signature from the patient.

The system may also provide status information regarding which home healthcare visits have been verified. Graphical indications textual indications and or various color schemes may be utilized to present status information to authorized personnel. For example one or more icon s may be presented on the clinician s to do list to indicate whether a particular visit has been verified or not.

In one embodiment an icon in the shape of a house may be utilized in order to quickly convey verification status information to authorized personnel via one or more graphic user interfaces. For example an empty house icon may be utilized to represent a healthcare visit task that has not been verified while a house icon having a superimposed checkmark may be utilized to represent a healthcare visit that has been verified by an electronic signature and or a time stamp as described above. Further verified visits may be color coded with a green color for example while un verified visits may be color coded with a red color for example etc.

In one embodiment one or more verification icons may be included in payroll invoicing therapy management administration and or other suitable graphic user interfaces through Kinnser Agency Manager for example in order to make the verification information provided by the system accessible to authorized personnel. For example a verification icon may be provided next to verified healthcare visits in order to indicate that the healthcare visit task is ready to be run for payroll.

In one embodiment the system may identify determine a geographic code associated with the patient s location and compare it to a geographic code associated with the clinician s device at the time of the patient s electronic signature. The time stamp of the electronic signature may also be compared to the scheduled visit time date in order to confirm whether the patient signature corresponds to the scheduled visit time frame.

This feature allows home health administrators auditors surveyors and other interested personnel to verify home healthcare visits using electronically stored location and or timestamp information reducing the amount of time required to manually verify patient visits. Further verification information may be incorporated into payroll invoice request forms and or integrated into payroll invoice records in order to hasten payment processing.

In one embodiment the system may provide accuracy data pertaining to the location of the patient and or the clinician. Accuracy information may include real time indication s that GPS is unavailable or that the system is waiting to receive geographical information from the location service. Further if location information has been received by the system accuracy information may include the system s level of confidence in the location data. For example status messages such as location 1000 meters location between 1000 meters and 300 meters or location within 300 meters may be provided upon the clinician s graphical user interface and or other display hardware.

Graphical indications textual indications and or various color schemes may be utilized as well. For example the system may provide a circle around the clinician s location on a map of the geographical area in order to indicate the level of confidence e.g. within 300 meters of the location data. An option to refresh location data may also be provided.

Data gleaned from the comparison of the patient s location and the clinician s location at the time of the patient s signature may be provided in real time to the clinician or other personnel and or stored for later analysis. This may be accomplished using a graphic or textual display indicating the results of the comparison. For example the system may indicate that the difference between the patient s location and the clinician s location as determined by the system is 500 meters plus or minus 200 meters. In this example 500 meters would be the geographical difference between the patient s location and the clinician s location and 200 meters would be the level of confidence in the location data. This information may be displayed using graphical indications textual indications and or various color schemes.

A threshold accuracy and or comparison level may be defined by the system and or entered by authorized personnel. The threshold accuracy and or comparison level may be utilized to decide what level of accuracy and or confidence is required in order to complete the home health visit verification process. In one embodiment if the level of accuracy and or the level of confidence if not met the electronic signature screen may be disabled.

Consider an example where a threshold accuracy level is set to be 1000 meters. In this example the system would not allow the patient s signature to be obtained i.e. the signature screen may be disabled if the accuracy is determined to be a value greater than 1000 meters. Likewise in this example if a threshold comparison level is set to be 500 meters the system would not allow the patient s signature to be obtained if the comparison of the patient s location and the clinician s location generates a distance value greater than 500 meters. In one embodiment this feature may be enabled and or disabled by authorized personnel as needed.

Home healthcare visit verification data stored by the system may be used to generate lists data tables reports and or other documentation for review by interested personnel such as administrators auditors surveyors etc. In one embodiment a geographic deviation report may be generated by the system. A geographic deviation report may show all of the visits for all clinicians from an agency over a period that the user chooses e.g. the past week . The report may show all patients each visit to each patient the clinician that made each visit and whether each visit was verified using electronic home healthcare visit verification. The report may also include a setting to illustrate not only visits that were verified but that happened more than n number of meters or feet yards miles etc. away from the patient s address on file.

In one embodiment the geographic deviation report allows a manager or auditor at a home healthcare agency to sort all the visits for a particular timeframe and find any that fall out of a predefined distance value. This feature allows the manager or other authorized personnel to drill down and look at more detail for these visits by sorting the visits by verification status. Such visits might have been performed somewhere other than the patient s address e.g. a skilled nurse facility family members home etc. or perhaps the system has access to the patient s signature but not a geographic code because for example location services were not available or perhaps they were fraudulent visits.

A geography deviation alert may also be provided by the system. This feature may be utilized in much the same way as the geography deviation report described above but provides a real time message alert to the clinician or other authorized personnel during the visit. For example if a manager employs a clinician that he or she is having timeliness issues with or suspected honesty issues the manager may decide to set up deviation alerts for visits done by the clinician in question. If a visit is scheduled to be at the home of a patient and a visit verification is submitted but the clinician s location is outside the threshold range set by the manager an email text message or other alert may be triggered and provided to the clinician.

In one embodiment the system allows a home healthcare visit to be verified without the intervention of the clinician. This may be accomplished by generating and storing a time stamp when the clinician carries his or her GPS enabled smartphone tablet or other suitable device through a ring or geo fence located around the patient s residence. In one embodiment authorized personnel may be given the option to set a global radius fence value around the patient s address and or the radius value may be set to a default value by the system. The applicable geo fence radius may be illustrated on a graphic user interface around the patient s address using a circle or other identifier.

In one embodiment the fence value may utilize the geo location settings of the healthcare worker s electronic device to detect when a clinician is close enough to the patient s address in order to check in. For example the system may ping the clinician s electronic device to determine if the clinician is inside the patient s defined radius. If the clinician is inside the clinician s geo fence radius the application may track and record a time in time stamp for the visit. Another time stamp may then be generated and stored when the clinician leaves the patient s residence thus carrying his or her GPS enabled smartphone tablet or other suitable device through the ring or geo fence located around the patient s residence. Thus when the clinician leaves the pre set radius the system may track the time the clinician left and use this time stamp as a time out for the visit.

In one embodiment the software may direct the clinician s device to emit an audible alert to bring the time in and time out events to the attention of the clinician as they happen. The alert may also request that the clinician provide verification on the screen of their device e.g. Yes I was at 123 Main street from 8 30 a.m. to 9 15 a.m. on Jun. 1 2013. 

In one embodiment the clinician may manually check in and check out using one or more buttons provided by a graphic user interface. For example the user may click a button such as a Start Visit button in order to activate a timer when he or she arrives at the patient s residence. When the clinician leaves the patient s residence they may click a button such as a Finish Visit button to discontinue the timer. This feature may be used in conjunction with one or more of the verification comparisons described above.

In one embodiment the system may also provide check in and or check out reminders. For example an audio alert may be generated in order to remind the clinician to manually enter their check in or check out times. Such alerts may be triggered off schedule time e.g. appointment is for 1 00 pm 2 00 pm and the chime message alert goes off at 12 55 pm and 1 55 pm respectively or may be utilized using a geo fence as described above. For example when a clinician gets within 50 meters or any desired value of the address they are supposed to be visiting the chime and message alert may be activated on their device to remind the clinician to check in or out.

Some home healthcare visits may require that a clinician be at the appointed address at a particular time e.g. private duty visits where the customer has more control over scheduling vs. a Medicare paid nurse visit where the Agency nurse has control over the schedule . In this example the system may send an alert to a set of subscribers when the clinician crosses the threshold of the geo fence as described above generating an in event or when the electronic signature submit process is triggered by the software.

In this example subscribers may include home healthcare agencies including specific managers or schedulers that want to know that the clinician arrives on time and or family members of the patient that might want to be notified that a clinician has arrived. Alerts may be provided using any suitable convention including emails text messages voicemail messages etc.

In one embodiment a visit within schedule feature may also be provided. This feature may be used to verify that a visit took place within a desired time frame. In one embodiment this may be accomplished by determining if the clinician visited the patient s residence within a scheduled window of time i.e. between 10 00 am and 11 00 am on Wednesday or within a threshold time range. Specifically if the electronic signature and geo code stamp are taken and fall within the 10 00 am 11 00 am timeframe the visit would be recorded as a time within scheduled visit occurrence.

In one embodiment the elapsed time of a visit may be calculated from automatic or manual check in and check out times recorded by the system in order to indicate the total time that a clinician was at the patient s address. The calculated values may be used to generate report s and or visual view s illustrating which home healthcare visits occurred during the scheduled time periods.

In one embodiment the system method and computer readable medium described herein may be provided as a stand alone software application or integrated into a proprietary healthcare management software package such as the Kinnser Agency Manager offered by Kinnser Software Inc.
