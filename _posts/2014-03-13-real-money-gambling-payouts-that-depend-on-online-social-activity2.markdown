This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 786 552 also entitled Real Money Gambling Payouts That Depend on Online Social Activity filed on Mar. 15 2013 and hereby incorporates by reference the disclosure of that application.

Though online gambling for real money allows a user to gamble conveniently from almost any location it lacks the social dimension that results from being in the company of other gamblers at the slots or poker tables of a busy casino.

Consequently websites that provide online gambling for real money are engaged in ongoing research and study into ways to make online gambling more social.

In an example embodiment a processor executed method is described. According to the method software on a server and or client device causes a view in a graphical user interface GUI for a game to be displayed to a user. The game is an online gambling game for real money. The software receives input from the user. The input includes a wager and play according to the game mechanics for the game. The software calculates a payout from the play. The payout includes a promotional payout that depends at least in part on a measure of social activity associated with the user or a measure of social influence associated with the user. And the software broadcasts the payout to at least one other person who is a social relation of the user.

In another example embodiment an apparatus is described namely computer readable storage media that persistently store a program. The program might be part of the software runs on a server and or client device. The program causes a GUI view for a game to be displayed to a user. The game is an online gambling game for real money. The program receives input from the user. The input includes a wager and play according to the game mechanics for the game. The program calculates a payout from the play. The payout includes a promotional payout that depends at least in part on a measure of social activity associated with the user or a measure of social influence associated with the user. And the program broadcasts the payout to at least one other person who is a social relation of the user.

Another example embodiment also involves a processor executed method. According to the method software on a server and or client device causes a view in a graphical user interface GUI for a game to be displayed to a user. The game is a video slot machine and the view includes a reel symbol that includes text suggesting that the user invite other persons to play the game. The software receives input from the user identifying one or more other persons to be invited to the play the game. Then the software changes the reel symbol with the text to another reel symbol that compensates the user.

Other aspects and advantages of the inventions will become apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate by way of example the principles of the inventions.

In the following description numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the exemplary embodiments. However it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the example embodiments may be practiced without some of these specific details. In other instances process operations and implementation details have not been described in detail if already well known.

Returning to server software includes load balancers e.g. the load balancing and virtualization software provided by Citrix VMware Microsoft or Xen that balance the load between the servers e.g. Apache HTTP servers in an elastic or dynamic array . It will be appreciated that the array is elastic because its size can be increased to accommodate additional servers and decreased to accommodate fewer servers. As further depicted in the servers in the elastic array transmit e.g. using HTTP data to and receive data from a the web browser or app and or b the servers on a social networking website such as Facebook. In an example embodiment the servers might read data from and write data to memory cache e.g. a memory cache created with memcached and managed with Couchbase Server which in turn is backed by database which might be MySQL. In an alternative example embodiment the database might be NoSQL. It will be appreciated that performance latencies can be significantly reduced by such a caching arrangement which exploits locality of reference. It will also be appreciated that memory cache in corresponds to the memory cache in and the persistent storage in corresponds to the database in . In an example embodiment synch queue might receive the data from memory cache to be written asynchronously to the database . As indicated on the software modularization depicted in the figure might be implemented as a LAMMP Linux Apache Memcache MySQL PHP architecture in an example embodiment.

In server software includes load balancers that balance the load between the servers in an elastic array . As further depicted in this figure the servers in the elastic array transmit data to and receive data from a the web browser or app and or b the servers on a social networking website such as Facebook. In an example embodiment the servers might read data from and write data to a hybrid in memory database and which persists data e.g. a hybrid in memory database such as Membase Couchbase Server .

The process described in makes use of the social relations e.g. friends followers contacts etc. of a user according to a contact list buddy list social graph or other access control list ACL . It will be appreciated that access to these social relations is controlled by the user. That is to say the software performing the operations in and the other figures will only have access to these social relations if the user authorizes such access e.g. through a command entered on a GUI dialog displayed or caused to be displayed by the software. Similarly in an example embodiment the software performing the operations in and the other figures might only have access to the profiles and or content activity streams of a social relation if authorized by the social relation e.g. through a command entered on a GUI dialog displayed or caused to be displayed by software at website .

As depicted in software e.g. running on a server and or client device causes a GUI view for an online gambling game e.g. an online casino game such as a video slot machine video poker video bingo video keno video roulette video craps video baccarat video pai gow etc. to be displayed on client device e.g. smartphone tablet or laptop in operation . In example embodiments the GUI view might be displayed by a browser or an app following a login authenticating a user who has been previously validated to meet any governmental restrictions and or organizational policies e.g. with respect to age geographical and or jurisdictional location problem gambling etc. In operation the software receives an input from the user e.g. a push of GUI button representing a wager e.g. specification of a monetary amount and a play e.g. a spin of slot machine reels or a spin of a roulette wheel according to the game mechanics for the game. In operation the software determines e.g. using a paytable any payout from the wager and the play. In an example embodiment the payout might include a promotional payout or other payout that depends on a measure of social activity e.g. Active Social Network ASN and or social influence e.g. influence score associated with the user. If there is a payout the software causes a GUI view showing the payout from the play and the wager to be displayed on the client device in operation . Then in operation the software broadcasts e.g. through a content activity stream on a social networking website accessed through an API the payout to persons who are social relations e.g. friends followers or contacts of the user who have authorized the broadcast .

In operation the software determines any payout from the wager and the play. In an example embodiment a payout for an online RMG game might be determined by a paytable that is a schedule of payouts for the outcomes that might occur from wagers and plays in the online RMG game. In an example embodiment the online gambling game might be a video slot machine. It will be appreciated that a paytable for a video slot machine is a table that shows the schedule of payouts for each winning payline depending on the amount wagered. It will further be appreciated that for a video slot machine a winning payline might consist of multiple matching reel symbols in a horizontal oblique triangular trapezoidal zigzag etc. line e.g. three matching pieces of fruit three bananas in a horizontal line. In another example embodiment the online gambling game might be video poker. In an example embodiment a paytable for video poker might show the schedule of payouts for each winning hand depending on the amount wagered.

In operation the payout includes a promotional payout or other payout that depends on a measure of social activity e.g. Active Social Network ASN and or social influence e.g. influence or importance score associated with the user. In an example embodiment a promotional payout might be a supplemental payout that is not reflected in the paytable for an online RMG game e.g. a relatively small percentage such as approximately 1 20 percent of the paytable payout. In an example embodiment ASN might be a count of the social relations friends followers contacts etc. of the player with whom the player has had a reciprocal or closed interaction loop within a duration window that is within a recency period. In an example embodiment a reciprocal or closed interaction loop might involve 1 an initial message and a response message or 2 an initial message and an action in response to the message. So if the player has sent a message e.g. a a message that might include text images audio video etc. posted to a profile maintained by social networking media website or broadcast in an activity content stream maintained by social networking media website or b a message that might include text images audio video etc. pursuant to a messaging protocol such as email instant messaging SMS etc. to a friend and the friend has responded with a message within a specified duration window e.g. one week after the initial message is sent that friend might be included in the count assuming the duration window is within a specified recency period e.g. one week from the time of counting . Likewise if the friend has sent a message to the player and the player has responded by an action such as accessing the friend s profile within a specified duration window e.g. one week after the message is sent that friend might be included in the count assuming the duration window is within a specified recency period e.g. one week from the time of counting .

In an example embodiment the ASN count might include friends of the player who are players of the online RMG game at the online RMG website. In another example embodiment the ASN count might include friends of the player who are players of the online RMG game at the online RMG website and friends who are players of other online games whether RMG or not at the online RMG website. Alternatively the ASN count might include the friends the player on a social networking media website regardless of whether they are players of the online RMG game or other games at the online RMG website e.g. friends of the player on a social networking media website who have authorized posts e.g. by the player and or by the online RMG website to their profiles or broadcasts to their content activity streams. Likewise in an example embodiment the message sent to a friend or to a player might relate to the online RMG game or other online games whether RMG or not at the online RMG website in order to qualify as a message for purposes of an ASN count. In an alternative example embodiment the message sent to a friend or to a player might qualify as a message for purposes of an ASN count regardless of the subject matter of the message. In still other example embodiments the ASN count might be adjusted to reflect the type of message sent. For example a reciprocal or closed interaction loop might be discounted e.g. by a fraction decimal less than 1 if the initial message is a template message broadcast by the RMG game and the message sent in response results from a click on a graphical user interface GUI control on the template message. And a reciprocal or closed interaction loop might be multiplied amplified e.g. by a fraction decimal greater than 1 if the initial message and or the message is sent in response is a personal message e.g. a message that is not a broadcast template message. In an alternative example embodiment ASN might be a count of friends of the player who are daily active users DAUs of the online RMG game or other online games whether RMG or not at the online RMG website within a recency period time e.g. a week . For further description as to other example embodiments of ASN see co owned U.S. Published Patent Application No. 2013 0005478 by McCaffrey et al. entitled Friend Recommendation System Based on Active Social Network which is incorporated herein by reference.

As described above the promotional payout or other payout might also or alternatively depend on a measure of social influence e.g. an influence score or an importance score associated with the user. In an example embodiment social influence might be measured using one or a combination of centrality measures for the social network or the social graph associated with the user e.g. the social relations of the user friends followers contacts etc. . Examples of such centrality measures are degree centrality eigenvector centrality Katz centrality PageRank score betweenness centrality and closeness centrality. Other measures of social influence based on the social network or the social graph of the user include potential reach clustering coefficient core number and vertex eccentricity as described in Michael Wu Community Influencers Step by Step 2010 which is incorporated by reference.

In operation the software broadcasts the payout to persons who are social relations e.g. friends followers or contacts of the user. In an example embodiment such broadcasting might be accomplished through the use of an application programming interface API which might be a web API exposed by software running on a social networking media website e.g. website in . Examples of such APIs include Facebook REST API Facebook Graph API Twitter API Bebo s Social Networking API SNAPI OpenSocial API etc. It will be appreciated that the Facebook APIs allow authorized third parties e.g. third parties with an access token and or permissions to access a user s Facebook profile and the content activity stream e.g. Facebook News Feed associated with that profile. Alternatively the software might broadcast the payout to persons who are social relations using a messaging protocol such as email instant messaging SMS etc.

In an example embodiment the content of template message might vary depending on the age or other attributes of the social relation. For example if the social relation is also a player of the online game e.g. a person whose age has been verified to meet any legal requirements the content of the message might be as shown in template message . But if the social relation is not a player of the online game or is a person whose age has not been verified the template message might broadcast Bad Bob has played Jacks or Better age requirement 21 .

The process described in makes use of the social relations e.g. friends followers contacts etc. of a user according to a contact list buddy list social graph or other ACL. It will be appreciated that access to these social relations is controlled by the user. That is to say the software performing the operations in will only have access to these social relations if the user authorizes such access e.g. through a GUI dialog displayed by the software.

As depicted in software e.g. running on a server and or client device causes a GUI view for an online gambling game e.g. a video slot machine to be displayed on client device e.g. smartphone tablet or laptop in operation . In example embodiments the GUI view might be displayed by a browser or an app following a login authenticating a user who has been previously validated to meet any governmental restrictions and or organizational policies e.g. with respect to age geographical and or jurisdictional location problem gambling etc. In operation the software receives an input from the user e.g. a push of GUI button representing a wager e.g. a specification of a monetary amount and a play e.g. a spin of slot machine reels according to the game mechanics for the game. In operation the software causes the display of a GUI view that includes a reel symbol with text suggesting that the user invite other persons e.g. friends followers or contacts identified on list maintained by social network media website to play the game. The software receives input from the user identifying the other persons to be invited to play game in operation . Then in operation the software causes the display of a GUI view where the reel symbol with the text is changed to another reel symbol that compensates the user e.g. a wildcard symbol for a payline resulting in promotional payout or other payout a scatter symbol resulting in a promotional payout a free play etc. . In an example embodiment a scatter symbol is a reel symbol that results in a payout e.g. twice the player s wager without being part of a payline.

GUI dialog also includes a text box which lists Facebook Friends who are already playing the game and a GUI button which allows the user to SEND INVITES to selected Facebook Friends who presumably are twenty one years old or older per the language in text box . In an example embodiment the software might send the invites through the use of an application programming interface API which might be a web API exposed by software running on a social networking media website e.g. Facebook e.g. if the invitees have authorized such invites by the player and or by the online RMG website. It will be appreciated that the Facebook APIs allow authorized third parties e.g. third parties with an access token and or permissions to access a user s Facebook profile and the content activity stream e.g. Facebook News Feed associated with that profile. Alternatively the software might send the invites using a messaging protocol such as email instant messaging SMS etc. GUI dialog also includes another tab which allows the user to invite Zynga Friends rather than Facebook Friends where Zynga Friends would be friends followers contacts etc. identified on a contact list buddy list social graph or other access control list ACL maintained by Zynga e.g. an online RMG website.

GUI view C shows the video slot machine after the user has identified other persons to invite to the play the game. In view bonus symbol has changed into scatter symbol which results in a promotional payout e.g. twice the monetary amount of the user s wager to the user.

In alternative example embodiments the online RMG game might not be a video slot machine. For example in the text inviting the user to invite other persons to play the online RMG game might appear in a square in an online bingo or keno game.

In operation 1 the player clicks on a graphic for the game causing browser to transmit an HTTP request to server software e.g. Facebook for the game s initial web page. In operation 2 server software e.g. Facebook returns an HTML5 CSS3 and JavaScript JS web page consisting of an iFrame e.g. Facebook chrome and an iFrame HTML tag for the game s initial web page. In operation 3 the browser uses the HTML tag to transmit a request to server software e.g. Zynga for the game s initial web page to display inside the iFrame. The game s initial web page might be an application server page e.g. PHP 5 or an HTML5 page. In operation 4 the application server page executes on server software e.g. Zynga resulting in requests to databases and other servers as needed to complete generation of the web page including possibly an HTTP request not shown transmitted to an API exposed by server software e.g. Facebook . In operation 5 the server software e.g. Zynga returns the game s initial web page e.g. HTML5 CSS3 and JS for the browser to display in the iFrame.

At some point thereafter in operation 6 the player clicks on a graphic e.g. representing a graphical user interface or GUI widget on a game web page e.g. HTML5 CSS3 and JS causing browser to transmit an HTTP request to server software e.g. Zynga . The click might be a wager and a play resulting in a payout that is broadcast to the content activity streams of social relations e.g. friends followers or contacts of the user who have authorized such broadcasts. Alternatively the click might transmit a list identifying social relations to be invited to play the game e.g. social relations who are not presently players. In operation 7 the server software e.g. Zynga returns a web page e.g. HTML5 CSS3 and JS to the browser indicating that the request was received. In operation 8 the server software e.g. Zynga transmits an HTTP request to an API exposed by server software e.g. Facebook broadcasting the payout or invitation to play the online RMG game to the content activity streams of the player s social relations on the social network managed by server software e.g. Facebook . It will be appreciated that in order to access the social relations content activity streams e.g. using an access token the server software e.g. Zynga might have earlier obtained permission from the social relations e.g. when they became players of the online RMG game or other online games at the online RMG website. Then in operation 9 server software e.g. Facebook sends a response e.g. in Java Script Object Notation JSON to server software e.g. Zynga describing the success or failure of the broadcasting to each content activity stream.

In an alternative example embodiment the game s initial web page or some subsequent web page served up by the game might have an Adobe Flash application e.g. a Small Web Format SWF file embedded in it. In this alternative example embodiment the user of browser might thereafter interact with the Adobe Flash application e.g. its GUI causing it to interact with the server software e.g. Facebook and the server software e.g. Zynga .

At some point thereafter in operation 4 the player clicks on a graphic e.g. representing a GUI widget on a game web page e.g. HTML5 CSS3 and JS causing browser to transmit an HTTP request to server software e.g. Zynga . The click might be a wager and a play resulting in a payout that is broadcast to the content activity streams of social relations e.g. friends followers or contacts of the user who have authorized such broadcasts. Alternatively the click might transmit a list identifying social relations to be invited to play the game e.g. social relations who are not presently players. In operation 5 the server software e.g. Zynga returns a web page e.g. HTML5 CSS3 and JS to the browser indicating that the request was received. In operation 6 the server software e.g. Zynga transmits an HTTP request to an API exposed by server software e.g. Facebook broadcasting the payout or invitation to play the online RMG game to the content activity streams of the player s social relations on the social network managed by server software e.g. Facebook . It will be appreciated that in order to access the social relations content activity streams e.g. using an access token the server software e.g. Zynga might have earlier obtained permission from the social relations e.g. when they joined other Zynga games. Then in operation 7 server software e.g. Facebook sends a response e.g. in JSON to server software e.g. Zynga describing the success or failure of the broadcasting to each content activity stream.

Here again in an alternative example embodiment the game s initial web page or some subsequent web page served by the game might have an Adobe Flash application e.g. a Small Web Format SWF file embedded in it. In this alternative example embodiment the user of browser might thereafter interact with the Adobe Flash application e.g. its GUI which in turn might interact with the server software e.g. Facebook and the server software e.g. Zynga .

In terms of the hardware and software platforms involved in the personal computing device might be a a laptop or other personal computer or b a mobile device such as a smartphone e.g. an iPhone Android Blackberry etc. or a tablet computer e.g. an iPad Kindle Nook etc. . In an example embodiment each of the websites and might be composed of a number of servers connected by a network e.g. a local area network LAN or a WAN to each other in a cluster or other distributed system which might execute cloud platform software e.g. as described below. The servers in websites and might also be connected e.g. by a storage area network SAN to persistent storages and respectively. In an example embodiment persistent storages and might include a redundant array of independent disks RAID .

Persistent storage might be used to store algorithms and or logic including game mechanics and data related to an RMG game and its players including accounting data and data about the players received by website from website e.g. through an application programming interface API exposed by website . In an example embodiment some of the data from persistent storage might be cached in memory cache in volatile memory on servers on website e.g. using a an in memory database or main memory database system MMDB or b a hybrid in memory database that also uses persistent storage in order to improve performance. Persistent storage might be used to store data including content associated with a profile and or content activity stream for users of a social networking media website e.g. users who are associated with each other through ACLs. In an example embodiment persistent storage might store similar data or content. Some of the data stored in persistent storage might be cached in memory cache in volatile memory on servers at website in an example embodiment. Persistent storage might be used to store regulatory and or auditing data e.g. reports from and or results from audits of websites such as website and logic e.g. logic that implements minimum internal control standards and or technical or other standards .

As indicated above personal computing device might be a laptop or other personal computer. In that event personal computing device and the servers in website and might include 1 hardware consisting of one or more microprocessors and or graphics processors e.g. from the x86 family or the Power family volatile storage e.g. RAM and persistent storage e.g. a hard disk or flash memory and 2 an operating system e.g. Windows Mac OS Linux Windows Server Mac OS Server etc. that runs directly or indirectly e.g. through virtualization software on the hardware. Or the operating system for the servers might be replaced by a hypervisor or other virtualization software. Alternatively personal computing device might be a smartphone tablet computer or other mobile device that includes 1 hardware consisting of one or more low power microprocessors and or graphics processors e.g. from the ARM family volatile storage e.g. RAM and persistent storage e.g. flash memory and 2 an operating system e.g. iOS Android Windows Phone webOS Linux etc. that runs on the hardware.

Also in an example embodiment personal computing device might include a web browser as an application program or part of an operating system. Examples of web browsers that might execute on personal computing device if it is a laptop or other personal computer include Internet Explorer Mozilla Firefox and Safari. Examples of browsers that might execute on personal computing device if it is a smartphone tablet computer or other mobile device include Android Browser Safari Mozilla Firefox and webOS Browser. It will be appreciated that users of personal computing device might use browsers to communicate with software running on the servers at website and at website . Alternatively users of personal computing device might use other application programs to communicate with software running on the servers at website and at website . For example if the personal computing device is a smartphone tablet computer or other mobile device users might use an app e.g. an app written in Objective C or Java or a hybrid app e.g. an app written in Objective C or Java that includes embedded HTML5 to communicate with software running on the servers at website and at website .

Though the disclosure above has focused on online RMG games some or all of the operations described above might be used in a gamification application rather than in an online RMG game. It will be appreciated that gamification involves the use of game design techniques game thinking and game mechanics to enhance tasks performed in non game contexts. So for example some or all of the operations described above might be used in an employee training program.

With the above embodiments in mind it should be understood that the inventions might employ various computer implemented operations involving data stored in computer systems. These operations are those requiring physical manipulation of physical quantities. Usually though not necessarily these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored transferred combined compared and otherwise manipulated. Further the manipulations performed are often referred to in terms such as producing identifying determining or comparing.

Any of the operations described herein that form part of the inventions are useful machine operations. The inventions also relate to a device or an apparatus for performing these operations. The apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes such as the carrier network discussed above or it may be a general purpose computer selectively activated or configured by a computer program stored in the computer. In particular various general purpose machines may be used with computer programs written in accordance with the teachings herein or it may be more convenient to construct a more specialized apparatus to perform the required operations.

The inventions can also be embodied as computer readable code on a computer readable medium. The computer readable medium is any data storage device that can store data which can thereafter be read by a computer system. Examples of the computer readable medium include hard drives network attached storage NAS read only memory random access memory CD ROMs CD Rs CD RWs DVDs Flash magnetic tapes and other optical and non optical data storage devices. The computer readable medium can also be distributed over a network coupled computer systems so that the computer readable code is stored and executed in a distributed fashion.

Although example embodiments of the inventions have been described in some detail for purposes of clarity of understanding it will be apparent that certain changes and modifications can be practiced within the scope of the following claims. For example some or all of the operations might be used with a client device that is not connected via a network to an online RMG website until some time after a wager and play have been made by a player. Rather a wager and play might be stored on the client device and transmitted to an online RMG website at a later time for collection of the wager and determination of any payout. Furthermore the operations described above can be ordered modularized and or distributed in any suitable way. Accordingly the present embodiments are to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive and the inventions are not to be limited to the details given herein but may be modified within the scope and equivalents of the following claims. In the following claims elements and or steps do not imply any particular order of operation unless explicitly stated in the claims or implicitly required by the disclosure.
