title: Bleeding mechanism for use in a propulsion system of a recoilless, insensitive munition
abstract: A bleeding mechanism for use in the propulsion system of a recoilless, insensitive munition utilizing a utilizing a fluidic countermass. The present bleeding mechanism utilizes a firing pin or a similar puncture or tear device. A heat sensitive material blocks the movement of the firing pin. A mechanical locking mechanism locks the firing pin in position until it is unlocked by the melting of the heat sensitive material. When the insensitive munition is exposed to heat, the reaction of the heat sensitive material within the bleeding mechanism allows the firing pin to be released and to rupture a cartridge seal. The cartridge may be filled with a compressed compound, which releases gas under pressure to the countermass container, causing a countermass cover to rupture, thereby emptying the countermass fluid.

The present invention relates in general to the field of weaponry. In particular the present invention relates to a bleeding mechanism for use in the propulsion system of a recoilless insensitive munition utilizing a fluidic countermass.

The U.S. Department of Defense is currently moving toward the long term goal of insensitive munition compliant inventory. The acquisition treatment of insensitive munitions was the subject of a Jan. 26 1999 memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition Technology and Logistics. The overall intent of the memorandum was to focus scarce resources on forward fit incorporation of insensitive munition compliant technology.

Insensitive munition is expected to save lives and materials. As defined in STANAG 4439 insensitive munitions mean Munitions which reliably fulfill their performance readiness and operational requirements on demand but which minimize the probability of inadvertent initiation and severity of subsequent collateral damage to weapon platforms logistics systems and personnel when subjected to unplanned stimuli. 

 Unplanned stimuli include thermal and mechanical impact threats of Fast Cook Off FCO Slow Cook Off SCO Bullet Impact BI Fragment Impact FI Sympathetic Detonation SD Shaped Charge Jet SCJ and Spall impact SI as presented in MIL STD 2105B.

The memorandum adds All munitions and weapons shall be designed to conform with insensitive munitions unplanned stimuli criteria and to use materials consistent with safety and interoperability requirements. Requirements shall be determined during the requirements validation process and shall be kept current throughout the acquisition cycle for all acquisition programs. Interoperability to include insensitive munitions policies shall be certified per CJCSI 3170.01 A. The ultimate objective is to design and field munitions which have no adverse reaction to unplanned stimuli analogous to Hazard Division 1.6 TB 700 2 NAVSEAINST 8020.8B T.O. 11A 1 47 DLAR 8220.1 Department of Defense Ammunition and Explosives Hazard Classification Procedures . 

While prior efforts to develop an insensitive munition IM propulsion system for a recoilless weapon utilizing a countermass presented certain advantages they still suffered from numerous shortcomings amongst which are the following 

According to United States Code Title 10 Chapter 141 Section 2389 Ensuring safety regarding Insensitive Munitions IM the Secretary of Defense shall ensure to the extent practicable that munitions under development of procurement are safe throughout development and fielding when subject to unplanned stimuli.

Two tests are used to simulate munitions exposed to a fire Slow Cook Off SCO and Fast Cook Off FCC . In SCO munitions in packaged configuration are heated at a rate of 6 C. hour until it reacts. In FCC munitions are engulfed in a flame of at least 1700 C. until it reacts. It is desirable for the reaction to be limited to no more than burning Type 5 reaction . A detonation is not acceptable Type 1 reaction .

Recoilless weapons operate by using expanding propellant gases to propel a projectile forward and a mass backwards in order to minimize recoil. Some recoilless weapons utilize a fluid as a countermass which is propelled backwards in order to minimize the hazard of the back blast to allow for firing from enclosure.

When tested for IM the propulsion systems of the recoilless weapons sometimes ignite launching the projectile which fails IM requirements with a Type 4 deflagration. The warhead may become armed and detonate which fails IM with a Type 1 detonation. It has been found that the removal of the countermass will often prevent the projectile from leaving the barrel and arming.

It would therefore be desirable to provide a bleeding mechanism for use in the propulsion system of a recoilless insensitive munition IM utilizing a utilizing a fluidic countermass that addresses the foregoing problems associated with convention IM systems. The bleeding mechanism would be activated by excess heat and as a result it would cause the countermass container to rupture. Once ruptured the countermass fluid will drain out. Without a countermass the propulsion system will no longer function. The need for such a bleeding mechanism has heretofore remained unsatisfied.

The present invention satisfies this need and describes a novel bleeding mechanism for use in the propulsion system of a recoilless insensitive munition IM utilizing a utilizing a fluidic countermass.

According to a preferred embodiment the present bleeding mechanism utilizes a firing pin or a similar device which is held in place by any one or more of 

The insensitive munition generally includes a tubular barrel within which a projectile or warhead is housed. A propulsion system and a liquid filled countermass container are also housed within the barrel behind the projectile.

The present bleeding mechanism can either form part of the insensitive munition or it can be externally and separately connected to the insensitive munition. In either design the bleeding mechanism is connected to an inlet of the countermass container.

When the insensitive munition is exposed to an unplanned stimulus such as heat the reaction of a heat sensitive material within the bleeding mechanism allows a firing pin to be released and to rupture a cartridge seal. The cartridge may be filled with a compressed gas or a compound that releases gas when exposed to heat. The released gas may be any suitable gas such as carbon dioxide nitrogen and helium. The compound may be a material that outgases when heated such as sodium bicarbonate potassium carbonate and potassium bicarbonate or an energetic material that combusts to generate gas.

With the fluid removed from the countermass container if the propulsion system activates the projectile will remain within the insensitive munition.

If the bleeding mechanism is located outside the barrel it will be readily exposed to the heat of a cook off. The filament wound barrel of the weapon is a good insulator and restricts the flow of heat to the heat sensitive device. The positioning of the device outside the weapon allows it to react to the thermal stimuli in a timely manner.

More specifically the present bleeding mechanism utilizes a heat sensitive material that may include any one or more of the following designs 

Similar numerals refer to similar elements in the drawings. It should be understood that the sizes of the different components in the figures are not necessarily in exact proportion or to scale and are shown for visual clarity and for the purpose of explanation.

Since the insensitive munition often utilizes a filament wound barrel in order to maximize strength and minimize weight cutting holes in the barrel to allow the countermass within the countermass container will compromise the integrity of the insensitive munition and is therefore neither feasible nor recommended.

Wherefore the present invention generally describes a novel bleeding mechanism for use as an external auxiliary to an insensitive munition for example as part of a storage unit or container as illustrated in . Since the bleeding mechanism is located externally relative to the barrel it is not shielded from the heat of the cook off.

Alternatively the bleeding mechanism can form an integral part of the insensitive munition and could be secured externally to a barrel or it could be placed internally relative to the barrel of the insensitive munition .

The recoilless insensitive munition further includes a projectile a propulsion system that contains a propellant and a countermass container that contains a fluidic countermass .

The countermass container is generally cylindrically shaped and is open at one end thereof. When the countermass container is filled with the fluidic countermass its open end is sealed with an elastic countermass cover . The countermass cover is secured to the barrel by means of a countermass cover retention feature that is either known or available and thus it will not be described in detail.

The countermass cover is preferably made of elastomeric material such as Polyethylene in order to allow for expansion under pressure. The fluidic countermass is preferably a saline solution but could be any other suitable solution including but not limited to Iron oxide solution plastic confetti.

The countermass container also includes a compressed gas inlet that is connected to an inlet tube for allowing the compressed air to enter through the inlet to the countermass container via the inlet tube as it will be explained later in greater detail. The inlet tube forms part of the bleeding mechanism .

The bleeding mechanism further includes a bleeding controller that controls the flow of the gas to the countermass container as illustrated in . The bleeding controller generally includes a generally cylindrically shaped bleeding chamber that retains the neck of the cylinder at one of its ends. The bleeding chamber further retains the tube and provides a path for the gas that escapes from the cylinder .

The opposite end of the bleeding controller houses a slidable firing pin assembly . The firing pin assembly includes a firing pin that protrudes axially in the direction of the seal within the bleeding chamber . The firing pin assembly further includes a support body that supports the firing pin and that is capable of sliding axially toward the seal as it will be explained in connection with .

Under normal conditions that is in the absence of an unplanned stimulus the support body compresses a spring against a base . This compression state is maintained by means of a locking mechanism as long as the thermal and other conditions remain within predefined normal parameters.

According to this preferred embodiment the locking mechanism includes a The locking feature such as a ball and a heat sensitive alloy . In this compression state the heat sensitive alloy is placed within a crevice indentation or deformation within the inner surface of the bleeding chamber . The locking ball is placed against the alloy and retains it in place.

The heat sensitive material can be a low melting point eutectic solder such as an Indium tin alloy. Since a small amount of the eutectic solder or alloy is needed the cost of the locking mechanism will not be significantly affected. The eutectic alloy has an ideal thermal response to heat melting completely at a precise temperature. The present invention utilizes the eutectic alloy as a secondary feature in the locking mechanism allowing the higher mechanical properties of the steel ball to hold back the firing pin .

The locking ball is preferably spherically shaped. The locking ball can be made of any suitable material including but not limited to stainless steel. The crevice is shaped and dimensioned so that in the compressed state as it accommodates the unmelted alloy a portion of the locking ball protrudes outwardly from the crevice so as to engage an edge of the support body . As a result the locking mechanism retains the firing pin assembly in a locked position with the spring compressed against the base .

Referring now to it illustrates the bleeding mechanism in an activated state. If and when the environmental conditions change that is when the insensitive munition is exposed to an unplanned stimulus for example if the thermal conditions surrounding the insensitive change such as when the heat sensitive alloy is exposed to elevated temperatures for example approximately 250 F. then the heat sensitive alloy melts causing the locking ball to recede within the crevice . The recession of the locking ball unlocks the locking mechanism by releasing the edge of the support body from the wedging of the ball and causes the spring to expand forcing the support body and the firing pin forward toward the seal rupturing it.

As the seal is ruptured the pressurized gas within the cylinder expands and escapes through the ruptured seal the bleeding chamber and the tube to the countermass container .

When the bleeding mechanism is not been activated the countermass cover is in a deflated or undeployed state and the sharp edge of the openers remains at a safe distance from the countermass cover so as not to puncture it.

As more clearly illustrated in input air at atmospheric pressure enters the countermass container through the rupture and further forces the fluid countermass to drain through the rupture until the countermass container is emptied of its fluid content . Consequently the propulsion system will be disabled.

Rather the countermass cover of the countermass container is made of a readily rupturable material such as for example polyethylene that ruptures when the countermass cover is deployed under pressure from the injected gas as explained earlier.

The sliding assembly retains the neck of the cylinder in a slidable relationship relative to the housing . The bleeding chamber provides a path for the gas that escapes from the cylinder .

In this embodiment the firing pin is secured to a fixed structure and the pressurized gas cylinder is retained in a spring loaded position against a housing .

To this end the body of the cylinder is surrounded by a spring that is compressed against the bottom side . This compressed position is maintained by means of a locking mechanism that is similar in function to that of the locking mechanism .

The locking mechanism includes a sliding assembly that surrounds and that is tightly secured to the neck of the cylinder . The sliding assembly includes an indentation within which the heat sensitive alloy is housed. The locking ball is inserted within the indentation atop the heat sensitive alloy such that a portion of the locking ball protrudes from the indentation.

The protruding portion of the locking ball engages a sleeve that is affixed to the housing . As a result the engagement of the sleeve and the locking ball retains the spring in a compressed position holding the cylinder at a distance from the firing pin .

In turn the sleeve disengages from the locking bail which allows the sliding assembly along with the cylinder to be propelled forward toward the firing pin . As a result the firing pin punctures the seal of the cylinder resulting in the escape of the gas from within the cylinder to the countermass container through the tube as described earlier.

It should be understood that other modifications might be made to the present bleeding mechanism without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example the present invention may be applied to single use recoilless rifles utilizing a liquid countermass and for the IAM Individual Assault Munition .
