title: Framework for generating programs to process beacons
abstract: In one embodiment, a method receives an object model determined from a specification for processing beacons. The method determines first information for a beacon object referenced in a basefact object to determine which beacon objects are applicable for the basefact object. Second information is determined for the structured data fields referenced in the basefact object to determine which output fields map to which structured data fields and third information is determined for a set of transformations for a set of input fields in the set of composite objects for the beacon to determine how to perform transformations to transform the set of input fields to the set of output fields. The method then generates instructions for a target program to process the beacons to transform the set of input fields to the set of output fields and map the set of output fields to the structured data fields.
