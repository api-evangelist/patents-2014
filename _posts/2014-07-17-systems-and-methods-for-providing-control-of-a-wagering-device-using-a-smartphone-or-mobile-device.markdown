This application is a non provisional application that claims priority from Provisional Application No. 61 902 551 filed Nov. 11 2013 and is incorporated herein by reference.

A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material that is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.

The field of the invention relates to systems and methods for controlling and directing the operation of a gaming device or gaming terminal using a player s smartphone tablet or other mobile device.

For many years gaming terminals were constructed and configured to provide for the play by a player sitting in front of the machine and interacting through buttons handles and touch screen. For example gaming devices includes a button panel through which the player may input a wager select their wager parameters such as pay lines and initiate play. The initiation of play was for many years accomplished by the player pulling a handle to cock the mechanical drive mechanism to rotate mechanical reels. Modernly the handle triggers a switch to initiate play. A play and repeat bet button on the button panel may also initiate play. More recently touch screen displays have enabled players to provide controlling input to the gaming terminal such as selecting wagers the wagered upon proposition as well as initiate play and cash out their winnings for example. The touch screen also enable the player to interact with secondary or bonus games by making selections toward achieving a result.

A drawback of gaming devices is that the player must sit at the gaming terminal in a position to operate the buttons. The player may have to reach to the touch screen or to reach the buttons in the case of a smaller player. The players may not easily change their seating position without having to turn to reach the buttons. Furthermore game control mechanics are limited by the buttons and touch screen configurations.

Some gaming terminals include large displays or secondary displays which cannot be easily reached by players to interact with them. For example a game may trigger a secondary game on a secondary display above the primary display. The player must interact with the secondary display through the button panel or primary display touch screen since they cannot reach the secondary display.

Furthermore inasmuch as gaming terminal buttons and screen are touched by many people there is a likelihood of transmitting a virus or other disease between players.

In a heretofore unrelated field modernly many individuals have Smartphones tablet computers mini table computers and similar mobile devices such as cellular telephones which include Broadband Internet and near field communication capabilities.

It would be advantageous if a system and method could be provided to enable a player to control the action at a gaming terminal by and through a player s own mobile device. In this instance the player would not need to repeatedly touch buttons and screen touched by previous player and could sit in any comfortable position without having to reach the buttons screens.

It would also be advantageous if a system and method could be provided to enable a player to control the action at a secondary display or a remote location on a large display in a portrait mode by and through a player s own mobile device.

It would further be advantageous if a system and method could be provided to enable a player to control the action at a gaming terminal by and through a player s own mobile device and to utilize the axis sensors of the mobile device in controlling the gaming device to provide unique features and presentations. For example a player may use their mobile device to simulate steering a vehicle which is displayed on the gaming device to play a secondary or feature game. The player may also use gesture motion of the portable device to simulate the pull of the gaming terminal play prompt handle and to make selections or control other action.

In regards to the above it would be advantageous to provide a system and method for uniquely linking a player s mobile device to the gaming device for play and to avoid multiple linkages to several nearby gaming devices or corruption of control of neighboring machines by other players.

It would also be advantageous to enable a player to capture a play or screen display to their portable device for example to memorialize a jackpot win.

The peripherals include but are not limited to the following and may include individual processing capability bill voucher acceptor to validate and accept currency and ticket vouchers the player interfaces such a buttons primary and secondary game displays and any secondary or tertiary displays with without touch screen functionality monitors and lights. The peripherals may include the displays as hereinafter described with reference to the various embodiments of the present invention as herein described or their equivalents. For example the bill voucher acceptor is typically connected to the game input output board of the EGM processing board which is in turn connected to a conventional central processing unit CPU board such as an Intel Pentium microprocessor mounted on a gaming motherboard. The I O board may be connected to CPU processor board by a serial connection such as RS 232 or USB or may be attached to the processor by a bus such as but not limited to an ISA bus. The gaming motherboard may be mounted with other conventional components such as are found on conventional personal computer motherboards and loaded with a game program which may include a gaming machine operating system OS such as a Bally Alpha OS. EGM processor board executes a game program that causes the gaming terminal to display and play a game. The various components and included devices may be installed with conventionally and or commercially available components devices and circuitry into a conventional and or commercially available gaming terminal cabinet .

When a player has inserted a form of currency such as for example and without limitation paper currency coins or tokens cashless tickets or vouchers electronic funds transfers or the like into the currency acceptor a signal is sent by way of bus to the I O board and to EGM processor board which in turn assigns an appropriate number of credits for play in accordance with the game program. The player may further control the operation of the gaming machine by way of other peripherals for example to select the amount to wager via the buttons . The game starts in response to the player operating a start mechanism such as the handle button such as a SPIN RESET button or a touch screen icon. The game program includes a random number generator to provide a display of randomly selected indicia on one or more displays such as the primary game display as shown in . In some embodiments the random generator may be physically separate from gaming terminal for example it may be part of a central determination host system which provides random game outcomes to the game program. Finally EGM processor board under control of the game program and OS compares the outcome to an award schedule. The set of possible game outcomes may include a subset of outcomes related to the triggering and play of a feature or bonus game. In the event the displayed outcome is a member of this subset EGM processor board under control of the game program and by way of I O Board may cause feature bonus game play to be presented on the primary game display and or any secondary display s .

Predetermined payout amounts for certain outcomes including feature game outcomes are stored as part of the game program. Such payout amounts are in response to instructions from EGM processor board provided to the player in the form of coins credits or currency via I O board and a pay mechanism which may be one or more of a credit meter a coin hopper a voucher printer an electronic funds transfer protocol or any other payout means known or developed in the art.

In various embodiments the game program is stored in a memory device not shown connected to or mounted on the gaming motherboard. By way of example but not by limitation such memory devices include external memory devices hard drives CD ROMs DVDs and flash memory cards. In an alternative embodiment the game programs are stored in a remote storage device. In an embodiment the remote storage device is housed in a remote server such as a downloadable gaming server. The gaming terminal may access the remote storage device via a network connection including but not limited to a local area network connection a TCP IP connection a wireless connection or any other means for operatively networking components together. Optionally other data including graphics sound files and other media data for use with the gaming terminal are stored in the same or a separate memory device not shown . Some or all of the game program and its associated data may be loaded from one memory device into another for example from flash memory to random access memory RAM .

In one or more embodiments peripherals may be connected to the system over Ethernet connections directly to the appropriate server or tied to the system controller inside the gaming terminal using USB serial or Ethernet connections. Each of the respective devices may have upgrades to their firmware utilizing these connections.

GMU includes an integrated circuit board and GMU processor and memory including coding for network communications such as the G2S game to system protocol from the Gaming Standards Association Las Vegas Nev. used for system communications over the network. As shown GMU may connect to the card reader shown as in through bus and may thereby obtain player information and transmit the information over the network through bus . Gaming activity information may be transferred by the EGM Processor Board to GMU where the information may be translated into a network protocol such as S2S for transmission to a server such as a player tracking server where information about a player s playing activity may be stored in a designated server database. This information may include time machine identification data coin in coin out jackpots or other information.

PID includes an integrated circuit board PID processor iView CPU and memory which includes an operating system such as Windows CE a player interface program which may be executable by the PID processor together with various input output I O drivers for respective devices which connect to PID processor and which may further include various games or game components playable on PTM or playable on a connected network server and PTM is operable as the player interface. PID connects to card reader shown as in through bus player tracking display shown as iView display in through video decoder and bus such as an LVDS or VGA bus.

As part of its programming the PID processor executes coding to drive player tracking display and provide messages and information to a player. Touch screen circuitry interactively connects PTM display and video decoder to PTM such that a player may input information and causes the information to be transmitted either on the player s initiative or responsive to a query. Additionally soft keys connect through bus to PID and operate together with the player tracking display to provide information or queries to a player and receive responses or queries from the player. PID in turn communicates over the CMS SMS network through Ethernet switch and busses and with respective servers such as a player tracking server.

PTMs provide a link between the virtual private WAN LAN network of the system components and the gaming terminal . The system components include the player tacking module e.g. Bally iVIEW device iView is a registered trademark of Bally Gaming Inc. PID EGM processing board and game monitoring unit GMU processing board . These system components may connect over a network to the slot management system such as a commercially available Bally SDS SMS and or casino management system such as a commercially available Bally CMP CMS .

The GMU system component has a connection to the base game through a serial SAS connection and is connected to various servers using for example HTTPs over Ethernet. Through this connection firmware media operating system software gaming machine configurations can be downloaded to the system components from the servers. This data is authenticated prior to installation on the system components.

The system components include the PTM processing board PID and game monitoring unit GMU . The GMU PID and PTM can be combined into one like the commercially available Bally GTM iVIEW device. The PTM may also interface with a switcher and router device of the type described above. In such case instead of providing the PTM display the switcher and router device provides for the content normally display at the PTM display to be displayed at one or more of the primary or secondary displays .

In accordance with one or more embodiments is a functional block diagram of a gaming kernel of a game program under control of gaming terminal EGM processor board . The game program uses gaming kernel by calling into application programming interface API which is part of game manager . The components of game kernel as shown in are only illustrative and should not be considered limiting. For example the number of managers may be changed additional managers may be added or some managers may be removed without deviating from the scope and spirit of the invention.

As shown in the example there are three layers a hardware layer an operating system layer such as but not limited to Linux and a game kernel layer having game manager therein. In one or more embodiments the use of an operating system layer such a UNIX based or Windows based operating system allows game developers interfacing to the gaming kernel to use any of a number of standard development tools and environments available for the operating systems. This is in contrast to the use of proprietary low level interfaces which may require significant time and engineering investments for each game upgrade hardware upgrade or feature upgrade. The game kernel executes at the user level of the operating system layer and itself contains a major component called the I O board server . To properly set the bounds of game application software making integrity checking easier all game applications interact with gaming kernel using a single API in game manager . This enables game applications to make use of a well defined consistent interface as well as making access points to gaming kernel controlled where overall access is controlled using separate processes.

For example game manager parses an incoming command stream and when a command dealing with I O comes in arrow the command is sent to an applicable library routine . Library routine decides what it needs from a device and sends commands to I O board server see arrow . A few specific drivers remain in operating system layer s kernel shown as those below line . These are built in primitive or privileged drivers that are i general ii kept to a minimum and iii are easier to leave than extract. In such cases the low level communications is handled within operating system layer and the contents passed to library routines .

Thus in a few cases library routines may interact with drivers inside operating system layer which is why arrow is shown as having three directions between library routines and I O board server or between library routines and certain drivers in operating system layer . No matter which path is taken the logic needed to work with each device is coded into modules in the user layer of the diagram. Operating board server layer is kept as simple stripped down and common across as many hardware platforms as possible. The library utilities and user level drivers change as dictated by the game cabinet or game machine in which it will run. Thus each game cabinet or game machine may have an industry standard EGM EGM processing board connected to a unique relatively dumb and as inexpensive as possible I O adapter board plus a gaming kernel which will have the game machine unique library routines and I O board server components needed to enable game applications to interact with the gaming machine cabinet. Note that these differences are invisible to the game application software with the exception of certain functional differences i.e. if a gaming cabinet has stereo sound the game application will be able make use of API to use the capability over that of a cabinet having traditional monaural sound .

Game manager provides an interface into game kernel providing consistent predictable and backwards compatible calling methods syntax and capabilities by way of game application API . This enables the game developer to be free of dealing directly with the hardware including the freedom to not have to deal with low level drivers as well as the freedom to not have to program lower level managers although lower level managers may be accessible through game manager s interface if a programmer has the need. In addition to the freedom derived from not having to deal with the hardware level drivers and the freedom of having consistent callable object oriented interfaces to software managers of those components drivers game manager provides access to a set of high level managers also having the advantages of consistent callable object oriented interfaces and further providing the types and kinds of base functionality required in casino type games. Game manager providing all the advantages of its consistent and richly functional game application API as supported by the rest of game kernel thus provides a game developer with a multitude of advantages.

Game manager may have several objects within itself including an initialization object not shown . The initialization object performs the initialization of the entire game machine including other objects after game manager has started its internal objects and servers in appropriate order. In order to carry out this function the kernel s configuration manager is among the first objects to be started configuration manager has data needed to initialize and correctly configure other objects or servers.

The high level managers of game kernel may include game event log manager which provides at the least a logging or logger base class enabling other logging objects to be derived from this base object. The logger object is a generic logger that is it is not aware of the contents of logged messages and events. The game event log manager s job is to log events in non volatile event log space. The size of the space may be fixed although the size of the logged event is typically not. When the event space or log space fills up one embodiment will delete the oldest logged event each logged event will have a time date stamp as well as other needed information such as length providing space to record the new event. In this embodiment the most recent events will thus be found in the log space regardless of their relative importance. Further provided is the capability to read the stored logs for event review.

In accordance with one embodiment meter manager manages the various meters embodied in the game kernel . This includes the accounting information for the game machine and game play. There are hard meters counters and soft meters the soft meters may be stored in non volatile storage such as non volatile battery backed RAM to prevent loss. Further a backup copy of the soft meters may be stored in a separate non volatile storage such as EEPROM. In one embodiment meter manager receives its initialization data for the meters during start up from configuration manager . While running the cash in manager and cash out manager call the meter manager s update functions to update the meters. Meter manager will on occasion create backup copies of the soft meters by storing the soft meters readings in EEPROM. This is accomplished by calling and using EEPROM manager .

In accordance with still other embodiments progressive manager manages progressive games playable from the game machine. Event manager is generic like game event log manager and is used to manage various gaming machine events. Focus manager correlates which process has control of various focus items. Tilt manager is an object that receives a list of errors if any from configuration manager at initialization and during game play from processes managers drivers etc. that may generate errors. Random number generator manager is provided to allow easy programming access to a random number generator RNG as a RNG is required in virtually all casino style gambling games. Random number generator manager includes the capability of using multiple seeds.

In accordance with one or more embodiments a credit manager object not shown manages the current state of credits cash value or cash equivalent in the game machine including any available winnings and further provides denomination conversion services. Cash out manager has the responsibility of configuring and managing monetary output devices. During initialization cash out manager using data from configuration manager sets the cash out devices correctly and selects any selectable cash out denominations. During play a game application may post a cash out event through the event manager the same way all events are handled and using a call back posted by cash out manager cash out manager is informed of the event. Cash out manager updates the credit object updates its state in non volatile memory and sends an appropriate control message to the device manager that corresponds to the dispensing device. As the device dispenses dispensable media there will typically be event messages being sent back and forth between the device and cash out manager until the dispensing finishes after which cash out manager having updated the credit manager and any other game state such as some associated with meter manager that needs to be updated for this set of actions sends a cash out completion event to event manager and to the game application thereby. Cash in manager functions similarly to cash out manager only controlling interfacing with and taking care of actions associated with cashing in events cash in devices and associated meters and crediting.

In a further example in accordance with one or more embodiments I O board server may write data to the gaming machine EEPROM memory which is located in the gaming machine cabinet and holds meter storage that must be kept even in the event of power failure. Game manager calls the I O library functions to write data to the EEPROM. The I O board server receives the request and starts a low priority EEPROM manager thread within I O board server to write the data. This thread uses a sequence of 8 bit command and data writes to the EEPROM device to write the appropriate data in the proper location within the device. Any errors detected will be sent as IPC messages to game manager . All of this processing is asynchronous.

In accordance with one embodiment button module within I O board server polls or is sent the state of buttons every 2 ms. These inputs are debounced by keeping a history of input samples. Certain sequences of samples are required to detect a button was pressed in which case the I O board server sends an inter process communication event to game manager that a button was pressed or released. In some embodiments the gaming machine may have intelligent distributed I O which debounces the buttons in which case button module may be able to communicate with the remote intelligent button processor to get the button events and simply relay them to game manager via IPC messages. In still another embodiment the I O library may be used for pay out requests from the game application. For example hopper module must start the hopper motor constantly monitor the coin sensing lines of the hopper debounce them and send an IPC message to the game manager when each coin is paid.
