title: Computing infrastructure
abstract: An affordable, highly trustworthy, survivable and available, operationally efficient distributed supercomputing infrastructure for processing, sharing and protecting both structured and unstructured information. A primary objective of the SHADOWS infrastructure is to establish a highly survivable, essentially maintenance-free shared platform for extremely high-performance computing (i.e., supercomputing)—with “high performance” defined both in terms of total throughput, but also in terms of very low-latency (although not every problem or customer necessarily requires very low latency)—while achieving unprecedented levels of affordability at its simplest, the idea is to use distributed “teams” of nodes in a self-healing network as the basis for managing and coordinating both the work to be accomplished and the resources available to do the work. The SHADOWS concept of “teams” is responsible for its ability to “self-heal” and “adapt” its distributed resources in an “organic” manner. Furthermore, the “teams” themselves are at the heart of decision-making, processing, and storage in the SHADOWS infrastructure. Everything that's important is handled under the auspices and stewardship of a team

This invention relates generally to COMPUTING INFRASTRUCTURE and more specifically to NETWORKS OF SURVIVABLE COMPUTING SYSTEMS.

There was a time when anything that could be done on a computer could be done faster on a supercomputer. However because supercomputers could address challenges that were well beyond the capabilities of ordinary computers they became increasingly specialized with emphasis on compute bound problems making them somewhat less suitable for general purpose computing. Business computers also evolved while retaining their general purpose nature and also became faster. In order to address a broader range of high performance computing HPC needs supercomputers need to become more general purpose because the largest potential HPC markets are by far associated with business needs. Likewise to address those large potential HPC markets business computers need to gain much more performance. Finally the largest potential HPC markets are likely to remain unaddressable until the associated needs can be met and one of the key needs is affordability.

There is an ongoing and increasing demand possibly an insatiable demand for affordable computer processing power. Supercomputers or alternatively high performance computing HPC systems have historically been very expensive and thus confined to a relatively small set of applications e.g. weather modeling academic and government based research etc. paid for by well funded customers and users and thus have been out of reach of many potential customers. The customer set has been so limited that for many years the highest performing systems have been tracked on a list presently known as the Top 500 www.top500.org . Such a list would not be practical if even a reasonable fraction of the customers who could take advantage of supercomputers actually purchased and operated them.

The potential market for supercomputers is essentially untapped primarily because it is mostly not addressable with the supercomputers available today nor is it apparently addressable with today s business servers including mainframes .

Today s supercomputers and business servers not only miss the mark in terms of affordability but also in terms of their fitness for purpose. While there are clearly a few enterprise applications that are a good fit for supercomputers as they are presently designed the large majority of commercial applications are not a good fit at present partly due to a requirements mismatch. While business servers are already better suited to running today s commercial applications they cannot provide the computer power needed for the next generation of HPC class business applications. Ultimately the vendors of supercomputers and business servers are both racing to address the same markets but from different starting points . . . .

Beyond the applications themselves there are very real issues associated with achieving high levels of affordable system survivability disaster recovery and security including data confidentiality integrity availability etc. which we assert are not addressed well by any contender 

Collectively these concerns bring us back to affordability not only in terms of capital expense i.e. the cost of asset acquisition but more importantly the operational expense. It is well known in the industry that despite the fact that the acquisition cost of supercomputing assets is very high it is quickly surpassed by the cost of operating those assets. Together these asset acquisition and operational costs comprise the total cost of ownership TCO which is a key factor in any return on investment ROI calculation. However as we move forward the trend toward an increased demand for supercomputing may not be merely to achieve a particular ROI but rather to survive. If done right which includes affordability as a prerequisite supercomputing may enjoy network effects and become indispensable i.e. highly competitive companies may in all likelihood need access to supercomputing and ROI may become far less relevant making the buying decision a more obvious choice. Thus for the addressable markets affordable supercomputing may become a necessary component in the business survival kit.

 An affordable highly trustworthy survivable and available operationally efficient distributed supercomputing infrastructure for processing sharing and protecting both structured and unstructured information. 

Over time however there has been increasing impetus to extend the applicability of supercomputers to a much broader range of commercial problem areas. In a preferred embodiment the system establishes a supercomputing platform that meets the needs of the broad but unaddressed market for high performance computing both in terms of total throughput but also in terms of low latency although not every problem or customer necessarily requires low latency while achieving unprecedented levels of affordability both capital and operational expense . Affordability trustworthiness survivability and fault tolerance may be among the essential needs yet these requirements have historically been in conflict with each other and resolving them requires a new approach.

The design of the system began with a focus on built in security survivability and trustworthiness the key ingredients for business critical mission critical computing and the associated implications have permeated every aspect of the invention.

Recognizing that labor is a significant operational expense and thus affects affordability from a TCO perspective the system was intentionally designed to operate in a lights out hands off unattended maintenance free environment. In a preferred embodiment suitably configured the system is designed to operate unattended in low cost remote locations for years.

The system incorporates design concepts that address next generation needs so that supercomputer manufacturing and production can occur on a scale appropriate for a radically enlarged addressable market resulting in the lowest possible cost structure while maximizing production flexibility. This sort of quantum reduction in cost structure is preferred if only to achieve the levels of affordability necessary to jumpstart the otherwise unaddressable broadest markets.

Due to the start from scratch system design approach and the myriad details associated with that approach the invention is best summarized by highlighting its extreme benefits. In a preferred embodiment the system offers 

Although the system is relatively modular by design there are many components and thus a commensurate large number of potential interconnections dependencies and interactions. Nonetheless for the purpose of teaching the aforementioned systems and methods the Table of Contents beginning on the next page attempts to summarize and group the diverse components and their relationships and to organize them in a somewhat linear way despite their distinctly non linear nature.

13.1.5 Lindenblad Omni Directional Elliptically Polarized Dipole Arrays With Full Length Shortened Capped Elements

ADSL. Asymmetric DSL. A DSL communications link characterized by its asymmetric download and upload rates e.g. 1.5 Mbps download 900 Kbps upload . See also DSL.

AFR. Annualized Failure Rate. The percentage of disk drives in a population that fail in a test scaled to a per year estimation. The AFR of a new product is typically estimated based on accelerated life and stress tests or based on field data from earlier products commonly on the assumption that the drives are 100 powered on . AFR estimates are typically included in vendor datasheets e.g. 0.88 0.73 0.63 etc. for high quality disks with MTTFs in the range of 1 million hours to 1.4 million hours . However the datasheet AFR and the field AFR differ widely. According to a 2006 study of large scale supercomputer clusters and ISPs that analyzed drives over a 5 year period the field AFR exceeds 1 with 2 to 4 common and up to 12 observed on some systems. See also ISP NEAR MTTF.

ASIC. Application Specific Integrated Circuit. A hardware device containing fixed not reconfigurable logic and other circuitry. See also FGPA.

Availability. Ability of a component or service to perform its required function at a stated instant or over a stated period of time. It is usually expressed as an availability ratio or percentage i.e. the proportion of time that a system can be used for productive work. Availability over a particular period of time is calculated as Total Time Unavailable Time Total Time where the Unavailable Time is closely related to the MTTR. Availability goals are often expressed as 99.9 three nines availability or 99.99 four nines availability and so on. Three nines 99.9 implies a maximum downtime of 8 hours and 46 minutes per year whereas four nines 99.99 limits the downtime to 53 minutes per year based on 365.25 days per year or 8766 hours per year. . Also In the context of security availability refers to the property of a system or a system resource that ensures it is accessible and usable upon demand by an authorized system user. Availability is one of the core characteristics of a secure system. See also AFR MTTF MTTR.

BB RAM. Battery Backed RAM. A type of NVRAM implemented by combining a conventional RAM e.g. SRAM or SDRAM with a battery backup in order to prevent data loss in case of power failure. Since the battery backup capability can typically sustain a relatively short period of operation BB RAM systems sometimes include low cost secondary storage such as one or more magnetic disk drives depending on redundancy requirements . Alternative NVRAM implementations e.g. MRAM FeRAM F RAM etc. are available that do not require battery backup capability. The SHADOWS CHARM technology uses diverse NVRAM technologies including BB RAM. However CHARM s primary rationale for using BB RAM in conjunction with the FIRE and NEAR technologies is to be able to better control its secure erasure in case of intrusion in addition to its traditional NVRAM use as non volatile storage. See also CHARM FIRE MRAM NEAR NVRAM RAM.

Bloom Filter. A probabilistic algorithm to quickly test membership in a large set using multiple hash functions into a single array of bits. Bloom filters have a space efficient set membership structure whose key characteristic is to never yield false negatives although it may yield false positives. Bloom s algorithm lets one determine whether a value has been previously handled e.g. processed stored etc. although one must allow the possibility of a false positive when extracting this information. Given a Bloom bit array N bits long and a numeric value e.g. a high quality hash whose presence we wish to store we take the first N bits from the result of the numeric value and set the index N in the bit array to TRUE. We repeat this about 5 to 20 times setting 5 to 20 bits respectively in the bit array using the next consecutive N bits from the numeric value. The N bit array starts out reset FALSE before we start to populate it with data. As the bit array becomes more populated sometimes we may set a bit that has already been set. This is the root of the false positive cases we examine later. When we wish to whether a numeric value has been previously handled we proceed in almost the exact way except that we read the bits from the bit array instead of setting them. As we read the bits if any of them are zero FALSE the numeric value is guaranteed to have never been handled. If all of the bits are set TRUE the numeric value has probably been handled and other means must be used to obtain a definitive authoritative answer. The saturation of a Bloom filter is defined to be the percent of bits set to TRUE in the bit array. The phase of a Bloom filter is defined to be the number of times we attempt to set a bit in the array 5 to 20 times in this example . Both of these variables can be modified to change the accuracy and capacity of the Bloom filter. Generally speaking the larger the size of the bit array N and the higher the phase the smaller the probability of false positive responses occurring. Statistically the chance of a false positive can be determined by taking the saturation which decreases with increasing filter size and raising it to the power of the phase.

BLOOMER . Banked Layered Orthogonally Optimized Matrix of Energy Receivers. An apparatus for deploying and controlling a multiplicity of energy receivers in orthogonal banks and layers so as to maximize their ability to collect energy from their intended source each is typically designed for a particular renewable or high capacity energy resource such as the sun the wind a river or the ocean . The basic idea is that in lieu of deploying an array of one or more large receivers to be able to deploy one or more arrays possibly distributed geographically of smaller receivers that can more easily be automatically repositioned and or reconfigured. The goal of automatic repositioning and reconfiguration is at least two fold 1 to maximize each receiver s ability to collect energy and thereby maximize the collected energy in aggregate and 2 to maximize the survivability of each receiver array and thereby maximize the survivability of the maximal energy collection capability. Conceptually when closed the apparatus minimizes the exposure of the energy receivers to various primary and or secondary threats and when bloomed the apparatus maximizes the exposure of the energy receivers to their intended energy source.

BOSS . Byzantine Object Subject Security. A distributed timely trusted computing base TCB and object subject security system that incorporates Byzantine agreement logic from the classic Byzantine generals problem in its decision making process and collectively makes security decisions in a fail silent manner that provides survivability even in the face of multiple failures and or corrupted nodes. BOSS is implemented and instantiated only in conjunction with a MASTER and works in conjunction with CHARM to control who gets access to what and when while ensuring that unauthorized information is not exposed not even to other internal systems . BOSS is designed to enable the SHADOWS infrastructure to support both classified and unclassified information processing and storage e.g. to meet or exceed Common Criteria CC Protection Profiles PP such as the U.S. DoD Remote Access Protection Profile for High Assurance Environments Version 1.0 June 2000 nominally at EAL5 or potentially at EAL6 if implemented by a single qualified development organization . Any BOSS node that fails or becomes corrupted may be restarted or replaced and in any case should not be trusted until its trustworthiness can be re established from scratch to the satisfaction of the surviving trusted nodes including at a minimum other MASTERs with which it previously participated as a team member. See also CC CHARM DoD EAL MASTER PP TCB.

Cache. A small fast memory relative to a larger slower memory holding recently accessed data designed to speed up subsequent access to the same data. Most often applied to processor memory access but also used for a local copy of data accessible over a network etc. See also Cache Conflict Direct Mapped Cache Fully Associative Cache Set Associative Cache.

Cache Conflict. A sequence of accesses to memory repeatedly overwriting the same cache entry. This can happen if two blocks of data which are mapped to the same set of cache locations are needed to be read or written simultaneously. See also Cache Line.

Cache Line. Or cache block . The smallest unit of memory than can be transferred between the main memory and the cache. Rather than reading from a larger but slower memory one word or byte at a time each cache entry is usually holds a certain number of words known as a cache line or cache block and a whole line is read and cached at once. This takes advantage of the principle of locality of reference if one location is read then nearby locations particularly following locations are likely to be read soon afterwards. See also Cache.

Caching. Caching is a useful general technique that sometimes makes programs run faster. It does this by exchanging space for time Caching tries to save previously accessed or computed results in an attempt to reuse them later rather than recomputing them. Caching is useful in all kinds of situations including almost any kind of searching cache the results of the search so that you can skip it next time HTML generation cache the results of the generation process so that you don t have to generate the page next time and numeric computation cache the results of the computation . See also Cache FACTUAL Memoization.

CC. Common Criteria. Here this refers to Common Criteria CC for Information Technology Security Evaluations Version 2.1 August 1999. See also PP.

CHARM . Compressed Hierarchical Associative Relational Memory. An associative memory system that provides high capacity highly available and survivable persistent storage and secure rapid recall of information. Incorporates local FIREblades and NEARblades or FIREdrives and NEARdrives and collaborates with CHARM systems of other local and remote SCRAM nodes. Unlike relational databases all information is indexed and from a hardware perspective all index storage is electronic no latency due to spinning media but without the expense associated with general purpose SSD. Unlike relational databases records or objects not meeting security constraints are never even accessed e.g. in order to check security attributes . Hard disks store only fractional archival data. All geographically colocated equipment and data are expendable without information loss or disclosure. See also FACTUAL FIRE NEAR SCRAM SSD.

CNC. Computer Numerical Control. A computer aided manufacturing technology using computers to control cutting machines such as milling machines and lathes to cut specified three dimensional shapes. CNC has been used since the early 1970s. Prior to this machines were controlled by prepared tapes and the process was called simply Numerical Control NC .

Codec. A complementary pair of functions comprising an encoder and a decoder such that an input can be provided to the encoder the output of which is fed to the decoder the output of which is the original input. See also FEC.

CORE . Communications Optimization Reasoning Engines. A collection of engines whose purpose is to encapsulate and securely execute high performance and or hardware assisted general purpose implementations of critical compute intensive processes to minimize latency maximize overall throughput and reduce operational costs. These engines e.g. FACTUAL FASTpage are typically closely associated with other systems and are thus described in those contexts. See also FACTUAL FASTpage.

Critical Heat Flux. The heat flux beyond which boiling cannot be sustained because the liquid working fluid no longer wets the surface of the heat source. Since heat flux is typically given in of W cm2 those skilled in the art may recognize that the critical heat flux can be extended by numerous means including any that increase the effective surface area of the heat source the denominator for a given level of power the numerator but also including the use of increased turbulence special coatings etc. See also Heat Flux RUBE.

DDoS. Distributed DoS. A DoS involving distributed attack sources such as when multiple compromised systems cooperate to flood the bandwidth or resources of a targeted system usually one or more web servers. The systems involved in a DDoS attack become compromised by the DDoS perpetrators via a wide variety of methods and depending on the nature and extent of the compromise may contain relatively static hardcoded attack vectors e.g. MyDoom which involved a hardcoding the IP address in advance of an attack or may contain sophisticated control mechanisms such that the compromised systems collectively form one or more botnets. Unlike hardcoded attacks botnets can be controlled dynamically and thus targeted at any IP address at any time. The DDoS strategy provides an attack perpetrator with numerous advantages 1 orders of magnitude more attack traffic than a simple DoS 2 increased stealth and detection avoidance and 3 significant defense challenges for the targeted victims since the aggregate bandwidth of a large botnet can easily exceed any practical amount of surplus bandwidth a defender might purchase to mitigate DDoS attacks and perpetrators can always add more compromised systems to their botnets . In a preferred embodiment of the SHADOWS infrastructure there are significant strong defenses against DDoS attacks implemented primarily in the SHADOWS FLAMERouter technology the essence of which is also in common with the SHADOWS RUSHrouter technology and by inclusion in the SHADOWS MARSHALs . The most important defenses include the ability to efficiently and accurately distinguish self bona fide traffic from non self the ability to impose adaptive flow control the ability to provide hidden services and stealthy interfaces the ability to present a continually moving multi point target thus dividing and effectively decimating the attack resources and significant means for load shedding and adaptive redistribution of defensive resources. See also DoS FLAMERouter MARSHAL RUSHrouter SELF.

DELEGATE . Distributed Execution via Local Emulation GATEway. A distinguished SERVANT node having the responsibilities of fulfilling a DELEGATE role. The DELEGATE role implements secure client side proxy agent that appears to locally implement a particular service which would normally be implemented elsewhere such as on a local or remote server but instead is actually implemented within the SHADOWS network cloud. The DELEGATE concept is described further in section 5.2. See also API DBMS DNS LDAP MPI POP3 RUSH RUSHrouter SIP SLA SMTP VoIP.

Delta Compression. Whereas any object can always be expressed in terms of another object the reference object plus the set of differences or deltas between them such expression is only beneficial if a suitable reference object can be found easily and resulting expression in terms of deltas achieves useful a compression ratio. In the art delta compression attempts to recognize the differences between successive or nearly successive versions of a file in order to express one in terms of the other plus some differences the delta . This works well in practice because the reference object i.e. the earlier file version is already known and the relationship between the files is already established the files are expected to be similar so processing is straightforward and efficient. When differences are small the compression ratio is excellent such that storing two nearly identical files with delta compression would consume little more space than storing one of them the ideal is reached when the files are identical . However applying the technique much more widely such that an arbitrary data sequence can be efficiently expressed in terms of some other arbitrary data sequence whose identity is unknown but must be efficiently discovered during the compression process is a very challenging problem that is well beyond the state of the practice. The compression in CHARM directly addresses this broader challenge by using its FASTpage search mechanisms and massively parallel implementation to efficiently locate fine grained candidate components i.e. sub objects of objects whose content is most similar to the various components of the object to be compressed. CHARM recognizes the differences between the similar content of any two objects or subjects which trivially includes versions of the same object an extremely frequent occurrence in CHARM because its objects are immutable so every version is a new object. More importantly however CHARM s compression can take advantage of different objects with partially common content such as objects having one or more shared vocabularies or having similar components sub objects . CHARM allows multiple objects to be used as reference objects so wherever commonality exists any object can be efficiently expressed in terms of the selected reference object s plus a set of deltas. Note that prior to applying delta compression CHARM applies other compression techniques such as RLE1 RLE 2 and RLE 3. While all the CHARM algorithms can be implemented in software in a preferred embodiment they are implemented in hardware in the CHARM PUMP. See also CHARM FASTpage PUMP RLE.

Demand Paging. In a virtual memory system a technique to conserve relatively scarce physical memory by loading virtual memory pages into physical memory only as they are accessed. See also Page Fault Swapping.

Direct Mapped Cache. A cache where the cache location for a given address is determined from the middle address bits. If the cache line size is 2n then the bottom n address bits correspond to an offset within a cache entry. If the cache can hold 2m entries then the next m address bits give the cache location. The remaining top address bits are stored as a tag along with the entry. In this scheme there is no choice of which block to flush on a cache miss since there is only one place for any block to go. This simple scheme has the disadvantage that if the program alternately accesses different addresses which map to the same cache location then it may suffer a cache miss on every access to these locations. This kind of cache conflict is quite likely on a multi processor. See also Cache Fully Associative Cache Set Associative Cache.

DMZ. De Militarized Zone. In networking this is a buffer zone situated between a protected LAN and a WAN and occupied by bastion servers firewalls or other devices that are sufficiently hardened so as to safely withstand direct exposure to the Internet.

DoS. Denial of Service. In computer security a denial of service attack DoS attack is an attempt to make a computer resource unavailable to its intended users. A DoS attack is characterized by an explicit attempt by attackers to prevent legitimate users of a service from using that service typically via one of the methods 1 consumption of computational resources such as bandwidth disk space or CPU time 2 disruption of configuration information such as routing information 3 disruption of physical network components. Attacks can be directed at any network device including attacks on network routers and servers e.g. web servers email servers DNS servers etc. . Examples of DoS attacks include 1 flooding a network thereby preventing legitimate network traffic 2 disrupting a server by sending more requests than it can possibly handle thereby preventing access to a service 3 preventing a particular individual from accessing a service and 4 disrupting service to a specific system or person. See also DDoS.

DRAM. Dynamic RAM. Volatile RAM that is characterized by its need to be continually refreshed in order to prevent data loss and by it relatively high storage density relatively high performance and relatively low cost. The dynamic nature of DRAM in conjunction with its rapidly increasing storage density creates a situation where there s a significant probability of multiple SEUs coinciding in the same access resulting in data loss that may be detected by SECDED but nonetheless cannot be corrected or worse yet data loss that is simply undetectable. See also CHARM MRAM NVRAM RAM SEU SRAM.

DSL. Digital Subscriber Line. A half duplex communications link typically superimposed on a standard telephone line pair such that the ordinary analog voice signal if present on the same line is not affected. DSL links are normally considered to be broadband especially for download speeds of at least 256 Kbps. See also ADSL.

EAL. Evaluation Assurance Level. A package consisting of assurance components from the Common Criteria CC Part 3 that represents a point on the Common Criteria predefined assurance scale e.g. EAL5 or EAL6 .

Emulate. Generally to imitate exactly. Specifically the capacity of one computer system to imitate another or to imitate the interfaces and environment of another such that relative to a particular set of expectations there is no difference between the emulator and that which it emulates. See also Simulate.

Emulation. The situation in which one computer behaves like another or imitates another s interfaces and environment. See also Simulation.

FACTUAL . Frequency Adaptive Computation Table Use Adaptive Lookup. A process oriented memoization memo table capability that retrieves previously computed vetted results for arbitrary deterministic processes and functions. All values that can affect the output including the identification of the exact process and any parameters may be provided as input along with a timeout value and a list intended recipients and a signed and certified result can be sent to them. FACTUAL implements a race looking up vs. recomputing vetted results but lookup typically starts before the request even reaches the head of the request queue for the target process. In the event a process starts due to timeout if there s a hit and the looked up result becomes available in time it may be used as an oracle instead to check the process. Misses cause no latency penalty. Unlike a memoized function which is responsible for caching its own results FACTUAL is a global process based capability that takes advantage of the persistent associative memory of the CHARM subsystem. See also Cache CHARM Memoization Memoize Memoized Function.

FASTpage . Fast Associative Search Tree pageable. A fast highly scalable associative memory mechanism that can adapt to the information to be remembered in order to optimize both time and space. FASTpage index size is limited only by the availability of system wide resources. FASTpage is well suited to both transient in memory data generally faster than hash table searching and persistent data designed for extremely fast searches with indexes in flash memory . The FASTpage search mechanism is based on a hybrid comprising a novel pageable Ternary Search Tree TST having compressed variable length nodes and exhibiting locality of reference and a novel pageable digital search Trie having vectored compressed variable length off page references . The FASTpage storage mechanism is optimal for flash based storage and intended for use in hierarchical memory systems such as those involving DRAM NVRAM e.g. BB RAM MRAM FeRAM or F RAM etc. flash memory and magnetic disk. In a preferred embodiment DRAM is used for in process or transient data content and for caching FASTpage pages and certain frequently accessed content NVRAM is used for metadata and building new pages FASTpage pages and content data pages flash memory is used to store FASTpage pages and frequently used content or possibly all of it depending on capacity and magnetic disk is used primarily to store referenced archival content including less frequently accessed content whose storage requirements exceeds available flash memory capacity. Conceptually in a preferred embodiment lower tiers in the hierarchical memory system subsume and therefore include the content in higher tiers notwithstanding security provisions that prevent the existence of directly usable data aggregations at any points in the system where content may be subject to attack. Each FASTpage implementation supports an arbitrary number of independent local search spaces limited only by local storage capacity. Each FASTpage search space may be individually defined to be either transient or persistent with individually specifiable survival requirements. In a preferred embodiment the FASTpage process is implemented in hardware as a CORE engine within one or more PUMP devices and also in software that executes on MASTERs SLAVEs and SERVANTs. See also CORE DRAM MASTER MRAM NVRAM PUMP SERVANT SLAVE TST.

FEC. Forward Error Correction. A form of error correction that encodes redundancy into data in order to recover the original intended data in the event of partial data loss or corruption. The forward nature of FEC stems from the fact that corrections can be applied while still making progress i.e. without having to go backward by retrying a communication or retrieval operation. CHARM uses FEC for communications and also for data distributed both locally and remotely on both transient media e.g. in DRAM and persistent media e.g. flash or magnetic storage . Because CHARM s storage formats are already FEC encoded stored data can be transmitted without further FEC encoding as appropriate. In a preferred embodiment of SHADOWS the FEC codecs are implemented as part of the CORE functions embedded in the PUMP devices. In a preferred embodiment the general purpose processors in SHADOWS also implement the FEC codecs. See also CHARM Codec CORE DRAM ECC FIRE NEAR PUMP.

FIRE . Fast Index Repository Emulator. The technology underlying a FIREblade or FIREdrive and used by CHARM as its primary online persistent storage. FIRE combines quickly securable DRAM and BB RAM for high speed storage of rapidly changing data with the DRAM used for caching already stored and therefore expendable in the clear data this does not imply that the already stored data is stored in the clear it is not but rather that the in the clear data is allowed to exist only in DRAM where it can be rapidly erased via de powering the DRAM for example in case of a security breach de powering DRAM is insufficient to prevent recovery of the most recent content by a sophisticated e.g. state sponsored attacker but it is the best available move against a powered on probe attack for example and the BB RAM used for buffering committed transactional data in conjunction with a set of other suitably distributed instantiations of FIRE with which it communicates not yet written to long term persistent data storage. FIRE uses flash based storage or its equivalent rather than magnetic storage and this provides high performance all electronic long term persistent data storage that is immune to mechanical wear and vibration including seismic events . The flash based storage also operates at very low power typically less than 1 microwatt per IOPS vs. more than 20 to 40 milliwatts per IOPS for low power and or high performance magnetic disk drives . The persistently stored data whether in BB RAM or flash memory is safe from intruders even if stolen. In the case of power failure information secured in the BB RAM can be written directly to its reserved locations in long term e.g. flash based storage. In a preferred embodiment with hundreds of input output channels the number of read write accesses per second per FIRE channel is orders of magnitude faster than the per channel rate of hard disk drives. See also BB RAM DRAM CHARM NEAR.

FLAMERouter . Firewall Link Aggregator Multiplexer Edge Router. aka FLAMER A special MASTER that serves as a gateway and tunneling router between the LAN fabrics of a SHADOWS node and one or more wide area networks WANs . Automatically tunnels SHADOWS communications protocols e.g. RUSH RECAP UNCAP over existing LAN and or WAN protocols as necessary. See also HSLS RUSHrouter LAN Tunneling Router WAN.

FORCE . Frictionless Organic Rankine Cycle Engine. A kilowatt scale turboalternator heat engine consisting primarily of an efficient low temperature 130 C. low pressure 6 8 bar vapor turbine connected to an alternator. The FORCE turboalternator has only one moving part the shaft which spins at very high speed e.g. nominally at 62 000 RPM in a preferred embodiment and rides on hydrodynamic vapor bearings essentially a vapor layer created by its rotating foils due to the Bernoulli effect. The vapor bearings are optimally advantageous to reduce friction losses to near zero during normal operation there is still some residual friction due to colliding vapor molecules . A novel optional embodiment of the FORCE turbine also engages separate pneumatic like vapor bearings during spin up and spin down but not during normal operation and thus completely avoids any wear inducing friction within the turbo machinery. In the absence of separate spin up spin down vapor bearings the foils of such turbo machinery incur friction and thus wear during spin up and spin down whenever the turbine drops below say for example about 2500 RPM .

FPGA. Field Programmable Gate Array. A type of reconfigurable logic based in hardware that may also include specialized embedded devices to that provide enhanced functionality and or performance while minimizing the use of reconfigurable logic gates. Contrast with ASIC. See also ASIC.

FRAME . Forced Recuperation Aggregation Movement of Energy. A power production and or peak shaving energy management capability whose goal is to reduce operational costs and enhance or enable survivability. FRAME works by significantly reducing the energy required to operate a heat dissipating system such as a computing system through the recuperative use of energy in general and by time shifting the generation and consumption of power to the most effective and or efficient time frames.

FSLS. Fuzzy Sighted Link State. A family of wireless routing algorithms e.g. for a wireless mesh that depends on the observation that changes in links which are far away i.e. relative to the mesh are less important than those links that are nearby. With FSLS any changes in link states are propagated quickly to nearby nodes and much less quickly to distant nodes because the distant nodes don t directly use the nearby link state updates in their link state calculations . See also HSLS.

Fully Associative Cache. A cache where data from any address can be stored in any cache location. The whole address must be used as the tag. All tags must be compared simultaneously associatively with the requested address and if one matches then its associated data is accessed. This requires an associative memory to hold the tags which makes this form of cache more expensive. It does however solve the problem of contention for cache locations cache conflict since a block need only be flushed when the whole cache is full and then the block to flush can be selected in a more efficient way.

Gbps. Giga bits per second. A measure that often refers to a serial communications rate in billions of bits per second i.e. one thousand Mbps . Although there are technically 8 bits per byte in serial communications there is usually a synchronization overhead e.g. 1 start bit and 1 stop bit for every 8 bits of data resulting in a 10 1 ratio of bits to bytes when calculating raw throughput i.e. ignoring compression and additional protocol overheads . Thus for example a 10 Gbps link might yield only 1 GBps 10 10 1 rather than 1.25 GBps 10 8 1.25 . See also Mbps.

HANDLER . Host Abstraction for Named Devices Layered Executable Resources. In a preferred embodiment a MASTER assigns virtualized computing storage and communications resources to a set of SLAVEs over which it has authority and a HANDLER implements the physical interfaces of these resources. In a preferred embodiment the HANDLER interfaces and logic are implemented within the SLAVE PUMP device s to which the SLAVE processors are attached such that the HANDLER hardware provides functionality similar to a software based isolation kernel. In a preferred embodiment the HANDLER s hardware implementation supports dedicated per process registers and FIFO devices that enable user space input output without system call overhead within the security constraints set by the MASTER. See also MASTER PUMP SELF SERVANT SLAVE.

Heat Flux. The flow rate of heat across or through a material or the quantity of thermal energy transferred to a unit area per unit time typically given in units of W cm2. See also Critical Heat Flux RUBE.

HMAC. Hashed Message Authentication Code. Sometimes just MAC although this can be confusing . A one way hash computed from a message and some secret data for the purpose of detecting whether a message has been altered. It is difficult to forge without knowing the secret data. See RFC 2402. See also MAC.

HSLS. Hazy Sighted Link State. A routing algorithm invented by researchers at BBN Technologies in the family of wireless routing algorithms called FSLS. Its designers sought to minimize global network waste the total overhead of which they defined as the amount of bandwidth used in excess of the minimum amount of bandwidth required to forward packets over the shortest distance in number of hops by assuming that the nodes had instantaneous full topology information. The network overhead associated with HSLS is theoretically optimal utilizing both proactive and reactive link state routing to limit network updates in space and time and on larger networks HSLS begins to exceed the efficiencies of the best known other routing algorithms. Unlike traditional methods HSLS does not flood the network with link state information to attempt to cope with moving nodes that change connections with the rest of the network nor does it require each node to have the same view of the network. In the SHADOWS infrastructure a variant of HSLS may be used generally within any subsystems where distributed resource information is relevant to the distribution of resource flows e.g. information working fluids energy etc. including specifically within the implementation of the FRAME subsystems e.g. STEER and the RUSH protocol e.g. within each RUSHrouter in particular. However whereas HSLS chooses a single path such as within a wireless radio mesh network the RUSH protocol chooses multiple paths and is not limited to any particular types of networks e.g. wired vs. wireless mesh vs. point to point etc. . Also whereas HSLS chooses its path based on performance the RUSH protocol views performance as only one of several indicators and also considers resource consumption e.g. channel types bandwidth quotas energy usage energy reserves service factors e.g. type of service SLAs QoS and security issues e.g. risk posture channel safety stealth visibility to traffic analysis etc. See also FLAMERouter FSLS QoS RUSH RUSHrouter SLA.

I2P. Garlic Router . An open source anonymizing overlay network based on establishing secure multi hop connections among intentionally selected I2P nodes. Although I2P incorporates lessons learned from TOR an alternative anonymizing network that predates it I2P is fundamentally a packet switched network while TOR is fundamentally a circuit switched one allowing I2P to transparently route around congestion or other network failures operate redundant pathways and load balance the data across available resources. TOR and I2P complement each other in their TOR works towards offering high speed anonymous Internet outproxying while I2P works towards offering a decentralized resilient low latency network in itself. One goal of I2P is to achieve appropriateness for use in hostile regimes against state level adversaries. I2P uses a technique called garlic routing layered encryption of messages passing through routers selected by the original sender. I2P sends messages by taking a message encrypting it with the recipient s public key taking that encrypted message and encrypting it along with instructions specifying the next hop and then taking that resulting encrypted message and so on until it has one layer of encryption per hop along the path. Furthermore at each layer any number of messages can be contained not just a single message. In addition to the cloves individual messages each unwrapped garlic message contains a sender specified amount of padding data allowing the sender to take active countermeasures against traffic analysis. I2P makes a strict separation between the software participating in the network a router and the anonymous endpoints destinations associated with individual applications. Any SHADOWS nodes that implement the RUSH protocol can participate in the I2P network both as one or more I2P routers and as one or more I2P endpoints or destinations. Although SHADOWS does not depend on I2P participating in the I2P network provides a source of mix in traffic that helps to prevent traffic analysis by a sophisticated attacker while also helping the I2P network. See also TOR RUSH.

Integrity. The quality of an information system reflecting the logical correctness and reliability of the operating system the logical completeness of the hardware and software implementing the protection mechanisms and the consistency of the data structures and occurrence of the stored data. In a formal security mode integrity is interpreted more narrowly to mean protection against unauthorized modification or destruction of information.

Internet. The largest collection of networks in the world interconnected in such a way as to allow them to function as a single virtual network. See also IP.

IOPS. Input output Operations Per Second. A measure of storage device random access performance. Storage devices such as magnetic disk drives support on the order of 100 IOPS assuming one 512 byte sector for each IO input output operation. Because the number of IOPS is partly determined by track to track latency and partly by rotational latency and the latter is tied to the rotational rate of the drive performance is much less than 100 IOPS for low cost drives spinning at 4200 to 7200 RPM and only slightly more than 100 IOPS for expensive top of the line drives spinning at 15 000 RPM. In contrast an inexpensive USB flash drive capable of read or writing at 20 MBps can achieve on the order of 40 000 IOPS an improvement of 400 . Storage devices however are also rated in terms of sustained throughput e.g. MBps such as when streaming a large file with a single access and in this context a single magnetic disk drive provides on the order of 60 MBps sustained vs. a USB flash drive throughput on the order of 20 MBps sustained. See also MBps USB.

LEB128. Little Endian Base 128. A scheme generally known in the art for encoding integers densely that exploits the assumption that most integers are small in magnitude. This encoding is equally suitable whether the target machine architecture represents data in big endian or little endian order. It is little endian only in the sense that it avoids using space to represent the big end of an unsigned integer when the big end is all zeroes or sign extension bits. Little Endian describes a processor architecture for which the least significant byte of a multibyte value has the smallest address .

MAC. Message Authentication Code. Used to validate information transmitted between two parties that share a secret key. Also Media Access Control the globally unique hardware address of an Ethernet network interface card. Also Mandatory Access Control a security criteria that contrasts with Discretionary Access Control DAC . See also DAC HMAC.

MASTER . Multiprocessor Adaptive Scheduler Task Executor Redirector. A distinguished capability that is responsible for participating in security decisions including resource allocation under the auspices of a trusted BOSS. A MASTER or would be MASTER i.e. a Candidate MASTER maintains its distinguished bona fide MASTER status only under the auspices of other MASTERs which is part of the function of the SELF system . Bona fide MASTERs self organize into local and distributed teams that are collectively responsible for getting work done including the computation and storage of data . In a preferred embodiment a MASTER may have a number of dedicated trusted attached and therefore local SLAVE resources over which it enjoys complete control via a HANDLER and any number of volunteer SERVANT resources that are not trusted. See also BOSS HANDLER SELF SERVANT SLAVE.

MARSHAL . Multi Agent Routing Synchronization Handling Aggregation Layer. A distinguished SERVANT node having the responsibilities of fulfilling a MARSHAL role. Any node authenticated as having a MARSHAL role that serves as a gateway for system users to access SHADOWS services via a network e.g. the Internet . A MARSHAL may also communicate with other MARSHALs under the auspices and control of a MASTER led team in order to implement one or more overlay networks and or network fabrics whose purposes and characteristics are determined by the MASTER led team but are opaque to the MARSHALs . By design a MARSHAL is not trusted and the role is typically fulfilled by a SERVANT node which is also inherently untrusted . Occasionally the MARSHAL role is fulfilled by a SLAVE emulating a MARSHAL that is operating under the auspices and control of a MASTER through a HANDLER and is therefore trusted but this fact is never known to those communicating with the MARSHAL. A MARSHAL may reside virtually anywhere e.g. at an ISP on customer premises at a telco central office at a datacenter on a utility pole within a server or PC etc. . See also HANDLER ISP MASTER PC SELF SERVANT SLAVE.

Mbps. Mega bits per second. A measure that often refers to a serial communications rate in millions of bits per second. Although there are technically 8 bits per byte in serial communications there is usually a synchronization overhead e.g. 1 start bit and 1 stop bit for every 8 bits of data resulting in a 10 1 ratio of bits to bytes when calculating raw throughput i.e. ignoring compression and additional protocol overheads . Thus for example a 10 Mbps link might yield only 1 MBps 10 10 1 rather than 1.25 MBps 10 8 1.25 . See also MBps.

MBps. Mega Bytes per second. A measure that often refers to a storage device throughput rate in millions of bytes per second where 1 byte equals 8 bits. A storage device may have a peak rate that is constrained by its interface and this rate is normally achieved only for short bursts when the associated read or write request can be satisfied via the device s cache memory. A storage device also has a sustained rate that corresponds to the maximum rate at which the device can continuously read or write data and this rate is tied to the accessibility of the underlying storage media i.e. the media rate . See also Mbps.

MDS. Maximum Distance Separable. Refers to a class of space optimal erasure codes specified as n k where n k specially coded extra symbols are created from k original symbols and any k out of n original and extra symbols is sufficient to reconstruct the original k symbols which means that up to e erasures can be tolerated where e n k. Such a code may also be equivalently represented as n m m where n specially coded extra symbols are created from m original symbols and any m out of n m original and extra symbols is sufficient to reconstruct the original m symbols which means that up to e erasures can be tolerated where e n. By definition erasures are symbols missing from known locations i.e. the symbols are not known but their position is . If instead of e erasures there are up to f faulty symbols but their positions are unknown then a system that can correct up to e erasures can correct at most f faulty symbols where f e 2 intuitively half the redundant codes are used to locate the errors and the other half to correct them .

Memoization. A technique by which an existing function can be transformed into one that remembers previous arguments and their associated results. See also FACTUAL Memoize Memoized Function.

Memoize. To modify a function such that re computation of previously computed results is avoided in favor of retrieving and substituting the previously computed results themselves. Memoization essentially augments a computational function with a cache of previously computed results indexed by the arguments of i.e. inputs to the previous computations. Memoization since it is based on caching therefore trades space for time. Memoization is only appropriate for pure functions one with no side effects whose return value depends only on the values of its arguments . Memoization is useful in all kinds of situations including almost any kind of searching cache the results of the search so that you can skip it next time HTML generation cache the results of the generation process so that you don t have to generate the page next time and numeric computation cache the results of the computation . The word memoize was coined by Donald Michie in 1968. See also Cache Caching FACTUAL Memoization.

Memoized Function. A function that remembers which arguments it has been called with and the result returned and if called with the same arguments again returns the result from its memory rather than recalculating it. A memoized function i.e. one with caching may run faster than one without caching but it uses up more memory. This same principle is found at the hardware level in computer architectures which use a cache to store recently accessed memory locations. See also Cache Caching FACTUAL Memoize.

MTTF. Mean Time To Failure. When applied to disk drives the MTTF is estimated as the number of power on hours per year usually assumed at 100 power on divided by the AFR. Thus a server class disk drive with a manufacturer specified AFR of 0.63 would have an estimated MTTF of about 1.4 million hours. PC class disk drives typically have much lower AFR values which are also calculated with a much lower number of power on hours per year. Note however that even for server class drives observed AFR values in the field exceed 1 with 2 to 4 common and up to 12 observed in some systems so the estimated MTTF needs to be carefully considered. See also AFR Availability MTBF MTTR.

MTTR. Mean Time To Repair. The average time usually determined through empirical measurement required to restore service after a breakdown or loss. See also Availability MTTF.

NaN. Not a Number. A value or symbol that is usually produced as the result of an operation on invalid input operands especially in floating point calculations. For example most floating point units are unable to explicitly calculate the square root of negative numbers and may instead indicate that the operation was invalid and return a NaN result. In floating point calculations NaN is not the same as infinity although both are typically handled as special cases in floating point representations of real numbers as well as in floating point operations. An invalid operation is also not the same as an arithmetic overflow which might return an infinity or an arithmetic underflow which would return the smallest normal number a denormal number or zero . A NaN does not compare equal to any floating point number or NaN even if the latter has an identical representation. One can therefore test whether a variable has a NaN value by comparing it to itself i.e. if x x then x is NaN . In the IEEE floating point standard IEEE 754 arithmetic operations involving NaN always produce NaN allowing the value to propagate through a calculation there are exceptions to this behavior in a proposed future standard . See also IEEE.

NEAR . Nearline Emulation Archival Repository. Used by CHARM for nearline storage NEAR is the technology underlying a NEARblade or NEARdrive . It provides high capacity electronically assisted long term data storage that is subject to minimal mechanical risk including wear vibration and seismic events due to significantly reduced mechanical duty cycle. The NEAR technology attempts to minimize the number of spinning disk drives while providing full accessibility to data. Prior to spin down the NEAR technology performs extensive analysis and maintenance after which it may reconfigure the system as necessary in accordance with the analysis and maintenance results. Data stored in NEAR is safe from intruders even if stolen. As a fringe benefit of the NEAR storage approach the number of read and or accesses per second is orders of magnitude faster than unassisted hard disk drives. See also CHARM FIRE SMART.

Packet. An ordered group of data and control signals transmitted through a network as a subset of a larger message.

Packet Switching. A communications paradigm in which packets messages or fragments of messages are individually routed between nodes with no previously established communication path. Packets are routed to their destination through the most expedient route as determined by some routing algorithm . Not all packets traveling between the same two hosts even those from a single message necessarily follow the same route.

Page Fault. The condition that occurs in a virtual memory system when there is an attempt to access a virtual memory page that is not currently present in physical memory. See also Demand Paging Swapping.

PERKS . Peak Energy Reserve Kilowatt Scale. A hybrid energy system combining UPS with a peak shaving system that directly captures excess or low cost energy from a multiplicity of sources when it is cheapest or most readily available and stores it for later reuse such as during peak periods when power is most expensive or less available . Unlike a UPS which remains charged just in case the PERKS capability continually captures and discharges stored energy just in time as needed so as to reduce the overall energy cost and maximize full processing availability. Depending on capacity and load PERKS may also serve as an extended runtime UPS.

POL. Point of Load. Point of load POL DC DC converters enable electronic developers to overcome the challenges caused by the high peak current demands and low noise margins of high performance semiconductor devices by placing individual non isolated DC power sources near their point of use thereby minimizing losses caused by voltage drops and ensuring tight voltage regulation under dynamic load conditions. POL devices also reduce noise sensitivity and EMI emissions by significantly shortening potential radiators and RF susceptible conductors.

Policy based Management. A method of managing system behavior or resources by setting policies often in the form of if then rules that the system interprets.

PP. Protection Profile. An implementation independent set of security requirements and objectives for a category of products or systems which meet similar consumer needs for IT security. A PP is intended to be reusable and to define requirements which are known to be useful and effective in meeting the identified objectives. Also A reusable set of either functional or assurance components e.g. an EAL combined together to satisfy a set of identified security objectives. Information about Protection Profiles can be found on the Internet at http www.iatf.net. See also CC.

Priority Loads. In power plants where load management schemes are used a priority is assigned to each load center. Loads with the highest priority are powered first and shed last.

PRNG. Pseudo Random Number Generator. A mechanism for generating pseudo random numbers on a computer. They re called pseudo random because you can t get truly random numbers from a completely non random thing like a computer. A pseudo random number generator is a computational or physical device designed to generate a sequence of numbers that does not have any easily discernable pattern so that the sequence can be treated as being random. In reality however if a computer generates the number another computer can reproduce the process. Random number generators have existed since ancient times in the form of dice and coin flipping the shuffling of playing cards the use of yarrow stalks in the I Ching and many other methods. See also Pseudo Random Number Random Number Generator.

Protocol. A formal set of conventions governing the formatting and relative timing of message exchange between two or more communicating systems or devices.

Proxy. A software agent often a firewall mechanism that performs a function or operation on behalf of another application or system while hiding the details involved. See also FLAMERouter MARSHAL RUSHrouter.

Proxy Server. A firewall component that manages Internet traffic to and from a LAN and that can provide other features such as document caching and access control. A proxy server can improve performance by supplying frequently requested data such as a popular Web page and it can filter and discard requests that the owner does not consider appropriate such as requests for unauthorized access to proprietary files.

Pseudo Random Number. One of a sequence of numbers generated by some algorithm so as to have an even distribution over some range of values and minimal correlation between successive values. See also PRNG.

PV. Photo Voltaic. A type of solar cell and produces electrical energy on exposure to sufficiently bright light sources.

QoS. Quality of Service. A term used in an SLA denoting a guaranteed level of performance e.g. response times less than 1 second . Also A group of service classes that define the performance of a given circuit.

RAM. Random Access Memory. A computer s direct access memory that can be accessed very quickly and overwritten with new information. With the exception of NVRAM which is specifically non volatile RAM loses its content when power is turned off but not so much that its cannot be reconstructed by a sophisticated e.g. state funded adversary the longer that a particular memory bit maintains its value the more recoverable it is by an adversary that gains physical access so powering off or making a few passes of rewriting random data really has little effect . In a preferred embodiment of the CHARM PUMP subsystem memory accessible by the PUMP and via the PUMP can be protected by the PUMP s ability to maintain complementary states in memory a technique where memory locations are invisibly toggled to and from their complementary states such that each state has a duty cycle of approximately 50 which means that an adversary gaining physical access cannot determine previous contents after a power off . See also BB RAM CHARM DRAM MRAM NVRAM PUMP SRAM.

RECAP . Reliably Efficient Computation Adaptation Persistence. A proprietary asynchronous real time protocol used by MASTERs to communicate with other MASTERs and with any SLAVEs under their control. The RECAP protocol is never used in the clear even locally and it is assumed to be subject to Byzantine failures. RECAP may be safely tunneled via other protocols especially RUSH but such tunneling is performed only by a specially authorized device called a FLAMERouter described elsewhere which also contains a MASTER. RECAP is used for communication among what are hoped to be trusted parties in contrast to UNCAP. See also FLAMERouter RUSH Tunneling Router UNCAP.

RLE. Run Length Encoding. A very simple form of lossless data compression in which runs of data that is sequences in which the same data value occurs in many consecutive data elements are stored as a single data value and count rather than as the original run. This is most useful on data that contains many such runs for example simple graphic images such as icons and line drawings but can provide compression as long as the encoded sequence is shorter than the original run. Compression in CHARM is augmented by RLE. CHARM uses a back to back encoding sequence RLE1 RLE2 and RLE 3 to first encode repeating single byte runs such as a string of blanks then repeating double byte runs including pairs produced by RLE 1 then repeating triple byte runs including triplets produced by RLE 2 . After CHARM does RLE encoding additional compression techniques are used. While all the CHARM algorithms can be implemented in software in a preferred embodiment they are implemented in hardware in the CHARM PUMP. See also CHARM Delta Compression.

RNG. Random Number Generator. A random number generator is a computational or physical device designed to generate a sequence of numbers that does not have a pattern. In theory true random numbers only come from truly random sources such as atmospheric noise and radioactive decay.

RUBE . Recuperative Use of Boiling Energy. A system using a relatively low temperature phase change working fluid in conjunction with heat exchanger surfaces that promote heterogeneous nucleation in order to separately recuperate heat energy boiling energy from hot spots and warm spots for immediate or subsequent reuse. Boiling energy in this context refers to energy that can be used immediately or stored for later use to help effect a liquid vapor phase change without approaching the critical heat flux. In a preferred embodiment recuperated energy heats and expands the working fluid causing a phase change to vapor if the temperature is sufficiently high which in conjunction with optional vapor injection creates a motive force that helps to circulate the working fluid among system components in order to thermally stabilize the system to further extract re usable energy for immediate reuse or storage and to efficiently exhaust waste energy without overly subcooling the working fluid . In a preferred embodiment a small continuous positively pressurized liquid flow is maintained ensured via a low power pump means in order to prevent dryout eliminate local hot spots and assure thermal stability as an asset protection mechanism that serves to reduce or eliminate dependency on thermal expansion nucleation and vapor injection as the only motive forces the pump may be optionally powered off when the required flow can be maintained without it e.g. due to vapor injection or other means . In a preferred embodiment the low power pump means is doubly or triply redundant due to its nature as an asset protection mechanism. An overview of the RUBE Heat Energy Recuperation Cycle is depicted below for a preferred embodiment. See also Critical Heat Flux Heat Flux RUBE Double Boiler RUBE Inner Boiler RUBE Vapor Injector.

RUBE Double Boiler. The RUBE Double Boiler apparatus is part of a closed loop system that in a preferred embodiment is connected to other components as shown in the figure RUBE Heat Energy Recuperation Cycle Overview. The RUBE Double Boiler apparatus comprises an inner boiler and an outer boiler such that the former is fully enclosed within the latter in order to maximize the recuperation of heat energy thermal energy dissipated by the aggregation of enclosed heat sources and optionally to separate the recuperated heat energy into two or more grades according to desired or observed temperatures. In a preferred embodiment the hot heat sources i.e. those components with a relatively higher heat flux such as CPUs are placed within the inner boiler or at least have their hot surfaces within the inner boiler and the warm heat sources i.e. those components with a relatively lower heat flux such as flash memory chips are placed within the outer boiler. Both the inner and outer boilers are pressure vessels intended to withstand a maximum of 7 bar operating pressures 100 PSI under normal conditions. Leaks within the inner boiler cause only a reduction in efficiency but leaks in the outer boiler can cause a loss of working fluid and a subsequent reduction in local survivability. In a preferred embodiment such as for electronics thermal stabilization applications the working fluid may be an organic dielectric fluid with a boiling point between 20 C. and 40 C. such as 1 methoxy heptafluoropropane C3F7OCH3 . Other working fluids may also be suitable some examples of which are listed in section 10.3. In a preferred embodiment the RUBE Double Boiler apparatus has an outer shell of cast aluminum although other construction methods and materials are possible and its external shape and form factor is such that it can mate with guide channels extruded into a vertically oriented cylindrical or partly cylindrical aluminum extrusion designed to contain a multiplicity of RUBE Double Boiler units. Given the aforementioned vertically oriented extrusion the intent is to be able to easily align and slide the RUBE Double Boiler apparatus from the extrusion upper opening downward into the extrusion until it reaches a bulkhead where couplings and connectors on the bottom of the Double Boiler apparatus mate with complementary couplings and connectors within the extrusion. In a preferred embodiment the RUBE Double Boiler apparatus is a pressure sealed field replaceable unit having blind mating quick disconnect inlet and outlet couplings with double EPDM seals although other seal materials are possible EPDM is preferred for its compatibility with the preferred working fluid and capable of operating at 100 PSI such as those available from Colder the extrusion would contain mating couplings . In a preferred embodiment the RUBE Double Boiler apparatus is also electrically sealed and EMP hardened having blind mating quick disconnect electrical connectors with a multiplicity of conductors appropriate for the ingress and egress of electrical power feeds and various high frequency signals such as are common in computer and telecommunications devices. In a preferred embodiment the RUBE Double Boiler apparatus connects to a bottom plane or equivalent connector arrangement in the vertical extrusion by means of a proprietary pin free connector designed by Morgan Johnson and having the property of providing an extremely high quality nearly noise free connection. See also RUBE RUBE Inner Boiler.

RUBE Inner Boiler. A means for recuperating the heat energy dissipated by the relatively high heat flux heat producing devices so that to the extent practical it can be converted to usable mechanical and or electrical energy. The inner boiler apparatus is colocated with the hot surfaces the surfaces with the largest heat flux of the hottest of the heat producing devices which are so arranged that such placement is possible with a minimum or otherwise convenient number of manifolds one of the factors determining the maximum size of the manifolds is the desire to take advantage of Rapid Injection Molding techniques in order to reduce the cost and lead times normally associated with injection molded components . In a preferred embodiment the inner boiler apparatus is oriented vertically although it is often depicted horizontally for convenience such that the vapor outlet is at the top and the liquid inlet and outlet are at the top or bottom. Once normal steady state operation is reached working fluid vapor is expelled through the vapor outlet and the liquid outlet is not used. Liquid working fluid is forced into liquid inlet where it is equitably distributed within the injection molded manifold chamber and to each heat exchanger s inlet check valve which it can then enter since the working fluid is under pressure. For each heat exchanger once the working fluid passes the corresponding inlet check valve it enters the heat exchanger where it circulates among the heat exchangers fins pins or other heat exchange surfaces. Depending on the then current temperature and pressure the working fluid may acquire heat energy causing all or part of it to evaporate. In a preferred embodiment such as for electronics thermal stabilization applications the working fluid may be an organic dielectric fluid with a boiling point between 20 C. and 40 C. such as 1 methoxy heptafluoropropane C3F7OCH3 . Other working fluids may also be suitable some examples of which are listed in section 10.3. In a preferred embodiment the working fluid expands substantially when heated. Since the inlet is check valved this expansion greatly pressurizes the heat exchanger and the working fluid is expelled through the outlet check valve where it makes its way to vapor outlet and or liquid outlet thereby creating a partial vacuum within the heat exchanger under discussion which helps to pull in more liquid working fluid . The hotter the system gets the higher the pressure at which it can operate up to the maximum desired target temperature of the heat producing devices or the useful upper limit of the working fluid whichever is lower. In a preferred embodiment one set of manifolds operates in the 30 C. to 40 C. range for a particular class of heat producing electronic chips while another set operates simultaneously in the 90 C. to 110 C. range for a different class of heat producing electronic chips. The same working fluid may be used for both in fact the cooler system can feed the hotter system however this would typically require a boost in pressure which can be accomplished externally via pumps or via the RUBE Vapor Injector. See also Critical Heat Flux Heat Flux RUBE RUBE Double Boiler RUBE Vapor Injector.

RUBE Vapor Injector. Inspired by the Gifford Steam Injector invented in 1858 the RUBE Vapor Injector is a means to 1 maintain a load the boiler within a desired temperature range and 2 recuperate as much energy as possible from the heat dissipated by the load in order to convert the recuperated heat energy into mechanical energy specifically pressure energy that can be used as motive force to reduce or eliminate the energy that would otherwise be needed for circulation pumps in a phase change heating cooling and or power generation system. In a preferred embodiment such as for electronics thermal stabilization applications the working fluid may be an organic dielectric fluid with a boiling point between 20 C. and 40 C. such as 1 methoxy heptafluoropropane C3F7OCH3 . Other working fluids may also be suitable some examples of which are listed in section 10.3. In a preferred embodiment the working fluid expands substantially when heated.

RUSH . Rapid Universal Secure Handling. A multi level proprietary communications protocol that has both asynchronous and synchronous characteristics and can stand alone or be tunneled over existing WAN protocols whether synchronous or asynchronous . RUSH is used as the primary carrier protocol among FLAMERouters MARSHALs and client side RUSHrouter software or hardware. RUSH can directly incorporate flows from the RECAP and UNCAP protocols and also tunnels them along with various industry standard protocols. The RUSH protocol can take advantage of other protocols e.g. I2P TOR as necessary to prevent or reduce the threat of traffic analysis and can also tunnel other protocols for the same reasons. A key characteristic of RUSH is its propensity for simultaneously utilizing multiple network channels interfaces gateways routes etc. such that a single conceptual source and destination pair effectively becomes multiple targets and destinations that tend not to be apparently related unless an adversary has truly global visibility in which case such an adversary still faces a multiplicity of overwhelming cryptographic and traffic analysis challenges . RUSH incorporates statistical information for resource management load balancing energy usage QoS etc. . See also DoD FLAMERouter I2P MARSHAL RECAP RUSH RUSHrouter TOR Tunneling Router UNCAP WAN.

RUSHrouter . An untrusted software or hardware tunneling router that implements only a subset of FLAMERouter capability and in particular can communicate with the SHADOWS infrastructure only via the RUSH protocol which also embeds the UNCAP protocol . RUSHrouters are untrusted because of the lack of control over their environments and has nothing to do with its inherent trustworthiness. Any computing system containing a SHADOWS non trusted component e.g. DELEGATE SERVANT must also include at least one RUSHrouter to facilitate communication with the SHADOWS infrastructure. In a preferred embodiment each outbound channel interface e.g. a physical network interface wireless adapter etc. has a dedicated RUSHrouter operating in its own VM a separate RUSHrouter also in its own VM serves as the default gateway for the host computer interfacing any hosted applications to the SHADOWS infrastructure by appropriately routing communications through the RUSHrouters that control the channel interfaces. See also DELEGATE FLAMERouter RUSH SERVANT Tunneling Router UNCAP VM.

SAS. Serial Attached SCSI. A disk drive interface standard that supersedes parallel SCSI and can accept either SAS or SATA disk drives. See also SATA.

SATA. Serial ATA. A disk drive interface standard that supersedes parallel ATA. SATA disk drives be used with either SAS or SATA disk host adapters but a SATA host adapter can communicate only with SATA drives. See also SAS.

SCADA. Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition. A category of mechanisms for process control that includes hardware and software components. SCADA provides for the collection of data in real time from sensors and machines in order to control equipment and conditions and typically includes transmitting the data to one or more central locations for logging and or analysis.

SCRAM . Survivable Computing Routing Associative Memory. A SHADOWS network building block including computation routing and associative memory working storage and implementing at least a particular minimum configuration of the CHARM SELF CORE and FRAME technologies. An individual SCRAM machine is intended to be self contained and capable of operating on or off the electrical grid for extended durations and without human attention or maintenance. By design a SCRAM machine is its own miniature datacenter that can be located in out of the way places such as underground on a pole or roof etc. as easily as in an office warehouse or datacenter. See also CHARM CORE FRAME SCRAMnet SELF SUREFIRE.

SCRAMnet . A SCRAM based network comprising any number of geographically proximate MASTERs SLAVEs and SERVANTs. On a WAN level SCRAMnets are the basis of the SHADOWS infrastructure but must always operate under the auspices of a distributed team that includes multiple MASTERs. Each SHADOWS node is a SCRAMnet but not necessarily vice versa. A SCRAMnet must meet specific requirements to become a SHADOWS node. Geographically proximate SERVANTs can organize themselves into SCRAMnets without having a local MASTER but only for the purpose of establishing communication with the SHADOWS network at which point they may be assigned to a MultiMASTER team which always has multiple MASTERs by definition . SERVANTs must be able to communicate with the SHADOWS network either individually or collectively and they may cooperate extensively to do so. Any Candidate MASTER that is unable to establish itself as a MASTER i.e. a full peer with other MASTERs retains its candidacy but is unable to fulfill any of the responsibilities of a MASTER. Rather than waste its resources a Candidate MASTER may volunteer or attempt to volunteer to operate under the auspices of a team of MASTERs in the role of SERVANT. See also MASTER SCRAM SERVANT.

SEC DED. Single Error Correction Double Error Detection. A form of ECC that can correct a single memory error or SEU and detect two. See also DRAM ECC SEU.

SELF . Secure Emergent Learning of Friends. An automated identity and role oriented immune system that differentiates self and non self friend and foe i.e. between authorized and unauthorized objects subjects and interactions. The focus of SELF is on the recognition of a relatively small set of correct behaviors rather than the recognition of any of an infinitely large set of counterfeit behaviors by definition all non self behavior is assumed malicious . SELF is the basis for establishing and maintaining trust among the interdependent systems subsystems and components in a SHADOWS infrastructure. SELF includes novel Byzantine agreement logic in its decision making process. SELF is highly integrated with BOSS which is the definitive authority on trust and correctness and with the RECAP UNCAP and RUSH protocols. Any anomalous non self behavior activates an appropriate immune system response. See also BOSS MASTER RECAP RUSH SCRAMnet SERVANT UNCAP.

Sensitive Information. Information that as determined by a competent authority must be protected because its unauthorized disclosure alteration loss or destruction can at least cause perceivable damage to someone or something. DoD 5200.28 STD . See also SBU Sensitivity Label.

Sensitivity Label. A piece of information that represents the security level of an object and that describes the sensitivity e.g. classification of the data in the object. Sensitivity labels are used by the TCB as the basis for mandatory access control decisions. DoD 5200.28 STD . In the SHADOWS infrastructure an object s sensitivity label and other security properties is available to CHARM the SHADOWS associative memory system and therefore to BOSS the SHADOWS TCB without having to retrieve the object itself via its FASTpage index entries. See also BOSS CHARM FASTpage Sensitive Information TCB.

SERVANT . Service Executor Repository Voluntary Agent Non Trusted. A cooperative computing and or storage node that is untrusted usually due to potential threat exposure . A MASTER that is not recognized as a MASTER by other MASTERS may operate as a SERVANT but to do so it must use the UNCAP protocol tunneled via RUSH rather than the RECAP protocol . See also BOSS MASTER RECAP RUSH SCRAMnet SELF UNCAP.

Set Associative Cache. A compromise between a direct mapped cache and a fully associative cache where each address is mapped to a certain set of cache locations. The address space is divided into blocks of 2 m bytes the cache line size discarding the bottom m address bits. An n way set associative cache with S sets has n cache locations in each set. Block b is mapped to set b mod S and may be stored in any of the n locations in that set with its upper address bits as a tag. To determine whether block b is in the cache set b mod S is searched associatively for the tag. A direct mapped cache could be described as one way set associative i.e. one location in each set whereas a fully associative cache is N way associative where N is the total number of blocks in the cache . Performance studies have shown that is generally more effective to increase number of entries rather than associativity and that 2 to 16 way set associative caches perform almost as well as fully associative caches at little extra cost over direct mapping. See also Cache Direct Mapped Cache Fully Associative Cache.

SEU. Single Event Upset. A probabilistic localized error in computer memory e.g. DRAM or logic typically caused by cosmic rays or alpha particles striking a transistor or memory cell and causing it to change state. The primary goal of ECC mechanisms is to detect and or correct the inevitable occurrence of one or more SEUs. Consumer computers rarely have ECC at all but server computers often protect their main memory systems with SEC DED ECC which is capable of correcting a single error per access and sometimes have a Chipkill type of ECC that can detect a single chip failure and some multiple SEU combinations. Because SEUs are probabilistic however as memory capacities and densities increase and as average chip temperature increase the likelihood of SEUs increases even more quickly than one might expect. SEU likelihood has now increased to the point that failure due to uncorrectable SEU is becoming a relatively common event even when SEC DED ECC is used. See also CHARM DRAM ECC FEC SEC DED.

SHADOWS . Self Healing Adaptive Distribute Organic Working Storage. A SHADOWS network consists of a combination of terrestrial and space based SHADOWS nodes and singleton SCRAM machines described later along with SERVANTs and MARSHALs . In general a geographically proximate collection of SCRAM machines may self organize into a geographically proximate SCRAMnet comprising a SHADOWS node. SCRAM machines that are unable to join a SHADOWS node remain as singletons until they can join one if ever. Singletons act as SERVANTs to bona fide SHADOWS nodes and as MARSHALs between SHADOWS nodes and system users however non singletons also volunteer for these roles on a part time basis .

Every SLAVE must be physically attached to and co located with at least one local MASTER in order to operate at all.

SMART. Self Monitoring Analysis Reporting Technology. Also S.M.A.R.T. A monitoring system and signaling interface for magnetic disk drives to detect and report on various indicators of reliability. SMART enables a host processor to receive analytical information from the disk drive that may be useful for anticipating failures. See also NEAR.

SOLAR . Self Orienting Light Aggregating Receiver. In a preferred embodiment a system using a relatively low temperature phase change working fluid to receive heat energy from the sun for immediate use in which case it acts as a boiler or subsequent use and especially for the primary purpose of generating electricity. In an alternative embodiment a system using a relatively low vapor pressure working fluid for example an appropriate Paratherm thermal oil to receive heat energy from the sun for immediate or subsequent use. The heat energy in this context refers to energy that can be immediately used immediately or stored for later use to effect or help effect a liquid vapor phase change such as occurs by design in a boiler. Received energy heats and expands the phase change working fluid which may have been preheated via RUBE above and which in conjunction with optional vapor injection see RUBE Vapor Injector described elsewhere in the boiler feed circuit and in conjunction with a FORCE nanoturbine or FPSE Free Piston Stirling Engine in the boiler output circuit can be used to accomplish work and particularly to generate electricity.

SRAM. Static RAM. A type of volatile RAM whose cells do not need to be continually refreshed but which may lose data if power is removed. Contrast with DRAM and NVRAM. See also DRAM NVRAM RAM.

SSD. Solid State Disk. A general purpose electronic storage device that emulates a traditional spinning disk drive but actually contains no moving parts and thus incurs no performance penalty due to rotational latency or track to track seek latency. Historically SSDs have been expensive and thus relegated to special purpose applications requiring the lowest possible disk access latency. Implementations based on NVRAM or SRAM are much more expensive per byte stored than those based on DRAM largely due to their higher speed and lower storage density. It is generally accepted that SSD can comprise a battery backed RAM BB RAM with a backup disk drive but there is less consensus as to whether flash memory on its own can constitute a general purpose SSD due to the fact that flash memory technology currently supports only a finite number of write cycles typically 10 000 or 100 000 or a million to a particular location. Relatively new technologies such as MRAM hold promise since they have the potential to be dense fast and relatively inexpensive. See also BB RAM MRAM NVRAM.

STP. Standard Temperature Pressure. A temperature of zero degrees Celsius 0 C. and a pressure of one atmosphere.

SUREFIRE . Survivable Unmanned Renewably Energized Facility Independent Reconfigurable Environment. A miniature self contained unmanned secure outdoor often underground supercomputing datacenter designed to be physically visited for maintenance purposes at most only once or twice a year and these may be combined with scale up visits . SUREFIRE sites can be located on virtually any outdoors property but also in basements or on rooftops etc. SUREFIRE sites usually include one or more renewable energy systems in addition to conventional energy sources. SUREFIRE sites are designed for maximal energy efficiency and emit very little waste heat. All SUREFIRE sites may be expendable without data loss and penetration can never yield useful information to an attacker. See also SCRAM.

Swap File. A special file in a virtual memory system which is used to temporarily store dirty memory pages. Swap files although typically disk based are often organized for relatively rapid access compared to writing dirty pages back to their original location. See also Demand Paging Swapping.

Swapping. In a virtual memory system a technique to remove virtual pages from physical memory in order to replace them with others that are currently needed. Dirty pages those which came from an executable image or data file and have been modified but not yet written back are written to a swap file temporarily unless they ve been written previously and are unchanged in which case they can simply be deleted . Non dirty pages can simply be deleted since they can be reread on demand. Pages are swapped out only if the data in them cannot be retrieved another way. See also Swap File.

Tcase. The temperature of the case package enclosing an integrated circuit chip at a particular point in time.

TCB. Trusted Computing Base. The TCB is a useful concept because it identifies within a system the subsystem which owns the security in the SHADOWS infrastructure BOSS implements the TCB . The rest of the components may communicate with this TCB and rely on it to make correct security decisions. Thus the TCB must exist and it must make 100 of the security decisions. The DoD defines the TCB as the totality of protection mechanisms within a computer system including hardware firmware and software the combination of which is responsible for enforcing a security policy. A TCB consists of one or more components that together enforce a unified security policy over a product or system. The ability of a trusted computing base to correctly enforce a security policy depends solely on the mechanisms within the TCB and on the correct input by system administrative personnel of parameters e.g. a user s clearance related to the security policy. DoD 5200.28 STD . TCSEC1983 defines the TCB as the totality of protection mechanisms within a computer system including hardware firmware and software the combination of which is responsible for enforcing a security policy. Note The ability of a TCB to enforce correctly a unified security policy depends on the correctness of the mechanisms within the TCB the protection of those mechanisms to ensure their correctness and the correct input of parameters related to the security policy. See also BOSS DoD TCSEC.

TCP. Transmission Control Protocol. A set of IP based networking protocols widely used on the Internet that provides communications across interconnected networks of computers with diverse hardware architectures and various operating systems.

TDP. Thermal Design Power. For power hungry integrated circuit chips there is sometimes an observable or even specified relationship between Tcase and TDP. See also Tcase.

TOR. The Onion Router. An open source anonymizing overlay network based on establishing secure multi hop TCP connections among randomly selected TOR nodes. Any SHADOWS nodes that implements the RUSH protocol can participate in the TOR network as a TOR node. Although SHADOWS does not depend on TOR participating in the TOR network provides a source of mix in traffic that helps to prevent traffic analysis by a sophisticated attacker while also helping the TOR network. See also I2P RUSH.

Trap Door. A hidden software or hardware mechanism that permits system protection mechanisms to be circumvented. It is activated in some non apparent manner e.g. special random key sequence at a terminal . DoD 5200.28 STD .

Trojan Horse. A computer program with an apparently or actually useful function that contains additional hidden functions that surreptitiously exploit the legitimate authorizations of the invoking process to the detriment of security.

Tunneling Router. Router or system capable of routing traffic by encrypting it and encapsulating it for transmission across an untrusted network for eventual de encapsulation and decryption. The FLAMERouter and RUSHrouter are both tunneling routers. See also FLAMERouter RUSHrouter Tunneling.

UDP. User Datagram Protocol. A Transmission Control Protocol TCP complement that offers a connectionless datagram service that guarantees neither delivery nor correct sequencing of delivered packets much like Internet Protocol IP upon which it depends. See RFC 768. See also TCP.

UNCAP . Untrusted Node Computation Adaptation Persistence. The secure proprietary protocol used for communication between MASTER led teams and the SERVANTs i.e. untrusted nodes that belong to them. UNCAP appears to be used for RUSHrouter to RUSHrouter communication also but this is only coincidental since every RUSHrouter comprises at least one SERVANT. UNCAP is always tunneled via the RUSH protocol but unlike RECAP there is no expectation of trustworthiness among its participants. See also FLAMERouter RECAP RUSH RUSHrouter Tunneling Router.

Usability. The usability of a system involves three potentially conflicting factors how quickly users can do what they want to do how correctly they can do it and how much they enjoy doing it. The underlying design of a computer system can affect its usability. Designing usability into a system involves analyzing users needs and then designing around those needs while optimizing the three factors.

USB. Universal Serial Bus. A tri speed high full low signaling standard. High speed USB 2.0 allows data transfer up to 480 Mbps which is 40 times faster than full speed USB. Due to signaling overhead the USB 2.0 standard appears to have a throughput limitation of around 25 to 30 MBps or is about half of what is implied by the raw data rate.

User. Any person who interacts directly with a computer system. DoD 5200.28 STD . Also Any entity human user or external IT entity outside of the computer system that interacts with it.

To achieve An affordable highly trustworthy survivable and available operationally efficient supercomputing infrastructure for processing sharing and protecting both structured and unstructured information. 

A primary objective of the SHADOWS infrastructure is to establish a highly survivable essentially maintenance free shared platform for extremely high performance computing i.e. supercomputing with high performance defined both in terms of total throughput but also in terms of very low latency although not every problem or customer necessarily requires very low latency while achieving unprecedented levels of affordability both capital and operational expense that is capable of earning a deserved reputation for trustworthiness survivability and fault tolerance. These requirements have historically been in conflict with each other and resolving them requires a new approach.

At its simplest the idea is to use distributed teams of nodes in a self healing network as the basis for managing and coordinating both the work to be accomplished and the resources available to do the work. The SHADOWS concept of teams is responsible for its ability to self heal and adapt its distributed resources in an organic manner. Furthermore the teams themselves are at the heart of decision making processing and storage in the SHADOWS infrastructure. Everything that s important is handled under the auspices and stewardship of a team.

Think The Borg a fictional being comprising life like yet robot like beings with a collective distributed consciousness from the science fiction television show Star Trek . The idea is to achieve an apparently centralized supercomputing infrastructure SHADOWS with all the advantages of centralization but not the disadvantages through the implementation of a highly distributed decentralized organic network of cooperating nodes working storage that self organize into teams dynamically partition work and resources among the nodes and teams and importantly hold each other accountable.

While it is straightforward to achieve high throughput via a large number of distributed nodes it is not possible to do so with very low latency and at very low cost. Thus there must be collections of nodes that are sufficiently localized to reach a critical mass of computing power in order to achieve the lowest possible latency for those problems and or customers that require it and to do so at the lowest possible cost without sacrificing trustworthiness survivability and fault tolerance . A new kind of supercomputing machine SCRAM was conceived as the means to reconcile the conflicting requirements including that of achieving low acquisition and operating costs. Each SCRAM machine is a self contained supercomputer in its own right but can be colocated with other SCRAM machines to multiply its capacity and performance without sacrificing latency and SCRAM machines can be distributed to achieve arbitrary levels of survivability.

In SHADOWS terminology working storage is not passive it s active the working storage actually does the work. A node is the smallest addressable unit of intelligent storage or working storage. A node comprises at least one processor to do computational work along with some mix of volatile and non volatile memory to provide information storage .

SHADOWS nodes can be organized into machines and machines can be organized into sites and these are the basis of the two primary conceptual SHADOWS building blocks 

In a preferred embodiment the subject machines are SCRAM machines and the subject sites are SUREFIRE sites.

SCRAM machines are miserly in their energy usage and are self contained including computing networking persistent storage power generation etc. . SCRAM machines do not need computer friendly environments you could safely drop one into a lake without damaging it so they can easily be distributed to multiple sites which need not be data centers any physically secure location may be appropriate . SCRAM machines are essentially very small self contained datacenters except that they require external power and to some degree depending on the threat profile physical protection.

In conjunction with SUREFIRE sites SCRAM machines are designed for deployment to unmanned unattended locations e.g. underground and require no routine maintenance.

A SHADOWS site is defined as a group of SHADOWS machines whether or not they are SCRAM machines that share the same or approximately the same GPS coordinates within some radius and or margin of error and are interconnected with a multiplicity of network switching and or routing communications fabrics.

In a preferred embodiment one or more SCRAM machines would be co located at a site in a particular kind of highly survivable facility referred to as a SUREFIRE site.

The are numerous SUREFIRE site configurations possible in order to provide the basis of meeting a diverse set of needs. The four exemplary configurations described here are 

The SUREFIRE Mini Silo is a preferred embodiment and by design its minimal configuration would enjoy the lowest cost of the three example underground configurations if deployed in volume which would enable affordable widespread deployment. The packaging of all of its major components is tailored especially to a silo configuration a cylindrical shape approximately 3 feet in diameter . The SUREFIRE Mini Silo can be configured to support various levels of performance in the sub TFLOPS to 10 TFLOPS range per silo.

The SUREFIRE Single Level Underground Vault is an alternate embodiment a larger diameter silo that could be affordably produced in fairly low quantities relative to the SUREFIRE Mini Silo and is able to accommodate a higher degree of conventional equipment than the SUREFIRE Mini Silo. The SUREFIRE Single Level Underground Vault is especially well suited to supercomputing accompanied by significant radio communications the silo itself serves as the base for relatively lightweight communications towers . The SUREFIRE Single Level Underground Vault can be configured to support various levels of performance in the 0.5 TFLOPS to 10 TFLOPS range per silo.

The SUREFIRE Multi Level Underground Vault is an alternate embodiment also in a silo configuration that is likely to require a somewhat substantial level of site engineering and preparation prior to deployment. A typical deployment scenario would be underneath literally a commercial class wind turbine e.g. 100 KW or more . While the basic design is straightforward to replicate its site preparation unlikely to be due to the facility depth and likely permitting issues. The SUREFIRE Multi Level Underground Vault can be configured to support various levels of performance in the 2 TFLOPS to 50 TFLOPS range per silo.

A SHADOWS mesh which may also be a neighborhood and or community is a group of SHADOWS sites in the same locale sharing proximate GPS coordinates and interconnected with a meshed network of point to point and point to multipoint links augmented by WAN links in a preferred embodiment a diverse multiplicity of terrestrial and satellite channels are used to achieve specific survivability goals .

A SHADOWS region is typically but this may be defined by policy the collection of WAN connected at least SHADOWS sites supplied or potentially supplied by the same utility power grid thus in the U.S. for example there are four regions under this definition but other definitions are possible also . Adjacent regions may also enjoy mesh like point to point or point to multipoint interconnections which may have the effect of collapsing two or more physical or policy defined regions into a single logical region.

A SHADOWS theater is a collection of WAN connected sites which for our purposes is essentially distinguished by some combination of geographical political military legal and technical considerations that force special or self similar treatment throughout the collection. Examples of theaters are North America Western Europe China Japan Australia the stratosphere the troposphere LEO satellites MEO satellites the moon and Mars this is clearly a non exhaustive list .

Finally the SHADOWS universe is the total collection of SHADOWS theaters whether interconnected by any means whatsoever or even disconnected.

Although traditional route optimizers and link balancing devices can optimize for some combination of link performance and or link cost they generally consider the network only from the device s point of view or with respect to a set of relatively local properties. This means for example that there is nothing to prevent such a device from choosing a low cost outbound link that corresponds to a high cost inbound link at the ultimate destination. This is usually the best that can be expected especially when only the near end device is under local administrative control and responsibility.

In stark contrast SHADOWS considers its entire network i.e. the SHADOWS universe as the basis for optimization. When optimizing for cost for example SHADOWS considers both the sending and receiving links for every SHADOWS node along a path.

Key SHADOWS drivers include the current and probable future availability of resources and the maintenance of adequate reserves to ensure appropriate levels of survivability.

SHADOWS network routing is further complicated by the need to intentionally thwart traffic analysis by potential attackers. Thus in addition to the functional boundaries roles and optimizations noted above there are non functional ones as well.

In particular once communications exits the virtual world of SHADOWS such that connection to the real world is required new types of special capabilities are called for.

The Firewall Link Aggregator Multiplexer Edge Router FLAMERouter capability lives at the interface between a SHADOWS supercomputing node and all external network connections LAN and WAN . One of its primary responsibilities is to cooperate with the FLAMERouters of other SHADOWS nodes in order to transparently and logically connect each SHADOWS node to the others optimally using the Scrutiny RECAP Reliably Efficient Computation Adaptation Persistence protocol over any and all channels available private and public . A key goal is to handle traffic as though all the nodes were connected on an amalgam of VLANs and VPNs but without the VLANs and VPNs taking extraordinary measures as necessary to avoid partitioning of the virtual network. 

Another key role of the SHADOWS FLAMERouters is to safeguard the SHADOWS communications channels not only to prevent denial of service which includes resisting DDOS attacks but also to prevent traffic analysis so as to render the SHADOWS network opaque. FLAMERouters use active techniques in conjunction with the SELF subsystem to classify both inbound and outbound traffic as friendly benign or malicious. Friendly traffic as determined by SELF is granted the highest priorities. Benign and malicious traffic are both allowed depending on the properties of the traffic itself but are closely managed by the FLAMERouters so as to meet the specific needs of SHADOWS non self traffic is desirable for mixing purposes as part of defending against traffic analysis by attackers but must be limited to exactly the desired bandwidths while ensuring that no malicious traffic is allowed to propagate .

As a fringe benefit of defending a SHADOWS network from DDOS attacks a wide deployment of FLAMERouters is expected to have the ability to help mitigate the effects of botnets across the Internet in general. FLAMERouters can execute behavior appropriate countermeasures.

The FLAMERouter processes can be implemented in software and or hardware but in a preferred embodiment are implemented primarily in reconfigurable hardware under the auspices of dynamic configuration software and under the control of the BOSS Byzantine Object Subject Security and SELF Secure Emergent Learning of Friends subsystems.

The SHADOWS RUSHrouter behaves much like the FLAMERouter but is designed for deployment to client locations where it can serve as a host resident proxy or default gateway or live in the DMZ as a server edge router and default gateway. The primary role of the RUSHrouter is to enable and manage secure communications between client machines and RUSHrouters between RUSHrouters and FLAMERouters indirectly because a RUSHrouter never knows when it is communicating with a FLAMERouter which can emulate RUSHrouters and among RUSHrouters all under the auspices and control of the FLAMERouters.

RUSHrouters communicate natively using Scrutiny s RUSH and UNCAP protocols. The RUSH Rapid Universal Secure Handling protocol focuses on meeting the needs of clients i.e. on the client side of the RUSHrouters . The UNCAP Untrusted Node Computation Adaptation Persistence protocol is a subset of RUSH and focuses on communications between the SHADOWS infrastructure and any SERVANTs that are implemented on client machines.

Because they are in essence client side gateways and firewalls with built in proxy and server functions RUSHrouters can also communicate like a residential gateway firewall with arbitrary Internet destinations including to and through overlay networks e.g. the anonymizing networks TOR I2P etc. and can do so by using any and all available connections like a FLAMERouter . Client preferences especially firewall and bandwidth preferences can be set by authenticated clients but all such configuration changes actually occur only at the behest of the FLAMERouters based on client requests to configuration control processes in the SHADOWS infrastructure.

Although RUSHrouters are under the control of FLAMERouters they technically do not actually communicate with them directly since FLAMERouters are generally invisible except to specially privileged devices and specifically not to RUSHrouters . Instead RUSHrouters communicate with a multiplicity of what they think are FLAMERouters but are in actuality SHADOWS MARSHALs Multiprocessor Adaptive Scheduler Task Executor Redirector .

A MARSHAL is much like a RUSHrouter except that it lives not on the client side but out in the Internet itself typically in data centers or network hubs where multiple high bandwidth connections are available. RUSHrouters and MARSHALs work together to route mix aggregate and manage traffic under the auspices and control of the FLAMERouters. Note that RUSHrouters and MARSHALs may be directed to send traffic to FLAMERouters thinking they re sending it to another RUSHrouter or MARSHAL because the destinations aren t recognizable as FLAMERouters . Only legitimate i.e. authorized traffic is ever directed to the FLAMERouters although this may include both benign and malicious traffic if desired by the FLAMERouters but only to the extent so desired . A compromised RUSHrouter or MARSHAL that directs unwanted traffic malicious or not toward the FLAMERouters may face appropriate countermeasures.

The key differences among RUSHrouters MARSHALs and FLAMERouters are their roles purposes locations location induced vulnerabilities configurations and implementations. Otherwise they are conceptually more alike than different from a process point of view. RUSHrouters are oriented to client side functions MARSHALs are oriented to middleman functions and FLAMERouters are oriented to server side functions yet they all can at least appear to emulate each other to a point.

Note Any FLAMERouter can emulate any number of RUSHrouters and MARSHALs and so can communicate directly with them without revealing itself.

SERVANT . Service Executor Repository Voluntary Agent Non Trusted. A cooperative computing and or storage node that is untrusted usually due to potential threat exposure . A MASTER that is not recognized as a MASTER by other MASTERS may operate as a SERVANT but to do so it must use the UNCAP protocol tunneled via RUSH rather than the RECAP protocol . See also BOSS MASTER RECAP RUSH SCRAMnet SELF UNCAP.

MARSHAL . Multi Agent Routing Synchronization Handling Aggregation Layer. A distinguished SERVANT node having the responsibilities of fulfilling a MARSHAL role. Any node authenticated as having a MARSHAL role that serves as a gateway for system users to access SHADOWS services via a network e.g. the Internet . A MARSHAL may also communicate with other MARSHALs under the auspices and control of a MASTER led team in order to implement one or more overlay networks and or network fabrics whose purposes and characteristics are determined by the MASTER led team but are opaque to the MARSHALs . By design a MARSHAL is not trusted and the role is typically fulfilled by a SERVANT node which is also inherently untrusted . Occasionally the MARSHAL role is fulfilled by a SLAVE emulating a MARSHAL that is operating under the auspices and control of a MASTER through a HANDLER and is therefore trusted but this fact is never known to those communicating with the MARSHAL. A MARSHAL may reside virtually anywhere e.g. at an ISP on customer premises at a telco central office at a datacenter on a utility pole within a server or PC etc. . See also HANDLER ISP MASTER PC SELF SERVANT SLAVE.

DELEGATE . Distributed Execution via Local Emulation GATEway. A distinguished SERVANT node having the responsibilities of fulfilling a DELEGATE role. The DELEGATE role implements secure client side proxy agent that appears to locally implement a particular service which would normally be implemented elsewhere such as on a local or remote server but instead may actually be implemented within the SHADOWS network cloud.

The DELEGATE proxy handles both stateless and stateful communication the latter may be expected to be chatty with the client side software requesting service such that the DELEGATE proxy translates requests to and from the RUSH protocol as needed. In one embodiment for example an open source DBMS API like that of say MySQL or PostgresSQL is implemented as a DELEGATE the MySQL or PostgresSQL DELEGATE can then be run locally on an arbitrary machine e.g. a PC or server and any software applications that expect the selected DBMS may run as though it were present.

Although the selected DBMS may appear to be local its operations may actually be carried out on the SHADOWS supercomputing infrastructure there is no need for database replication because the survival and integrity of distributed data is intrinsic to the SHADOWS architecture.

Any number of authorized subjects at any authorized locations can similarly instantiate the selected DBMS DELEGATE and they may all be sharing the same database if that is what is called for or diverse databases as required. Furthermore if one application requires one DBMS say MySQL and another requires a different DBMS say PostgresSQL and a third application requires an OpenLDAP server and a fourth requires an Apache web server then four appropriately selected DELEGATEs can be instantiated on the local machine. Each DELEGATE may implement the requisite local API but can communicate via the RUSH protocol with a local set of virtual RUSHrouters which can communicate again via the RUSH protocol with the distributed SHADOWS infrastructure where the actual computing operations can be carried out in accordance with an appropriate SLA.

In a preferred embodiment the DELEGATE concept can be applied to common Internet based services including DNS email POP3 SMTP etc. VoIP SIP and so forth.

In a preferred embodiment the DELEGATE concept is applied to HPC class interprocessor communications by implementing an MPI API.

A SHADOWS machine comprises one or more nodes sharing a common chassis or other container of some sort without regard to specific packaging. In a preferred embodiment SCRAM is one such machine its extruded aluminum chassis may be cylindrical in shape comprising a set of Quadrants each of which comprises a set of Lobes and an optional set of Blades .

Main Section. In a preferred embodiment depicted in the main section 1 i.e. the vertical upright portion is a single large aluminum extrusion with an overall diameter of about 25 including cooling fins not shown . However there are only a handful of extruders in the world capable of handling a diameter approaching 25 and the associated tonnage of press capacity required so in an alternate embodiment the main section is split into identical interlocking sections one per 90 quadrant each of which has a maximum diameter of 

Inner Diameter. The inner diameter is smaller than depicted in order to increase the interior room and is assigned a cooling function.

Lower Section. The lower extruded section comprises interlocking outrigger sections one per quadrant that are identical large extrusions with a maximum diameter cross sectional length of about 28 in a preferred embodiment or somewhat less than 17 in an alternative small form factor embodiment not shown or six interlocking outrigger sections two per quadrant that are identical large extrusions with a maximum diameter cross sectional length of about 20 in a preferred embodiment or about 12 in an alternative small form factor embodiment not shown with values proportional to dimensions shown .

In a preferred embodiment the coolant sump and pumps are accessed from the open side where the missing quadrant is . In a alternate embodiment the unit is serviced from the top. Note that the sump is normally dry except in the rare case of accidental spills all the working fluid couplings are blind mating and self sealing .

Depending on the selected pump there may be as many as four high reliability 50 000 hours MTBF pumps in a quadruple modular redundant arrangement where each such arrangement is responsible for a certain percentage of the necessary flow. Under normal loads and depending on the ambient temperature or other cooling temperature only one pump is typically operating some conditions require no pumps at all . In a preferred embodiment based on variable voltage DC pumps the pumps are small and nominally dissipate less than 25 watts each while pumping up to 1200 LPH 317 GPH or 5.3 GPM or providing pressures up to 3.5 bar 50 PSI .

In a preferred embodiment the SCRAM Supercomputer is designed to be self contained storage wise with up to 32 full size 3.5 inch disk drives per quadrant or preferably 128 small form factor 2.5 inch disk drives per quadrant. A limited edition might ship with 2 nearline outrigger blades each populated with 16 drives of 80 GB or 1.28 TB per blade for a total of 2.56 TB. Although we could easily use higher capacity drives the selected 80 GB drives are at a sweet spot for price and performance. Given a fixed budget far more performance can be had with the lower capacity drives because many more drives can be purchased for the same amount of money and more spindles means higher levels of parallel access.

For 2007 the highest density 2.5 inch SAS disk drive has a raw uncompressed capacity of 146 GB so the maximum hard disk storage capacity possible with 128 drives is 18.7 TB per quadrant 146 GB 128 or 56 TB for the chassis. With dual ported SAS drives however there are 256 channels of access 300 MBps each rather than 128 channels all SATA drives are only single ported .

In a preferred embodiment each NEARblade is a 16 drive SAS SATA hybrid consisting of 4 to 8 dual ported SAS drives for speed and 8 to 12 single ported SATA drives for high capacity and cost reduction. Note that despite the fact that typical SAS drives 10K RPM are much faster than high capacity SATA drives 5400 or 7200 RPM both are considered only nearline storage in a SCRAM Supercomputer.

Each storage blade is likely to weigh 15 to 20 pounds 16 drives plus frame thermal conductors and coolant . If all the drives in a bay were spinning at once they would require 160 to 300 watts of power depending on the mix of SATA and SAS drives.

In a typical configuration much less than 20 of the drives would normally be spinning reducing the power load to the neighborhood of 32 to 60 watts maximum.

In a preferred embodiment blades are either top loaded or front loaded but must be selected for maintenance and powered down before removal. This is a matter of authenticating making a menu selection and waiting for a light to indicate that the blade is ready to be removed and that the solenoid controlled blade latching mechanism is unlocked. An outrigger blade such as a drive bay can be removed without shutting down the SCRAM lobes in the corresponding quadrant.

Because a phase change coolant is in use removing a SCRAM lobe requires an authorized power down of the quadrant containing it and likewise waiting for a light to indicate that the quadrant is ready to be opened and that its solenoid controlled module latching mechanism is also unlocked. The same solenoid control may prevent tampering and other unauthorized access.

Due to the very large surface area the outer fins provide substantial cooling even in the absence of data center style air conditioning. Phase change working fluid is circulated in the outer walls causing the vapor to condense under normal circumstances.

The walls containing the optional inner fins also incorporate fluid circulation channels and can provide cooling when forced air is available say from a data center underfloor air conditioning system . A high reliability low noise blower is also contained in the base as a backup to supplement other means of cooling during over temperature conditions.

Note The fluid channels in the inner walls are distinct from the fluid channels in the outer walls and may be used separately although there is a relatively low resistance conduction path in the current design because they re contained in the same all aluminum extrusion.

Note Although it is not shown here because it s not related to the extrusion there is also a heat exchanger and couplings for connecting with a building or datacenter chilled water system. In most cases the already hot return water is sufficient for cooling a SCRAM node which has substantial economic implications especially for overloaded datacenters.

In a preferred embodiment a SCRAM node is composed of 1 to 4 quadrants . Each quadrant contains 4 lobes that are fully connected to each other and to the lobes in the other quadrants. Each quadrant controls up to 8 optional outrigger blades discussed elsewhere in any combination and each blade is fully connected to each lobe in the corresponding quadrant .

Note In the illustration above the particular internal configuration details of each of the individual lobes are not significant except that the PEERS fabric local to each lobe connects with the PEERS fabric in the other lobes and also with the outrigger blades .

In a preferred embodiment one or more of the blocks depicted above as optional outrigger blades also are implemented internally i.e. within a lobe in a non bladed manner so that the specific means are also built into the lobe and provide the corresponding capability inherently i.e. without the need for optional outrigger blades in order to reduce the cost of a basic configuration.

Each lobe s workload is handled by SELF CHARM blocks that function symbiotically to securely store retrieve and process information using an associative memory hierarchy. In particular the SELF roles of BOSS MASTER and SLAVE are each paired with a CHARM PUMP capability that is tailored for the particular role. In the diagram above the pairings BOSS PUMP MASTER PUMP and multiple SLAVEs with multiple PUMPs are depicted without arrows to emphasize the symbiotic coupling. Each pairing includes one or more means for processing along with one or more levels of local memory and or cache. Note that in a preferred embodiment the multiple SLAVEs with multiple PUMPs in a one to one configuration are replaced with one or more PUMPs each having a multiplicity of SLAVEs .

In each SELF CHARM pairing the SELF means and the CHARM means may each be implemented via one or more traditional CPUs SMP or not programmable and or reconfigurable logic e.g. FPGAs ASICs etc. or even discrete logic or any combination thereof including implementation of a pairing or multiple pairings on a single chip using any combination of means.

In a preferred embodiment the BOSS PUMP and MASTER PUMP pairings are implemented via a single CPU handling the BOSS MASTER functionality and a single FPGA or Structured ASIC handling both their respective PUMP functionalities. The SLAVE PUMP pairings are each implemented via a single CPU handling the SLAVE functionality and a single FPGA or Structured ASIC handling the corresponding PUMP functionality.

Logically each lobe has a PEERS switching routing fabric but in a preferred embodiment there are actually at least two redundant fabrics working together in an active active configuration.

SCRAM machines provide a solid foundation for the SHADOWS infrastructure which is highly distributed with inter node communications occurring globally over WANs quasi locally within a locale via WLANs and locally within a site via a multiplicity of LAN switch fabrics and or meshes. Nonetheless the SHADOWS infrastructure is designed to play nice which allows it to safely participate in other networks in various roles e.g. supercomputer NAS appliance a complete SAN deployment etc. all as a first class citizen. Furthermore the SHADOWS infrastructure is designed to take advantage of idle or unused computing storage and communications resources associated with the networks to which it is attached as authorized in order to maximize its supercomputing throughput while minimizing the cost of doing so. The SCRAM machines provide the magic that makes it possible.

Regardless of the physical implementation a SCRAM machine comprises four major logical functions and thus four major types of means SELF CHARM CORE and FRAME.

Internally each of a SCRAM machine s Lobes and optionally any Blade comprises at least one MASTER and typically at least one SLAVE and both MASTERs and SLAVEs typically comprise multi core general purpose processors but may optionally comprise special purpose processors including without limitation devices or modules comprising fixed or reconfigurable logic such as ASICs FPGAs and so forth.

Each MASTER is further distinguished by its isomorphic association with unique instantiations of BOSS and SELF which are implemented at least partly in secure immutable hardware . Thus in this aforementioned embodiment a node could refer to the SCRAM machine itself or any of the Quadrants Lobes Blades MASTERs or SLAVEs or even the processors whereas they collectively determine the Machine.

In a preferred embodiment SELF is an automated role oriented immune system that differentiates self and non self friend and foe thus said system may distinguish between authorized and unauthorized objects subjects and interactions.

In a preferred embodiment SELF may establish and maintain trust among interdependent systems subsystems and components.

In a preferred embodiment SELF may integrate with BOSS see section 7.1.3 to incorporate Byzantine agreement logic from the classic Byzantine generals problem into its decision making process so that it may make correct decisions in the face of overt or covert attack collusion and corruption.

In a preferred embodiment SELF may be highly integrated with BOSS and with the RECAP UNCAP and or RUSH protocols.

In a preferred embodiment any anomalous behavior detected by SELF or of which SELF becomes aware may trigger an appropriate immune system response.

At its simplest the idea is to use distributed teams of nodes in a self healing network as the basis for managing and coordinating both the work to be accomplished and the resources available to do the work. The SHADOWS concept of teams is responsible for its ability to self heal and adapt its distributed resources in an organic manner. Furthermore the teams themselves are at the heart of decision making processing and storage in the SHADOWS infrastructure. Anything that may be important may be handled under the auspices and stewardship of a team.

The purpose of having teams is at least five fold 1 to distribute the automated resource management overhead 2 to partition parallelize and distribute the actual processing load and improve overall performance 3 to increase the fault tolerance of the system 4 to increase the inherent survivability of the system and 5 to increase the difficulty of successfully attacking the system.

Although distributed the SHADOWS infrastructure cannot be correctly described as strictly centralized or strictly decentralized. It is definitely not centralized in the sense that a traditional mainframe or supercomputer is intentionally centralized. Neither is it decentralized in the sense that a peer to peer network or perhaps a grid network is intentionally decentralized so as to avoid centralized functionality which often requires significant trade offs . Rather SHADOWS is a little of both in a Borg like way. SHADOWS might best be described as having a conceptually centralized function that happens to have local representation but a highly decentralized implementation. The SHADOWS Borg like operational team concept may be vaguely reminiscent of the physics concept of quantum entanglement a quantum mechanical phenomenon in which the quantum states of two or more objects have to be described with reference to each other even though the individual objects may be spatially separated .

In the SHADOWS infrastructure every MASTER is the leader of at least one team to which other MASTERs both local and remote are also assigned. Depending upon the nature of a particular team there may also be non MASTER participants and these may be voluntary SERVANTs or non voluntary SLAVEs .

Given a set of MASTERs cooperating as a team a specific MASTER is always the team leader if present and functioning correctly and each of the other MASTERs has a specific but potentially dynamic role relative to the current team leader. There are at least as many teams has there are MASTERs so that every competent MASTER leads at least one team and also participates in subordinate roles in other teams. The more MASTERs there are the more powerful the system is.

Although every MASTER leads a team not every potential MASTER may actually become a MASTER. The state of being a MASTER is neither automatic nor assured it requires establishing identities and relationships with other potential MASTERs and or with actual MASTERs until a sort of critical mass of relationships qualifications trustworthiness and actual trust is reached enabling the state of being a MASTER to be achieved. Until then a potential MASTER can be a SERVANT i.e. it can volunteer but cannot lead a team. A SERVANT is a useful but untrusted working storage resource it is capable of storing retrieving and forwarding encoded encrypted information but not decrypting or decoding it . In general a SERVANT doesn t possess enough information to make decrypting and decoding possible regardless of the computing resources available to a would be attacker. A SERVANT is also capable of executing in memory processes against information securely received but not stored under the auspices of a MASTER led team.

Some SERVANTs are assigned a MARSHAL role which adds to their responsibilities but not to their trustworthiness like the SERVANT the MARSHAL role is inherently untrusted .

In the SHADOWS infrastructure by design any information that is intentionally stored is deemed immutable this does not apply to transient information existing only in memory . Immutable data content can never be changed note however that the internal storage format of the information may be modified without changing the content and thus without changing the identity and has an identity that is determined by the content itself a cryptographic digest that is somewhat like a DNA signature. This digest or content based identity is known by various names but in this document may be referred to as simply the ContentDigest. The ContentDigest is calculated with a cryptographic one way function and is sufficiently random that it is useful for quasi randomly assigning the content to the team currently responsible for the logical universal partition to which the subject ContentDigest belongs. In addition to the ContentDigest all stored information is also given a universally unique ContentAlias that can remain forever associated with the ContentDigest and is more convenient and efficient to use. The ContentAlias is permanently assigned by the same team that is responsible for the logical universal partition to which the subject ContentDigest belongs and the team s identity is embedded in the ContentAlias. Thus both the ContentDigest and the ContentAlias implicitly or explicitly identify the same team which essentially becomes the ContentStewardTeam that is accountable for knowing about the content its logical whereabouts and other potentially privileged information may not actually be known by the team acting as content steward but it serves as the focal point but especially the bidirectional mapping of ContentDigest and ContentAlias.

Every SHADOWS resource task and identifiable entity of any virtually kind including without limiting the generality of the foregoing processes objects subjects and records is assigned to a team as are all users and or actors that exhibit any kind of producer and or consumer behavior with respect to the SHADOWS infrastructure or its mission.

From a rudimentary viewpoint in a preferred embodiment a SHADOWS team comprises for example at least five active MASTERs two colocated MASTERs say LocalMASTER  the team leader and LocalMASTER  and three non colocated MASTERs say RemoteMASTER  RemoteMASTER  and RemoteMASTER . This minimal team is sufficient to maintain Byzantine agreement in the face of one Byzantine fault e.g. a single corrupt MASTER or one failed site e.g. due to a regional disaster . In the event of a failed site individual subsystems may still function sufficiently as to be able to call home and contact remaining portions of the SHADOWS infrastructure. In such a scenario the surviving resources will be assimilated back into the infrastructure as SERVANTs if they cannot qualify or re qualify as MASTERs.

It is accepted in the art that the minimum number n of team members required for Byzantine agreement is 3f 1 where f is the number of faults to be tolerated and no more than one third of the team members are faulty whether benign or malicious . The SHADOWS architecture acknowledges this as a starting point although there is reason to believe that 3f 1 may be overly conservative. However because survivability and trust are key to SHADOWS conservatism is quite acceptable. In any case if 3f 1 is too conservative then achieving 3f 1 means that a larger number of faults may be tolerated with no actual changes. On the other hand SHADOWS uses a linear MDS code e.g. a variant of Reed Solomon to achieve Byzantine agreement. . However SHADOWS uses coding theory rather than voting to implement Byzantine agreement. Thus Byzantine agreement among k out of n MASTERs on the same SHADOWS team is sufficient to tolerate f faults where f n k 2 and n k in the general case of f faulty and or malicious team members assuming that it is not known which f of the n MASTERs are faulty and or malicious. This means that for the case when f 1 then n 2 k.

If instead it is allowed that up to c MASTERs have simply crashed or failed to respond and it is known which ones these are then SHADOWS may tolerate a combination of up to c known crashed or unresponsive MASTERs and up to f faulty or malicious but unknown MASTERs where c 2f 

In general there must be at least two colocated MASTERs both of which must have already qualified to lead teams such that one of them can lead the team and the other can serve as local backup simultaneous failure of both is equivalent to failure of that team in the local geographic region .

There must also be at least three MASTERs that are remotely located not in the same geographic region as the local MASTERs and not in the same geographic region as each other such that at least three additional geographic regions are represented none of which shares any regional threats with the others. This can be considered as a special case of Byzantine agreement except that agreement is among regions and at least n regions are required for Byzantine agreement where n 3f 1 and where f is the number of faulty or failed regions to be tolerated. Once the basic requirements of geographic diversity are met any number of additional MASTERs whether colocated or remote can be added to any team as needed.

The definitions of geographic regions and regional threats as used here are determined by policy decisions that are outside the scope of this document. There may also be other team membership requirements that are likewise determined by policy.

Once the minimum team membership requirements have been met a SHADOWS team can form and begin rounding itself out by virtue of extending its membership as the SHADOWS infrastructure grows. In particular potential MASTERs that cannot yet participate in a MASTER role for whatever reason may volunteer as SERVANTs and thus become immediately usable by any and all existing SHADOWS teams. At some point potential MASTERs may qualify to become MASTERs in which case they can be assigned to one or more SHADOWS teams in subordinate non team leader roles and can also be assigned teams of their own as new teams are formed. Note that non team leader roles can become acting team leaders at any time if their superiors are unable to perform their roles.

Whenever a team s leadership capacity becomes diminished either in absolute terms e.g. diminished capacity fewer team members through attrition failure eviction etc. or in relative terms e.g. team member overload unacceptable risk profile etc. then additional team members are aggressively recruited as necessary without lowering the bar for qualifications however .

When any team here the SubmittingTeam receives an artifact containing information to be stored or handled say from another team or an external source it is analyzed at least sufficiently to classify the information boundaries if not already known for example it is helpful to know the granularity of the object such as whether it is a file database record or email message etc. . Conceptually the artifact s ContentDigest is computed at the coarsest granularity and then looked up in a local RecognizedContentIndex to find out if the artifact or its content has been previously handled. The actual lookup occurs by first checking the SubmittingTeam s local copy of the RecognizedContentIndex and if not found sending a lookup request message containing the ContentDigest to the accountable ContentStewardTeam. Typically the SubmittingTeam is actually part of a computing cluster of some sort so the local copy of the RecognizedContentIndex is most likely distributed over the local cluster meaning that even a local lookup entails sending a message to the appropriate local team responsible for that particular slice of the RecognizedContentIndex . If found either way then the ContentAlias is now known and from a simplistic viewpoint the storage request has essentially been fulfilled since the content has already been stored of course there s a little more to it in terms of tracking accessing parties etc. but that sort of detail is well known in the art and out of scope for this document .

If the ContentDigest is neither in the RecognizedContentIndex which may not be completely up to date nor the ContentStewardTeam s RecognizedContentIndex then the information to be stored is new by definition. Note that although the ContentStewardTeam may eventually be responsible for assigning a ContentAlias to the information to be stored pairing it with the associated ContentDigest and publishing it to the SHADOWS infrastructure. However such assignment cannot occur until the artifact and its information content is received and vetted according to the ContentStewardTeam s rules because the assignment of a ContentAlias is both automatic and permanent and thus by design cannot be changed later.

Once it has been determined that the information to be stored is actually new then it is further analyzed to determine if there are any recognizable finer granularities this can occur in parallel with the initial lookups if there are sufficient processing resources and simply aborted if the coarser grained artifact is subsequently recognized as having been stored already . Because changing even a single bit of an artifact s information content results in a different ContentDigest by design this means that the resulting artifact is a different artifact from the SHADOWS viewpoint. However given the high degree of overlap between two artifacts that differ in as little as one bit this fact can be revealed if not already known by performing successively finer grained analyses and any discovered overlap in content can be used to great advantage by SHADOWS.

By way of explanation consider an artifact such as a book which contains unstructured information from the viewpoint of a DBMS database management system for example but yet clearly has some sort of structure based on its inherent natural boundaries and granularities e.g. entire book chapters pages paragraphs sentences etc. . In this example the entire book has a single identity. Each of the chapters also has an identity as do each of the pages each of the paragraphs each of the sentences and so on. At some point the difference in identities between the content of two editions of a particular book for example may boil down to the specific areas where they differ in content and this may occur anywhere along the granularity spectrum. This is likewise true for artifacts that are purported to be different their actual differences can be discovered and revealed.

The problem and process of analyzing content in order to identify it is well suited to the SHADOWS infrastructure and in fact was one of its architectural drivers. From the outset such analysis lends itself well to a cooperative parallel processing configuration and the more fine grained the analysis the more embarrassingly parallel the problem becomes. In the SHADOWS infrastructure each problem to be solved is assigned to a team and highly parallel problems natural involve the use of teams operating in a highly parallel fashion.

Every SHADOWS process is an artifact and thus has an identity and thus is assigned to one or more teams each of which has a particular role with respect to that process. In simplistic terms SHADOWS teams cooperatively share the management responsibilities of each artifact and process artifacts are no exception. One SHADOWS team is responsible for storing a particular process i.e. its executable image is an artifact another for verifying it prior to distribution or execution another for executing it another for monitoring its execution etc. Thus when software rejuvenation is called for multiple SHADOWS teams are involved on a cooperative basis.

Another area of process specific cooperation among teams is in the area of memoization which is essentially the capability of looking up known results of deterministic processes and or functions rather than recomputing them from scratch. We ve already noted that each artifact and each process down to the bit level has its own identity and that each existent combination of artifacts also has its own identity within the limitation of acceptable granularity . Accordingly whenever a deterministic process or function accepts a particular set of input values and produces a deterministic set of output values we can treat the set of input values in conjunction with the specific process as a new input process artifact with an identity. We can also treat the set of output values as an artifact with an identity. This done memoization is a conceptually simple matter of establishing a pairing between the input process identity and the output identity such that any already known output can be looked up and identified. Thus given any input process identity it can be determined through a lookup whether the result has been previously computed and if so what its identity is. Conversely it can be directly determined which input process identities if any have generated a particular output identity.

The SHADOWS FACTUAL capability is conceptually just a memoization system but one that is designed to operate at global scale and supercomputing speed with the high levels of security and survivability commensurate with the SHADOWS infrastructure. Teams are used to perform the processing required to arrive at previously unknown results and to reach consensus on vetted results prior to memoization which is particularly important for FACTUAL because memoized results can be reused as authoritative results that sidestep process execution . As with any artifact the various content and identities associated with memoized results need to be stored which involves teams on a SHADOWS wide basis as does the lookup of memoized results. If it cannot be readily determined on a local basis whether a memoized result exists the problem to be solved is queued for processing but can normally be dequeued if a vetted memoized result is obtained prior to the start of execution. A memoized result that is obtained after execution has already started can be used as a test oracle to verify the result thereby serving as a built in system integrity check. Memoization of results and whether to use lookup of memoized results is context specific and configurable at the process level or process family level. In general lookups of memoized results may not be utilized when such lookups consume more resources than would be required to simply recompute the results unless such lookups reduce a local processing load by shifting the lookup elsewhere. The lookups of memoized and therefore already known results are also vetted by virtue of the fact that lookups like other operations are handled by geographically distributed teams that are difficult to attack. Not only must a distributed team reach consensus on the identity of the memoized result but other distributed teams are typically involved in moving a copy of the content of the identified result to where it is needed and in all cases the recipient s can determine the degree to which consensus was reached in each step. The availability of memoized results is also very helpful in cases of Byzantine failure that would otherwise hamper the achievement of vetted results.

Software rejuvenation coordinates heartbeat rekeying and process port changes with process version updates and restarts. Actual rejuvenation is managed by each MASTER s BOSS role which comprises a virtual machine VM with special privileges and responsibilities as a timely trusted supervisor one of which is starting a new VM process pair and migrating its essential state to it through the hypervisor VMM.

Rejuvenation can include a new version of executable from the same source with no functional changes using one way translation to deter reverse engineering .

Each node maintains a bitmap of globally active process port combinations including ports in transition e.g. due to version update . Assuming one bit per process port this requires at most 64 Kbits or 8 KB. An encrypted authenticated bitmap is distributed periodically and upon request via RECAP. Active process port updates are also distributed periodically via RECAP as are periodic authentication requests to verify a non corrupted image at each node. Incorrect or missing responses may trigger SELF reporting and escalation.

Any message received on a globally non active port constitutes behavior that is both a diagnostic clue and or a SELF clue as is any message received on an active but not ready port at a particular node. The latter could be legitimate within a short window corresponding to propagation delay if the sender did not receive a not ready update in time to prevent message transmission. In the latter case the sender must immediately follow up with a retraction message within a specific time period if the difference in message timestamps request time minus not ready time exceeds the allowable maximum which is designed to accommodate propagation and update delay . The timely receipt of an authenticated retraction message say within a second or some other policy specified threshold prevents escalation.

Each node maintains a map e.g. a bitmap of site local volunteer nodes nodes whose load is sufficiently light both absolutely and relatively that they can accommodate a higher than average load which means that ready virtual SERVANT processes and or SERVANT VMs possibly running on some combination of MASTERs and SLAVEs can be granted execution resources .

Given for example a maximum of 8K nodes at a particular site this bitmap of site local volunteer nodes can be represented in only 1 KB. Each node on a multi node street updates others on its street via street local multicast and they take turns updating their neighborhood. Each node in a neighborhood takes its turn updating its community and each node in a community takes its turn updating the other communities in the site.

When aggregated updates are applied overwriting of newer data is avoided the part to be avoided is simply skipped over . Local data one bit is always most up to date then street local neighborhood local community local and site local.

The site local volunteer bitmap can be ANDed with the site local process port bitmap for a particular process port combination which is updated in the same manner in order to find volunteer nodes for the process port. Volunteers are typically sought at a higher rate than draftees which can be any node with a ready process port .

Typically a random or pseudo random number is generated to find a starting bitmap offset and the next available bit is selected or next N bits if more are needed . A full word size of bits can be read at once. Compressed bitmaps are also possible see bit sliced index manipulation .

BOSS is a distributed timely trusted computing base TCB and object subject security system that incorporates Byzantine agreement logic from the classic Byzantine generals problem in its decision making process and collectively makes security decisions in a fail silent manner that provides survivability even in the face of multiple failures and or corrupted nodes. BOSS is implemented and instantiated only in conjunction with a MASTER and works in conjunction with CHARM to control who gets access to what and when while ensuring that unauthorized information is not exposed not even to other internal systems .

In the SHADOWS infrastructure BOSS implements the TCB and thus owns the security of the system. The rest of the components rely on BOSS to make correct security decisions and it must make 100 of the security decisions.

Any BOSS node that fails or becomes corrupted can be restarted or replaced and in any case cannot be trusted until its trustworthiness can be re established from scratch to the satisfaction of the surviving trusted nodes including at a minimum other MASTERs with which it previously participated as a team member. Keeping in mind that every MASTER is associated with a BOSS component and that BOSS is a distributed function refer back to A SHADOWS Team Comprises Members with No Common Regional Threats in 7.1.1.5 for more information on Byzantine agreement.

BOSS is designed to enable the SHADOWS infrastructure to support both classified and unclassified information processing and storage e.g. to meet or exceed Common Criteria CC Protection Profiles PP such as the U.S. DoD Remote Access Protection Profile for High Assurance Environments Version 1.0 June 2000 nominally at EAL5 or potentially at EAL6 if implemented by a single qualified development organization .

The DoD defines the TCB as the totality of protection mechanisms within a computer system including hardware firmware and software the combination of which is responsible for enforcing a security policy. A TCB consists of one or more components that together enforce a unified security policy over a product or system. The ability of a trusted computing base to correctly enforce a security policy depends solely on the mechanisms within the TCB and on the correct input by system administrative personnel of parameters e.g. a user s clearance related to the security policy. DoD 5200.28 STD . TCSEC1983 defines the TCB as the totality of protection mechanisms within a computer system including hardware firmware and software the combination of which is responsible for enforcing a security policy.

Note The ability of a TCB to enforce correctly a unified security policy depends on the correctness of the mechanisms within the TCB the protection of those mechanisms to ensure their correctness and the correct input of parameters related to the security policy.

In the beginning Candidate MASTERs in a system seek to establish trust relationships with existing MASTERs and failing that with other Candidate MASTERs and if successful self organize to become full fledged MASTERs.

Any Candidate MASTER that is unable to establish itself as a MASTER i.e. a full peer with other MASTERs may retain its candidacy but is unable to fulfill any of the responsibilities of a MASTER. Rather than waste the resources of such a candidate it may volunteer or attempt to volunteer to operate under the auspices of a team of MASTERs in the role of SERVANT Service Executor Repository Volunteer Agent Non Trusted .

Each MASTER is distinguished from other MASTERs and from non MASTERs by a set of inherent traits and capabilities possessed only by MASTERs and Candidate MASTERs which are singleton would be MASTERs that have not been accepted and deemed trustworthy by a sufficient quorum of other MASTERs and or Candidate MASTERs and thus have not yet attained MASTER hood .

Conceptually one could think of MASTERs and Candidate MASTERs as being genetically and behaviorally related in ways that are mutually detectable.

Genetics. At the hardware level each MASTER has a one to one correspondence with and physical attachment to 1 a BOSS device or subsystem that has a universally unique cryptographic identity and 2 a SELF device or subsystem that can cryptographically establish whether the BOSS device or subsystem and any other arbitrary entity claiming to be part of the same system are indeed parts of the same self In a preferred embodiment self in this context refers to a bona fide SHADOWS infrastructure. This test is somewhat like a DNA based identification test where parts of the same self share a common DNA sequence so that in concept your nose and your right hand could both claim to be part of the same self e.g. you and the claim could be definitively verified.

Behaviors. A MASTER or Candidate MASTER is also behaviorally related to other MASTERs and Candidate MASTERs that are part of the same SHADOWS infrastructure and these behaviors are intended to be collectively inimitable. By way of analogy there s a helpful saying If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck it s a duck. However in the SHADOWS infrastructure an ability to imitate behavior intended to be inimitable is merely inconclusive only the converse is true If it does not walk exactly like a duck OR it does not quack exactly like a duck then it is not a duck As a consequence any non self behavior by a MASTER or Candidate MASTER is taken as evidence of counterfeit. Note that non self behavior by a MASTER is distinguished from the misbehavior of for example a communication channel used for MASTER to MASTER communication. The SHADOWS infrastructure attempts to determine and isolate the actual source s of misbehavior not doing so would render it much more vulnerable to denial of service DoS attacks . There is no concept of once trusted always trusted a trusted MASTER can become untrusted and therefore shunned at the first sign of misbehavior. In a preferred embodiment a shunned MASTER can be rejuvenated put on probation as a closely watched Candidate MASTER and rehabilitated to the extent possible. During rehabilitation it may fulfill roles typically assigned to a SERVANT which is inherently non trusted or possibly the roles of a Probationary MASTER whereby it thinks it s a MASTER and is apparently allowed a voice in decisions without being able to actually affect their outcomes and its decisions are closely monitored for correctness . In a preferred embodiment a shunned MASTER now a closely watched Probationary MASTER that fails to rehabilitate fully may either be shut down turned off or continue to be shunned but in the latter case may not recognize that it has been shunned a context is created somewhat like a honeypot or honeynet configurations used by researchers and system administrators to monitor attackers as part of putting it on probation that keeps up appearances in such a way as to marginalize the shunned MASTER while consuming minimal resources .

All system resources are partitioned in such a way as to allocate the management of them among all the MASTERs in the system. Every MASTER leads at least one team and also participates on multiple teams led by other MASTERs.

Each MASTER is the primary steward of several sets of resources and for each such set leads a team of MASTERs that is collectively responsible for that set of resources despite the simultaneous failure or corruption of any number of MASTERs up to a policy specified threshold . Failed and or corrupted MASTERs including the team leader are adaptively tolerated until detected at which point they are replaced.

A system s resources essentially refer to its capacity as a network of working storage comprising the areas of communications processing storage and energy. Each of these resource areas can be further refined in terms of understanding their capacities as resources constraints on their use or non use and other resource specific aspects. For example the communications resource area comprises connectivity and bandwidth as well as quantitative quality levels for each connectivity comprises availability and reliability for example and bandwidth comprises rate latency and jitter among others . Similarly the processing resource area comprises the ability and readiness to accomplish particular tasks with accompanying arrival rates service rates etc. as well as quantitative quality levels . The storage resource area comprises the ability and capacity to store information to transient and or persistent memory and subsequently retrieve it further comprising various addressing means and rates with accompanying quantitative quality levels . The energy resource area comprises the various energy sources and sinks for example having sufficient energy to power a combination of system components during a particular time window and to absorb store or reject any waste energy produced during that same window with accompanying quantitative quality levels.

Each MASTER maintains a viewpoint of the resources claimed to be available in the system both locally and elsewhere including its own in a radial fashion. In a preferred embodiment each resource claim is associated with a reputation that can be used to weight that resource claim. Relative proximity to the center as represented by distance from a set of local MASTERs determines relative update detail and frequency. The notion of radial proximity can be substituted with a hierarchical notion based on fixed granularity e.g. neighborhood town state country . For example local resources those comprising the center are the most detailed and frequently updated whereas nearby but non local resources are less detailed and less frequently updated and remote resources are the least detailed and least frequently updated.

Locally each MASTER summarizes the resources for which it is responsible normalizes the summary to a format that is standardized among the local MASTERs and shares it with its immediate peers i.e. the other local MASTERs on a mutually agreeable schedule. In a preferred embodiment the schedule of local updates is both event driven and periodic but the period is actually time varying on a prearranged basis as agreed among the local MASTERs failure to meet the time varying requirements provides a hint to SELF that may trigger an auto immune response .

In a preferred embodiment each MASTER also uses the local resource summaries provided to it by its immediate peers the same set of peers referred to in the previous paragraph and creates a further summary comprising their collective local resources then normalizes the collective summary to a format that is standardized among those peers and shares the collective summary with non local but nearby MASTERs on a mutually agreeable schedule. Conceptually in a set of concentric rings centered on the local MASTERs these non local but nearby MASTERs would correspond to the nearest larger ring . In a preferred embodiment the schedule of next ring updates is both event driven and periodic but the period is actually time varying on a prearranged basis as agreed among the local MASTERs failure to meet the time varying requirements provides a hint to SELF that may trigger an auto immune response .

In a preferred embodiment Byzantine agreement via BOSS is used locally by the BELIEF Bayesian Emergent Learning Intelligent Evaluation of Facts subsystem to create a 4 bit reputation estimate for each process at each node including its own based on its belief in reputation estimates proffered by others which are weighted by their own reputations and normalized to a 4 bit result. The local BOSS subsystem maintains its own view of the 4 bit reputation estimate for each process at each node including its own as a rolling average that can be queried at a rate independent of its update rate.

A reputation vector of length 2 b bits contains the last 2 b r r bit reputation estimates. Thus if b 128 and r 8 the vector is b 8 16 bytes long and contains b r 16 reputation estimates. If r 4 then the same vector would contain the last b r 32 reputation estimates. Alternatively with r 4 then 16 reputation estimates could be stored in only 8 bytes.

Given a c bit ClaimedValue and an r bit ReputationForClaimedValue proportional to the confidence in the claimant with respect to such claims or perhaps overall where 0 is worst case and 2 c 1 and 2 r 1 are the respective best case values for each variable the w bit ClaimWeightedByReputation value can be calculated as ClaimWeightedByReputation ClaimedValue ReputationForClaimedValue 2 

For example given a 4 bit ClaimedValue c 4 and a 4 bit ReputationForClaimedValue r 4 proportional to the confidence in the claimant with respect to such claims or perhaps overall where 0 is worst case and 15 is best case for each variable their 4 bit weighted product ClaimWeightedByReputation can be calculated as ClaimWeightedByReputation ClaimedValue ReputationForClaimedValue 4 4 4 

Although the interim product is c r bits wide 4 4 8 in this case shifting it right by c r w bits normalizes it back to the desired w bit result where in this case w 4.

The idea is to complement but avoid the necessity of conventional synchronous lockstep execution of identical instruction on identical CPUs at exactly the same time in a high availability HA duplicate modular redundancy DMR or triple modular redundancy TMR configuration with voting logic to determine the correct outcome.

The lockstep approach is useful for quickly detecting and handling transient errors and hardware problems and even associated software errors by masking such errors when possible . This approach can greatly improve the availability of a particular machine in a friendly environment but it does nothing for the availability in a hostile one. Thus if the HA server or site is compromised or taken down the system immediately becomes either untrustworthy or unavailable.

Note that being untrustworthy but still available is the worst possible outcome unless the system is specifically designed to assume the presence of untrustworthy nodes.

In contrast the SHADOWS Asynchronous Byzantine Agreement approach removes the need for lockstep execution although it can still be used but with less benefit since the ROI would be greatly diminished . The need for maximal asynchronous operation cannot be underestimated in a high survivability system since all manner of network traffic problems and corresponding mitigations can occur due to anticipated or actual attacks or even just normal congestion.

Instead of fine grained instruction level voting SHADOWS assumes that there are no completely trustworthy individual nodes but that consensus among a policy determined quorum is sufficient to warrant trust. In particular consensus is reached on the final result rather than on each instruction involved in its calculation.

This approach has the significant advantage of being able to incorporate arbitrary levels of diversity in multiple dimensions such as geographic locations political environments security mechanisms algorithms software versions e.g. differentiating among authors skill levels code versions programming languages build environments certification levels etc. CPUs memory systems EMP radiation hardening physical access controls etc. .

By comparing only the results or more precisely a representation of the results through the use of a Byzantine agreement algorithm from the classic Byzantine generals problem this approach can minimize the overhead associated with voting logic while still establishing a nearly arbitrary level of trust. Even nodes with intermittent hardware and or error prone or corrupted software can contribute useful results.

In a SHADOWS or SCRAM network voters may actually be data consumers not involved in the calculation that is they re not the Byzantine generals . In this scenario the voters do not have the actual results and must first receive results from the producers i.e. from the Byzantine generals . First the producers can each calculate the appropriate result including compression encryption and a CRC or message digest as appropriate . However rather than each producer transmitting the entire result to each consumer the producer then computes an FEC encoding of the result message with a suitable rate code and extracts its share of the FEC encoded message which it also encrypts and to which it may add a MAC message authentication code and or digital signature. The share is then transmitted to any consumers that need it along with identifying information as appropriate for the communications protocols in use. The code rate n k used determines the number of uncorrupted shares i.e. k of n that must be received in order to decode a result and determine its validity.

Data consumers may be addressed individually via unicast or collectively via multicast but in both cases the ability of a group of authorized but not necessarily trusted producers to send FEC encoded slices or slivers to the consumers greatly increases the likelihood that each consumer receives the correct desired data at the maximum rate it can be received such as when limited by the consumer s aggregated inbound bandwidth which may be greater than the individual outbound rates of the individual senders .

The BOSS subsystem is built on the principles of a Trusted Computing Base TCB as are known by those skilled in the art. In addition however BOSS is further constructed with accurate time keeping mechanisms and hardware support for the logic and processing required to implemented a Timely TCB TTCB whose principles are also known in the art but to a lesser degree and are well described elsewhere. The BOSS subsystem may also be implemented or emulated in software given an environment sufficient to meet the particular set of needs.

The novel BOSS hardware is tamper proof or tamper resistant and enables synchronization and reconciliation of multiple time keeping sources that are authoritative to varying degrees e.g. local atomic clocks local crystal controlled oscillators terrestrial radio or satellite based signals such as WWV GPS etc. .

The BOSS hardware also securely implements various cryptographic processes and provides secure encrypted storage of associated variables keys and so forth. The BOSS hardware also securely implements the error and or erasure coding mechanisms described below that enable the use and application of forward error correction FEC as described below.

It is accepted in the art that the minimum number n of team members required for Byzantine agreement is 3f 1 where f is the number of faults to be tolerated and no more than one third of the team members are faulty whether benign or malicious . The SHADOWS architecture acknowledges this as a starting point although there is reason to believe that 3f 1 may be overly conservative. However because survivability and trust are key to SHADOWS conservatism is quite acceptable. In any case if 3f 1 is too conservative then achieving 3f 1 means that a larger number of faults may be tolerated with no actual changes. On the other hand SHADOWS uses a linear MDS code e.g. a variant of Reed Solomon to achieve Byzantine agreement. . However SHADOWS uses coding theory rather than voting to implement Byzantine agreement. Thus Byzantine agreement among k out of n MASTERs on the same SHADOWS team is sufficient to tolerate f faults where f n k 2 and n k in the general case of f faulty and or malicious team members assuming that it is not known which f of the n MASTERs are faulty and or malicious. This means that for the case when f 1 then n 2 k.

If instead it is allowed that up to c MASTERs have simply crashed or failed to respond and it is known which ones these are then SHADOWS can tolerate a combination of up to c known crashed or unresponsive MASTERs and up to f faulty or malicious but unknown MASTERs where c 2f 

In a preferred embodiment a multiplicity of peers say n of them representing only a portion of the peers that are competent ready and willing to perform is responsible for a particular computation and consensus is required among at least k of them where k

Each of the n peers shares only one slice which means that the threshold value k which may vary with context determines how many correct slices and thus how many correct peers are required to reconstruct the consensus result. This technique which in a preferred embodiment is also used in other contexts contributes to Byzantine fault tolerance since up to n k faulty contributors can be ignored however the SELF and BOSS subsystems may take note of such failures .

In the case of each of the peers needing to know the consensus result each peer can simply share a single slice with the others and the specific slice to be shared is tied to the relative ordinal number of each peer within the set of n collaborating peers e.g. peer shares slice peer shares slice and so on up to peer n which shares slice n . Each peer digitally signs its slice so that recipients can verify whose it is i.e. that it was actually provided by the peer with which it is identified . Any peer that shares the wrong slice or a corrupted slice or fails to share a slice becomes included in the set of up to n k faulty contributors whose slice can be ignored during this round of computation but the responsible peer is noted of course . Once a peer has received at least k 1 of the possible n slices from the other peers or k slices if the peer doesn t have its own slice then the consensus result can be independently reconstructed locally without further communication.

The use of this method while not avoiding the intended redundancy of computation does eliminate unnecessary communications overhead. Instead of each peer sharing a copy of the computational result or alternatively a copy of a digest of the computational result for a total of n copies each peer shares only a fraction 1 n of a copy that has been enlarged slightly to n k of its original size so that in the aggregate only one copy is shared at most and that copy is n k of its original size where n k 1 . Each slice is appropriately encrypted and digitally signed by each sending peer prior to distributing it to the other peers in order to assure accountability. Consensus can be reached despite the Byzantine failure of up to n k peers.

The use of this method is a tremendous benefit where one or more authorized third party entities needs a consensus result from say n peers that are collectively providing a service and the third parties not only need to know that consensus is reached but also what the actual result is. The particulars of the method are the same as those stated above except that each peer also sends one or more suitably encoded encrypted etc. slices of the consensus result to the authorized third parties.

In cases involving non local communications the communications mechanisms and current operational profile are fundamentally tied to the level of redundancy required as are the encryption mechanisms so the same exact slice used for consensus is not sent to the third party but rather each peer creates a new set of n slices from its own unencrypted slice of the consensus result and these are FEC encoded with a systematic n k code such that any k of the n slices where k 

For example based on the current levels of network congestion between itself and the destination third parties one peer may independently decide to send 20 slices to a third party such that any 15 slices is sufficient to reconstruct the sender s original slice of the consensus result. If there are 4 channels to be used for the transmission for example the sender may opt to split the slices up among the available channels such that each channel handles a few of the slices according to its individual data rate congestion reliability etc. The same principles apply however and consequently the authorized third party entities need only to receive any legitimate k of n slices from a given sender to reconstruct that sender s single slice of the consensus result. Further the authorized third party entities need only to reconstruct legitimate slices from any k of n senders to reconstruct the original consensus result.

In general SHADOWS native processes do not push data around as loads are shifted and requests are made etc. Instead IDs are pushed around and if a process actually needs the associated data it can request it on a pull basis or if there are no other operands just forward the request to the team that owns the data resources permitting . The act of pushing an ID however has the effect of putting the team owning the associated data on notice that it may be needed soon essentially identifying the ID as a speculative prefetch opportunity.

In its simplest form a SHADOWS native process has an input queue and an output queue as depicted in one the left. Ignoring security issues the input queue accepts tuples of the form TxID Operand ID List performs the work of the process which is to generate one or more Result IDs then enqueue them into output queue for distribution. The transaction id TxID ties the Operand IDs received as input to the Result IDs associated with the processing results.

Under the covers of a SHADOWS native process however there are actually a number of latency hiding asynchronous parallel processes whose purpose is to keep a simple process busy doing actual work for as long as there are queued up requests. This is depicted in one the right.

In a preferred embodiment as depicted in the input queue accepts tuples of the form TxID Operand ID List. An interior process immediately fires off requests for the actual data associated with the Operand IDs requesting the teams that have the specific data to send it along to a specific destination team which may be the current team or some other one . A message may also sent to the specified destination team to put it on notice that data for the particular TxID may soon be arriving since unexpected data may trigger defensive behavior .

When the data is retrieved by the team that owns it it may be sent to the specified destination team thus for a given TxID the outbound message and the inbound message are unlikely to occur on the same machine unless the sender of specifically wishes to receive and process the data within its own team for some reason. When the specified destination team collects the operands and stores them in RAM it may then enqueue process descriptors including pointers to the operand data in RAM into the input queue of the embedded simple process. The simple process may later dequeue the process descriptor and associated data perform its process and enqueue the raw results to its output queue. A postprocessor may dequeue the raw results in order to create one or more digests of the results thereby generating one or more Result IDs. The Result IDs and raw data may be pushed to the appropriate teams i.e. to the owners stewards based on the Result IDs and then a tuple TxID Operand ID List Result ID List or equivalent may be enqueued to the output queue .

Each MASTER may have its own viewpoint of the entire system based on its own local statistics and a global i.e. non local statistical summary of the rest of the system so that it may think globally but act locally. Statistics may be summarized into simple percentiles a preferred embodiment may use quartiles such that any statistic may be summarized in just four states requiring just two bits for the purpose of decision making . Each MASTER may communicate its local statistics to its immediate neighbors both periodically and whenever a state change occurs. In a preferred embodiment the neighboring MASTERs may individually calculate the statistics for their neighborhood and communicate them upward to a higher aggregation level. In an alternate embodiment the neighboring MASTERs may take turns rolling up the statistics for their neighborhood and communicating them upward to a higher aggregation level.

A systems thinking diagram as depicted in may help teach how each MASTER s work scheduling decision making may be influenced by the forces associated with the current values of the key system variables involved in load balancing decisions. In the diagram the arrows marked with S represent forces or trends that may cause one system variable to affect another in the same direction i.e. the pointed to variable may be influenced to go up or down as the other one does . Likewise the arrows marked with O represent forces or trends that may cause one system variable to affect another in the opposite direction i.e. the pointed to variable may tend to go down if the other one goes up or up if the other one goes down . Systems thinking diagrams are often characterized by the presence of loops each of which may be either a balancing loop which tends to be very stable like the way a thermostat works or a reinforcing loop which tends to result in runaway behavior like the unwanted feedback in a public address system . In the figure the four quadrants each comprise a self stabilizing balancing loop B B B and B . By design there are no reinforcing loops that could cause runaway behavior.

In understanding the operational description that follows it may be useful to know that cooperating MASTERs in the SHADOWS infrastructure may volunteer to do work thus making themselves eligible to be delegated to by other MASTERs. Any MASTER may delegate work to any volunteer without requiring further permission. Volunteers who receive temporary overloads may re delegate the work if authorized or push it back or ignore it which is effectively equivalent to crashing which may be noticed by the delegator .

MASTERs may also delegate work to SLAVEs and or SERVANTs but only those for which they are responsible.

Given any resource capacity of interest e.g. processing capacity memory capacity storage capacity energy capacity etc. two of the system variables driving resource balancing are the AverageLocalNodeUtilization and the AverageNonLocalUtilization which are themselves driven in the same direction as the level of local or non local resource demands respectively i.e. if demand increases utilization tends to increase also and vice versa . Utilization Examples A utilization of 100 means that the node is operating exactly at the desired utilization goal which may be somewhat less than its raw capacity whereas 70 means that its capacity is underutilized by 30 . Likewise 150 means that 50 more work is queued at the node than it was intended to handle all at once. It could still be accomplished eventually but service level agreements SLAs might not be met and customer satisfaction might suffer. An average utilization that continually exceeds 100 is one indication that system capacity should be increased.

For simplicity in the following discussion we ll conceptually aggregate all of a node s resources into the concept of a relative workload capacity the ratio of the local node s capacity to accomplish requested work compared to the average capacity of the other nodes. The capacity of the local node and or any combination of other nodes can be increased by scaling up i.e. increasing the capacity of an individual node . The aggregate capacity of the other nodes i.e. any nodes other than the local one under consideration can also be increased by scaling out i.e. by adding more nodes . Changes in local and or nonlocal capacity tend to drive the their node utilizations in the opposite direction e.g. increasing local node capacity tends to decrease local node utilization . We ll use the AverageLocalNodeUtilization and the AverageNonLocalUtilization variables to represent their respective resource utilizations. We can then define an important dependent variable we ll call LocalNodeRelativeWorkload i.e. the node s workload as a percentage compared to what other nodes are currently experiencing on average . The LocalNodeRelativeWorkload is calculated as AverageLocalNodeUtilization AverageNonLocalUtilization 1 100

Thus a LocalNodeRelativeWorkload value of 20 means that the local workload is 20 above the average workload of the other nodes i.e. excluding itself whereas 20 means that the local workload is 20 below the average of the other nodes. This percentage can then be compared to the current percentile or quartile etc. thresholds in order to classify the workload of the local node relative to the other nodes. In a preferred embodiment one goal is to determine which load category the local node fits best such that one of four values which requires 2 bits to represent can be assigned for classification purposes e.g. Very Heavily loaded Heavily Loaded Lightly Loaded Very Lightly Loaded . While any eligible node can be delegated to those with the lightest load may receive a statistically larger fraction of any delegated work and those with the heaviest load may receive the smallest fraction and possibly zero . Workload adaptation is continuous but enjoys relatively low overhead due to the hysteresis induced by basing local adaptation decisions on relative workload and by classifying the relative workload into a small number of statistical categories that correlate well with the actions to be taken.

Two additional dependent variables are the LocalWillingnessToVolunteer and the Local WillingnessToDelegate both of which are intuitively related to the relative workload.

Volunteering The trend of the local node s willingness to volunteer to take on additional load LocalWillingnessToVolunteer is opposite the trend of LocalNodeRelativeWorkload . Thus if a local node s relative workload increases then its willingness to volunteer decreases and vice versa. Over time i.e. there s a delay any change in the local node s volunteer efforts may also drive its average utilization AverageLocalNodeUtilization in the same direction increased volunteering may increase its own utilization and vice versa . However over time the local node s volunteer efforts may also drive the utilization of the other i.e. non local nodes in the opposite direction. The more that the local node volunteers to do the work of other nodes the less work the other nodes have to do which decreases their utilization and vice versa.

Delegation The trend of the local node s willingness to delegate part of its workload is in the same direction as the trend of LocalNodeRelativeWorkload . Thus if a local node s relative workload increases then its willingness to delegate increases and vice versa. Over time i.e. there s a delay any change in the local node s delegation efforts may also drive its average utilization in the opposite direction increased delegation may decrease its own utilization and vice versa . However over time the local node s volunteer efforts may also drive the utilization of the other i.e. non local nodes in the same direction. The more that the local node delegates its work to other nodes the more work the other nodes have to do which increases their utilization and vice versa.

The virtual machine VM sandboxes and software layers depicted in have been or could be implemented in any of several open source and or commercially available virtual memory environments. Types of Software to Execute Contributed open source services outsourced services experimental services customer applications applications under test commercial and other third party applications. Note Each VM sandbox is configured to exactly meet the approved resource needs of a particular application which may vary according to function level of trust priority etc. The working set of a typical VM sandbox ranges from 50 KB to 100 MB but will normally be well under 1 MB. Thousands of sandboxes can be supported on each host CPU e.g. on each MASTER CPU or SLAVE CPU in . .

Examples of systems that may be tailored to the SLAVE PUMP or in a straightforward manner include the open source software Xen now a part of Linux OpenVZ and others as well as the experimental software Denali and its variants from the University of Washington both of which are well suited to Unix Linux and various BSD environments.

The key novel capabilities introduced by interfacing to the SLAVE PUMP or rather than to traditional computer hardware include 

In each OctoPlexer has ten 16 bit HT channels 8 bit channels are optional for SLAVEs . HT SLAVE I O is 8 bit or 16 bit. HT MASTER I O is 16 bit. In dual OctoPlexers use 1 channel to connect to each other. Dual 8 or 16 bit SLAVE I O HT channels one per OctoPlexer link each SLAVE CPU to the OctoPlexers . A 16 bit HT channel connects each MASTER PUMP to an OctoPlexer . and depict an embodiment with each HT to PCIe bridge having four ports A B C D of 4 channel PCI Express connected via 16 bit HT channel to a MASTER PUMP having 16 bit HT channels connecting it to OctoPlexers one per OctoPlexer .

Each PUMP or typically implements at least two inter PUMP HT links . Ideally these are 32 bit HT links but may be 16 bit or 8 bit if PUMP I O pins are insufficient. In PUMP is distinguished in that it terminates both ends of the PUMP PUMP PUMP daisy chain while the other PUMPs each implement an HT tunnel with a cave for each PUMP s local functions . Thus for example in the diagrams of and one of PUMP s links connects to PUMP and the other to PUMP . PUMP and PUMP also connect to each other. In theory the number of unbridged PUMPs or is limited primarily by requirements of the type of bus daisy chain chosen e.g. HT is currently limited to 31 devices .

Each of PUMPs or also emulates at least one HT tunnel with a cave for PUMP functions between a pair of HT links connected to pairs of corresponding processors represented in as a pair of MASTERs and multiple pairs of SLAVEs . In HT links are Coherent HT of 16 bit width with 8 bit width optional links are Non Coherent HT with Coherent HT optional and of 16 bit width with 8 bit width optional links are Non Coherent HT with Coherent HT optional and of 32 bit width with 16 bit width optional links are like links but targeted to optional on board devices links are proprietary CCB ClearSpeed ClearConnect Bus HT links are to external interfaces possibly vendor specific and or proprietary such as proprietary CRAY SeaStar communications devices links implement 4 independent PCIe switch fabric links each with a channel of 4 PCIe lanes with each fabric having dual redundant switches North West and North East . Here PUMP is shown with only one pair of processor to PUMP HT links for the MASTER processors plus a ClearSpeed ClearConnect Bus interface whereas the other PUMPs are depicted with two pairs of processor to PUMP HT links two pairs of SLAVE CPUs per PUMP are hoped for . Ideally these processor to PUMP HT links are 16 bit but could be 8 bit if PUMP I O pins are insufficient 16 bit processor to PUMP HT links are more important to PUMP than to the other PUMPs .

In general when only one coherent i.e. cache coherent inter processor HT link is available on each processor such as in a 2 way Opteron configuration depicted in that link is connected directly to a PUMP or rather than to its mating processor . The PUMP or may then emulate each processor s or mating processor or . This allows each processor or to see all of the PUMP s or memory as belonging to the other processor or . Since the PUMPs or collaborate their collective memory is sharable among all the connected processors or regardless of which PUMP or each processor or connects to. Local non PUMP processor memory is sharable between directly connected processors only if the links or connecting them are coherent otherwise such processors or are connected only for I O and inter processor message passing.

Note Given a pair of SLAVE CPUs say such as and of for example one of the processors could be replaced by a specialized processor adhering to the processor s bus protocol. Examples may include replacing an AMD Opteron processor with a DRC or XtremeData coprocessor. Such a coprocessor would have the same access to memory as the replaced processor.

Ideally all PUMP devices or within a node or module are identical at least in hardware part number if not design. Failing that PUMP MASTER may be unique and all others SLAVE CPUs . . . must be identical.

In a preferred embodiment PUMP MASTER PUMP is associated with the MASTER processors which are responsible for module initialization etc.

In a preferred embodiment a SCRAM node is composed of 1 to 4 fully connected quadrants each quadrant contains 4 lobes and controls up to 8 optional blades discussed elsewhere in any combination and each blade is fully connected to each lobe in the corresponding quadrant. Each lobe comprises a number of means whose conceptual interaction is depicted in . In a preferred embodiment one or more of the blocks depicted as optional blades also are implemented internally i.e. within a lobe in a non bladed manner so that the specific means are also built into the lobe and provide the corresponding capability inherently.

In a preferred embodiment as depicted in a MASTER CPU or SMP works cooperatively and symbiotically with a MASTER PUMP via a direct communication path for example HyperTransport . The MASTER role assigned to the MASTER PUMP differentiates it from any SLAVE PUMPs . The MASTER PUMP transparently communicates with the SLAVE PUMP by way of the CPU SMP or the PEERS fabric i.e. transparent to both of them . The MASTER CPU or SMP typically has a multiplicity of volatile DRAM memory channels preferably SECDED or Chipkill ECC that it makes partly available to the MASTER PUMP e.g. some memory is set aside for local use and some is allocated to the MASTER PUMP . The MASTER PUMP has a multiplicity of non volatile high reliability low power local memory channels that it makes partly available e.g. as a block device to the MASTER CPU or SMP . The multi channel memory controllers in the MASTER CPU SMP also belong to the PUMP which allocates capacity and bandwidth between CPU and PUMP memory.

In a preferred embodiment a MASTER CPU or SMP works cooperatively and symbiotically with one or more SLAVE PUMPs via a direct communication path for example HyperTransport . The SLAVE role assigned to the SLAVE PUMP differentiates it from the MASTER PUMP . Each SLAVE PUMP typically has a multiplicity of SLAVE CPU SMP devices associated with it and that are entirely dependent on the SLAVE PUMP for all non local input output. In a preferred embodiment each SLAVE PUMP emulates any devices required to bootstrap each of its dependent SLAVE CPU SMP devices and well as all communications and storage devices so that all aspects of the software execution environment for the SLAVE CPU SMP devices are under control of the SLAVE PUMP which is acting on behalf of the cooperative pairing of MASTER CPU or SMP and MASTER PUMP . Each SLAVE CPU SMP device typically has a multiplicity of volatile DRAM memory channels preferably SEC DED or Chipkill ECC that is entirely available to the SLAVE PUMP which is acting on behalf of the cooperative pairing of MASTER CPU or SMP and MASTER PUMP . The multi channel memory controllers of the SLAVE CPU SMPs belong to the SLAVE PUMPs the MASTER PUMP delegates to the SLAVE PUMPs which allocate capacity and bandwidth between local CPU memory and PUMP memory. Some memory is set aside for local use by SLAVE CPU SMP devices and some is allocated to the MASTER PUMP which may delegate it back to its various SLAVE PUMP devices in any allocation. In general the various CPU SMP devices and use local memory and respectively in traditional ways. However because the local memory is limited to SECDED or Chipkill ECC and the latter is costly it is well known in the art that high density DRAM cannot be relied upon for data held in memory long term if even there is no risk of power failure due to the relatively high single event upset SEU probability leads to an accumulation of uncorrectable errors. Thus in a preferred embodiment only a portion of the potentially large DRAM capacity is allocated for local memory use and only to processors whose processes are fault tolerant to an appropriate degree e.g. checkpointed and or executed redundantly . The remainder of the DRAM capacity is allocated to the various PUMP devices and which construct a multiplicity of very high speed virtual block storage devices see from aggregations of the corresponding memory channels using a suitable n k FEC to encode and decode block data stored into and retrieved from the virtual block storage devices. For example if commodity AMD64 CPUs are used for all CPU SMP devices and and if there is one MASTER CPU or SMP and four SLAVE CPU SMP devices and each CPU has dual channel memory configuration then there are ten 10 memory channels averaging 3.2 GB second each with low end memory devices for a maximum aggregate rate of about 32 GB second. In this configuration for example an with n k FEC code where n 10 and k 8 would yield an effective throughput of about 25 GB second 80 of 32 GB second and any 8 of 10 channels would be adequate to preserve data integrity in other words any two memory channels or an entire CPU with both its channels could fail entirely and yet no data loss would occur in the virtual block device . For performance all FEC encoding and decoding would occur in the various PUMP devices and which would be typically implemented in reconfigurable logic structured ASICs or other hardware implementation. In a preferred embodiment FEC encoding is similarly applied to remote non colocated memory systems such that communications can be used to combine n k FEC codes advantageously for example a local code could combine with a remote code to create a code that would preserve data integrity as long as any 16 of the 20 channels were available . In a preferred embodiment FEC encoding is similarly applied to the hard disk storage devices in the system as well as to the non hard disk storage devices in the system for example a large number of USB flash memory or SD flash memory devices such as those accessible via PEERS Packet Engines Enabling Routing Switching and via the various outrigger blades .

In a preferred embodiment of a CHARM Lobe one or more of the means collectively labeled here as Blades also are implemented internally i.e. within a lobe in a non bladed manner so that the specific means are also built into the lobe and provide the corresponding capability inherently.

In a preferred embodiment as depicted in HyperTransport HT is used to create a system bus for connecting a MASTER CPU or SMP comprising at least 3 HT links with a MASTER PUMP and two SLAVE PUMPs . The MASTER CPU or SMP is responsible for initializing the various HT devices it can reach up to any non transparent bridges as well as any bridged non HT devices such may be attached to or reached via the PEERS fabrics up to any non transparent bridges. The PEERS fabrics depicted in comprise a multiplicity of HyperTransport HT and PCI Express PCIe packet engines implementing HT tunnels HT PCIe bridges and PCIe switches. In this embodiment each fabric includes 96 PCIe lanes for I O to PEERS in other lobes plus non PCIe channels to local storage I O devices and LANs. Each fabric of each lobe connects to each of 8 blades with 4 PCIe links so each blade is connected via 32 PCIe links 4 links to each of 4 lobes over 2 separate fabrics . In a preferred embodiment the MASTER CPU or SMP has a multiplicity of volatile DRAM memory channels preferably with SECDED or Chipkill ECC that can be accessed by the PUMP devices and as appropriate via the HT links. The MASTER PUMP has a multiplicity of non volatile high reliability low power DRAM memory channels that it makes partly available e.g. as a block device via any of its HT links in a preferred embodiment the MASTER PUMP has includes at least four such links 2 tunneled and 2 bridged . Each SLAVE PUMP implements an HT tunnel plus 5 extra non transparent bridged HT links for communicating with SLAVE CPUs additional PUMPs and other I O devices. Assuming each SLAVE CPU SMP has a dual channel memory controller there are 16 SLAVE memory controllers whose capacity and bandwidth are allocated between local CPU memory and PUMP memory by the MASTER PUMP via the SLAVE PUMPs . Assuming the MASTER CPU SMP also has a dual channel memory controller there would be a total of 18 such channels. Although only a single MASTER PUMP is shown in each MASTER PUMP implements an HT tunnel plus one or two non transparent bridged HT links so multiple PUMPs can be easily deployed as needed.

In a preferred embodiment various combinations of single or multiple MASTER CPU or SMPs MASTER PUMPs SLAVE PUMPs and HT bridges which are implicit in the PEERS fabrics and Blades due to the presence of PCI Express up to the maximum number of addressable HT devices note that by design the number of SLAVE CPU SMP devices is not included in this count can be coupled together in a double ended daisy chain fashion. In the embodiment of there are four SLAVE CPU SMPs associated with each of the two SLAVE PUMPs for a total of eight SLAVE CPUs . The HT connection from MASTER PUMP to external interface optional is exemplary of a connection to a possibly vendor specific and or proprietary external interface such as any of a family of CRAY specific communications chips SeaStar SeaStar2 etc. designed to provide high performance communications between components of a supercomputing system. Note that the HT connection to external interface e.g. a CRAY SeaStar or some other bridged interface could alternatively originate at either or both of the SLAVE PUMPs rather than the MASTER PUMP any combination of available PUMP interfaces is feasible it could also alternatively originate at the MASTER CPU or SMP if a processor with 4 HT links is used or an SMP comprising at least a pair of 3 link CPUs is configured leaving at least one HT link free .

In a preferred embodiment a MASTER CPU or SMP works cooperatively and symbiotically with one or more SLAVE PUMPs via its direct HT paths for the primary purpose of implementing high performance computing cluster using slaved commodity processors e.g. the SLAVE CPU SMP devices which need not be homogeneous. Each of the SLAVE CPU SMP devices typically has or in any case is required to have only a single HT link if any and if none then is interfaced to a device that can supply at least one . Thus a key aspect of the SLAVE PUMP is its ability to directly interface to a multiplicity of HT devices having only singleton HT links and to provide communications with and among them and with other devices in the system as authorized without requiring the attached devices to have multiple HT links of their own which is normally required for HT based multiprocessor communication .

In a preferred embodiment the SLAVE PUMPs implement external interfaces comprising a 16 bit HT tunnel pair and at least five 16 bit non transparent bridged HT device ports which can either be internally switched such as with a crossbar switch or implemented internally as a set of connected HT tunnels where each non transparent HT device is simply an HT bridge with a tunnel and the tunnels are connected in series . In addition to the bridged HT device ports the SLAVE PUMP also implements an HT cave with its own functionality comprising logic internal local memory and input output queues all operating under the auspices of the cooperative pairing of MASTER CPU or SMP and MASTER PUMP .

In a preferred embodiment at least four of the five 16 bit non transparent bridged HT device ports can be alternatively implemented as eight 8 bit non transparent bridged HT device ports. In a preferred embodiment any internal HT tunnels and paths within the SLAVE PUMPs are of maximum width as of this writing the HT standard specifies a maximum width of 32 bits .

In a preferred embodiment the MASTER PUMP implements external interfaces comprising a 16 bit HT tunnel pair and at least one 16 bit bridged HT device port that can be configured as either a transparent or non transparent bridge depending on the intended use. In addition to the bridged HT device port the MASTER PUMP also implements an HT cave with its own functionality comprising logic internal local memory external local memory and input output queues all operating under the auspices of its cooperative pairing with the MASTER CPU or SMP .

In a preferred embodiment its adaptive transparent non transparent bridged HT device port can be alternatively implemented as two 8 bit adaptive transparent non transparent bridged HT device ports. In a preferred embodiment any internal HT tunnels and paths within the MASTER PUMP are of maximum width as of this writing the HT standard specifies a maximum width of 32 bits .

In an alternative embodiment relative to that depicted in Conceptual Interaction Diagram 1 the BOSS PUMP and MASTER PUMP pairings are implemented via a single CPU handling the BOSS MASTER functionality and a single FPGA or Structured ASIC handling both their respective PUMP functionalities. The SLAVE PUMP pairings are each implemented via a single CPU handling the SLAVE functionality and a single FPGA or Structured ASIC handling the corresponding PUMP functionality. In the embodiment of each SLAVE PUMP has ultra low power multi channel memory local to itself and each SLAVE CPU SMP is associated with its own SLAVE PUMP . The MASTER PUMP has ultra low power multi channel bulk non volatile memory local to the MASTER PUMP . The multi channel memory controllers of all the SLAVE CPU SMPs belong to the PUMP the MASTER PUMP delegates to the SLAVE PUMPs which allocate capacity and bandwidth between local CPU memory and PUMP memory.

Refer to . CHARM Lobe Alternate Embodiment with Broadcom HT2000 Conceptual Main PUMP with Gang of 3 Aux PUMPs 6 Octoplexers

In the particular embodiment of the CHARM Lobe includes four SLAVE modules . Each SLAVE module has one SLAVE PUMP and at least one SLAVE CPU or accelerator with at least two local DRAM channels comprising COTS SECDED or Chipkill ECC memory DIMMs typically 4 of them on the CPU and two ultra low power NVRAM channels comprising a non COTS CHARM array of F RAM MRAM and BB DRAM typically on the PUMP . An example F RAM MRAM configuration comprises a minimum of 18 F RAM and or MRAM devices two channels at a minimum of 9 devices per channel if SECDED ECC is used . An example BB DRAM configuration based on 8 GB increments with orthogonal ECC uses 72 device multiples of 128 MB mobile SDRAM. In the embodiment of the MASTER module and SLAVE modules each have dual redundant point of load POL DC power supplies typically from a 48VDC nominal source. The memory power control and battery may be incorporated in the lobe or off board but the DRAM array of each SLAVE module is individually switchable with the ability to zap or kill all memory devices and or content on demand for security.

In each processor each is designated here as either a MASTER or SLAVE has a relatively small but dedicated local memory that is closely matched to the needs of the specific processor or . For an Opteron processor a pair of dual channel DIMMs well matched to the clock rate would be anticipated.

Each PUMP has nine 9 parallel 72 bit ECC protected memory channels typically implemented with commodity DIMMs that lie at the economic sweet spot of performance capacity and price. When possible each PUMP supports at least a second bank for a total of 18 DIMMs accessible 9 at a time. On each access the 72 bits from each of the 9 DIMMs is corrected to 8 bytes 64 bits of data per DIMM. One bit from each such byte is used to form a second 72 bit ECC word 1 bit byte 8 bytes DIMM 9 DIMMs 72 bits which is then corrected to a 64 bit data word and this is done 8 times per access yielding a total of eight 8 orthogonally error corrected 64 bit words 64 bytes total per access. Note that 64 bytes is both the size of an Opteron cache line and the minimum payload in an HT packet. The internal PUMP buffers must handle blocks of at least 648 bytes 8 accesses of 9 channels at 9 bytes per channel netting out to 512 bytes of orthogonally error corrected data.

Each PUMP can deliver a 64 byte cache line refill in a single memory access using a single minimal HT packet. A multi line cache refill can require the same number of accesses as cache lines which provides a 4 throughput improvement over a dual channel memory configuration plus another dimension of error correction and the data still fits in a single HT packet. Since the processors mostly operate out of their own local dual channel memory banks there is a surplus of memory bandwidth and this is used to support accelerators within the PUMP or as well as accelerators connected to the PUMP such as the ClearSpeed chips e.g. CSX600 that connect via the ClearConnect Bus as depicted in and .

Each PUMP also has several banks of 72 bit ECC protected NVRAM e.g. MRAM FeRAM or F RAM etc. some of which are likely be implemented on stacked daughterboards attached to the CHARM module via stacking connectors 1 or 2 banks per stack . The appropriate buffer sizes depend on the typical currently available chips which for MRAM are currently limited to on the order of 128K 8 each so each bank would have a capacity on the order of 1 MB.

Because it need only be large enough for an appropriate working set each processor s local memory can be implemented with components that trade off density for speed while optimizing for the economic sweet spot. From the perspective of a processor s memory controller and or MMU this local memory is the processor s main memory or in the case of the Opteron processor a slice of it and it can serve this purpose well as long as it is significantly larger than the largest cache supporting it.

From the system s viewpoint however such processor local memory is just another cache level CPU matched dual channel pairs of high performance DIMMs are intended to serve somewhat like an external process local L3 cache or L4 cache if the CPU already has an actual L3 cache whereas the PUMP s memory better fulfills the role of main memory. In the case of coherent processor to PUMP HT links each processor or thinks the PUMP s memory belongs to a peer processor or so it can be accessed directly via HT bus requests. Otherwise virtual memory page faults in a processor s local but small physical memory can normally be satisfied from the PUMP s large aggregate physical memory e.g. like the aggregated blocks depicted in rather than from an actual disk the PUMP can emulate a paging disk of arbitrary size limited only by the overall memory and storage capacity of the entire distributed system .

The PUMP s NVRAM is a somewhat limited resource intended primarily for internal use by the PUMP logic to maintain metadata related to flash and disk based storage and to buffer critical data until it can be safely distributed and stored into a higher capacity distributed memory. For example the associative memory algorithm logic including the CHARM FASTpage logic resides in each PUMP. In particular the FASTpage logic uses NVRAM to persistently maintain the ternary search tree meta data and buffer updates to search tree memory pages before they re written to flash memory in a preferred embodiment flash is the primary storage media for persistent associative memory .

One bit of a CHARM object id is used to determine whether or not an object is immutable i.e. not mutable . An immutable object is one whose content cannot be changed for any reason .

Once an object becomes immutable it can never again be mutable. A mutuable object is essentially an incomplete work in progress once the work has been completed the object becomes immutable. For example transactional contributions from distributed processes building a search tree would all be targeted to the immutable object id of the tree being constructed the targeted immutable object id would be known to the distributed processes .

Mutable object ids are NOT reusable. After an object has become immutable the associated mutable object id is no longer valid except in an audit context and its use would be automatically detected as a security issue.

One bit of a CHARM object id is used to determine whether or not an object is transient i.e. not persistent . In this context transient means temporary and persistent means permanent and these terms may be used interchangeably.

1. Whenever an object id is needed for an intermediate result that need not be i.e. cannot be persistently stored.

2. Whenever an object id is needed for a persistent i.e. permanent result that may or may not already exist but in either case is not yet known. Any number of transient ids may be mapped to the same persistent id.

Transient ids are ultimately reusable but only after their previous use has been verifiably flushed from the system. Active transient ids are managed issued and revoked in large ish blocks to minimize overhead.

Legitimate uses exist for all four combinations of mutability and persistence but there are constraints on where the associated objects may be stored as indicated in Table 4 

Transient Mutable T P 0 M I 0 objects are used only for temporary discardable objects and can only be stored in volatile RAM CHARM cannot allow them to be stored in persistent storage including NVRAM . For security reasons all decrypted objects fall into this category no object can be stored in the clear ever which means that a first pass deletion of all in the clear objects can occur instantaneously by de powering i.e. removing the power from the volatile RAM where they re temporarily stored. In a preferred embodiment the memory is re powered after a brief period and at least secondary and tertiary passes through the volatile memory occur in order to write white noise patterns into the memory in keeping with the security assumptions stated elsewhere which anticipate the possibility that an attacker has significant state sponsored resources for accessing high value assets. More passes may be specified in the applicable security policy. .

Transient Immutable T P 0 M I 1 objects are really temporary aliases for Persistent Immutable T P 1 M I 1 objects whose object ids are not yet and might never be known locally. Such objects are kept in online NVRAM rather than RAM but cannot be stored in nearline storage. If the Persistent Immutable id becomes known locally it subsumes every occurrence of the Transient Immutable id which is immediately released. A Transient Immutable id may also be revoked without ever mapping it to a Persistent Immutable id. A bidirectional mapping is maintained such that given either the Transient Immutable object id or a Persistent Immutable object id the other s can be determined until such time as the Transient Immutable object id has been flushed from the system.

Persistent Mutable T P 1 M I 0 objects are those which are destined to become immutable but are not yet complete. Such objects are kept in online NVRAM rather than RAM but cannot be stored in nearline storage.

Persistent Immutable T P 1 M I 1 objects are those which are already complete and can never be changed. Each version of an externally supplied artifact for example has its own Persistent Immutable object id. Every Persistent Immutable object has a corresponding message digest that serves as its digital fingerprint. A bidirectional mapping is maintained such that given either the Persistent Immutable object id or the message digest the other can be determined.

Due to the thresholding and FEC scheme used only slices and slivers of pre compressed data are stored. As described below a slice is a fraction of the original data and a sliver is a fraction of a slice. 

Given an object or other data to be stored or communicated it can be divided up into k fractions of the whole such as k packets or k slices. In a preferred embodiment a cryptographic message digest its dna tag is computed for the object to be stored which may or may not be in the clear and then the object is compressed and encrypted at which point a second outer cryptographic message digest is computed for the encrypted result and concatenated to the encrypted result which concatenation then becomes the basis for the FEC encoding process described below by treating it as the original data and dividing it k ways i.e. into k slices. Thus reconstruction of this original data from its k slices or their FEC encoded siblings does not actually make the original in the clear data available but only a compressed encrypted and therefore still secure isomorphism of it. Successful reconstruction of the still encrypted data from its k slices can be verified only if the key used to generate the outer cryptographic message digest is known along with the length of the digest.

Given a systematic n k FEC code the original k slices of data are used to encode up to n redundant slices any k of which is sufficient to reconstruct the original data. Since a systematic n k code is used the original k slices which are included in the set of n slices are also sufficient to reconstruct the original data.

In a preferred embodiment no more than one slice of data from a single object is allowed to be stored on a particular device precluding the loss of more than one of an object s slices due to a single device failure or theft. Note that multiple slices each from a different object may be stored on each device without penalty.

In a preferred embodiment any node or device entrusted with a slice can further encode the data for sub distribution using an n k FEC code thereby encoding up to n redundant slivers any k of which is sufficient to reconstruct the original slice. Slivers are particularly useful for highly distributed nearline storage such as when data is distributed to non trusted devices PC based storage servers or any SERVANT or device running or emulating a SERVANT .

In a preferred embodiment no more than one sliver of data from a single object is allowed to be stored in a single data handling unit e.g. a disk sector file or record etc. precluding the loss of more than one of an object s slivers due to localized hard or soft failures e.g. bad disk sector corrupted file etc. .

The number of slices or slivers that can be co located in the same facility and or within a geographic region is constrained to be less than some policy specified threshold. Thus the capacity required on a particular device or at a particular facility is only a fraction of what would be required to store an arbitrary object.

As a performance enhancement but at the risk of decreased survivability depending on the exact configuration and policy specified thresholds SHADOWS nearline activities can include co locating slices of new versions of objects with slices of recent versions of the same objects by combining them into volumes or clusters. When a particular object is recalled from storage all or part of the corresponding sliver volume can be retrieved all at once it order to reduce latency especially in the case where the versions are related through reversible delta compression operations.

Note As a consequence of its FEC based slicing and associated constraints SHADOWS storage needs no separate disk defragging procedures.

In a preferred embodiment CHARM uses FEC forward error correction and specifically systematic codes such Reed Solomon RS Cauchy Reed Solomon CRS and or others with encoders and decoders implemented in software and or hardware. A key property of the systematic n k codes in CHARM is that given a set of n redundantly encoded data packets or other chunks of data any k of them are sufficient to decode and thereby reconstruct the original data k

If a Reed Solomon code variant or similar is used where n packets are generated and any k of them can enable reconstruction of the original data then the redundancy can be given as r n k and the code can support up to r erasures missing packets where it is known which packets are missing or r 2 errors where some packets are in error but which ones they are is unknown . In CHARM storage based data and data in transit tend to require only erasure correction because there are other means for identifying missing or corrupted packets whereas volatile memory based data tend to require full error detection.

In CHARM FEC is applied in multiple dimensions with different parameters as appropriate to the purpose and nature of the data which may differ for example among the various contexts associated with local vs. distributed data transient vs. persistent data mutable vs. immutable data data in transit vs. data at rest public data vs. private data etc. Other considerations and requirements may apply as well such as requisite levels of security integrity availability persistence survivability etc.

In general the higher the required levels of redundancy for a particular context the larger the value of n is likely to be relatively speaking. Also the higher the required levels of security for a particular context the larger the value of k is likely to be relative to a particular value of n where k

When using the known Luigi Rizzo FEC algorithms with 8 bit wide symbols i.e. a Galois Field GF p w where p 2 and w 8 as described by Rizzo in 1997 which implies a maximum of n p w 2 8 256 up to n 256 packets can be generated for any given chunk of data in such a way that any k packets out of the 256 is sufficient to reconstruct the original data.

Because Rizzo s algorithm is based on a systematic code the first k packets of the n 256 maximum can be directly aggregated to represent the original data without decoding. The remaining 256 k packets or n k packets in general contain redundant data in accordance with the selected FEC algorithm. If any of the first k packets are missing any packets from the remaining 256 k may be substituted but FEC decoding must occur in order to reconstruct the original data.

For decoding efficiency it is preferable to use only the original k packets if available thereby completely avoiding the FEC decoding algorithm. However left as is this would reduce security somewhat because data could be reconstructed with less effort by an attacker by not adding FEC decoding to the cryptographic burden .

The Scrutiny Pseudo Random Ordinals PRO encoding concept is to pseudo randomly distribute the original k packets among the n 256 packets. A key associated with but in a preferred embodiment distinct from the data s underlying security key can be used to seed a PRNG. When the key is known the ordinal positions of the k original packets can be determined directly allowing aggregation without the overhead of FEC decoding assuming all the original k packets are available .

The same technique can be applied to group the remaining 256 k packets according to accessibility locale storage level etc. . For example the next most accessible m packets can be distributed among the remaining 256 k packets in exactly the same way.

Note that the PRNG sequence generation algorithm must automatically skip over and not emit duplicate ordinals within a given sequence which implies that memory must be associated with sequence generation in order to keep track of which ordinals have been emitted . A Bloom filter would be excellent in this respect since it is both compact and relatively opaque which aids its resistance to analysis and attack yet the lack of a particular entry corresponding to a candidate ordinal is clear evidence that the candidate is not a duplicate of a previously occurring ordinal. The presence of a matching entry however is an indication that the candidate might be a duplicate of an ordinal that has occurred already so the candidate can simply be skipped in favor of a new candidate.

In the CHARM implementation of infinite precision floating point numbers each number is a transreal value and thus in addition to the set of integers and real numbers also includes infinity and NULL. In a preferred embodiment the implementation is further enhanced to include a small set of signed infinite precision symbolic constants such as pi and e along with a small set of others plus a means for referring to an extended set of mathematical and or scientific constants typically irrational numbers i.e. numbers which can only be written as a never ending non repeating decimal fraction and thus cannot be written in the form of a fraction where the numerator and denominator are both integers which are generally known in the art.

In a preferred embodiment the CHARM infinite precision floating point representation requires variable length word size on 1 byte boundaries with at least an 8 bit word 1 byte which may be represented as having bits numbered from 0 to 7 left to right. The first bit is the sign bit S the second bit is the exponent extension flag e the third bit is the exponent bit E the fourth bit is the fraction extension flag f and the final four bits are the fraction bits FFFF 

When f 1 the byte after the exponent extension if any begins a field of 1 or more fraction extension bytes unsigned LEB128 format .

When e 0 and E 0 the value of the exponent is 0 i.e. the fraction is also unnormalized and contains an integer value a single byte may contain the signed values 0 to 15 the sign bit applies .

When e 0 and E 1 E MAX and f 0 the value of the exponent is 0 and the fraction field FFFF represents special values the sign bit S differentiates all values and all FFFF field values except 0 and 1 are signed as follows 

When the FFFF field value is 0 the special value is NULL or Nullity unsigned when S 0 and Rational Number Indicator when S 1 ratio of integers to follow . Note Rational numbers can be represented by a ratio of integers i.e. a pair of numbers corresponding to a numerator and a denominator. The Rational Number Indicator byte indicates that a pair of numbers follows each of which is a variable length signed integer. .

When the FFFF field value is 1 the special value is RESERVED for OID Indicator when S 0 OID to follow and for BLOB Indicator when S 1 BLOB descriptor content to follow . Note An OID is a variable length value in a format somewhat similar to the numeric format. The E exponent field is replaced by a T type field and the F fractional field is replaced by an I identifier field. Specific field values are also different. In the case of a Perspex matrix the OID can be dereferenced resulting in a value compatible with the expected numeric value. A BLOB descriptor is a variable length value in a format somewhat similar to the numeric format followed by the described content . The E exponent field is replace by a T type field and the F fractional field is replaced by a C content field. Specific field values are also different. In the case of a Perspex matrix the BLOB content can be decoded resulting in a value compatible with the expected numeric value. .

When e 1 in the first byte then one or more of the following bytes contribute to the exponent where the first bit of each such byte indicates whether additional bytes are required and the other 7 bits of the byte are appended to the right of previous exponent bits beginning with the E bit in the first byte .

Likewise when f 1 in the first byte then one or more of the bytes following the exponent extension bytes if any contribute to the fraction where the first bit of each such byte indicates whether additional bytes are required and the other 7 bits of the byte are appended to the right of previous fraction bits beginning with the four F bits in the first byte .

If e 0 and E 1 and F is 0 and S is 0 then V Nullity Note Nullity is unsigned minus Nullity cannot occur. Nullity is something like NaN Not a number but better defined essentially a NULL value for numbers. .

If e 0 and E 1 and F is 0 and S is 1 then V the ratio of integers specified by the following number pair 

If e 0 and E 1 and F is 1 and S is 1 then V the value of the dereferenced BLOB descriptor and content 

If e 0 then V 1 S 2 E 1.F where 1.F is intended to represent the binary number created by prefixing F with an implicit leading 1 and a binary point.

If e 0 and E 0 and F is ZERO then V 0 regardless of S which is always normalized by masking it to 0 also 

Unlike the CHARM floating point format the IEEE double precision floating point standard representation prior art requires a 64 bit word which may be represented as numbered from 0 to 63 left to right. The first bit is the sign bit S the next eleven bits are the exponent bits E and the final 52 bits are the fraction F 

Whereas frequently occurring small values e.g. 15 to 15 require only 1 byte in the CHARM format 8 bytes are required in the IEEE double precision floating point format 4 bytes are required in the IEEE single precision format which is otherwise not discussed here . Furthermore whereas larger or less frequent values occupy only as many bytes as required for their actual representation in the CHARM format but as many bytes as are needed can be used including the representation of rational numbers the IEEE floating point format is fixed at 8 bytes regardless of whether 8 bytes is too many or not enough.

CHARM and particularly PUMP and CORE may include Perspex processing within its native capabilities. A Perspex matrix is a matrix of 16 numbers arranged in 4 rows and 4 columns that can be handled as a single operand with a minimum of 16 bytes 1 byte per number .

In the CHARM CORE implementation of Perspex each number in a Perspex matrix is a transreal value and thus in addition to the set of integers and real numbers must include infinity and nullity NULL in CHARM . The CHARM implementation is further enhanced to include a small set of signed infinite precision symbolic constants such as pi and e along with a small set of others plus a means for referring to an extended set of constants. The aforementioned math constants are generally known in the art.

In a preferred embodiment a unique code value is assigned to every unique textual word occurring within selected lexicons anywhere in the system and the code assigned is determined by word length and frequency of occurrence.

In a preferred embodiment word codes and phrase codes are used to maximize internal compression and throughput.

4. The first 16 384 128 two byte codes are reserved for the most frequently occurring lowercase dictionary words that are three characters or longer.

5. The remaining 16 384 two byte codes are reserved for the most frequently occurring case variations as encountered of dictionary words that are three characters or longer and already encoded.

7. The next 1 048 512 three byte codes are reserved for the most frequently occurring lowercase dictionary and corpus words that are three characters or longer and not already encoded.

8. The remaining 1 048 512 three byte codes are reserved for the most frequently occurring but not yet encoded case variations as encountered of dictionary and corpus words that are three characters or longer and already encoded.

9. The first half of the 268 435 456 four byte codes the first half of the 34 359 738 368 five byte codes and the first half of each distinct length of the successive multi byte codes are reserved for additional lowercase words in arbitrary order as they re encountered for instance .

10. The second half of the 268 435 456 four byte codes the second half of the 34 359 738 368 five byte codes and the second half of each distinct length of the successive multi byte codes are reserved for the most frequently occurring but not yet encoded case variations as encountered of dictionary and corpus words that are three characters or longer and already encoded.

12. Canonical entries i.e. lowercase words are defined by their code the associated text string and a list of non canonical entries.

13. Non canonical entries i.e. mixed case and uppercase words are defined by their code the code of the associated canonical entry and a variable length bit pattern LEB128 that defines which characters need to be uppercase one case bit per text character .

In a preferred embodiment a MASTER processor assigns virtualized computing storage and communications resources to a set of SLAVE processors over which it has authority and HANDLER Host Abstraction for Named Devices Layered Executable Resources logic in the PUMP implements the physical interfaces of these resources.

In a preferred embodiment the HANDLER interfaces and logic are implemented within the SLAVE PUMP devices to which the SLAVE processors are attached such that the HANDLER hardware provides functionality similar to a software based isolation kernel. In a preferred embodiment the HANDLER s hardware implementation supports dedicated per process registers and FIFO devices that enable user space input output without system call overhead within the security constraints set by the MASTER .

In a preferred embodiment of the CHARM PUMP subsystem memory accessible by the PUMP and via the PUMP can be protected by the PUMP s ability to maintain complementary states in memory a technique where memory locations are invisibly toggled to and from their complementary states such that each state has a duty cycle of approximately 50 which means that an adversary gaining physical access cannot determine previous contents after a power off .

In a preferred embodiment the FASTpage process is implemented in hardware as a CORE engine within one or more PUMP devices and also in software that executes on MASTER SLAVE and SERVANT processors. In a preferred embodiment of SHADOWS the FEC codecs are implemented as part of the CORE functions embedded in the PUMP devices. While all the CHARM algorithms can be implemented in software in a preferred embodiment they are also implemented in hardware in the CHARM PUMP.

As noted in the earlier description of the multi channel memory controllers in the MASTER CPU SMP belong to the PUMP which allocates capacity and bandwidth between CPU and PUMP memory the multi channel memory controllers of all the SLAVE CPU SMPs belong to the SLAVE PUMPs the MASTER PUMP delegates to the SLAVE PUMPs which allocate capacity and bandwidth between local CPU memory and PUMP memory. As noted in the earlier description of virtual memory page faults in a processor s local but small physical memory can normally be satisfied from the PUMP s large aggregate physical memory e.g. like the aggregated blocks depicted in rather than from an actual disk the PUMP can emulate a paging disk of arbitrary size limited only by the overall memory and storage capacity of the entire distributed system .

Access to the PUMP s aggregated memory regions can occur through DMA PIO messaging etc. either as virtualized system main memory or as high speed working storage but is always presented as an aggregate to a processor or through action of a PUMP or not shown . Available resources need not be equally allocated to the various processors as depicted in by the allocation delta . Also although each processor is depicted as having its own allocation that need not be the case. There could also be one or more shared allocations or some combination of shared and private allocations . Each allocation can be encrypted or in the clear.

The high speed working storage of is presented to a processor by the PUMP or not shown . The speed latency is affected by proximity of the memory controllers involved and the HT paths involved. The PUMP function is not restricted to a particular interface or other means of allocating memory and making it available to processors or for its own use . For example a PUMP can present a disk storage block device interface a malloc style heap allocation interface or both or something else entirely. Whatever interfaces are presented or emulated they would continue to be available even in the face of multiple processor and or memory channel failures up to the limits of the erasure code rate then in use and that rate can be changed dynamically to reflect a new post failure configuration .

Any number of processors and associated memory channels may participate and they need not be homogeneous to any particular degree nor do they need to be co located. Thus processors may differ in type ECC support memory channel count and or width etc. as well as location. However all these factors bear on both performance and survivability of stored information.

This particular implementation assumes the use of a processor configuration including at least 2 external HyperTransport interfaces available 1 for each of the 2 independent switch fabrics . Any AMD Opteron processor trivially meets this requirement. However a nearly identical configuration can be achieved with a single external HyperTransport interface meaning that any processor with a HyperTransport interface may do not just an AMD Opteron as long as the HyperTransport bridge chips selected e.g. the nVidia chips in the implementation above implement a HyperTransport tunnel dual bi directional interfaces on the bridge chip like and so they can be daisy chained . In this example a pair of nVidia n3600 chips are already daisy chained for each fabric so a processor with only one HyperTransport link would require the same number of chips but with all four of them two pairs in the same daisy chain.

Many variants of this PEERS implementation are possible including the use of entirely different components and alternative connections and numbers of connections at its external interfaces but there are a number of distinctive features that are common to an acceptable PEERS implementation and these are noted in section 8.3.2.

Logically each lobe has a PEERS switching routing fabric but in a preferred embodiment there are actually several redundant fabrics working together in an active active configuration. In a preferred embodiment each lobe has at least a dual fabric working in conjunction with other lobes and quadrants that also have at least a dual fabric.

There are at least two independent PEERS switching fabrics servicing a particular Lobe s processor PUMP configuration. In a preferred embodiment HyperTransport is used to connect the processor PUMP configuration to each PEERS fabric which is primarily PCI Express PCIe to simplify off board switching and routing of input output IO so the primary connection to PEERS is via one or more HyperTransport Bridge Tunnel interface chips which connect directly to the processor s and PUMP s . Each HyperTransport interface is bidirectional and also double ended allowing configuration and control from either end .

In the configuration of a representative pair of nVidia n3600 chips is daisy chained to achieve a sufficient number of bridged HyperTransport to PCIe connections 56 lanes for each fabric. The particular chip pair also includes additional IO 12 SATA lanes 4 GBE ports and 20 USB ports that improve the economics of the system by being available for free and thereby eliminating the need for some chips that may otherwise be needed.

The 12 SATA lanes from each fabric 24 lanes total are distributed not shown here to the 8 Outrigger Blade positions as follows 4 distinguished blade positions each receive a set of 4 lanes i.e. from each of 4 lobes for a total of 16 lanes per distinguished blade position and all 8 blade positions each receive 1 lane i.e. from each of 4 lobes for a total of 4 lanes in any blade position . This supports a low cost configuration with 8 JBOD just a bunch of disks storage blades where all 8 blades can each have 4 high capacity full size 3.5 SATA drives or alternatively 4 can have 4 full size SATA drives and 4 can have 16 small form factor 2.5 SATA drives.

Each of the 4 GBE ports is connected to a separate 5 port GBE switch chip not shown with 1 such chip for each of the 4 lobes in a quadrant leaving unused switch port which is then provided as an external port. This allows all 4 lobes in a quadrant to invisibly monitor and share the load for each external GBE port and each quadrant externalizes such ports 1 per lobe .

The 20 USB ports on each pair of nVidia n3600 chips are distributed to a set of 20 internal USB connectors that provide low latency access to cheap flash based storage. Up to four PCIe PCI X bridges e.g. PEX 8114 account for 8 PCIe lanes from the pair of nVidia n3600 chips in each fabric.

Each of the bridges supports 4 NEC mPD720101 USB 2.0 host controllers each of which provides a root hub with 5 downstream facing ports for a total of 80 additional USB ports per fabric or 160 additional USB ports per lobe. For modularity each set of 80 additional USB ports would typically be on a separate PCB would could be optionally omitted from a particular configuration say to achieve cost savings .

By default the CHARM technology discussed elsewhere stores only fractional compressed encrypted FEC encoded data on each flash drive and disk drive using multiple lobes and quadrants plus external nodes to distribute the information.

In each fabric of a preferred embodiment 16 PCIe lanes from the pair of nVidia n3600 chips 8 from each chip are connected to a PCIe switch e.g. PEX 8548 whose primary purpose is to provide an 8 lane communications path to each of the 3 other lobes in the same quadrant that the lobe under discussion is in. A reserve of 8 additional PCIe lanes is provided and may be flexibly configured as needed using 1 to 4 ports e.g. 8x1 4x2 4x1 2x2 2x4 4x1 1x3 1x4 etc. . There is one such PCIe switch for each of the lobe s switch fabrics.

In each fabric of a preferred embodiment 16 PCIe lanes from 1 chip in the pair of nVidia n3600 chips i.e. all 16 lanes from 1 chip are connected to a PCIe switch e.g. PEX 8548 whose purpose is to provide a 4 lane communications path to the 4 other lobes in each of the 2 other quadrants for a total of 8 lobes . There is 1 such PCIe switch for each of the lobe s switch fabrics.

In each fabric of a preferred embodiment 16 bidirectional PCIe lanes from 1 chip in the pair of nVidia n3600 chips i.e. all 16 lanes from 1 chip are connected to a PCIe switch e.g. PEX 8548 whose purpose is to provide a 4 lane communications path to each of the 8 Outrigger Blades that share the same quadrant the as the lobe under discussion. There is one such PCIe switch for each of the lobe s switch fabrics. In this preferred embodiment then each of the 8 Outrigger Blades is therefore directly connected to each of the four lobes in the same quadrant via a 4 lane communications path on each of the lobe s switch fabrics. Given just 2 switch fabrics as depicted above this means each blade has 16 lanes 4 lanes to each lobe on each of 2 fabrics for a total of 32 bidirectional lanes. At this writing readily available parts allow for a rate of 2.5 Gbps in each direction per lane aggregating to a 32 lane total of 80 Gbps 8 GB second in each direction per Outrigger Blade. In the relatively near term this can double to a per blade total of 160 Gbps 16 GB second each way as the newest PCIe standard 5 Gbps per lane is implemented and deployed and this embodiment may likely enjoy further speed increases over time. Note that the per lane PCIe rates described in this paragraph also apply everywhere else that PCIe is named .

In a preferred embodiment HyperTransport is used to connect the processor PUMP configuration and in each lobe to at least one external interface chip e.g. CRAY Seastar or Seastar2 etc. which may be vendor specific and or proprietary and which may be used to interconnect any number of SCRAM nodes with each other and or with other systems. In the case of one or more SCRAM nodes acting in the role of an intelligent storage server for example to a much larger CRAY supercomputer in a preferred embodiment a minimum of four SeaStar based interfaces would be available per quadrant and each would offer 6 high speed links with a sustained bidirectional throughput of 6 GB second by comparison a fast FC link such as a SAN interface is 4 Gbps which is more than an order of magnitude slower .

As depicted in the 4 interfaces labeled A B C D on each of the Quadrant 1 modules are available with COTS hardware on a single chip system I O controller or such as the Broadcom HT 2100 . In the preferred embodiment at least four independent switch fabrics are desired with 4 or more aggregated links to each fabric. Although fewer or more links and fabrics can be used a minimum of 4 provides robustness and enables graceful degradation in the case of hardware faults or failures. In the figure above each line depicted between the blocks represents either 4 or 8 aggregated links.

For the purposes of both incremental cost scalability and graceful degradation in the preferred embodiment the design is intentionally partitioned in such a way that adding modules to the system also increases the capacity for communication among the modules. This is accomplished by ensuring that the necessary fraction of the total capacity is directly available on each module in contrast with the usual practice of placing the switching fabric on its own modules. Although the wiring of the switch fabric is more complex especially between the North and South switches than would be otherwise necessary in the preferred embodiment the complexity can be relegated to an entirely passive wiring harness flex circuit or PCB.

The HT 2100 has 24 PCIe links with support for up to 5 PCIe controllers and can thus offer up to 5 independent ports of which only 4 are needed in the preferred embodiment. Two controllers would each aggregate 8 PCIe links and two would each aggregate 4 PCIe links using a total of 24 links out of 24 possible but only 4 of the 5 available controllers.

The 4 interfaces labeled A B C D above correspond to the 4 PCIe controllers to be used such as 4 of the 5 available on an HT 2100 and would each comprise either 4 or 8 aggregated PCIe links. Each of the 4 controllers would be connected to a different switch fabric chip all 4 or 8 of the links assigned to a particular PCIe controller would connect to the same switch fabric chip .

The HT 2100 has two HyperTransport ports 16 with an integrated tunnel. In a preferred embodiment the HT 2100 would be interposed on the HyperTransport interface between two Scrutiny PUMP devices or or alternatively between a MASTER CPU and a PUMP or or between two MASTER CPUs .

In an alternate embodiment there is a multiplicity of fabrics interconnecting the lobes and quadrants and for each fabric there are 4 interfaces labeled A B C D on each of the Quadrant 1 lobes depicted above and likewise for the lobes not depicted that can be implemented via a single system I O controller chip or such as the Broadcom HT 2000.

The number of interfaces and lanes per interface is highly dependent upon the particular combination of HyperTransport to PCIe bridge chips or used. As an example the HT 2000 has two HyperTransport ports 16 and 8 with an integrated tunnel. Given a homogeneous combination of HT 2000 chips for example the upstream 16 HyperTransport port would be connected to the processor array and the downstream port to an optional HyperTransport device not shown . The HT 2000 also has 17 PCIe lanes with support for up to 4 controllers. In this example the 4 controllers would each aggregate 4 PCIe lanes for a total of 16 lanes used. Thus the 4 interfaces labeled A B C D above would each have its own PCIe controller and each interface would comprise 4 aggregated PCIe lanes. Each of the 4 PCIe controllers would be connected to a different PCIe switch fabric chip each set of 4 lanes would connect to the same switch fabric chip as depicted.

As depicted in a basic quad fabric PCIe FLAMERouter configuration as a blade includes a PCIe based blade interface with links to four different switch fabrics four lanes per fabric for a total of 16 lanes . These links interface to the rest of the blade through a PCIe switch such as the PEX8548 which terminates redundantly in a pair of tunneling HT to PCIe bridges . As depicted each bridge connects both to a MASTER CPU and a SLAVE PUMP having a multiplicity of SLAVE CPUs attached. In the absence of specific requirements the specific configuration of CPUs and PUMPs is not particularly critical example alternatives are depicted in and . depicts a dual Opteron setup with doubly redundant PCIe interfaces to the CHARM lobes via PCIe switches while depicts the same doubly redundant PCIe interfaces as but with a quad processor configuration based on Niagara 2 N 2 processors. depicts an arbitrary FLAMERouter processor configuration where the interface to the CHARM lobes of the main system is based on the Horus HyperTransport device .

As depicted in the bridges also connect to a second PCIe switch that provides multiple interfaces to high speed external I O as appropriate.

Due to timing requirements in its implementation of communications protocols e.g. RUSH RECAP UNCAP the FLAMERouter is a consumer of high accuracy PPS pulse per second signals. For this reason a Rubidium clock module such as the commercially available Symmetricom X 72 could be optionally placed on the blade as part of a SLAM module which would synthesize a PPS signal that is also synchronized and phase locked with international time signals available from GPS and other satellites terrestrial radio etc. . In a preferred embodiment however the composite PPS signal source s would be located more centrally in the system chassis with the PPS signals distributed to blades such as the FLAMERouter.

The FIREdrive referred to in blade configuration and internal configuration is essentially a highly parallel SSD based data storage system tuned to massively parallel transactions. depicts the same doubly redundant PCIe interfaces as and but for a FIREdrive blade containing USB flash memory rather than a FLAMERouter networking blade. depicts an alternative view of the same USB flash memory subsystems but interfacing to internal I O switch interfaces or rather than blade interfaces . A key distinction between the blade implementation of and the internal implementation of is that the blade has local intelligence with a MASTER CPU and a MASTER PUMP and associated RAM and NVRAM this local intelligence may also be implemented as depicted in . As depicted in both and each I O switch or supports 4 USB flash drive subsystems for a total of 8 USB flash drive subsystems per CHARM lobe . Note In addition to the 4 PCIe to PCI X bridges depicted in each switch or also supports 2 SAS controllers as depicted in and these may alternatively be replaced with additional USB flash drive subsystems to double the aggregate I O performance and storage capacity. Each subsystem has 20 USB flash drives each on its own USB channel . With 4 CHARM lobes per each quadrant as depicted in each quadrant thus has 32 such USB flash drive subsystems for a total of 640 internal USB flash drives per quadrant with a total per quadrant capacity of 1.2 TB using 2 GB drives 2.5 TB using 4 GB drives 10 TB with 16 GB drives or TB with 64 GB drives. The key performance driver is the large number of independent channels acting in parallel rather than the relative performance or capacity of individual flash drives. If sufficiently slow USB flash devices are used multiple devices may be used per USB device channel without overloading the channels.

Read Performance 640 drives quadrant 25 MBps assuming somewhat better than average USB flash drives of any storage capacity 16 GBps 128 Gbps per quadrant. The performance constraint here is each individual USB flash drive and link not the aggregate bandwidths along the other communications paths. Write Performance 640 drives quadrant 10 MBps minimum 6.4 GBps 49 Gbps per quadrant or 147 Gbps sustained throughput per chassis. The overall read write performance thus enjoys linear speedups in sync with device performance with a better device e.g. 50 faster overall write performance would also be approximately 50 higher at 9.6 GBps minimum per quadrant based on 15 MBps typical per drive . IOPS Performance 4 KB Assuming 4 KB per IO and a conservative 10 MBps per drive for both read write each drive would be capable of about 2500 IOPS. 640 drives quadrant 2500 IOPS drive 1.6 million IOPS per quadrant or over 4.8 million IOPS per 3 quadrant chassis. These rates compare favorably with the 7680 IOPS per quadrant achievable with high performance SAS drives which are 166 slower. IOPS Performance 1 KB When using smaller I O sizes the number of IOPS increases accordingly. For example a normal SHADOWS FASTpage index may access 1 KB increments rather than 4 KB increments so the number of IOPS per quadrant would increase by 4 to 6.4 million IOPS per quadrant assuming 640 channels per quadrant . Furthermore given a better USB flash drive say for example 23 MBps vs. 10 MBps assuming 80 reads and 20 writes this could improve further by a factor of 2.3 to more than 14 million IOPS per quadrant. Note that some of the better USB flash drives claim speeds of up to 34 MBps read and 21 MBps write .

Note that these approximations of I O rates are tied to the read write access speeds of the USB flash drives regardless of the storage capacity of the drives. Thus small cheap flash drives can be very effective for improving throughput. Since the system was designed to accommodate a very large number of flash drives high capacities can be achieved by aggregating many small cheap drives with contention free access paths.

Affordability 2007 A single quadrant fully populated with 640 cheap 2 GB flash drives 15 each in 2007 would yield more than 1.2 TB of flash memory performing 1.6 million IOPS for under 10 000. If high performance 4 GB drives were used instead about 30 each a single quadrant would yield 2.5 TB of flash for under 20 000. However the better drives are also at least twice as fast 23 MBps vs. 10 MBps assuming 80 reads and 20 writes so the performance would double to 3.2 million IOPS for the same 20 000. Although this discussion contrasts the capacities achievable using 2 GB and 4 GB USB flash drives yielding 1.2 TB and 2.5 TB of storage respectively per quadrant these are by no means the maximum capacities. Rather these capacities represent a sweet spot where useful capacity is available at a reasonable price. As 8 GB and larger flash drives move into the sweet spot the increased flash based total capacity is enough to match the total capacity available when using high performance SAS 64 GB hard disk drives 2007 . However in terms of IOPS the flash drives are orders of magnitude faster. Even in 2007 however flash drives are available in capacities up to 64 GB per drive and these would increase the flash based storage capacity to more than 40 TB per quadrant.

Nominally excluding internal self maintenance activities at most one minimally redundant logical copy of the nearline data is normally spun up anywhere in the system extra redundant storage is spun down. In a preferred embodiment the duty cycle approaches a limit of k n where the storage is FEC encoded with an n k erasure code that is used to establish redundancy and where the survival of any k of the n fragments is sufficient to guarantee successful retrieval. Nearline storage is maintained on a spun down basis.

1. In a preferred embodiment SHADOWS NEARdrives are used only for nearline storage and contain only immutable objects and more precisely only encrypted FEC encoded fragments of objects .

3. Drives are usually spun down especially those used by SHADOWS. In a preferred embodiment after a drive is no longer needed for the current session i.e. after hand off has occurred but prior to actual spin down the drive s SMART data is analyzed to characterize its failure potential and then partly based on the results the drive is tested further maintained and possibly repaired under automated control. Afterward it is spun down. Additional detail on this process appears in a later section.

4. At least two local physical drives are distinguished as the active drives. Each user s space is available as a compressed secure encrypted virtual volume on these drives. The drives are owned and managed by separate MASTERs on separate system boards.

5. Active user space is always duplexed mirrored across the active drives which optionally spin down when idle in a preferred embodiment this is the default behavior but with a fairly long delay period modified dynamically by predictive heuristics that track user behavior .

6. Only a portion of any drive is available as active space say for example 200 GB out of 300 GB total .

7. All data in user space is also pushed to the SHADOWS network in accordance with the SLA and policy preferences etc.

8. In the event of an active drive failure one of the non active drives may be immediately spun up and synchronized. During synchronization data equivalent to that normally retrieved from the failed drive i.e. FEC encoded fragments etc. may be sought from the SHADOWS network as needed.

9. All writes intended for non active drives may be queued onto the active drives. When a safe i.e. adequately short but not too frequent delay has elapsed for a particular non active drive it may be spun up and synchronized with the active drives which may then be cleared of queued data .

10. Non active drives may be spun up occasionally for data retrieval if the information cannot be retrieved from other sources e.g. flash memory active drives etc. .

11. The active drives cache mutually exclusive entries objects that already exist on the non active drives. In a preferred embodiment this is complemented by the presence of flash based or equivalent caching of high demand objects also on a mutually exclusive basis. Mutual exclusivity maximizes the caching effect preventing redundant caching enables more objects to be cached in a given amount of space.

12. The active drives redundantly cache all objects that do not exist on the non active drives. Such objects are also cached in higher levels of memory and storage at least until safely distributed and stored in accordance with storage policy and any applicable SLAs .

13. Periodically and with a fairly long period the active drives may be rotated one at a time so that except initially there is always an old one and a new one. The long period minimizes start stop cycles and the rotation levels the wear and MTTF.

14. If a system board fails its buddy assumes its role and spins up one of its non active drives making it active then queues its buddy s data to its own newly active drive. Although it could potentially write directly to its buddy s drive if dual ported the point is that its buddy might not really be dead and conflict is to be avoided. A buddy s drives can be read accessed at any time however if necessary.

15. If further analysis determines that a buddy has truly failed and this requires voting etc. and coordination via BOSS a system board can indeed take over the buddy s drives after consensus under the auspices of BOSS has put the buddy into a fenced state such that it can do no harm. 

16. During high performance activities such as when the nearline storage system is needed to behave like an online storage system more perhaps all drives may be spun up but staggered to reduce inrush current in order to obtain an amplified striping effect.

The NEARdrive referred to 8.6.2 and depicted in internal configuration and blade configuration is essentially a high density disk based data storage array tuned for maximizing survivability of massive amounts of long term data. Because the disk drives devices are often spun down the apparent behavior of the NEARdrive seems to emulate that of nearline drives. depicts an internal configuration similar to that of but for disk drive devices rather than USB flash drives. depicts the same data blade oriented PCIe interfaces as but for a NEARdrive blade containing disk drives rather than a FIREdrive blade containing USB flash memory. A key distinction between the blade implementation of and the internal implementation of is that the blade has local intelligence with a MASTER CPU and a MASTER PUMP and associated RAM and NVRAM this local intelligence may also be implemented as depicted in . As depicted in both and each I O switch or supports at least 2 SAS controllers each with 4 arrays of 8 dual ported drives for a total of 8 drive arrays 64 drives accessible to each CHARM lobe . Note Each switch or depicted in also supports 4 USB flash drive subsystems in addition to the 2 SAS controllers shown and these may alternatively be replaced with additional SAS controllers and drive arrays to double the aggregate I O performance and storage capacity of the SAS drive arrays . depicts the use of a pair of back to back SAS Expander devices so that each port of each drive in an 8 drive array has an interface to each of a quadrant s 4 CHARM lobes . In the NEARdrive blade configuration depicted in SAS Expanders are not used the SAS Controllers interface directly to the doubly redundant blade interface switches and these interface directly to each of the quadrant s 4 CHARM lobes just as other blades do see . As depicted in and each 8 drive SAS array is accessible by any CHARM lobe via any of 4 independent switch fabrics or over either the West switches shown or the East switches not shown . Each quadrant supports any mix of 64 dual ported internal SAS or SATA disk drives organized as 8 arrays of 8 drives each for a raw capacity of 9.3 TB per quadrant with 146 GB SAS drives 12.8 TB with 200 GB SATA drives . The West I O switches or shown in support 4 such 8 drive arrays with the East switches supporting the other 4 arrays. Since any of a quadrant s 4 CHARM lobes can access any of the quadrant s 64 disk drives any 3 of the 4 lobes can fail without losing access to any of its 64 drives.

Three primary preferred NEARdrive embodiments are envisioned as most useful a small vacuum sealed steel can a full sized storage blade or module and a Mini version that has approximately the same dimensions as a single full sized 3.5 inch disk drive 

In a preferred embodiment NEARdrive Blade implementations for the following storage configurations would be typical 

In a preferred embodiment each NEARdrive Blade has the same form factor with the approximate dimensions of 7 H 2.5 W thick 9 D. This is sufficient to accommodate up to four full sized 3.5 inch drives or at least 16 small form factor SFF drives 2.5 or smaller .

In a preferred embodiment sufficient ports are available so that the drives on each NEARdrive Blade may be single ported or dual ported up to 300 Gbps each in the current state of the practice but this is not limited by the invention .

Each NEARdrive Blade includes redundant SAS controllers such that dual ported drives are connected to independent controllers and switches within the blade.

Each NEARdrive Blade may optionally configured to be intelligent with its own NEARdrive controller and switching logic which case it has its own local MASTER and possibly includes CHARM processing logic or it may be switched only in which case it operates under the control of a nearby MASTER.

Each NEARdrive Mini typically comprises a NEARdrive controller and either four matching 2.5 inch SAS SATA drives or eight matching smaller SAS SATA drives. With eight smaller drives a hybrid configuration such as 4 SAS and 4 SATA drives is possible.

Each NEARdrive Mini is responsible for its own 4 or 8 drives but can in a preferred embodiment directly access the 4 or 8 drives of its buddy.

In a preferred embodiment NEARdrive Can implementations for the following storage configurations would be typical 

Each NEARdrive Can has the same form factor with the approximate dimensions of 3.25 diameter 6 H 12 H for double height can . The standard height can is sufficient to accommodate at least 4 small form factor SFF drives 2.5 or smaller plus 2 smaller 1.8 drives optional .

In a preferred embodiment each NEARdrive Can communications interface comprises a single 12 lane data connector that can support any combination of single ported or dual ported drives up to 300 Gbps each in the current state of the practice but this is not limited by the invention requiring 12 ports or less. The number of lanes supported is arbitrary and can be reduced or increased as necessary of course. In the preferred embodiment one of the goals is to maximize the data throughput and IOPS during peak periods which requires a minimum of 1 lane per physical drive 2 for dual ported drives .

In an alternate embodiment that minimizes the host interface requirements the number of connector lanes is reduced to 1 or 2 and 1 or 2 multiplexers are embedded inside the NEARdrive Can. The multiplexers allow switching between the contained disk drives based on software control mechanisms SATA or SAS protocols .

Each NEARdrive Blade may optionally configured to be intelligent with its own NEARdrive controller and switching logic which case it has its own local MASTER and possibly includes CHARM processing logic or it may be switched only in which case it operates under the control of a nearby MASTER.

Given the data from the Google study of 100 000 disk drives we draw somewhat different conclusions than those of the authors with regard to the effect of temperature on the annual failure rate AFR of disk drives in a data center environment. Our view of the Google data is that it indicates that the lowest failure rates occur in the moderate temperature range of 30 C. to 45 C. and particularly in the range 35 C. to 40 C. The Google authors conclude that at such moderate temperature ranges it is likely that there are other effects which affect failure rates much more than temperature and we concur.

The Google authors further observe that temperatures outside this moderate range tend to increase the failure rate. While it is obvious that increased temperatures can increase the failure rate they had no explanation for why lower temperatures would also apparently increase the failure rate. However the problematic lower average temperatures cited 15 C. to 30 C. seem unlikely to occur in spinning drives in a busy data center it is far more likely that the lower average temperatures indicate the occurrence of thermal cycling such as what would occur when systems or drives are powered up and down or when drives are spun down by BIOS power saving settings . Since there is no apparent electronics phenomenon that would account for an increase in failure rate due to such moderately reduced temperatures in fact moderate temperature reductions are normally expected to decrease the failure rate of electronic devices it is far more likely that the significantly increased failure rate is due to thermally induced stress. Note In fact intentionally induced thermal stress is a primary technique used during accelerated life cycle testing to force failures. .

In a preferred embodiment the NEAR technology can be integrated with the SHADOWS RUBE technology described elsewhere so that a working fluid is actively circulated through the NEARdrive Blade or Mini and among its components in order to provide thermal stabilization and thereby minimize thermal stress. Note RUBE Recuperative Use of Boiling Energy is part of the FRAME Forced Recuperation Aggregation Movement of Energy subsystem. . In a preferred embodiment the boiling point of the working fluid is 34 C. at STP and slightly higher at mildly elevated pressures making the effective range approximately 34 C. to 40 C. and the RUBE technology supplies an appropriate combination of liquid and vapor according to how much cooling or heating is needed. If the NEARdrive components approach or exceed a target temperature they act as a heat source and are efficiently cooled by the fluid as it changes phases on the other hand if the components drop below this temperature such as when they are spun down they act as a heat sink and are efficiently kept heated by the fluid as it phase changes the other direction thus the fluid greatly increases thermal stability. When drives are spun up after a period of non use they are already warmed up and ready to go without thermal stress.

Another important impact of NEARdrive s thermal stabilization with respect to drive reliability has less to do with outright drive failure and more to do with preventing read errors in the first place. Thermal variation can affect the relative head alignment between writing and reading operations. If the head is directly aligned with the track performance is relatively good as the head moves off track the performance drops markedly as the magnetic remnant components of previously written data are read back along with the newly written signal leading to the potential for increased read errors. Thermal stabilization helps to sidestep this particular threat vector.

Industry standard disk drives provide various self monitoring signals that are available through the SMART standard interface. SMART detects and reports on various indicators of reliability. SMART enables a host processor to receive analytical information from the disk drive that may be useful for anticipating failures.

Industry based empirical analysis of a very large number of drives in a well characterized data center environment indicates that some signals appear to be more relevant to the study of failures than others and this is confirmed by the Google study referred to in the previous section.

In a preferred embodiment the NEARdrive analysis of SMART data available from each disk drive focuses first on indicators whose critical threshold values were established with high confidence 95 by the Google study as summarized in Table 5 

The Google study noted however that it is unlikely that SMART data alone can be effectively used to build models that predict failures of individual drives given that over 36 of all failed drives had zero counts on all four of these SMART variables. Thus while a non zero count is highly predictive of imminent failure of the corresponding drive a zero count does not ensure that all is well. However the NEAR technology can put this information to good use as described in section 8.6.8.

In a 2006 study of large scale supercomputer clusters and ISPs CMU researchers analyzed the data from a 765 node supercomputer cluster with 3 060 CPUs 3 060 DIMMs 765 motherboards 3 406 disk drives and other components over a 5 year period the useful life of a disk drive . The CMU researchers were able to draw a number of important conclusions which are applied in a novel way by the NEAR technology as described in section 8.6.8 

In a preferred embodiment of the NEAR technology the highly predictive non zero SMART data counts referred to in section 8.6.6 and inferences from the findings summarized in section 8.6.7 both mandate and enable direct preventive action rather than only remedial action for the corresponding drive in advance of drive failure. In particular such a drive can be and should be treated exactly as if it has just encountered an actual failure with the exception that the drive may not have actually failed yet and that such actual failure may in fact be preventable or at least deferrable.

In a preferred embodiment of the NEAR technology a predicted or actual drive failure causes the data storage and retrieval responsibilities of the failed or at risk drive to be immediately shifted to other drives. In a preferred embodiment if said responsibilities cannot be shifted for all at risk drives relatively immediately then load shifting occurs for any failed drives first and the relative risk among the at risk drives can be used to determine the load shifting order among the at risk drives. In a preferred embodiment the at risk drives may be prioritized by the relative risk apparently but not actually implied by their relative SMART Indicator values with consideration given to other indicators and risk information that may be available.

In a preferred embodiment failed or at risk drives are left spun up if possible and then subjected to a pre spin down drive analysis and maintenance cycle as described in section 8.6.9. For each drive if the cycle is successful the drive is spun down the same as if no SMART errors or failure had been detected and it is left in the normal drive rotation for later use. For any drive where the cycle is unsuccessful including mechanical failure or burn out the drive is permanently de powered and taken out of the normal drive rotation.

In a preferred embodiment of the NEAR technology the highly predictive non zero SMART data counts referred to in section 8.6.6 can be used in conjunction with any observed failures to trigger an elevated risk level by predicting the increased relative risk of disk drive failures especially among those drives sharing one or more common dependencies e.g. same module same thermal environment same vibrational environment same power environment same EMP environment etc. .

In particular if any drive e.g. in a NEARdrive Blade or NEARdrive Mini has experienced an actual failure or such a failure is or was predicted by a non zero count for any of the four SMART Indicators listed in Table 5 then there is an increased risk that some number of other drives at the very least those with mutual dependencies may fail as well within the predictive time period.

In a preferred embodiment of the NEAR technology this situation triggers a drive analysis and maintenance cycle for each of the drives in the collective group e.g. those in the affected drive rotation . One by one the data storage and retrieval responsibilities of each such drive is immediately shifted to other drives that are known good or otherwise not at risk. If the cycle is successful the drive under test is restored to normal operation and left in the normal drive rotation for immediate or later use. For any drive where the cycle is unsuccessful including mechanical failure or burn out the drive is permanently de powered and taken out of the normal drive rotation.

In a preferred embodiment of the NEAR technology an automated pre spin down drive analysis and maintenance of every disk drive is executed on a periodic basis as described herein and also executed when triggered in accordance with proactive risk management activity such as that described in 8.6.8.

It is generally accepted among knowledgeable intelligence professionals that it is effectively impossible to sanitize i.e. securely erase disk storage locations by simply overwriting them no matter how many overwrite passes are made or what data patterns are written. Each track contains an image of everything ever written to it but the contribution from each layer gets progressively smaller the further back in time it was made.

Although we conceptualize writing each bit to a disk drive as either a logical one or a zero the actual effect is closer to obtaining a 0.95 when a zero is overwritten with a one and a 1.05 when a one is overwritten with a one. Normal disk circuitry is set up so that both these values are read as ones but using specialized algorithms drive capabilities and or specialized circuitry it is possible to determine the information stored in previous layers i.e. due to previous writes . In a preferred embodiment of the NEAR technology this fact is exploited by painstakingly microstepping the drive and reading and rereading the signal from the analog head electronics essentially oversampling it by rereading tracks with slightly changed data threshold and window offsets and varying the head positioning by a few percent to either side of the track synthesizing the oversampled waveform and analyzing it in software possibly with the help of reconfigurable or dedicated logic to generate an ideal read signal and subtract it from what was actually read leaving as the difference the remnant of the previous signal i.e. the recovered data .

As each sector is sampled its apparent content is saved so that it can be restored or moved as needed 

The aforementioned process can easily be combined with or replaced by other data recovery algorithms and processes known in the industry as appropriate in order to enhance the survivability of the data stored via the NEAR technology and without detracting from its most important properties namely the capability to recover from some number of otherwise unrecoverable errors the capability to proactively prevent some number of errors that may otherwise be encountered and the capability of accomplishing said error recovery and error prevention on a fully automated basis without encountering any unplanned downtime or interruption of service.

In a preferred embodiment of the NEAR technology a disk read error i.e. one that has not yet caused the corresponding drive to be labeled as having failed triggers an on the fly drive analysis and maintenance cycle that is limited to the immediate sector s corresponding to the read error beginning with the errant sector while also triggering the full drive analysis process as described in the previous section. The idea is to attempt to complete the current access even if a delay is required. Because every NEARdrive stores only fragments of objects and a sector error can affect at most one such fragment the analysis induced delay cannot add any latency to the overall storage retrieval operation except in the case where it corresponds to the swing vote i.e. an extremely unlikely scenario involving multiple failures where no other fragments are available to help complete the operation .

As depicted in a NEARFIRE hybrid blade is simply a configuration that incorporates a FIREdrive as described in section 8.5 and depicted in along with a NEARdrive as described generally in section 8.6 and specifically in section 8.6.3 and depicted in all on a single blade. In a preferred embodiment the local intelligence depicted in and implemented by a MASTER CPU and a MASTER PUMP is augmented by the introduction of an HT to PCIe bridge or and more importantly a SLAVE PUMP with associated SLAVE CPUs not shown .

CORE refers to a collection of engines whose purpose is to encapsulate and securely execute high performance and or hardware assisted general purpose implementations of critical compute intensive processes to minimize latency maximize overall throughput and reduce operational costs. Note All of these technologies see Table 6 are intended for hardware or software implementation. The specific engines e.g. FACTUAL FASTpage are typically closely associated with other systems and may thus be further described in those contexts .

FACTUAL capability is a memoization system designed to operate at global scale and supercomputing speed with the high levels of security and survivability commensurate with the SHADOWS infrastructure. Memoization is essentially the capability of looking up known results of deterministic processes and or functions rather than recomputing them from scratch.

Because each SHADOWS artifact and each process has its own identity whenever a deterministic process or function accepts a particular set of input values and produces and deterministic set of output values we can treat the set of input values and the specific process identity as a new artifact having an identity of its own. We can likewise treat the set of output values as an artifact with an identity. Memoization then becomes a conceptually simple matter of establishing a pairing between the input process identity and the output identity such that any already known output can be looked up and identified. Thus given any input process identity it can be determined through a lookup whether the result has been previously computed and if so what its identity is.

Teams are used to perform the processing required to arrive at previously unknown results and to reach consensus on vetted results prior to memoization which is particularly important for FACTUAL because memoized results can be reused as authoritative results that sidestep process execution . As with any artifact the various content and identities associated with memoized results need to be stored which involves teams on a SHADOWS wide basis as does the lookup of memoized results.

If it cannot be readily determined on a local basis whether a memoized result exists the problem to be solved is queued for processing but can normally be dequeued if a vetted memoized result is obtained prior to the start of execution. A memoized result that is obtained after execution has already started can be used as a test oracle to verify the result thereby serving as a built in system integrity check. Memoization of results and whether to use lookup of memoized results is context specific and configurable at the process level or process family level. In general lookups of memoized results may not be utilized when such lookups consume more resources than would be required to simply recompute the results unless such lookups reduce a local processing load by shifting the lookup elsewhere. The lookups of memoized and therefore already known results are also vetted by virtue of the fact that lookups like other operations are handled by geographically distributed teams that are difficult to attack. Not only must a distributed team reach consensus on the identity of the memoized result but other distributed teams are typically involved in moving a copy of the content of the identified result to where it is needed and in all cases the recipient s can determine the degree to which consensus was reached in each step. The availability of memoized results is also very helpful in cases of Byzantine failure that would otherwise hamper the achievement of vetted results.

As noted in section 7.3.1 Load Balancing SHADOWS Native Processes in general SHADOWS native processes do not push data around as loads are shifted and requests are made etc. Instead IDs are pushed around and if a process actually needs the associated data it can request it on a pull basis or if there are no other operands just forward the request to the team that owns the data resources permitting . The act of pushing an ID however has the effect of putting the team owning the associated data on notice that it may be needed soon essentially identifying the ID as a speculative prefetch opportunity.

As previously noted in its simplest form a SHADOWS native process has an input queue and an output queue as depicted in on the left. Ignoring security issues the input queue accepts tuples of the form TxID Operand ID List performs the work of the process which is to generate one or more Result IDs then enqueues them for distribution. The transaction id TxID ties the Operand IDs received as input to the Result IDs associated with the processing results.

The FACTUAL system works as depicted in on the right by intercepting the input queue before it is seen by the aforementioned native process i.e. the one described earlier in section 7.3.1 which is depicted above as a thumbnail illustration at . The input queue accepts tuples of the form TxID Operand ID List. An interior lookup process immediately fires off requests to find out if the current process which must be deterministic has previously computed a result for the Operand IDs requesting that the results i.e. a hit with results or a miss with nothing be sent along to a specific destination team responsible for collecting results which may be the current team or some other one . A message including the TxID Operand ID List tuple is also sent to the specified collect results destination team to put it on notice that data for the particular TxID may soon be arriving unexpected data can trigger defensive behavior and to the team responsible for throttling the actual execution of the process if already computed results aren t found soon enough note that the throttling team is co located with the actual execution process and has read and update access to its input queue . As lookup results if any are received they are collected and a hit or miss is determination is made with a message to that effect being sent to the team responsible for throttling the actual execution of the native process and also to a prefetch process if the result is a hit then the ID of the results is known but not the actual results so the prefetch sends a speculative prefetch message to the appropriate team if the result is a miss then a non speculative prefetch message with the TxID Operand ID List tuple is sent to the appropriate team because the team responsible for actual process execution may be requesting the operands shortly .

When the team responsible for throttling the actual execution of the native process receives the TxID Operand ID List tuple it immediately enqueues it internally to the co located execution process input queue . If a hit message occurs the inline input queue is checked. If processing has not started the entry is dequeued because the result is already known. If the processing has already started it is left to run and its result can be verified against the known result. In any case the hit message can be forwarded to the Vet Results process team . If the co located execution completes its results are also forwarded to the Vet Results process team. Validated results can be placed into the normal process output queue . If results were calculated that were previously not seen they can be posted for update in order to support a future computation.

Child. A node of a tree referred to by a parent node. Every node except the root is the child of some parent.

Internal node. A simple node of a tree that has one or more child nodes equivalently a node that is not a leaf. All FASTpage internal nodes are allocated beginning with an ordinate of 0 and incrementing their ordinate value and therefore exhibit heap like growth behavior this is depicted by example in Table 7 through Table 17 .

Node. 1 A unit of reference in a data structure. Also called a vertex in graphs and trees. 2 A collection of information which must be kept at a single memory location.

String. A list of characters usually implemented as an array. Informally a word phrase sentence etc. Since text processing is so common a special type with substring operations is often available. Note The term string usually refers to a small sequence of characters such as a name or a sentence. The term text usually refers to a large sequence of characters such as an article or a book.

Tree. 1 A data structure accessed beginning at the root node. Each node including the root is either a leaf or an internal node. An internal node has one or more child nodes and is called the parent of its child nodes. All children of the same node are siblings. Contrary to a physical tree the root is usually depicted at the top of the structure and the leaves are depicted at the bottom. 2 A connected undirected acyclic graph. It is rooted and ordered unless otherwise specified.

Trie. pronounced tree . Also Digital Search Trie. A tree for storing strings in which there is one node for every common prefix. The strings are stored in extra leaf nodes. Note The name comes from reTRIEval and is pronounced tree. 

Parent. The tree node conceptually above or closer to the root than a particular node the child node and which has a link to the child node.

Leaf. A node in a tree but without any children. In a FASTpage index a leaf is also a compound node that may include both an external reference i.e. the proper data of a leaf and also an internal reference i.e. a follow on reference to the next internal node . Note Every node in a tree is either a leaf or an internal node. All FASTpage leaf nodes compound nodes are allocated beginning with an ordinate of 255 and decrementing their ordinate value and therefore exhibit stack like growth behavior this is depicted by example in Table 7 through Table 17 .

The idea behind FASTpage is to create a fast highly scalable associative memory mechanism that can adapt to the information to be remembered in order to optimize both time and space. Each FASTpage implementation supports an arbitrary number of independent local search spaces limited only by local storage capacity. Each FASTpage search space may be individually defined to be either transient or persistent with individually specifiable survival requirements.

In essence FASTpage is a fast efficient associative memory mechanism that can also persist indefinitely. Although the persistence properties of a FASTpage index may be achieved via any common data storage means the concept is designed to capitalize on the very high performance of solid state disk SSD drives and SSD accelerated storage systems in general and the Scrutiny FIRE and NEAR technologies in particular. Note FIRE Fast Index Repository Emulator is the technology underlying a FIREblade or FIREdrive . It provides high performance all electronic long term data storage that is immune to mechanical wear and vibration including seismic events . The stored data is safe from intruders even if stolen. The number of read write accesses per second is orders of magnitude faster than hard disk drives. NEAR Nearline Emulation Archival Repository is the technology underlying a NEARblade or NEARdrive . It provides high capacity electronically assisted long term data storage that is subject to minimal mechanical risk including wear vibration and seismic events due to significantly reduced mechanical duty cycle. The stored data is safe from intruders even if stolen. The number of read and or accesses per second is orders of magnitude faster than unassisted hard disk drives. . In a preferred embodiment FASTpage indexes takes advantage of minimal NVRAM resources for meta data and efficiently uses flash memory to amplify its high performance. Note NVRAM or Non Volatile Random Access Memory tends to be expensive and of fairly low capacity and is therefore somewhat of a precious resource. A key NVRAM property is that it usually supports an unlimited number of read write cycles and potentially long term data retention always long enough to survive a reboot and sometimes as long as 10 years. . The fact that flash memory can typically endure only a limited number of write cycles is fully accommodated within the internal FASTpage mechanisms which cannot approach such limits by design yet does not negatively impact FASTpage indexes in any way. FASTpage indexes can also take full advantage of storage mechanism that have no such write cycle limitations.

The FASTpage concepts as described in this brief assume a strictly local implementation no distributed properties are described . However any FASTpage implementation can participate in higher level distributed architectures such as SHADOWS and CHARM of which FASTpage is a component and can beneficially replace the hash based search algorithms of DHTs distributed hash tables . Note CHARM Compressed Hierarchical Associative Relational Memory is itself a component of SHADOWS Self Healing Adaptive Distributed Organic Working Storage . Given a FASTpage implementation that is participating in such a distributed architecture then each FASTpage search space can also participate on an individually selectable basis in a higher level distributed search space.

FASTpage indexes can be implemented relatively easily in hardware or software while avoiding the negative attributes of various traditional associative search mechanisms. Nonetheless the FASTpage mechanism was inspired by the respective individual benefits normally attributed to memory tries binary search binary trees splay trees ternary search trees hash tables distributed hash tables and Bayer tree variants. Note The three most well known variants of Bayer trees are commonly known as B trees B trees or B trees. . In particular the ternary search tree TST serves as the conceptual jumping off point for understanding the FASTpage search concepts.

1. FASTpage indexes combine the properties of a ternary search tree TST and a digital search trie spelled Trie but pronounced tree taking advantage of their in memory search performance while adding persistence with a page sized storage unit typically a convenient multiple of a 512 byte sector .

2. TST concepts are central to FASTpage especially the property that not found conditions in string searches are determined on average faster than equivalent searches with a hash table. Also important is that unlike hash tables FASTpage requires no reorganization to accommodate growth.

3. Unlike traditional TSTs a FASTpage TST requires only 4 bytes per internal node 1 byte for each of the four indices split left equal right . Each FASTpage page has sufficient capacity for exactly 256 nodes so that each index can refer to any node. A typical FASTpage TST page requires only 1 KB of space of memory or storage.

4. Trie algorithms are known for their extremely fast in memory search speeds but at the expense of explosive sparse memory requirements. When the set of keys is sparse i.e. when the actual keys form a small subset of the set of potential keys as is very often the case many most of the internal nodes in the Trie have only one child which wastes memory. FASTpage Trie pages usually start out as FASTpage TST pages however and these may be densely populated each node requires only about 4 bytes on average which is perhaps one third the space of a classic TST node . When sufficient leading byte diversity exists the TST is converted to a Trie.

5. FASTpage attempts to diversify the nodes on a page given a common string up to a particular character position with the ultimate goal of collecting all of their descendents into a Trie node. A FASTpage TST page is converted to a FASTpage Trie page at the point when the leading byte of its first node corresponds to the lowest possible byte value in the associated set of possible keys and the number of keys with diverse but contiguously sequential leading bytes in the same node exceeds a threshold. Any nodes with non contiguous leading bytes are allowed to remain in the Trie page but are moved to their respective proper locations based on their leading byte value .

6. As part of the conversion from a FASTpage TST page to FASTpage Trie page any successor keys based on non leading bytes regardless of whether their corresponding predecessors were contiguous are relegated to their respective lower level successor pages.

7. A complete FASTpage Trie page is obtained when the highest valued possible differing byte is also included in the contiguous sequence. Any byte at that position can then serve as an 8 bit index into the FASTpage Trie page and thus it can be used to directly obtain a reference or pointer to the appropriate descendent page.

8. Once a complete FASTpage Trie page is created it becomes immutable never changes . Immutability of Trie pages provides significant performance benefits for caches and survivability benefits for limited write devices such as flash based storage.

9. FASTpage metadata can be embedded in each page but in a preferred embodiment is stored elsewhere. In particular the metadata is maintained in a separate set of pageable persistent storage co located with the corresponding FASTpage pages that can be indexed by the FASTpage page number.

10. Each FASTpage page has an associated metadata descriptor comprising a page type e.g. TST Trie etc. page size optional node size e.g. 4 or 8 bytes reference size e.g. 2 4 8 or 16 bytes the most significant portion held in common by the majority of leaf node reference addresses current indices for the stack and heap access control security barrier information data validation information optional and one or more indicators of progress toward TST to Trie conversion.

11. The metadata describing most significant common portion if any of external references associated with the majority of leaf nodes on the page is used to factor out the common portion which typically reduces leaf node memory requirements by half thereby allowing more nodes to be stored and increasing the page density.

12. All of the FASTpage pages at a particular location may be subordinated to pages held elsewhere such that the location itself to an arbitrary level of detail may comprise a portion of the actual search key. One effect of this is that of natural key partitioning. Another effect is storage space conservation by not having to store or process a portion of a key that is held in common by all the keys at a particular location.

13. Leaf nodes are not fixed in size but may consume 1 or 2 or more 4 byte entries as required in order to contain their variable length external reference information plus a 1 byte follow on index to an internal node . A single 4 byte entry contains a 1 byte internal index plus a 1 2 or 3 byte external reference. A double 4 byte entry 8 bytes contains a 1 byte internal index plus a 4 5 6 or 7 byte external reference. Similarly a triple 4 byte entry 12 bytes can contain up to an 11 byte external reference and so on. In a preferred embodiment numerical references are encoded with a variable length unsigned LEB128 binary number 1 bit per byte is a flag with 7 bits per byte of numerical information so each byte contributes a factor of 2 7 128 to the addressable range . Note LEB128 is a relatively well known data format that refers to a Little Endian Base 128 integer with 128 possible values per byte. .

Because a FASTpage index is associative it can serve wherever there is a need for an arbitrary n to m mapping e.g. 1 to 1 1 to many many to 1 many to many which corresponds to a very large application space. Although a FASTpage index excels with keys of any size it is particularly well suited to long and or variable length keys that may be problematic for other lookup means.

Here is a non exhaustive list of some examples of applications where a FASTpage index may be optimal both in memory and on disk 

Almost any hash table can be replaced with a FASTpage index it may be contra indicated only for fixed size tables with pre optimized perfect hash keys . Note A FASTpage index is about the same speed as a hash table for a successful lookup but often much faster for an unsuccessful lookup especially with long keys this is important because hash tables are often used to determine that a key is not present . Unlike a hash table a FASTpage index can traverse key information in sorted order forwards or backwards and perform nearest match searches. Unlike a hash table a FASTpage index never needs wholesale reorganization to account for growth. A FASTpage index maintains high density key pages to optimize time and space and becomes even more efficient over time as FASTpage TST pages are converted to FASTpage Trie pages. .

Disk based indices such as those based on B trees B trees or B trees may generally be replaced with FASTpages. Note A key goal of disk based indexes is to reduce the number of disk accesses required to locate a key since disk access is usually a major performance bottleneck. Accordingly their disk based index nodes tend to be fat and contain many keys in order to minimum the number of fetches required. Likewise a FASTpage index contains many keys but is much smaller and finer grained by design so as to be able to cache many more nodes that have a high probability of relevance. Although a FASTpage index may potentially incur more logical disk accesses one should expect less actual physical disk I O overall because of the higher probability that useful nodes are cached early on. Also because flash memory is the primary FASTpage persistence mechanism by design in a preferred embodiment the FASTpage lookup rate in a very large database will easily exceed that of a typical disk based index by as many as several orders of magnitude. .

File System Applications. FASTpage keys are variable length and can be of any length without penalty so hierarchical file systems can be implemented without arbitrarily restricting the length of file names and directories folders and each directory or folder can contain any number of entries. Because FASTpage keys are variable length without restriction it is possible to implement path names of unlimited length such that there is just a single index for an entire file system. Nonetheless a typical approach would be to implement a nested index where each directory or folder has its own secondary FASTpage index because it offers a number of advantages the discussion of which are outside the scope of this document .

Fully Indexed Database Applications. A FASTpage index can be substituted wherever a traditional database index can be used such as on an index per field and or index per key basis for each table. With a FASTpage index it is also quite reasonable to index EVERY field or column rather than just a selected few in every table with a single database level index. In a preferred embodiment a single FASTpage index can easily be used to subsume other indexes by prefixing each key value with both a table identifier and a field or column identifier. In a preferred embodiment each table identifier and each field or column identifier would be a variable length numeric value typically only one byte that is mapped to the corresponding table name or field or column name respectively. As a prefix to the key value each identifier itself would only be stored once in a FASTpage index due to its inherent key compression properties each such identifier would be common to all key values appearing after it. . In a FASTpage index any table identifier field column identifier and any unique values are automatically factored out and stored only once. By so doing a multi table search can be carried out easily and tables not containing a particular field or column cannot contain the associated field or column identifier and thus can yield no relevant records. Likewise fields containing null values naturally occupy no space at all and if none of the records in a table have a value for that field even the identifier itself need not be stored a search for that field or values in that field can yield no relevant records . When the key values associated with a particular field or column are defined to be UNIQUE not duplicated the result of each successful record oriented database index search is typically a record number or row number for object oriented databases the result of each successful index search is typically an object identifier. However when DUPLICATE key values are allowed the result of both record oriented and object oriented database search is either a reference to an array or list of record row numbers or object identifiers respectively or a recursive reference to secondary FASTpage index containing further order related information e.g. GROUP BY .

Compressed Database Applications. In addition to using one or more FASTpage indexes to replace traditional database indexes they can also be used to achieve significant database compression a technique used in Scrutiny s CHARM technology . The idea is to achieve compression by factoring out the vocabulary associated with a particular database. One way to achieve this is to create a non duplicated index of key values comprising the vocabulary of the database including at least all non BLOB non numeric values but possibly numeric values as well. In a preferred embodiment the key value is prefixed by a data type identifier before index insertion which means search keys need to be prefixed likewise . As each non duplicate key value is inserted into the vocabulary index a variable length code e.g. LEB128 is automatically assigned based on its predicted or actual likelihood of occurrence frequency such that the highest frequency key values may be assigned the shortest codes and vice versa. Note Unless codes are specially assigned this means that results cannot be sorted or grouped alphanumerically by vocabulary codes which are assigned by probable frequency . Instead once the results are available the vocabulary codes can be mapped back to traditional data values for grouping sorting and presentation purposes. . A reverse mapping entry is also inserted. Once the vocabulary is mapped all database values can be replaced by their vocabulary codes and the database becomes compressed and speedier. It is a policy decision as to whether speculative vocabulary insertions may be allowed not recommended . It may make sense to use a representative corpus to extract a useful vocabulary. Either way if a key is not in the vocabulary then by definition it cannot be in the database either. Likewise if a key is found in the vocabulary but has no external reference then it is nonetheless not yet in the database. However if a key is found in the vocabulary and there is an external reference then it refers to a secondary FASTpage index that reveals all matching database locations via follow keys table code field or column code record or object id.

Relational Database Applications. Given the compressed database application environment of the previous paragraph it would be straightforward to construct an RDBMS relational database management system over it. Most importantly SQL structured query language queries would need to be translated to incorporate the appropriate vocabulary coding so that any corresponding FASTpage indexes can be properly searched. Data manipulations e.g. joins occur normally except that coded values are used which generally makes the searches much faster. If the database is fully indexed recommended search results can be MUCH faster. Eventually in many cases the search results must be mapped back from their encoded values to their traditional equivalents for presentation purposes.

Content Management Applications. A FASTpage index is well suited to full text indexing in general and indexing of arbitrary content in particular since its variable length keys with leading compression provide a great deal of flexibility. Some of the same techniques described above for compressed databases are also directly applicable to content management regardless of whether the content repository is a file system a database management system or something else. The vocabulary compression technique is particularly useful since it also allows search keys to be mapped from vocabulary words to coded concepts. Concept coding and tagging can supplement simple text searching by incorporating thesauri and other external concept oriented information that can help a searcher optimize precision and recall. External classifiers and reasoning engines can also contribute key pairs for a given chunk of content. In addition to using a FASTpage index for key data multiple temporary FASTpage indexes can be used during content analysis and also during queries for quickly cross matching and correlating interim results.

High Security Applications. A FASTpage index is well suited to high security applications for two primary reasons 1 designed in fine grained access control and 2 elimination of the need to retrieve the target records and or objects to process queries and make security determinations. MAC mandatory access control and or DAC discretionary access control security barriers can be inserted into the stored key information as part of the key itself in one or more various locations according to the desired effect. Note The security barrier is a special coded token that the FASTpage index can discern from the otherwise expected bytes in an index key sequence. When security barriers are enabled at a particular level of granularity there is a 1 bit overhead to flag the security barrier at that level. Thus a table level barrier will incur an overhead of one bit per table even if a particular table has no barrier. Barriers are available for at least the following levels database table field or column data type vocabulary code and target e.g. data or external reference. . In a database application for example a security barrier token can be inserted into the key just before a table identifier e.g. before each table identifier or perhaps just one of them and this would have the effect of skipping over any table that should be invisible to a particular query based on the security context of the query itself . Similar security barriers which are tied to security policy may be placed at other important locations within any key and also within the area containing the target of any key as well as being associated with all keys on a particular FASTpage index page and or its descendents. It is typical that database systems which offer very fine grained access control policies e.g. only personnel reps can view salaries over 30 000 must first fetch the candidate target records in order to determine which records are in scope for a particular query assuming the non security criteria are otherwise met . FASTpage allows fully indexed information and one useful consequence of this is that all access oriented security decisions can be made before the corresponding records and or objects are actually retrieved i.e. before their risk of exposure becomes increased by accessing them .

Synchronous Blocking vs. Asynchronous Non Blocking Queued Interface. The FASTpage processes can be implemented completely in software or hardware as an API application programming interface comprising synchronous blocking function calls or system calls. In a preferred embodiment however a software implementation would comprise a set of asynchronous non blocking message oriented transactional services accessible via a queued messaging interface and a hardware implementation would comprise at least a non blocking transactional packet oriented queued interface such as might be implemented with PCI Express or HyperTransport e.g. with retrieval requests posted writes .

Software vs. Hardware. In a preferred embodiment the FASTpage processes would be implemented in both software and hardware due to their overall utility. The idea is to standardize on FASTpage indexes and use them wherever they re applicable. General purpose CPUs would use software implementations when appropriate especially for temporary or transient indexes but would also have access to hardware accelerated implementations. The hardware implementations would be a shared resource accessible to multiple processors and would largely be responsible for all persistent data. Note In a preferred embodiment multiple FASTpage processes would be instantiated within each PUMP Parallel Universal Memory Processor device described elsewhere . The PUMP device which would initially be implemented with reconfigurable logic e.g. FPGA or Structured ASIC .

Local vs. Distributed Operation. In a preferred embodiment e.g. the SHADOWS infrastructure all persistent data may be distributed over a large number of globally distributed processes and devices that cooperate to effect a secure survivable persistent associative memory with significant computing power. In such a context the data may be both encrypted and widely scattered in such a way as to render all persistent data unusable as stored i.e. if stolen it would be worthless . Quite a bit of the local processing may take place on encrypted data without bringing it into the clear. Each local node may have partial responsibility however for some fraction of the global key space that it must process in the clear even if it appears scrambled scrambled data does not present a significant hurdle for a well funded sophisticated attacker . Such in the clear data may be created only as needed and may exist only in protected volatile memory that may be erased on demand such as when an attacker or intruder is detected. In general due to the highly distributed nature of the preferred embodiment any in the clear data captured by an attacker at one or even a few locations would be of little utility.

Compression. A FASTpage index enjoys leading key compression quite naturally. Also from a disk space viewpoint many keys may be stored on each page so pages can be densely rather than sparsely populated. Furthermore space usage in general may be quite low because internal references are all page relative and external references may be variable length.

In a preferred embodiment the page relative internal references consume w bits each thus a search node consumes 4w 8 w 2 bytes and 2 w such nodes are accommodated on each page where the page size is determined as 2 4 w 2 bytes which simplifies to w 2 w 1 bytes. Leaf nodes require w 2 bytes in the normal case 1 byte for a follow on internal reference and up to w 2 1 bytes per short external reference and up to w 1 bytes per long external reference.

In a preferred embodiment the page relative internal references consume only 8 bits one byte each w 8 thus a simple search node simple node consumes only 4 bytes rather than the 13 bytes required by a traditional ternary search tree and up to 256 such nodes are accommodated on each 1K 1024 byte page. Leaf nodes are compound nodes that also require 4 bytes in the normal case 1 byte for a follow on internal reference and up to 3 bytes of external reference or multiples of 4 bytes if more addressing capacity is required. In a preferred embodiment a multiple of 4 bytes is allocated as needed where 1 byte is used for a follow on internal reference with the remaining bytes available for a variable length LEB128 encoded external reference i.e. a multiple of 4 bytes may be allocated and allocated but unused bytes are simply ignored . In an alternative embodiment a fixed number of bytes may be allocated still a multiple of 4 bytes where 1 byte is used for a follow on internal reference with the remaining bytes dedicated for a fixed width external reference.

In an alternate embodiment the page relative internal references may be extended from 1 byte to w bits each w 8 in order to allow for more nodes per page and larger page sizes.

In an alternate embodiment the page relative internal references may be reduced from 1 byte to w bits each w

In a preferred embodiment the page relative internal references are specified on a per page basis to w bits each in order to flexibly and dynamically determine the nodes per page and the page size for a specific application scenario.

In a preferred embodiment each FASTpage index page has an associated offset somewhat like a base address that can be added to any external references to extend them.

Security Barriers. In a preferred embodiment an LEB128 like code would be used to identify tables fields or columns etc. within an index key where one bit of an 8 bit byte is used as a stop bit for variable length values with the consequence that only 7 bits per byte remain for data yielding 2 7 or 128 possible values hence the name . When a security barrier is enabled at a particular level in such an embodiment the LEB128 like code would be replaced with a similar but modified code where the first byte is special by virtue of having a bit dedicated to flag the presence of a security barrier and with the rest of the bytes if any being LEB128 like as before. With the extra flag bit dedicated to the security barrier the first byte can now take on only 2 6 or 64 possible values. When the security barrier flag is NOT SET it means that the byte sequence is NOT a security barrier and is therefore processed normally. When the security barrier flag IS SET it means that the first byte i.e. the one containing the security barrier flag and any continuation bytes collectively comprise a byte sequence that represents a security barrier and accordingly identifies a security policy that must be complied with after which i.e. if and only if the security policy is complied with the next immediately following byte sequence may be processed normally up to the next security barrier if any .

In the following example a series of tables Table 7 through Table 17 is used to depict how a series of words is in inserted into a FASTpage index. The table name indicates the word whose insertion is depicted and the table itself depicts the content of the depicted index. Note that each table has an upper part containing simple internal nodes with a column HEADER to identify what the upper data represents and a lower half containing compound leaf nodes if any with a column FOOTER to identify what the lower data represents. In this example each simple node has a 4 byte allocation comprising a tuple containing the subject character and internal child references i.e. Char Left Middle Right. Each compound leaf node has a variable length allocation comprising a tuple containing SimpleNodeOffset ExternalReference.

Load balancing and other resource sharing information is shared as typed block data in standard heartbeat messages. The information content and frequency of distribution varies according to a hierarchy of granularity that reflects the degree of locality most affected by the information.

In a preferred embodiment SHADOWS recognizes several hierarchical granularities of locality that can be configured as required to appropriately represent resource distributions and comprising at least the following notional levels of granularity along a spectrum Machine more fine grained Site Neighborhood Community. Region World less fine grained .

In this discussion Machine may be taken to be the most fine grained locality because it is sufficient for teaching purposes but there are usually also finer grained localities and the same principles apply the hierarchy actually extends in both directions . For example in a preferred embodiment the Machine which is a SCRAM node that is described elsewhere comprises a set of Quadrants each of which comprises a set of Lobes and an optional set of Blades where each Lobe and optionally any Blade comprises at least one MASTER and typically at least one SLAVE and both MASTERs and SLAVEs are typically multi core processors.

Sharing of intra locality specific load balancing information occurs within each hierarchical granularity and sharing of summarized load balancing information occurs by pushing it to the next less fine grained level. Note In a preferred embodiment this information sharing is implemented with secure multicasting wherever and whenever such multicasting is feasible for efficiency and with secure simulated multicasting otherwise. 

For example within a specific Machine e.g. among the multiple processors of a multiprocessor machine information sharing is more fine grained i.e. more detail and shared at a higher frequency than across the Site containing the Machine or the Neighborhood containing the Site etc. Similarly within a Neighborhood information sharing is more fine grained than across the Community containing the Neighborhood or the Region containing the Community etc.

Every Machine shares load and resource information with its Site at a relatively high frequency compared to the summarization of the Site s information . Likewise every Site shares load and resource information with its Neighborhood at a relatively high frequency compared to the summarization of the Neighborhood s information and so on.

Accordingly load balancing information is fresher within a Machine than within a Site or Neighborhood but fresher within a Neighborhood than within a Community and so on.

Note that the information roll up technique described here is not limited to load balancing information but is generally applicable to other information related to resource sharing and is especially useful for quantified classification of resource availability i.e. relative capacity available rather than relative current load . Resource information can also be much finer grained than the available of a general resource such computing capacity it may extend for example to the capacity for handling a very specific task or to the level of energy production fuel reserves network bandwidth etc. The resulting information is particularly actionable when used in conjunction with Think Globally Act Locally decision making processes such as those used by the MASTER described elsewhere to determine its immediate propensity to offload tasks through delegation vs. handling them locally vs. volunteering to take on even more tasks.

On an event driven basis every Machine shares only significant changes in its load or resources where significance is statistically designated by for example a change in quartile. In a preferred embodiment load classification by quartile is used and each quartile class is represented by just two bits. By using quartiles changes in classification occur relatively slowly and provide natural hysteresis which is very desirable. When a quartile change does occur it represents a substantive and therefore usually actionable change in load classification. Causal factors e.g. load spike failed CPU etc. may optionally be shared if known and if allowed required by policy at the cost of increased communication overhead in a preferred embodiment such information is not shared generally but rather is shared only with those processes or other entities that have a need to know .

On a periodic basis every Machine re establishes a baseline for its load and available resources by sharing fine grained information with its Site which includes its partner and by keeping track of information shared by affiliated Machines peers within its Site. Thus every Machine has Machine level load info for all its peers by definition all the affiliated Machines within its Site .

On a predetermined basis in a preferred embodiment round robin turn taking is used determined by assigned time slot each Machine also summarizes its Site s load info and shares it with both its Site i.e. with all the peer Machines for whom it is summarizing information and with its Neighborhood i.e. with all the Sites that are peers of its Site . Each Machine takes a turn periodically in order to amortize the overhead across the Site s multiple Machines . The summary includes a list expressed or implied of the Site s Machines and their Machine indices ranked by quartile in a preferred embodiment quartile is used but other classifications schemes are usable .

This summarization process occurs at each hierarchical level. Thus every Machine has access to summarized Machine level load and resource information for every affiliated Machine in the Site and Site level information for every affiliated Site in the Neighborhood and Neighborhood level information for every affiliated Neighborhood in the Community and so on.

In a preferred embodiment a multiplicity of peers at each level but representing only a portion of the peers at that level say n of them is responsible for each roll up operation. Each such peer uses the same information basis to independently create a roll up dataset which should be identical to those created by the other n 1 participating peers . The dataset is then compressed encrypted sliced and FEC encoded with a systematic n k code such that any k of the slices where k

An untrusted node such as an end user PC or non Scrutiny server also referred to as the subject machine can be configured with SHADOWS software processes that enable its participation in the SHADOWS supercomputing infrastructure. Any PC or server machine regardless of its PC or server label can serve as both a SHADOWS client for one or more end users or as a SHADOWS server.

No end user software processes running on an untrusted node are ever allowed to communicate with the SHADOWS infrastructure directly. All communication must take place via one or more agent processes SHADOWS agents installed and or executing on the user s machine. Table 18 identifies some of the key communications and process actors.

In particular non SHADOWS software e.g. user applications can communicate only with local SHADOWS DELEGATEs which in turn communicates only with its local RUSHrouter. Locally installed SHADOWS SERVANTs SERVANT agents if any can also communicate with the local RUSHrouter which is responsible for all external communications. The user local RUSHrouter further implements one or more MARSHAL roles that communicate with their assigned MARSHAL teams more on this later via one or more wide area networks WANs . Each MARSHAL may also communicate with other nearby MARSHALs as specifically instructed by its MARSHAL team. The MARSHAL team communicates amongst itself and with other MARSHAL teams as necessary and permitted in order to reach the WAN facing FLAMERouters of the back end SHADOWS infrastructure which themselves act as MARSHALs such that a mere MARSHAL doesn t actually know when or if it is actually communicating with a FLAMERouter .

The SHADOWS infrastructure consists of a widely distributed cloud of dedicated back end supercomputing and storage nodes augmented by a collection of user supplied computing and storage resources untrusted nodes . The back end supercomputing and storage nodes provide the resources necessary to achieve a basic level of service under the terms of a basic service level agreement SLA .

However users can extend this basic service via Quid Pro Quo SLA which provides a means to leverage the actual capacity of their local resources. For example a user typically consumes much less than 10 of the available computing capacity over a 24 hour period leaving more than 90 unused and therefore wasted. Under the terms of the Quid Pro Quo SLA and with the support of the SHADOWS infrastructure a user can not only take advantage of nearly 100 of the available capacity but can do so when it is needed most. The combination of a Quid Pro Quo SLA and the SHADOWS infrastructure essentially allows a user to bank the unused or unneeded resources and recall them on demand.

For example we can measure compute time in CPU seconds CPU minutes or CPU hours. Compiling a simple software source code file might consume 100 of a CPU for anywhere from a fraction of a second to several minutes. However compiling an operating system like Linux with say 17 000 files might take 3 hours or more on a fast machine and the CPU might not be at 100 the whole time depending on the speed of the machines disk drives. For the sake of discussion let s say that compiling Linux locally requires 180 CPU minutes 3 hours at 100 CPU and we ll ignore the number of CPUs CPU speed disk speed etc. for now . Under the terms of the Quid Pro Quo SLA if the SHADOWS infrastructure had already been able to take advantage of 180 CPU minutes of idle computing resources on the user s machine then the user would have banked sufficient resources to recall them all at once and apply them to a single task all on an automated basis . In this case the task of compiling Linux would be carried out by the Quid Pro Quo augmented SHADOWS infrastructure which means that all 17 000 files would be compiled in parallel with the user specified options and the results returned to the user s machine. The compilation itself might take only a second or two but let s just say less than a minute rather than 3 hours which is a significant speedup and would exhaust the banked 180 CPU minutes all at once. Additional resources would be consumed for communicating and storing requests and results but this is also done optimally under the SHADOWS infrastructure.

A user s computation and data storage resources cannot be trusted by the SHADOWS infrastructure which mandates special processes in order to achieve the high level of security required. This extra processing creates an overhead that must be accounted for in the Quid Pro Quo SLA but otherwise provides the same benefits high security and data integrity to the user contributing the resource as for other users.

When talking about untrusted nodes in the context of the SHADOWS infrastructure it is useful to distinguish between the foreground processing background processing and communications processing that occurs locally i.e. on the subject machine e.g. the user s PC or a server belonging to the user s employer . In this context foreground processing refers to any SHADOWS processing that is performed locally to satisfy the immediate request s of a bona fide user. Background processing refers to any SHADOWS processing that is performed locally to satisfy the Scrutiny SHADOWS Quid Pro Quo SLA associated with the subject machine. Communications processing refers to any local processing and communications required to satisfy the combined communications needs of foreground processing or background processing.

End user software applications can integrate with the SHADOWS infrastructure through a SHADOWS DELEGATE which is essentially an application specific proxy or gateway that provides the necessary interface. The user facing side of the DELEGATE implements one or more APIs application programming interfaces and or protocols needed by the user s software applications and to be provided by SHADOWS . Examples would include various file systems version control systems database managements systems directory systems email systems instant messaging VoIP etc.

In general each DELEGATE provides a single minimalist user facing API that implements a particular API and or protocol. For example one DELEGATE might implement the MAPI email messaging protocol while another DELEGATE implements the IMAP email messaging protocol. If IMAP isn t needed then the IMAP DELEGATE is not installed. Likewise if the user needs both the proprietary Oracle DBMS and the open source MySQL DBMS to be available then the appropriate DELEGATE can be installed for each.

Regardless of the user facing API or protocol implemented by a particular DELEGATE the SHADOWS facing side of the DELEGATE implements the SHADOWS RUSH protocol. Thus the DELEGATE is essentially a protocol and data translation process interposed between a user s software application and the SHADOWS infrastructure. In each case the user s software application depends on some functionality external to itself which is normally provided by another local or remote software application or service and it is the role of the appropriate DELEGATE to emulate that functionality. The DELEGATE itself rarely implements the functionality on its own but rather simply provides bi directional translations of requests and responses while communicating with the SHADOWS infrastructure to do most of the actual work.

A DELEGATE need not be installed as a service on the subject machine it may run on demand as an application. For example a software developer could locally run a compiler from a make file. The actual compiler can be replaced with a DELEGATE that is responsible for the compilation but which securely communicates with the SHADOWS infrastructure to do the actual work and return exactly the same results that would have been returned by the local compiler but with improvements in one or more dimensions e.g. less elapsed time deeper analysis etc .

Note that if a user requests that changed files be automatically archived to the SHADOWS infrastructure this is still considered foreground processing although it may occur at reduced priority because it is requested by the user on behalf of the user.

First note that very little if any background processing occurs except under the terms of the Quid Pro Quo SLA.

In the SHADOWS infrastructure background processing on an entrusted node is always carried out by a SERVANT agent or simply SERVANT . Using the UNCAP protocol instructions and data are sent from the SHADOWS infrastructure back end via FLAMERouter s to multiple MARSHALs across WANs to the RUSHRouter acting as MARSHAL on the subject machine. The RUSHrouter routes the communications to the SERVANT which acts on the received instructions and data. In general all or some of the data is cached in a local associative memory structure but portions may be also be stored persistently only as directed in a specific encrypted container intended for that purpose. In general the encrypted persistent store contains insufficient information to accomplish any task including basic data retrieval. The UNCAP protocol depends heavily on forward error correction FEC and bits of information supplied only on an as needed JIT basis. Most UNCAP instructions to a SERVANT are provided in terms of operators actions to take and operands specified objects on which to operate and the information necessary to construct either one may not arrive until just before it is needed at which point it is cached in memory rather than stored persistently.

FEC is also used to return actual results of a particular operation. For results that seem to be novel FEC can be used as instructed to encode any results which may be partially cached and partially stored and more importantly only partially returned to the SHADOWS infrastructure or forwarded elsewhere as requested . By using FEC each SERVANT sends only a fraction of the result taking advantage of the almost always smaller uplink capacity associated with the subject machine while taking also taking advantage of the almost always larger downlink capacity of the target recipient by receiving an aggregation of inputs from diverse SERVANTs. The ability to capitalize on asymmetric uplink downlink capacities is particularly beneficial for communicating interim results among a large collection of SERVANTs under the direct control of the SHADOWS infrastructure. Corrupt and or unresponsive SERVANTs are easily detected and worked around by the combination of FEC and encryption among other techniques. SERVANTs are not provided with communication capability except that required to communicate with their local interior MARSHAL.

One of the operations of a SERVANT process is to launch a subordinate SERVANT process and register it with its MARSHAL the subordinate SERVANT must also register directly . The subordinate SERVANT process executable is first created from cached and or stored objects just like any other result under the auspices of the SHADOWS infrastructure. Once the synthesis is approved it is then launched as a separate request which also requires concurrence of the local RUSHrouter which cannot withhold concurrence unless something isn t quite right . The local MARSHAL may kill any local SERVANT process and may also causes its own virtual machine to be restarted by crashing itself if need be . SERVANT processes may thus be created and deleted on the fly but each is completely expendable. In fact from the SHADOWS infrastructure viewpoint every aspect of a user s machine is expendable.

Background processing is always subordinate to foreground processing and thus the SERVANT may relinquish control whenever there is foreground processing to do which could be due to any DELEGATE or any other application under user control .

When servicing users RUSH is the only visible protocol after the user s application programming interface API up to and including the SHADOWS FLAMERouter. On the user side the API is terminated locally by the associated resident DELEGATE process which serves as a stateful protocol translator API to RUSH and application gateway. Here s a typical interface sequence User App DELEGATE RUSHrouter MARSHAL MARSHAL MARSHAL FLAMERouter MASTER

Note that the FLAMERouter on the server side has an embedded MASTER and can fully terminate the RUSH protocol. The FLAMERouter s MASTER can communicate with other internal MASTERs using RECAP.

When a user s machine or actually a SERVANT on the user s machine is servicing SHADOWS the UNCAP protocol is tunneled through RUSH such that RUSH is still the only visible protocol SERVANT RUSHrouter MARSHAL MARSHAL MARSHAL FLAMERouter MASTER

In this scenario the SHADOWS SERVANT natively uses the RUSH protocol so no user API is involved. On the server side which is actually the originating end UNCAP which is tunneled over RUSH is used to direct the SERVANT. RECAP traffic occurs only between the MASTER and the FLAMERouter which has an embedded MASTER but does not propagate to RUSH.

The SHADOWS infrastructure frequently needs to take advantage of one way links unicast or multicast because requiring a return path imposes an unnecessary constraint on the system. Thus all route planning is based on one way routes. This also turns out to be very advantageous when asymmetric links are to be used such as ADSL. In any case RUSH models all bidirectional links as two unidirectional links because the presence of one direction e.g. reception does not imply the correct functioning of the other e.g. transmission . This same principle holds for radio frequency and optical traffic used for RUSH communications.

Given a need for one way communication between two SHADOWS sites A and B there are likely to be multiple paths each consisting of one or more links any or all of which could apparently be utilized. The effect of actually selecting and utilizing one particular path over another may have significant consequences in terms of delay cost and or reliability.

Any link that is defined in terms of one or more usage and or capacity thresholds e.g. bursting limits capacity windows etc. is modeled in SHADOWS as a set of related sub links each defined by its own set of thresholds. Given a set of sub links the links must be labeled in ascending order of sequential use e.g. A1 is used before A2 etc. .

The SHADOWS infrastructure dynamically characterizes the paths especially the major ingress egress points and intermediate SHADOWS nodes between its various sites and creates a plan for each site that allocates one way traffic to each possible destination site along its outbound links in such a way as to globally optimize the use of each link. The allocation of traffic is dynamic in that it may be re planned on a periodic or event driven basis but is almost always event driven expiration of a plan is considered an event as is any major perturbation in SHADOWS network status .

Route planning generally strives to achieve several potentially conflicting goals. Conflicts among goals may not occur or may be of no consequence as long as link utilization stays below some bottleneck threshold. One of the desirable side effects of route planning is to identify and monitor actual or potential inter site bottlenecks in the SHADOWS network and to recommend or ideally to execute provisioning changes.

For route planning purposes at any point in time there is a set of parameters that statistically characterizes a particular path from site A to site B and this set depends on a similar set of parameters that characterizes each of the links in the path. The statistical path and link parameters comprise at least some combination of the following 

Energy usage is a key consideration for survivability especially for systems that must continue to operate when the utility power grid is down and for systems that routinely operate off grid. Although a given site may load shed to an extreme degree such as getting rid of all processing and storage tasks leaving only communications in order to avoid a potential network partition there can still be a critical shortage of energy especially if prolonged periods must be endured.

Communications and particularly transmissions can be highly consumptive of sparse energy resources. For that reason SHADOWS and specifically the RECAP and RUSH protocols considers energy use as an optionally advantageous part of its resource information. The RUSH protocol in particular considers energy usage in its routing algorithms such that during certain resource scenarios routing occurs in such a way as to maximize network coverage while minimizing energy usage. In this context the overriding goal is to conserve as much energy as possible but expend as much energy as necessary to prevent a network partition.

In a preferred embodiment of the SHADOWS infrastructure each SHADOWS site has multiple external communication channels that connect it directly or indirectly to all other SHADOWS sites via a diverse variety of networks VLAN WAN WLAN etc. over a combination of optical wired terrestrial wireless and satellite wireless links. Normally only a few of these links as few as one is needed to prevent a network partition. In a strictly site local energy crisis survival of the site preventing a network partition may be a simple matter of choosing the link with the lowest power requirement. However in the case of a site whose presence is pivotal in keeping several other sites connected the problem is more complex. Such a problem could occur for example if the local site is the only survivor capable of connecting two parts of a mesh and both of the parts depend on the local site for WAN connectivity. In this case the system uses the minimum number of links needed at appropriate power levels to safely prevent a network partition and the determination of a minimalist configuration requires understanding of the present nearby network topology since lower power can potentially be achieved by introducing more hops and a potentially more indirect path thereby trading away minimal latency or by taking advantage of packets that can be directly overheard at a given power level by nodes beyond the next hop.

In a preferred embodiment the power requirements for data transmission are determined and normalized into an energy cost per 512 byte packet. Other packet sizes are possible but 512 bytes is used as a normalization unit since it is a convenient and frequently occurring size in the SHADOWS infrastructure in anonymization networks various real time protocols and so forth.

A SHADOWS inter node messaging plan is a means for globally optimal use of locally available network communications links while dynamically adapting to a frequently changing network state.

Inter node messaging plans are created and maintained in quasi real time and are sufficiently event driven to account for network perturbations and state changes. However event driven doesn t mean message driven. Plans are not calculated on demand according to current outbound message load. Rather a single plan is expected to apply to a very large number of messages so that the amortized computational overhead can be relatively small.

Each messaging plan accommodates the both the recommended outbound link capacity and maximum outbound link capacity of a particular node. When plan recommendations are approached and or exceeded actionable messages occur to request automated workload shifting and or provisioning requests.

A messaging plan for one way A to B communications is simply for each QoS priority a list of next hop links or sub links that are to be used along with the percentage of data that is to be sent via each link.

Example The messaging plan data structure for point A the origin of a one way communication from point A to point B is conceptually similar to the following 

The idea is to pre validate session setup traffic in a way that shifts the burden of proof and the overhead of verifying that proof away from the SHADOWS infrastructure while simultaneously challenging inbound traffic originators in a manner that mitigates the threat of DDoS improves auditability and minimizes the use of SHADOWS resources.

On networks used to enable and facilitate automated communications with new or previously unconnected entities supplicants a beacon is transmitted that allows legitimate devices to sync up with and connect to the SHADOWS network in order to initiate additional steps in an identification and authentication process. A very important aspect of the SHADOWS beaconing mechanism is that the burden of proof is shifted away from SHADOWS to the devices desiring a connection. Although it may appear from the description below that there is significant overhead on the SHADOWS side it is illusory because the computations occur so rarely no more often than once per tens or hundreds of seconds and are then amortized over say thousands of inbound connections. The outbound beacon fragments are multicast or returned in special Hashcash enabled DNS requests and require little transmission overhead.

Beacons provide a low overhead defense layer intended to quickly obtain a pre validation estimate that answers the question friend or foe If the estimated answer is foe then it s actually definitive and low overhead traffic management techniques can be used to cause each such connection attempt to get stuck usually for a long time as determined by SHADOWS or by security policy but generally for long enough to decimate a DDOS attack . If the estimated answer is friend then enough access is allowed such that the next level of verification is possible.

In a preferred embodiment beacons are used for almost all initial communications with the SHADOWS network security policy determines the degree to which none some or all of the initial communications depends on successful use of beaconed information. but different beaconing tactics are used to help limit access to different resources. If beacons are in use to limit access to a resource then the resource cannot be accessed successfully without first interpreting the beacons correctly.

In a preferred embodiment a sequence of beacons is transmitted via a multiplicity of time varying communications channels with legitimate beacons camouflaged among bogus beacons both on a given channel and also among different channels. In a preferred embodiment the mix of communications channels used for beacon transmissions changes over time so that at any point in time a variety of legitimate channels is available for hearing a mix of legitimate and bogus beacons along with a variety of channels where only bogus beacons are heard. Any listening device can potentially hear the beacons but only bona fide communications partners can understand and easily separate the legitimate beacons from the bogus beacons doing so requires both detailed process protocol knowledge typically built into hardware and also knowledge of several public and private cryptographic keys. In the next two paragraphs the values of s p and d referred to respectively in the context of 1 of s 1 of p and 1 of d are all values that can be computed by a supplicant based on a reasonably accurate knowledge of time and a completely correct knowledge of the aforementioned process protocol. The correct values of s p and d are needed to select from among the sets of cryptographic keys that are supposedly known to the supplicant.

In the SHADOWS network a legitimate beacon comprises the current date current time a nonce and a 1 of s digital signature associated with the SHADOWS time keeping authority a BOSS team . Although the nonce value is by definition a random value it is tracked internally and must be used by successful supplicants. A bogus beacon is very similar except that the nonce field and digital signature are both filled with random data values that are not tracked and where the nonce field is guaranteed to differ from any currently legitimate nonce value.

Prior to transmission a legitimate beacon is encrypted with a 1 of p private key associated with the SHADOWS beacon service then with a 1 of d private keys associated with supplicants devices many supplicant devices share the same 1 of d keys so these aren t the same as the actual and unique private keys assigned to such devices .

Prior to transmission a bogus beacon is similarly encrypted but with any randomly selected 1 of p private key associated with the SHADOWS beacon service except for the presently correct one then with any randomly selected 1 of d private keys associated with supplicants devices except for the presently correct one.

Finally the legitimate beacon is divided into k packets and FEC encoded into n legitimate beacon packets with a n k erasure code. One or more bogus beacons are similarly FEC encoded into bogus beacon packets.

After encoding the legitimate n beacon packets are then transmitted periodically one at a time on the various legitimate beacon channels at a dynamically determined rate and transmission pattern interspersed with bogus beacon packets with a dynamically determined and appropriate percentage of packets going over each legitimate channel. The bogus beacon packets are also transmitted over one or more of the currently non legitimate beacon channels.

When a bona fide communications partner is ready to initiate communications with the SHADOWS network it first obtains a reasonably reliable estimate of the current date and time rounded to the nearest minute and then uses it to compute a message digest of a sequence comprising data from the following tuple 

Secret knock increasingly sophisticated pattern involving sync knowledge crypto client side burden stickiness.

Classification as self vs. non self begins with address port protocol date time Hashcash consistency public private key.

A low saturation Bloom filter can be used to partially validate RUSHRouter traffic against virtual channel combinations that occur by detecting those which are clearly invalid. The idea is to use a Bloom filter at the network edge to reject bogus traffic without further processing. If traffic appears bogus e.g. attempted communication on an invalid virtual channel is detected via a Bloom filter then by definition it is bogus there are no false negatives . However if traffic appears legitimate it requires further validation.

The SHADOWS infrastructure actively manages inbound traffic including throttling it as necessary to insure that the SLAs for various classes of service are maintained. Traffic that is apparently or actually bogus has an associated class of service below all others and thus is also actively managed which includes deciding whether and to what extent connections and or packets can be dropped bandwidth reduced delayed by latency de prioritized etc.

Attackers may be able to compromise client side components to various degrees and thus may be able to get closer to hitting a particular target more quickly.

Although some clients may get further along in the pre validation process than others they and their traffic are internally classified as non self i.e. originated by an attacker as soon as pre validation fails. Pre validation may be allowed to continue temporarily after such a failure as though no failure occurred in order to mask the step in which the failure occurred and or to collect additional information that may be useful for characterizing an attack or attacker. In no case however can continued pre validation after a failure lead to successful validation.

RUSHrouters and other SHADOWS entities use the RUSH protocol which takes advantage of a SHADOWS specific flavor of directed spread spectrum addressing DSSA to balance the communications load across multiple virtual channels while also helping to validate RUSH traffic. Note A similar technique can be used with certain types internal traffic with suitably adapted DSSA configuration parameters. . DSSA exhibits an apparently random hopping around behavior that cannot be replicated without knowledge of the configuration parameters and cryptographic keys used to generate the behavior. Incorrect hopping behavior triggers SELF reporting and likely escalation.

In conjunction with DSSA the RUSH protocol also takes advantage of a distributed efficiently amortizable CPU cost function with no trap door e.g. a Hashcash like algorithm in order to reduce the risk of DDoS by creating an asymmetric initialization burden i.e. the client side RUSH protocol initiator has a much greater burden than the server side connect point .

The need for further validation if the traffic appears legitimate is partly due to the inherent properties of Bloom filters which could be easily circumvented with a FASTpage index at higher resource cost but mostly due to the fact that the RUSH protocol s DSSA hopping behavior is intended to be a low overhead front end mechanism that simply helps to determine friend or foe at the network edge. Thus it is like the a series of secret handshakes that must succeed before other more costly validation tests are attempted e.g. exchanging digital credentials initially but also just the ongoing encryption and decryption associated with routine communications . Note A relatively static large window set of DSSA configuration parameters can be used prior to authentication these may be somewhat vulnerable but still create a useful entry barrier . Another set of DSSA configuration parameters can be issued and used after authentication. . Also because the hopping behavior is ongoing it serves as a low cost mechanism to help assure continuous traffic validation there s no point in using cryptographic techniques to validate a message if one already knows it cannot be valid .

The presence of bogus traffic is a direct indication to SELF that one or more non self communications agents are engaging or attempting to engage in unauthorized communications with the SHADOWS infrastructure.

RUSHrouters obtain sets of DSSA configuration parameters from the MARSHALs to which they connect under the auspices and control of a MASTER led team and they do so using Byzantine agreement see also BOSS . Every agent may have its own parameters but in general multiple agents a non unity fraction of the total may safely share the same parameters without knowing it thus reducing the number of concurrent parameter sets that must be maintained on the server side.

In the SHADOWS implementation of DSSA for protocol validation the DSSA configuration parameters include an internal seed value to be used in conjunction with a high quality PRNG to generate sets of sequences of destination addresses ports and nonces that drive the adaptive hopping behavior of communications based on the RUSH protocol. Note A nonce is a randomly chosen value different from previous choices inserted in a message to protect against replays. . The DSSA configuration parameters also include the percentage of communications of each type to be transmitted via each channel and approximate time windows along with a mask that specifies which fields are required during the specified time window those not required are don t care . Note that the DSSA configuration parameters are relatively long lived e.g. perhaps minutes or hours compared to the durations of each DSSA hop e.g. seconds .

The destinations are aware of the specific DSSA configuration parameters for each set of RUSHrouters that shares parameters each set may include any number of RUSHrouters . At any point in time the concurrently active DSSA configuration parameters for each set of RUSHrouters can be aggregated into a single Bloom filter or into one of several Bloom filters as long as they share the same parameter definitions and format. The ability to merge Bloom filters enables the set of concurrently active DSSA configuration parameters to be both maintained individually so that obsolete ones can be deleted and new ones can be added and also combined into a merged filter that can be used for rapid traffic validation.

Note that for security reasons these parameters are suggestive rather than being precisely defined here.

When checking for a bogus message if any of the Bloom filter bits are zero FALSE the message is guaranteed to be bogus so validation processing can cease as soon as zero bits are detected. If all of the bits are set TRUE the message is likely legitimate but further processing is required before validation can be confirmed.

Note that the DSSA configuration parameters are relatively long lived e.g. perhaps minutes or hours compared to the durations of each DSSA hop e.g. seconds .

The destinations are aware of the specific DSSA configuration parameters for each set of RUSHrouters that share parameters each set may include any number of RUSHrouters . At any point in time the concurrently active DSSA configuration parameters for each set of RUSHrouters can be aggregated into a single Bloom filter or into one of several Bloom filters as long as they share the same parameter definitions and format. The ability to merge Bloom filters enables the set of concurrently active DSSA configuration parameters to be both maintained individually so that obsolete ones can be deleted and new ones can be added and also combined into a merged filter that can be used for rapid traffic validation.

Note that for security reasons these parameters are suggestive rather than being precisely defined here.

When checking for a bogus message if any of the Bloom filter bits are zero FALSE the message is guaranteed to be bogus so validation processing can cease as soon as zero bits are detected. If all of the bits are set TRUE the message is likely legitimate but further processing is required before validation can be confirmed.

SHADOWS RUSHrouters running on user PCs and or servers receive digitally signed beacons with embedded time signals in packets originating from the SHADOWS network at variable but regular intervals. Note Any computing system containing a SHADOWS non trusted component e.g. DELEGATE SERVANT must also include at least one RUSHrouter to facilitate communication with the SHADOWS infrastructure. In a preferred embodiment each outbound channel interface e.g. a physical network interface wireless adapter etc. has a dedicated RUSHrouter operating in its own VM a separate RUSHrouter also in its own VM serves as the default gateway for the host computer interfacing any hosted applications to the SHADOWS infrastructure by appropriately routing communications through the RUSHrouters that control the channel interfaces. Also in a preferred embodiment the time signals originate from a set of stratum 1 NTP time servers embedded within SHADOWS machines e.g. sites with SCRAM nodes since these have internal atomic clocks with crystal controlled backup clocks and are designed to survive and remain accurate in the absence of national or international time sources e.g. GPS satellites . Alternatively any stratum 1 NTP time server will do. . The data to be uploaded regarding security events originating at the user s PC such as a scanning a fingerprint scan or reading a SmartCard is timestamped with both the local time and the last n SHADOWS time signals received where n is a configurable parameter but usually n 2 for authentication oriented security events . Thus the time associated with a security event can be guaranteed to be accurate within an epsilon that is controlled by the interval between SHADOWS time signals unless corruption is detected.

By considering the local time at a user s PC as well as one or more SHADOWS time stamps SHADOWS can more easily detect local attempts to defeat security such by adjusting a PC s clock and or interfering with network transmissions . Heartbeat events supply clues here also based on whether any are missing especially in the same timeframe that a security event occurs.

During known or extended periods of network congestion or in order to conserve bandwidth or server capacity local RUSHrouters which also have some ability to locally detect attempted local security breaches can be instructed ultimately by the SHADOWS SELF and BOSS functionality as to how they are to respond.

For instance a RUSHrouter may fail silently i.e. force a crash or restart of itself and or any SHADOWS components shut down the user s PC or server etc. or report back to the SHADOWS network with a specified set of information or some combination thereof. The RUSHrouter s ability to respond is also influenced to a large degree by whether the RUSHrouter itself has been corrupted or just the platform upon which it is operating. In the case of a RUSHrouter implemented within a self contained VM which is a preferred embodiment the RUSHrouter may continue to operate normally despite corruption in its physical host.

If the SERVANT is accompanied by and associated with a RUSHrouter described elsewhere which may also be implemented within a self contained virtual machine then in some configurations all of the physical host s communication may be directed toward the RUSHrouter acting as the default gateway and inbound communication may be directed to the RUSHrouter as a DMZ machine. In either or both of these scenarios the RUSHrouter accompanying the local SHADOWS SERVANT s can act locally and defensively to mitigate malicious outbound behavior by the physical host and inbound malicious traffic targeted at the physical host or at the SERVANT s for that matter and thereby possibly enable the SERVANT s to continue operating.

Every message type is associated with a Process Input Control List PICL a Process Output Control List POCL and a set of corresponding access control masks.

The PICL identifies each process that is allowed to input the message type and the POCL identifies each process that is allowed to output it. Each input or output access control mask is a variable length bitstring with one bit allocated for every process specified in the PICL or POCL .

There is exactly one IMM and one OMM for each message type in the system. The IMM and OMM are each represented by a quasi static value that can vary only when the system is reconfigured in one or more of the four following ways 

There is one ICM and one OCM for each subscriber for each message type in the system. Each ICM OCM mask has the same number of bits as the corresponding IMM OMM which associates each bit with a specific process. The IPM and OPM masks are each represented by a quasi static value that can vary only when the subscriber changes her or her effective preferences in some way.

Atomic Word. A variable length sequence of characters comprising the largest word or partial word which can be encoded and handled as a single unit. Examples My Dog has fleas .

Compound Word. A single word comprised of a sequence of two or more atomic words such that the sequence encountered hints at more complexity than would normally be encoded as a single atomic word. Examples 

Permanently Assigned Token PAT . A variable length unique identifier that is permanently assigned to a particular data value with the characteristics that the length of the PAT is relatively shorter than the length of the data value it identifies and thus can be used to uniquely represent the relatively longer data value. A PAT is always at least four bytes in length but has no natural maximum size although it can be artificially constrained .

Vocabulary Relative Token VoRT . A variable length unique identifier implemented as an unsigned LEB128 integer that is permanently assigned either to a raw data value or to a particular PAT with the characteristics that the length of a VoRT is relatively shorter than the length of the PAT it is associated with if any and thus can be used to uniquely represent the relatively longer PAT. A VoRT is always at least one byte in length but less than four bytes in length i.e. always shorter than a PAT .

Vocabulary. A specific associatively addressable collection of token pairs where each pair contains both a PAT and a VoRT. Partial pairs are not allowed i.e. for every PAT in the vocabulary there must be a VoRT and vice versa . Given either a PAT or a VoRT the vocabulary can be queried to determine its mate within the vocabulary providing that such a pairing exists. Note A pairing either exists or not there are no unpaired singleton entries. . There can be any number of vocabularies and each has a permanent unique identifier which serves to identify its namespace VoRT values can overlap among vocabularies so whenever VoRTs are used the identifier of the vocabulary they re relative to must be specified .

The idea is to enable the creation of a level of indirection between a document and its word indices by referencing every encoded document element to a particular vocabulary whenever appropriate. In subsequent usage e.g. such as when compressing a document there may be multiple concurrent vocabularies for each document a variable number of bits in the first byte of each compression tag provide for on the fly vocabulary switching .

Note The concepts described here do not relate to an individual document but rather to an entire corpus or lexicon. Individual documents or other artifacts can then be specified synthesized analyzed and or compressed relative to the available vocabularies.

1. Virtual Global Word List. A list of globally unique words is maintained such that every word ever encountered is added to a virtual global list and given a permanently assigned token PAT in the system. The PAT is the long mechanism for uniquely specifying a word using a variable length identifier. Each PAT is at least 4 bytes in length and specifies exactly one word. Responsibility for list updates is distributed globally among SHADOWS MASTER teams partitioning is such that every possible word belongs to exactly one MASTER team and that team is responsible for adding new words to the team s partition of the global word list assigning a PAT and distributing the new word PAT tuple to the various SHADOWS sites so they can update their non authoritative local copies of the virtual global world list. Note This distribution responsibility includes both initial distribution as words are added and on demand distribution as local copies of the global list are discovered to need new words added. Note that on demand distribution includes words that are truly new as well as existing words the site did not know about for whatever reason. Actually the local copy of the global word list is authoritative for words that are present in the list but not words that are absent. . In a preferred embodiment each list as described here is maintained via a distributed FASTpage index.

2. Virtual Local Copy of Virtual Global Word List. In the same way that the virtual global word list is distributed globally among SHADOWS MASTER teams a virtual local copy of that list is distributed locally i.e. at a site or within a neighborhood among local SHADOWS MASTER teams so that each such team is responsible for maintaining and searching a specific partition of the local copy on behalf of the other MASTERs in that locale. If a local word search in the correct partition doesn t yield a matching word PAT tuple then the locally responsible team passes the word to the responsible global team. In a preferred embodiment each list as described here is maintained via a distributed FASTpage index.

3. Encryption of Tuples. In a preferred embodiment the word PAT tuples are encrypted prior to insertion into the list. In this case a target word or PAT to be searched for must first be encrypted and then the encrypted value is sought.

4. Multiple Vocabularies. There may be many vocabularies the point of which is to enable words that occur together naturally to also occur together in a vocabulary any word may occur in multiple vocabularies however . Vocabularies are particularly useful for data compression and for creating implicit relationships among artifacts. Note The mere fact that two artifacts share the same vocabulary serves as a point of commonality. . In a preferred embodiment each vocabulary as described below is maintained via a distributed FASTpage index. From a process perspective the team based handling of vocabularies exactly parallels the handling of the virtual global word list as described in 1 2 and 3 above the actual teams partitioning and encryption may differ as appropriate .

5. Vocabulary Specific Encoding. Rather than storing the actual word in each vocabulary the word s associated PAT is stored instead. To add a word to a vocabulary a relatively short vocabulary specific code a VoRT is assigned to the word or rather to the relatively longer PAT associated with the word resulting in a VoRT PAT tuple that is simply inserted into the vocabulary analogously to the process in 1 2 and 3 above.

6. Most Valuable Characters. Each vocabulary also includes a list of the 63 most frequently used or otherwise most valuable characters which may include multibyte Unicode characters in that vocabulary each of which is assigned a 6 bit non zero code see Leader Byte below .

7. Structure of a PAT. The first byte in a PAT is the leader byte and the last byte is the trailer byte. In a PAT of n bytes where n 3 the first n 1 bytes describe the root word or stem and the following trailer byte describes the details suffix capitalization accents etc. .

8. Compound Words. In the case of an irregularly capitalized word like ScrutinyAgent it is encoded as a single PAT sequence describing a compound word. The PAT sequence is formed by juxtaposing each PAT of the individual words comprising the compound word with its counterparts in the same relative order as the parts of the compound word and setting the compound word bit in each individual word but the last.

9. Leader Byte. The leader byte determines how the data immediately following it is encoded. The allocation of information in the leader byte is as follows 1 bit Numeric flag indicates whether the atomic word is a number or an alphabetic string 6 bits either a signed LEB64 Numeric value 0 63 which may be combined with subsequent signed LEB128 bytes to form a number of arbitrary precision or a Small Alphabet character any of the 63 most valuable characters or if not then a null value as an escape to indicate that the next byte which may be any 8 bit value contains the first character in place of the 6 bit value 1 bit Last byte flag i.e. signals the last byte of an atomic word in the case where the leader byte is the only byte including the Small Alphabet scenario where the next byte stands in as the first byte . Each vocabulary can optionally specify the associated 63 character alphabet each character of which has a 6 bit identifier that can represent an arbitrary Unicode character even a multi byte character within a single leader byte.

10. Trailer Byte. The trailer byte describes the details suffix capitalization accents etc. of how the preceding bytes of the word are to be interpreted and what the suffix is if any. By simply ignoring the trailer byte a word oriented operation can compare canonical word roots. The allocation of information in the trailer byte is as follows 2 bits Capitalization specification irregular lower first only upper 4 bits Normal but vocabulary specific word suffix specification such as ed ee er es ie ies ing or y etc. 1 bit Compound word flag includes next word 1 bit Last byte flag i.e. signals last byte of an atomic word .

11. Overlapped Vocabulary Namespace. In a preferred embodiment the first 2 bytes of a PAT overlap with the 2 byte namespace allowed for each vocabulary which allows 1 or 2 bytes per word and uses 1 bit per byte to signal continuation thus such a vocabulary is limited to 16K of the most valuable words .

12. Tri Word Phrases. In a preferred embodiment a dictionary of three word phrases is maintained. Each three word phrase is represented as a sorted tuple smallest PAT middle PAT largest PAT trailer byte where 3 bits of the trailer byte are needed to specify the order of the words encountered there are 6 possible orderings relative to the default sorted order . There would be a pairing of a phrase PAT value with a triplet of sorted word PAT values. Searching for a word PAT triplet would return a phrase PAT value with trailer byte if one exists. Searching for a phrase PAT value with trailer byte would return a triplet of sorted word PAT values if one exists. Searching for a phrase PAT value without a trailer byte would return all the corresponding triplets of sorted word PAT values if any. There can only be 3 6 such triplets at most.

One of the CORE methods implemented in a PUMP device is that associated with the UpdateMovingAverages iValue message.

In a preferred embodiment the CORE method corresponding to the UpdateMovingAverages iValue uses a 16 byte data structure 4 of them fit in a 64 byte cache line and 32 of them fit in a 512 byte sector . The data structure comprises a set of bit fields as follows 

As should be apparent to anyone skilled in the art the format including specific fields field widths and number of data points etc. and resulting space requirements of the 16 byte data structure were chosen for convenience and are somewhat arbitrary the essence of the process is easily adaptable to other formats and space requirements.

The UpdateMovingAverages iValue method is stateless it uses the integer parameter iValue modulus 2n where n 4 to update the object data structure. Specifically the data structure contains the information necessary to maintain a circular buffer of 8 raw data points with an index to indicate where the head tail interface is that drives the current moving average CMA as well as a quadruple of slower moving recent moving averages RMA and a pair of the historical moving averages HMA . The RMA and HMA are essentially averages of averages after every so many cycles of updating the CMA s 8 raw data points the RMA is updated with the CMA and after every so many cycles of the updating the RMA s data points the HMA is updated with the CMA.

The update frequency of the CMA is driven by the frequency of the UpdateMovingAverages iValue message sent. With each invocation the oldest data point is dropped and the newest is added and a new CMA is calculated. The CMA has an associated 12 bit CMA cycle count that is incremented every time the CMA buffer index wraps around to zero i.e. after every 8th CMA update . Whenever this occurs the set of 4 recent moving average RMA data points is updated with the latest CMA dropping the oldest RMA data point in the process and a new RMA is then calculated. Likewise the RMA has an associated 12 bit RMA cycle count that is incremented every time the RMA cycle count wraps around to zero i.e. after every 4th RMA update . Whenever this occurs a pair of 2 historical moving average HMA data points is updated with the latest RMA dropping the oldest HMA data point in the process and a new HMA is then calculated.

In addition to the three moving averages a weighted moving average WMA is also calculated and this occurs with every invocation of the UpdateMovingAverages iValue according to the following formula WMA 2 CMA RMA HMA 4

This means that the 8 most recent data points carry 50 of the weight with 25 going to the recent moving averages and 25 to the historical moving averages. In operation all four averages WMA CMA RMA HMA are available and can be used as needed.

The FRAME subsystem comprises the following identifiable sub subsystems abbreviated with acronyms as means and these are depicted in 

FRAME is an energy production and or peak shaving energy management subsystem whose goal is to reduce operational costs and enhance or enable survivability. FRAME may significantly reducing the energy required to operate a heat dissipating system such as a computing system through the recuperative use of energy in general and by time shifting the generation and consumption of power to the most effective and or efficient time frames.

The FRAME subsystem may acquire energy renewably when possible and appropriate use energy efficiently to generate power conserve energy through recuperation and recycling and efficiently maintain energy storage reserves. FRAME is described here with respect to the node with which it is associated.

FRAME may significantly reduce the energy required to operate a heat dissipating system such as a computing system in general and in particular the SCRAM subsystem depicted in through the recuperative use of energy in general and by shifting the generation and consumption of power to the most effective and or efficient time frames. FRAME may also reduce the cost of energy required for operation by selecting from among the available energy sources and including economic considerations.

The basic idea underlying FRAME is to maximize the survivability of a site for example a computing and or communications facility whether manned or unmanned by adaptively minimizing its dependence on external energy sources and supplies. FRAME does so with an integrated automated system that controls and provides energy generation consumption conservation and storage along with automated interfaces for external replenishment and repair thereby minimizing human attention and energy expenditures as well .

In essence FRAME is like a highly integrated co generation power plant that is internal to the local node that is the node which directly depends on FRAME for power. As depicted in the box labeled SCRAM etc. represents just such an example where the SCRAM apparatus implements the primary functionality of the node containing both SCRAM and FRAME and where said functionality is also the node s primary power consumer . SCRAM is described in section 5.

However FRAME and its dependent node are actually co dependent because FRAME also depends on the node for waste energy. Maximal power optimization is possible through co operation by design and integration which are static and co operation by cooperative collaboration which are dynamic while the system is running. In a preferred embodiment parts of FRAME are so tightly integrated with the dependent node so as to significantly blur the boundaries between producing and consuming subsystems because of their symbiotic relationships such as exists between FRAME s RUBE sub subsystem and the SCRAM subsystem to which it connects via STEER as further described in section 10.3 .

More precisely FRAME is a power production and or peak shaving energy management subsystem whose goal is to enhance or enable survivability. In at least some contexts economy of operation is a fringe benefit rather than the primary driver. By design survivability and availability are primary drivers with economy of operation being a consequence of meeting two key survivability constraints 

Survivability is enhanced by significantly reducing operational costs especially labor and energy costs of both the local node and some larger system with which the local node is typically associated and in which the local node typically plays a part .

FRAME comprises some combination of six primary subsystems as depicted in these are summarized below and described in their respective sections 

SLAM A subsystem that may monitor track and control a node s physical environment including energy production storage and consumption maintain system time and geolocation authenticate and communicate with maintenance staff and call home. The SLAM apparatus is described more fully in section 10.1.

STEER A subsystem of manifolds valves and motive devices that may be computer controlled and that may work somewhat like a crossbar switch in order to dynamically control working fluid flow in a manner that may optimize the exchange of thermal energy between working fluids of different temperatures in such a way as to meet specific goals for the availability of the working fluids at specified temperature ranges. The STEER apparatus is described more fully in section 10.2.

RUBE A subsystem that may recuperate thermal energy boiling energy in the form of heated working fluids from hot spots and warm spots that may be exchanged for cooled working fluids with the thermal energy heat being transferred elsewhere where it may be put to good use . The RUBE apparatus is described more fully in section 10.3.

PERKS The PERKS apparatus may capture excess or low cost energy from a multiplicity of sources e.g. opportunistically such as when it is cheapest or most readily available and store it for later i.e. time shifted use such as during peak periods e.g. when power is relatively more expensive or less available . In a preferred embodiment as depicted in the context of the PERKS apparatus may intermediate the supplies of fuels and or electrical power from external sources including for example from or via a facility in which it may be located or co located storing a portion of the associated flow in convenient form and passing along the rest to internal consumers other subsystems .

FORCE As depicted in the FORCE apparatus is a kilowatt scale e.g. 0.5 KW to 50 KW modified Rankine cycle heat engine that may comprise some combination of various heat sources working fluids including at least one appropriate organic working fluid for two phase liquid vapor operation vaporizer superheaters low temperature low pressure vapor turbines generators and or alternators recuperators desuperheaters preheaters dehumidifiers condensers subcoolers and interfaces to STEER apparatus . In a preferred embodiment the primary object of the FORCE apparatus may be to convert externally supplied electrical energy chemical energy e.g. one or more types of fuel and or thermal energy e.g. heat contained in some type of working fluid into electrical energy and or thermal energy that may then be provided as an output to other subsystems. In a preferred embodiment said electrical energy may be output directly to the PERKS apparatus for subsequent further conversion storage and or distribution. In a preferred embodiment high quality thermal energy may be provided as an output in addition to or in lieu of electrical energy. In a preferred embodiment said thermal energy may be output to the STEER apparatus for subsequent further transport conversion storage and or distribution. The FORCE apparatus is described more fully in section 10.5.

SOLAR The SOLAR apparatus comprises some combination of apparatus for tracking and or concentrating solar energy and directing it to a receiver where it may be collected and converted to thermal energy and transferred to a working fluid. In a preferred embodiment the SOLAR apparatus may also comprise a STEER apparatus interface for accepting and delivering working fluid to one or more companion subsystems e.g. the RUBE apparatus or FORCE apparatus etc. . The SOLAR apparatus is described more fully in section 10.6.

The HVAC CWS and other non storage thermal interfaces to the FRAME means as depicted in are described with the RUBE apparatus in section 10.3.

SLAM A subsystem that may monitor track and control a node s physical environment including energy production storage and consumption maintain system time and geolocation authenticate and communicate with maintenance staff and call home. 

In a preferred embodiment when the SELF see section 7 FRAME see section 10 DEFEND see section 12 and or WARN see section 13 subsystems are present the SLAM apparatus may integrate with one or more of them to implement cooperative functionality. In a preferred embodiment the SLAM apparatus may be an integral part of the FRAME subsystem .

In a preferred embodiment the SLAM apparatus may comprise a multiplicity of SLAM devices each of which may independently provide the full functionality of the SLAM apparatus.

In a preferred embodiment a SLAM device may implement the SELF functionality described in section 7. In a preferred embodiment at least one host processor within a SLAM device implementing the SELF functionality described in section 7 may specifically be enabled for the role of candidate MASTER and or MASTER as described in section 7.3.

In a preferred embodiment when a SLAM device is embedded into a SCRAM system where it may be reasonably secure from a physical point of view and where it may have nearby MASTERs to communicate with including other SLAM devices then it may have or acquire internal MASTER and BOSS capabilities that become enabled as described in section 7 in which case individual SLAM devices or the SLAM apparatus as a whole may participate in system wide security decisions.

In a preferred embodiment SLAM devices comprising the SLAM apparatus may be sufficient through cooperation Byzantine agreement logic as described in section 7.2 and mutual agreement that may result to enable each other to become MASTERs as described in section 7.3 even absent the participation of non SLAM MASTERs and non SLAM Candidate MASTERs. 

In a preferred embodiment when a SLAM device becomes a MASTER as described in section 7.3 it may delegate work to others including to other SLAM devices and thus offload a portion of its tasks. In a preferred embodiment offloaded tasks may typically include those which may be compute bound e.g. analysis and optimization . In this way SLAM devices may take advantage of the computational capabilities inherent in the system of which they may be a part.

In a preferred embodiment the SLAM apparatus depicted in may comprise decision making control and supervisory functions to oversee the operation of the FRAME subsystem as well as non FRAME subsystems to which FRAME may be connected. SLAM may also participate in the monitoring tracking and control of other i.e. non FRAME subsystems that depend on the FRAME apparatus within the local node. SLAM may be involved in the interfaces to external subsystems such as Facility HVAC CWS facilities and External Thermal Exchange Storage facilities .

In a preferred embodiment the SLAM apparatus depicted in monitors tracks and controls to the extent possible the physical environment of the node incorporating the FRAME apparatus including controlling the sibling FRAME subsystems i.e. STEER RUBE PERKS FORCE and SOLAR comprising said FRAME apparatus as described herein. In a preferred embodiment SLAM provides optionally advantageous SCADA supervisory control and data acquisition functions particularly with respect to establishing and maintaining the proper system thermal parameters and power generation usage parameters in order to optimize the use of the system s energy resources.

In a preferred embodiment the SLAM devices of the local node may collaborate with and coordinate with the SLAM devices in other nodes both local and remote in order to enhance survivability of both the local node and the SHADOWS network as a whole.

In a preferred embodiment the SLAM apparatus depicted in may provide steering and or other control signals not shown to the STEER apparatus flow control devices in order to optimize the temperature and pressure ranges associated with each of its embedded manifolds and pseudo reservoirs. The SLAM apparatus may interact with other subsystems and especially other FRAME subsystem components i.e. through to carry out the desired energy resource usage policies. In a preferred embodiment said control signals may be generated through cooperation among MASTERs and especially SLAM devices that are MASTERs Byzantine agreement logic as described in section 7.2 and mutual agreement that may result Byzantine agreement with respect to said control signals. In this way there may be increased assurance that the said control signals can maximize system survivability and optimize the overall operation of the system.

In a preferred embodiment the SLAM apparatus depicted in may contain a crystal controlled oscillator for maintaining relatively accurate time in the absence of external time synchronization signals. In a preferred embodiment said apparatus may synchronize with a GPS or other satellite originated signal and also with an external PPS pulse per second signal such as that available with a local or remote atomic e.g. Rubidium or Cesium based clock and which may provide a reconciled PPS output not shown . In a preferred embodiment high quality PPS inputs may originate with a commercially available miniature atomic clock module that may be internal to and integrated with the local SCRAM system .

In a preferred embodiment a SLAM device may be equipped with geolocation devices radio devices and or other devices that may be capable of acquiring or approximating the current time location and bearing through unidirectional or bidirectional communications from external sources including LEO low earth orbit or MEO mid earth orbit satellites communications towers wireless access points homing beacons and other signal transmitting or transceiving devices. In a preferred embodiment information acquired or inferred from said external geolocation sources may serve to inform a SLAM device s belief as to the current time location and bearing as well as its confidence in said belief and the SLAM device may use said belief to synchronize internal timekeeping and geolocation devices accordingly.

In a preferred embodiment a SLAM device may be equipped with internal timekeeping and geolocation devices that may be capable of approximating the current time location and bearing even in a GPS denied environment. In a preferred embodiment said internal geolocation devices may comprise a combination of oscillators electronic compasses inertial reference units three axis accelerometers and other suitable devices as may be available.

In a preferred embodiment SLAM s three axis accelerometers may sense movement and may thus be able to determine orientation of the system of which the SLAM may be a part as well as the direction and rate of movement if any. In a preferred embodiment SLAM s magnetic compass magnetometer may help.

In a preferred embodiment said accelerometers may also be useful for sensing vibration which may include vibration due to failed or failing components physical attacks and or other impacts to the equipment and seismic P waves which may provide sufficient warning often on the order of a few seconds or tens of seconds and may therefore enable the triggering of some emergency action. In a preferred embodiment if the WARN and or LISTEN subsystems are present not part of FRAME the SLAM may integrate with them in order to exchange sensory inputs and analyses threat time location accelerometer readings etc. and may also cooperate on monitoring and or maintenance functions.

In a preferred embodiment various sensory input signals may be made available simultaneously to multiple SLAM devices and MASTERs and such that Byzantine agreement with respect to the correctness of said signals may be reached through cooperation among MASTERs and especially SLAM devices that are MASTERs Byzantine agreement logic as described in section 7.2 and mutual agreement that may result from Byzantine agreement with respect to said sensory input signals. In this way there may be increased assurance that the said sensory input signals can maximize system survivability and optimize the overall operation of the system.

In a preferred embodiment SLAM devices may provide monitoring and tracking of high value assets said assets normally being the system itself or a subsystem to which a SLAM device may be attached or with which it may be co located.

In a preferred embodiment a SLAM device may be equipped with one or more communications channels that enable external communications including communications with authorized personnel. In a preferred embodiment said communications channels include a combination of wired and wireless channels suitable for secure communications with authorized personnel and with other authorized systems which may include the ability to call home to one or more authorized destinations to report intrusion attempts geolocation system status asset tracking information or other authorized information .

One possible embodiment of a SLAM device configuration is depicted in . In an alternate preferred embodiment there may be no actual SLAM device but rather the various SLAM I O devices may be distributed among the system s existing electronics modules for example with the SLAM device s processing responsibilities relegated to tasks or processes or virtual machines that may execute as part of the inherent workload of other processors within the system of which the SLAM device would otherwise be part.

In a preferred embodiment when a SLAM device is embedded into a SCRAM subsystem the preferred means of communications with maintenance personnel may be via a suitably equipped personal computer PDA or other device having reliable means of biometric sensory inputs e.g. fingerprint iris etc. for authentication over a multiplicity of secure wired and or wireless channels each such channel bearing a portion of the data stream with independent encryption keys. In an alternative embodiment any acceptably secure communications devices and or channels may be utilized for said purpose.

STEER A system of manifolds valves and motive devices that may be computer controlled and that may work somewhat like a crossbar switch in order to dynamically control working fluid flow in a manner that may optimize the exchange of thermal energy between working fluids of different temperatures in such a way as to meet specific goals for the availability of the working fluids at specified temperature ranges.

In a preferred embodiment the STEER apparatus depicted as part of the FRAME subsystem in may comprise dynamically reconfigurable plumbing interconnectivity such that some or all of the fluid based devices that may comprise its sibling subsystems such as pumps heat exchangers etc. may be adaptively and dynamically connected disconnected reconnected and or operated in reconfigurable patterns that may achieve particular purposes at a particular point in time. In a preferred embodiment such reconfigurations and operations may occur under the control of the SLAM apparatus so that thermal energy may be optimally routed to the various devices in the system with minimized energy loss or waste.

The STEER apparatus comprises a combination of pipes tubes joints manifolds and valves a combination of fixed and statically or dynamically adjustable valves under system control as necessary that may collectively work somewhat like a crossbar switch in order to dynamically control working fluid flow between various sources and sinks of thermal energy mixing working fluid of different temperature ranges as needed to meet specific goals for moving compatible working fluids in accordance with appropriate temperature and pressure ranges.

In the depiction of only three broad and non specific temperature ranges are shown as examples depicted by each arrow to or from STEER having one of three different cross hatch patterns but in principle as many ranges as needed may be used with separate means provided for each type of working fluid and operating regime. The key limitation driving the mixing may be the conservation of energy inputs and outputs and the need to blend changing temperatures and pressures adaptively while respecting the desired operating ranges which may vary over time . Note that although the STEER apparatus is depicted as a centralized box in in order to better visualize its role conceptually in a preferred embodiment its components may be conveniently distributed around the local system in order to more easily co locate them with their associated devices and connectors.

In order to control the rate of flow to various devices by using control signals from the SLAM apparatus depicted in the STEER apparatus may incorporate a Latching Digital Flow Rate Control Valve apparatus hereafter simply Rate Control Valve an example of which is depicted in .

As depicted in in a preferred embodiment each Rate Control Valve comprises a set of binary latching valves that may be individually latched open or closed and at least a common inlet manifold with inlet connection 231 a common outlet manifold with outlet connection 235 along with signaling connections e.g. depicted in as A B C and D and optionally sensory connections not shown appropriate to each binary latching valve .

In a preferred embodiment the inlet connection 231 and outlet connection 235 may be arranged to be on diagonally opposite sides of the Rate Control Valve i.e. in a reverse return configuration such that the path from connection 231 to connection 235 through any individual valve in the set of binary latching valves is the same length as the path through any other such individual valve in the set.

In a preferred embodiment a Rate Control Valve may comprise magnetic latching valves as binary latching valves specifically to conserve electrical energy since they can be automated yet relatively little electrical energy may be required to operate them and only then to toggle them from one position e.g. open or closed to the other e.g. closed or open respectively . In an alternative embodiment one or more non latching valves or motor valves may be substituted instead. In yet another alternative embodiment which may not be fully automatable one or more manually operated valves may be substituted.

In a preferred embodiment a Rate Control Valve may be constructed by connecting the inlets of a set of N binary latching valves to a common inlet manifold and connecting the outlets of said binary latching valves to a common outlet manifold. The example depicted in comprises a set of four binary latching valves so for this example N 4. A truth table for this example depicting the flow rates for the various input combinations is depicted in Table 19.

In a preferred embodiment the individual binary latching valves may be selected or constructed to accommodate the working pressures associated with their intended use and to ensure suitability with respect to the requisite control signaling and any relevant sensory requirements.

In a preferred embodiment a Rate Control Valve may be constructed such that the aggregate flow rates of the binary latching valves are the constraining factor. In an alternative embodiment something else may be the constraining factor. In either embodiment given a Rate Control Valve containing a set of N binary latching valves N 0 that are functioning correctly the rate of flow may be controllable into N 1 binary steps over a range of 0 to 100 with a step size equal to 100 N . For example a Rate Control Valve comprising four binary latching valves i.e. N 4 may have five 4 1 5 steps ranging from 0 to 100 at 25 intervals 100 4 25 corresponding to flow rates of 0 25 50 75 and 100 with built in redundancy for all intermediate steps but not for the zero flow and full flow settings . In a preferred embodiment redundancy for the zero flow and full flow settings may be created straightforwardly using known modular redundancy techniques e.g. such as TMR or triple modular redundancy .

Given a set of suitable binary latching valves constructed and configured as taught here the signaling connections may then be used to force the individual binary latching valves to a desired state according to the flow rate desired. When all the binary latching valves are actually closed the corresponding flow rate is zero which is clearly a trivial case. When all the binary latching valves are commanded closed the corresponding flow rate may be zero which is to say there is some possibility that at least one individual valve in the set may fail open. In a preferred embodiment apparatus that requires variable flow and also for example assured zero flow and or full flow may be created straightforwardly using known TMR triple modular redundancy techniques.

In a preferred embodiment when all the individual binary latching valves are open the corresponding flow rate of the Rate Control Valve may be constrained by whichever flow rate is most constraining i.e. the rates of the inlet and or outlet connections to their respective manifolds the rates of the manifolds themselves or the aggregate flow rates of the open binary latching valves.

In a preferred embodiment the optional sensory signals of the individual binary latching valves may be used to determine whether each particular valve is properly opened or closed. In an alternative preferred embodiment a flow sensor may be used to determine the aggregate flow thereby allowing the proper functioning of the binary latching valves to be inferred. In yet another preferred embodiment both techniques may be used together in order to increase confidence that the actual state is known.

In the case of individual binary latching valve malfunction significant redundancy accrues as N becomes larger and this is a fringe benefit of making the controllable flow rates increasingly fine grained i.e. smaller increments . In particular a valve that refuses to open or close can be worked around by opening or closing a different one instead. The special case of zero flow and full flow however cannot be made redundant without additional valves and a different configuration. Nonetheless it is straightforward and known in the art to accommodate the two special cases if necessary through modular redundancy where the entire Rate Control Valve is treated as a single modular device.

In a preferred embodiment of the STEER apparatus depicted in the Rate Control Valves nare monitored and controlled by the SLAM means and TMR triple modular redundancy which is known in the art is used to implement a high availability configuration of Rate Control Valves when system criticality warrants it.

In a preferred embodiment in order to dynamically reconfigure the flow to various fluid based devices without actually modifying the physical plumbing connections for example by using control signals from the SLAM apparatus depicted in the STEER apparatus incorporates one or more Parallel Series Reconfigurator devices hereafter each is simply called a Reconfigurator . For simplicity in a preferred embodiment each Reconfigurator supports only two devices and larger configurations may be supported by treating each two device Reconfigurator as a single device that can be substituted into a separate Reconfigurator apparatus operating at a higher level. In an alternate embodiment and with increased complexity additional devices may be supported within a single Reconfigurator by introducing additional control variables as desired and defining the appropriate control states.

In a preferred embodiment with fluid handling components connected as depicted in each Reconfigurator comprises a set of three binary latching valves i.e. valves that are latchable in either the open or closed position and require no electrical power to sustain their presently latched setting as depicted by and in and four devices suitable for splitting and or merging liquid flows e.g. Y couplings T couplings manifolds etc. such as those depicted by and for example in optional check valves not shown along with signaling connections e.g. depicted in as A B and C on latching valves and respectively and optionally sensory connections not shown appropriate to each binary latching valve.

In the Reconfigurator depicted in the flow enters at . In a preferred embodiment the flow capacity at entry point and exit point are normally at least equal to the aggregate capacity of the branches that split from into points and and ultimately the branches that merge again at point . In a preferred embodiment the branches at and and all other internal flow points including latches and are each at least equal to the flow capacity of the greater of the flow capacities of Device 1 and Device 2 . In a preferred embodiment flow capacities of Device 1 and Device 2 may be identical.

In a preferred embodiment a Reconfigurator may comprise magnetic latching valves as binary latching valves and specifically to conserve electrical energy since they can be automated yet relatively little electrical energy may be required to operate them and only to toggle them from one position e.g. open or closed to the other e.g. closed or open respectively . In an alternative embodiment one or more non latching valves or motor valves may be substituted instead. In yet another alternative embodiment which may not be fully automatable one or more manually operated valves may be substituted.

In a preferred embodiment a Reconfigurator s configuration may be determined by a truth table such as one having three binary control variables i.e. logical control inputs and thus having eight 2 3 8 possible states of which five are generally valid the other three states are not normally needed but may be used for special circumstances or unusual devices . Table 20 depicts a truth table relating to the configuration of corresponding to three latch control variables and eight possible configuration states.

In an alternative preferred embodiment one or more of the individual binary latching valves depicted in may each be substituted with a Latching Digital Flow Rate Control Valve apparatus as described in section 10.2.1 an example of which is depicted in . While such substitution may make the configuration significantly more complex conceptually it may be modeled easily and may afford opportunity to provide additional dynamic balancing of system flows including the possibility of taking advantage of one or more partial flow configurations listed in Table 20.

In a preferred embodiment a Reconfigurator may be used to dynamically re plumb a mated pair of devices e.g. Device 1 and Device 2 of from a parallel configuration i.e. A On B Off C On to a serial configuration i.e. A Off B On C Off or vice versa. In a preferred embodiment other combinations may be useful as indicated in Table 20. In a preferred embodiment said dynamic reconfiguration may be automated and or unattended.

For example a pair of pumps presently operating in parallel to maximize flow rate may be dynamically configured to operate in series instead perhaps in order to increase pressure as part of a work around for a failed or failing downstream component. In this particular example one might expect such a reconfiguration to cause the flow rate to be reduced as is commonly the case but this is not necessarily so because in a preferred embodiment the FRAME apparatus of which the STEER apparatus taught here may be a part may comprise variable speed pumps wherever pumps are used. Thus the tradeoff may be increased power consumption by the affected pumps rather than necessitating a change in operating pressures and or flows. There is of course the possibility that there would be no tradeoff at all such as in the case where a reduced flow rate is a feature of the intended reconfiguration such as with a modified power usage profile .

As another example a pair of heat exchangers that are operating in series to maximize the heat exchange for a particular scenario may be dynamically configured to operate in parallel instead perhaps in order to decrease pressure drop to compensate for a failed upstream pump or valve etc. or to simply achieve a different energy consumption rate or a different thermal profile.

In a preferred embodiment of the STEER apparatus depicted in multiple Reconfigurators may be combined as necessary to achieve nearly arbitrary parallel series combinations. For example in an environment where the energy availability power requirements cooling load ambient temperature etc. are all changing dynamically and possibly dramatically it may be very difficult to tune the system to a configuration that is optimal using conventional means. However the use of Reconfigurators may enable dynamic reconfiguration and tuning of the system to match changing real world requirements for example in conjunction with external control logic such as may be provided by SLAM apparatus depicted in .

In a preferred embodiment a specific type of Reconfigurator may be constructed as an assembly of a pair of mated devices plus other requisite parts such that the resulting assembly may be seen as having a single fluid input and a single fluid output along with a set of control and or sensory signals and having the function of a single device whose characteristics at a point in time are equivalent to the pair of mated devices operating in one of the desired configurations which may be a subset of those technically possible .

In an alternate preferred embodiment a specific type of Reconfigurator may be constructed as an assembly of a pair of non mated devices plus other requisite parts such that the resulting assembly may be seen as having a single fluid input and a single fluid output along with a set of control and or sensory signals and having the function of a single device whose characteristics at a point in time are equivalent to the pair of non mated devices operating in one of the desired configurations which may be a subset of those technically possible .

In an alternative preferred embodiment as depicted in a generalized Virtual Reconfigurator may be constructed without actually embedding or otherwise including the devices and but rather by providing two extra pairs of inlet outlet connections to accommodate a pair of said devices that are external and may be attached later plus the other requisite parts previously described such that the resulting assembly has a single fluid input and a single fluid output along with a set of control and or optional sensory signals plus two pairs of inlet outlet connections for the two devices to be attached later.

RUBE A subsystem that may recuperate thermal energy boiling energy in the form of heated working fluids from hot spots and warm spots that may be exchanged for cooled working fluids with the thermal energy heat being transferred elsewhere where it may be put to good use .

The RUBE apparatus depicted as part of the FRAME subsystem in may comprise devices for recuperating transferring and exchanging thermal energy contained in working fluids and these may be referred to hereafter as RUBE devices. 

In a preferred embodiment the RUBE apparatus may be co located and closely integrated with its thermal energy sources and sinks. Said sources and sinks may be any devices which may emit or absorb thermal energy respectively to be recuperated transferred and or exchanged by RUBE.

In a preferred embodiment origins of said boiling energy may be co located subsystems that may need to be kept to specific desired or maximum operating temperatures or temperature ranges and typically these may be subsystems which also generate waste heat that otherwise may ordinarily need to be rejected from the system.

In a preferred embodiment the RUBE apparatus may be tightly integrated with a combination of power dissipating components such that the cooling of temperature sensitive components can be aided through the thermal energy contributed by relatively hotter and or potentially less temperature sensitive components.

In a preferred embodiment the RUBE apparatus depicted as being part of the FRAME subsystem in may be tightly integrated with the SCRAM apparatus described in section 5. In another preferred embodiment the RUBE apparatus is also integrated with the FORCE apparatus . In still another preferred embodiment the RUBE apparatus may also integrated with the SOLAR apparatus described in section 10.6. In a preferred embodiment the RUBE apparatus may be integrated with external sources of thermal energy which may include sources of energy that may otherwise be wasted.

In a preferred embodiment the RUBE apparatus may use a relatively low temperature phase change working fluid to recuperate thermal energy and as a medium for transferring thermal energy. In a preferred embodiment such as for electronics thermal stabilization applications the working fluid is preferentially a non flammable non ozone depleting low GWP organic dielectric fluid with a boiling point between 20 C. and 40 C. and a useful upper limit of at least 125 C. such as 1 methoxy heptafluoropropane C3F7OCH3 which is practically non toxic and currently not regulated for transport or use. Other suitable working fluids may include for example C5F12 C6F14 C4F9OCH3 C4F9CH3 C4F9OC2H5 and C4F9C5H5 as well as others and may also include combinations of said fluids some of which may not be organic dielectric fluids having boiling points within the exemplary range. In a preferred embodiment the working fluid expands substantially when heated and vaporizes easily.

In a preferred embodiment the RUBE apparatus may integrate with and or connect to a variety of thermal energy sources and sinks over a wide temperature range but there may be others external to the RUBE apparatus that may be accessible via the STEER apparatus .

As depicted in and in addition to the thermal energy it may directly recuperate thermal energy from the subsystems with which it integrates RUBE devices may accept working fluids that are relatively cool well below the fluid s boiling point but nowhere near freezing for its own use and may deliver working fluids that are relatively warm at or below the fluid s boiling point . In a preferred embodiment the RUBE apparatus may accept working fluid from the STEER apparatus depicted in for cooling purposes.

Internally the temperatures to which the RUBE apparatus may be exposed may be well above the working fluid s boiling point. In a preferred embodiment it is an object of the RUBE apparatus to provide integral sources and sinks for said thermal energy within non FRAME subsystems to which the FRAME apparatus may be connected and integrated and of which it may be a part . In a preferred embodiment the SCRAM apparatus depicted in and in the Venn diagram of may exemplify one such non FRAME subsystem. In the Venn diagram of the overlapping areas between the two circles depicting RUBE and SCRAM represent interfaces and integrations that may exist between various RUBE and SCRAM devices such as where a SCRAM heat source may mate with a RUBE heat sink for example. However thermal sources and sinks may also occur within RUBE s sibling FRAME subsystems i.e. SLAM STEER PERKS and FORCE and these may be opportunistically utilized by RUBE .

In a preferred embodiment RUBE may exchange working fluids with its sibling FRAME subsystems only via the STEER apparatus depicted in rather than directly and so may take advantage of any available thermal sources and sinks including those external to the node itself that are under the control of the SLAM apparatus and accessible via the STEER apparatus.

In a preferred embodiment RUBE may utilize a relatively low temperature phase change working fluid in conjunction with heat exchanger surfaces that may promote heterogeneous nucleation so that it may more easily acquire and recuperate heat energy boiling energy from hot spots and warm spots for immediate or subsequent reuse.

In a preferred embodiment recuperated boiling energy heats and expands the working fluid which by natural convection or thermosiphon or in conjunction with a vapor injection mechanism may implement a type of thermal pump or thermocompressor that may deliver motive force that may circulate or help to circulate said working fluid. Boiling energy in this context refers to energy that may be immediately used immediately or stored for later use and that may help effect a liquid vapor phase change without approaching the working fluid s critical heat flux. In a preferred embodiment said vapor injection mechanism may also implement a phase temperature and pressure conversion capability suitable for merging streams of working fluid that may differ in phase temperature and or pressure. In a preferred embodiment said stream merging and conversion capability may be utilized by the STEER apparatus depicted in .

In a preferred embodiment recuperated energy heats and expands the working fluid possibly involving a complete or partial phase change depending on the temperature and pressure which in conjunction with optional vapor injection and adequate subcooling may create a motive force that may help to circulate the working fluid among system components. In a preferred embodiment said circulated working fluid may help to thermally stabilize the system to further extract re usable energy for immediate reuse or storage and or to efficiently reject waste energy without overly subcooling the working fluid.

In a preferred embodiment a relatively small continuous positively pressurized liquid flow may be maintained among selected subsystems or components which may be ensured via one or more low power pumps in order to prevent dryout eliminate local hot spots and assure thermal stability as an asset protection mechanism that may serve to reduce or eliminate dependency on thermal expansion nucleation and vapor injection as the only motive forces. In a preferred embodiment said pump s may operate at reduced power levels or may be powered off completely when the required flow can be maintained without them.

In a preferred embodiment said low power pumps may be of a high reliability variable voltage direct current sealless magnetic type most preferably with a spherical ceramic bearing or other means of minimizing friction and mechanical wear thereby contributing to reliability and availability. In a preferred embodiment said low power pumps may be configured to be at least doubly or triply redundant partly due to their role as an asset protection mechanism.

An overview of the RUBE Heat Energy Recuperation Cycle is depicted in and for three different preferred embodiments labeled v.1 v.2 and v.3 for convenience within the next three subsections.

In a preferred embodiment common to all three embodiments described the RUBE Double Boiler Inner Boiler preferentially receives relatively cooler working fluid because it contains a combination of potentially temperature sensitive and or high heat flux electronic devices whose respective operating temperature ranges must be appropriately maintained in order to retain the optionally advantageous properties of the system. The RUBE Double Boiler Inner Boiler is part of the RUBE Double Boiler described in 10.3.2 and is further described in 10.3.3.

In a preferred embodiment common to all three embodiments described the RUBE Double Boiler Outer Boiler Chamber Reservoir receives relatively warmer working fluid because it contains a combination of potentially temperature insensitive and or low heat flux electronic devices whose respective operating temperature ranges are sufficiently lax as to need no extraordinary attention in order to retain the optionally advantageous properties of the system. The RUBE Double Boiler Outer Boiler Chamber Reservoir is part of the RUBE Double Boiler described in 10.3.2.

In the following description of a preferred embodiment labeled for convenience as RUBE Heat Energy Recuperation Cycle v.1 and depicted in any of the devices may each be replaced by a multiplicity of units with the same or altered characteristics plumbed in series or parallel so as to modify flow or pressure as desired or to effect an optimal use of a variety of heat or cold sources of differing characteristics. In a preferred embodiment said devices may be part of and or integral to the STEER apparatus depicted in and thus may be dynamically reconfigurable.

As depicted in the flow control valves and may each be either a simple check valve the minimum requirement or an optional hybrid apparatus hybrid flow control valve comprising a check valve combined with some type of tap valve proportional valve or other means of flow control that can be used to optimally balance the system and which may be optionally dynamically controllable for example via integration with the STEER apparatus depicted in or via other electronic and or computer controlled mechanisms.

In a preferred embodiment said flow control valves may be deployed on aggregated flows as depicted above or alternatively on individual flows when a multiplicity of one or more of the devices are present. In a preferred embodiment the optional hybrid flow control valves may be present only if they re under the control of a system monitoring and control function in which case it may be presumed that some combination of temperature pressure and or flow sensors may also be placed at appropriate points to provide feedback to the system monitoring and control function.

As depicted in pump pulls working fluid from the RUBE Double Boiler outer boiler chamber reservoir and pushes it through flow control valve into the liquid inlet of the RUBE Vapor Injector out the delivery outlet and through another flow control valve into the RUBE Double Boiler inner boiler apparatus which may add heat to the fluid and may cause it to partially or fully evaporate. The heated working fluid which may be any combination of liquid and vapor then may exit the inner boiler apparatus through either or both of two flow control valves and or where it may proceed along either or both of the two downstream paths following the path of least resistance determined pseudo statically by the configuration or dynamically when hybrid flow control valves are present .

In an alternate preferred embodiment not shown the output of pump may connect to a dynamically controllable splitter or diverter valve not shown one of whose outputs may connect as previously described to flow control valve and the other of which may connect into an additional inlet not shown on the RUBE condenser apparatus in order to mitigate the risk associated with the possibility that all working fluid circulating to the inner boiler apparatus may be inadvertently leaked into the outer boiler chamber reservoir thereby bypassing the RUBE condenser apparatus . In a variant of said alternative preferred embodiment a check valved separate pump not shown may comprise the bypass mechanism. In either of said alternative preferred embodiments fluid may be cooled and or condensed directly from the outer boiler chamber reservoir which may thereby allow the system to function at a lower efficiency and or survive for a longer period.

From flow control valve the working fluid and or vapor may flow into the optional PERKS or RUBE load shaver apparatus if present and then into the condenser apparatus or else into the condenser apparatus directly. In the RUBE condenser apparatus any vapor present may condense to fluid and may return via pump to the outer boiler chamber reservoir where it may be circulated and preheated in preparation for repeating the cycle through pump and or through the pump bypass path directly into flow control valve .

From flow control valve the working fluid and or vapor may flow into the vapor inlet of the RUBE Vapor Injector where it may be mixed with liquid working fluid from liquid inlet . When little or no vapor is present the RUBE Vapor Injector may simply serve as a mixer with no particular contribution to thermal efficiency and this situation may occur when the system is operating at sufficiently low power levels that the working fluid is still below its boiling point after leaving the inner boiler apparatus this may be the normal startup scenario the energy recuperation apparatus may be initialized to begin the flow of working fluid before power may be applied to the inner boiler apparatus . Under high power scenarios and or with sufficient pressure in the outer boiler chamber reservoir vapor may vent through flow control valve into vapor inlet .

When sufficient vapor is presented at the vapor inlet of the RUBE Vapor Injector so as to activate its normal vapor injection operating mode as described in section 10.3.4 a suction may be created at liquid inlet and a positive pressure may be created at the delivery outlet which may cause working fluid to flow from flow control valves and or according to the path of least resistance.

Depending on the actual working temperatures and pressures within the system including the settings of the flow control valves and or it may be possible to power down pump while retaining the full operation of the system thereby adding to the overall efficiency of the system. In the case of a powered down pump it may also be possible to close flow control valve i.e. if it is an optional hybrid as described earlier thereby preventing flow induced wear on pump even though such wear may be minimal .

In the following description of the embodiment depicted in the operation is nearly identical to that of except for an altered path between the outer and inner boilers from the outer boiler to inner boiler of the RUBE Double Boiler apparatus depicted as and respectively and the inclusion of an optional recuperative vapor path from said outer boiler to the optional PERKS or RUBE Load Shaver if present or to the RUBE Condenser otherwise.

In the following description of a preferred embodiment labeled for convenience as RUBE Heat Energy Recuperation Cycle v.2 and depicted in any of the devices may each be replaced by a multiplicity of units with the same or altered characteristics plumbed in series or parallel so as to modify flow or pressure as desired or to effect an optimal use of a variety of heat or cold sources of differing characteristics. In a preferred embodiment said devices may be part of and or integral to the STEER apparatus depicted in and thus may be dynamically reconfigurable.

As depicted in the flow control valves and may each be either a simple check valve the minimum requirement or an optional hybrid apparatus hybrid flow control valve comprising a check valve combined with some type of tap valve proportional valve or other means of flow control that can be used to optimally balance the system and which may be optionally dynamically controllable for example via integration with the STEER apparatus depicted in or via other electronic and or computer controlled mechanisms.

In a preferred embodiment said flow control valves may be deployed on aggregated flows as depicted above or alternatively on individual flows when a multiplicity of one or more of the devices are present. In a preferred embodiment the optional hybrid flow control valves may be present only if they re under the control of a system monitoring and control function in which case it may be presumed that some combination of temperature pressure and or flow sensors may also be placed at appropriate points to provide feedback to the system monitoring and control function.

As depicted in two paths feed the RUBE Double Boiler Inner Boiler . In a first path pump may pull working fluid from the RUBE Double Boiler Outer Boiler Chamber Reservoir and push it through flow control valve into the RUBE Double Boiler inner boiler apparatus . In a second path a combination of pressure from RUBE Double Boiler Outer Boiler Chamber Reservoir and suction induced by RUBE Vapor Injector at liquid inlet may pull working fluid from the RUBE Double Boiler Outer Boiler Chamber Reservoir through flow control valve into the liquid inlet of the RUBE Vapor Injector out the delivery outlet and through a flow control valve into the RUBE Double Boiler inner boiler apparatus .

The RUBE Double Boiler inner boiler apparatus may add heat to the working fluid and thereby cause it to partially or fully evaporate. The heated working fluid which may be any combination of liquid and vapor then exits the inner boiler apparatus through either or both of two flow control valves and or where it may proceed along either or both of the two downstream paths following the path of least resistance determined pseudo statically by the configuration or dynamically when hybrid flow control valves are present .

From flow control valve the working fluid and or vapor may flow into the optional PERKS or RUBE load shaver apparatus if present and then into the condenser apparatus or else into the condenser apparatus directly. In the RUBE condenser apparatus any vapor present can condense to fluid and return via pump to the outer boiler chamber reservoir where it can provide cool fluid to pump and or RUBE Vapor Injector via flow control valve and also be circulated preheated and or vaporized in which case it can exit through flow control valve into the vapor inlet of the RUBE Vapor Injector .

From flow control valve the working fluid and or vapor may flow into the vapor inlet of the RUBE Vapor Injector where it may be mixed with liquid working fluid from liquid inlet . When little or no vapor is present the RUBE Vapor Injector may simply serve as a mixer with no particular contribution to thermal efficiency and this situation may occur when the system is operating at sufficiently low power levels that the working fluid may still be below its boiling point after leaving the inner boiler apparatus this may be the normal startup scenario the energy recuperation apparatus may be initialized to begin the flow of working fluid before power may be applied to the inner boiler apparatus .

In a preferred embodiment under high power scenarios and or with sufficient pressure in the outer boiler chamber reservoir vapor may vent through flow control valve into vapor inlet .

When sufficient vapor is presented at the vapor inlet of the RUBE Vapor Injector so as to activate its normal vapor injection operating mode as described in section 10.3.4 a suction may be created at liquid inlet and a positive pressure may be created at the delivery outlet which may cause working fluid to flow from flow control valve into the RUBE Double Boiler inner boiler apparatus via flow control valve .

Depending on the actual working temperatures and pressures within the system including the settings of the flow control valves and or it may be possible to power down pump while retaining the full operation of the system thereby adding to the overall efficiency of the system. In the case of a powered down pump it may also be possible to close flow control valve i.e. if it is an optional hybrid as described earlier thereby preventing flow induced wear on pump even though such wear may be minimal .

In the following description of the embodiment depicted in the operation is nearly identical to that of except for the addition of a new path between the outer and inner boilers from the inner boiler to outer boiler of the RUBE Double Boiler apparatus depicted as and respectively the elimination of both the flow control valve at and the path from 312 to RUBE Vapor Injector leaving an altered feed path to the RUBE Vapor Injector depicted as the path from to .

In the following description of a preferred embodiment labeled for convenience as RUBE Heat Energy Recuperation Cycle v.3 and depicted in any of the devices may each be replaced by a multiplicity of units with the same or altered characteristics plumbed in series or parallel so as to modify flow or pressure as desired or to effect an optimal use of a variety of heat or cold sources of differing characteristics. In a preferred embodiment said devices may be part of and or integral to the STEER apparatus depicted in and thus may be dynamically reconfigurable.

As depicted in the flow control valves and may each be either a simple check valve the minimum requirement or an optional hybrid apparatus hybrid flow control valve comprising a check valve combined with some type of tap valve proportional valve or other means of flow control that can be used to optimally balance the system and which may be optionally dynamically controllable for example via integration with the STEER apparatus depicted in or via other electronic and or computer controlled mechanisms.

In a preferred embodiment said flow control valves may be deployed on aggregated flows as depicted above or alternatively on individual flows when a multiplicity of one or more of the devices are present. In a preferred embodiment the optional hybrid flow control valves may be present only if they re under the control of a system monitoring and control function in which case it may be presumed that some combination of temperature pressure and or flow sensors may also be placed at appropriate points to provide feedback to the system monitoring and control function.

As depicted in two paths feed the RUBE Double Boiler Inner Boiler . In a first path pump may pull working fluid from the RUBE Double Boiler Outer Boiler Chamber Reservoir and push it through flow control valve into the RUBE Double Boiler inner boiler apparatus . In a second path a combination of pressure from RUBE Double Boiler Outer Boiler Chamber Reservoir and suction induced by RUBE Vapor Injector at liquid inlet may pull working fluid from the RUBE Double Boiler Outer Boiler Chamber Reservoir through flow control valve into the liquid inlet of the RUBE Vapor Injector out the delivery outlet and through a flow control valve into the RUBE Double Boiler inner boiler apparatus .

The RUBE Double Boiler inner boiler apparatus may add heat to the working fluid and thereby cause it to partially or fully evaporate. The heated working fluid which may be any combination of liquid and vapor then exits the inner boiler apparatus through either or both of two flow control valves and or where it may proceed along either or both of the two downstream paths following the path of least resistance determined pseudo statically by the configuration or dynamically when hybrid flow control valves are present .

From flow control valve the working fluid and or vapor may flow into the optional PERKS or RUBE load shaver apparatus if present and then into the condenser apparatus or else into the condenser apparatus directly. In the RUBE condenser apparatus any vapor present can condense to fluid and return via pump to the outer boiler chamber reservoir where it can provide cool fluid to pump and or RUBE Vapor Injector via flow control valve and also be circulated preheated and or vaporized in which case it can exit through flow control valve into the vapor inlet of the RUBE Vapor Injector.

From the RUBE Double Boiler inner boiler apparatus the working fluid may can exit under pressure at point and flow directly into the main reservoir of the outer boiler apparatus . The omission of a flow control valve at point is an intentional departure from the preferred embodiment described in the previous section 10.3.1.2 . Keeping in mind that the inner boiler apparatus is actually contained within the outer boiler apparatus the omission of a flow control valve at point which may actually represent a multiplicity of control valves enables the path from the inner boiler apparatus to the outer boiler apparatus to simply be a pattern of convenient egress points e.g. holes in the inner boiler apparatus .

In a preferred embodiment some or all of the egress points from the inner boiler apparatus can be distributed over the interfacing surfaces of the inner boiler apparatus so as to evenly or otherwise distribute the escaping fluid into the outer boiler apparatus thereby improving turbulence and enhancing the mixing of fluid temperatures with the outer boiler apparatus while also reducing or smoothing the thermal gradients that may otherwise be present within the outer boiler apparatus .

In a preferred embodiment some or all of said egress points particularly those most likely to handle relatively hotter working fluid and thus relatively higher vapor content from the inner boiler apparatus can be preferentially distributed over the interfacing surfaces of the inner boiler apparatus so as to distribute the fluid with relatively higher vapor content into specific areas of the outer boiler apparatus . In a preferred embodiment said specific areas are those where the escaping fluid is less likely to encounter relatively cooler fluid which would have a cooling and or condensing effect thereby improving the rate at which working fluid is converted to vapor which consequently increases the pressure within the outer boiler apparatus which may beneficially raise the boiling point of the working fluid and or increase the motive force available at the vapor inlet of the RUBE Vapor Injector the latter may occur only if the fluid is allowed to vent through flow control valve into vapor inlet .

In a preferred embodiment under high power scenarios and or with sufficient pressure in the outer boiler chamber reservoir vapor may vent through flow control valve into vapor inlet .

When sufficient vapor is presented at the vapor inlet of the RUBE Vapor Injector so as to activate its normal vapor injection operating mode as described in section 10.3.4 a suction may be created at liquid inlet and a positive pressure may be created at the delivery outlet which may cause working fluid to flow from flow control valve into the RUBE Double Boiler inner boiler apparatus via flow control valve .

Depending on the actual working temperatures and pressures within the system including the settings of the flow control valves and or it may be possible to power down pump while retaining the full operation of the system thereby adding to the overall efficiency of the system. In the case of a powered down pump it may also be possible to close flow control valve i.e. if it is an optional hybrid as described earlier thereby preventing flow induced wear on pump even though such wear may be minimal .

The RUBE Double Boiler apparatus is part of a closed loop system that in a preferred embodiment is connected to other components as depicted in and corresponding to three different preferred embodiments of the RUBE Heat Energy Recuperation Cycle described in section 10.3.1.

Each RUBE Double Boiler apparatus comprises one or more inner boiler units and an outer boiler such that the former are fully enclosed within the latter in order to maximize the recuperation of heat energy thermal energy dissipated by the aggregation of enclosed heat sources and optionally to separate the recuperated heat energy into two or more grades according to desired or observed temperatures.

In a preferred embodiment common to all three embodiments described in section 10.3.1 the RUBE Double Boiler Inner Boiler apparatus preferentially receives relatively cooler working fluid while the RUBE Double Boiler Outer Boiler Chamber Reservoir receives relatively warmer working fluid.

In a preferred embodiment potentially temperature sensitive and or high heat flux electronic devices whose respective operating temperature ranges must be appropriately maintained in order to retain the optionally advantageous properties of the system are preferentially placed within an inner boiler or at least have their hot surfaces within an inner boiler . Consequently potentially temperature insensitive and or low heat flux electronic devices i.e. those devices whose respective operating temperature ranges are sufficiently lax as to need no extraordinary attention in order to retain the optionally advantageous properties of the system are placed within the enclosing outer boiler.

In an alternative preferred embodiment without special concern for temperature sensitivity such as when the components under consideration are not particularly temperature sensitive the relatively hot heat sources e.g. those components with a relatively higher heat flux such as CPUs and point of load power regulator components are preferentially placed within the inner boiler or at least have their hot surfaces within an inner boiler and the warm heat sources i.e. those components with a relatively lower heat flux such as DRAM and flash memory chips are placed within the enclosing outer boiler.

Both inner and outer boilers may be pressure vessels intended to withstand a maximum of 7 bar operating pressures 100 PSI under normal conditions plus a margin of safety. Unintentional leaks within an inner boiler cause only a reduction in efficiency but leaks in the outer boiler can cause a loss of working fluid and a subsequent reduction in local survivability. In a preferred embodiment the normal operating pressure for both the inner and outer boilers does not exceed 2 bar and may be substantially less.

In a preferred embodiment it is optionally advantageous for the RUBE Double Boiler Outer Boiler Chamber Reservoir to have a somewhat vertical orientation with a distinct top having a vapor dome to simplify the collection of vapor evolving from the working fluid.

In a preferred embodiment such as for electronics thermal stabilization applications the working fluid may be an organic dielectric fluid with a boiling point between 20 C. and 40 C. such as 1 methoxy heptafluoropropane C3F7OCH3 . Other working fluids may also be suitable some examples of which are listed in section 10.3. In a preferred embodiment the working fluid expands substantially when heated and vaporizes easily.

In a preferred embodiment the RUBE Double Boiler apparatus has an outer shell of cast aluminum although other construction methods and materials are possible and its external shape and form factor are such that it can mate with guide channels extruded into a vertically oriented cylindrical or partly cylindrical aluminum extrusion designed to contain a multiplicity of RUBE Double Boiler units.

Given the aforementioned vertically oriented extrusion in a preferred embodiment the intent is to be able to easily align and slide the RUBE Double Boiler apparatus from the extrusion upper opening downward into the extrusion until it reaches a bulkhead where couplings and connectors on the bottom of the Double Boiler apparatus mate with complementary couplings and connectors within the extrusion. In an alternate embodiment the RUBE Double Boiler apparatus aligns and slides downward from the extrusion upper opening into the extrusion until it reaches a mechanical stop at that point a lever or cam means accessible from the top can be exercised such that it pulls the RUBE Double Boiler apparatus toward a nearby vertical interior wall such that couplings and connectors on the side of the RUBE Double Boiler apparatus mate with complementary couplings and connectors on the extrusion s interior wall.

In a preferred embodiment the RUBE Double Boiler apparatus is a pressure sealed field replaceable unit having blind mating quick disconnect inlet and outlet couplings with double EPDM seals and capable of operating at 100 PSI such as those available from Colder the extrusion would contain mating couplings . Note Although other seal materials are possible EPDM is preferred for its compatibility with the preferred working fluid. .

In a preferred embodiment the RUBE Double Boiler apparatus is also electrically sealed and EMP hardened having blind mating quick disconnect electrical connectors with a multiplicity of conductors appropriate for the ingress and egress of electrical power feeds and various high frequency signals such as are common in computer and telecommunications devices.

In a preferred embodiment the RUBE Double Boiler apparatus connects to a bottom plane mid plane or backplane or equivalent connector arrangement in the vertical extrusion by means of a proprietary pin free connector and having the property of providing an extremely high quality nearly noise free connection. In an alternate embodiment the same connector arrangement is used but is placed on the side or back of the RUBE Double Boiler apparatus rather than on the bottom. See also RUBE RUBE Inner Boiler.

In a preferred embodiment of the RUBE Double Boiler an example of which is depicted in the outer boiler shown on the left is a pressure vessel containing a dielectric working fluid with the electronics module shown on the right.

In the example of the memory modules depicted are representative of electronics that are immersed in the working fluid of the outer boiler . Notice that they appear on both sides of the assembly. However they re not on opposite sides of the same PCB but rather on two different PCBs mounted back to back with a manifold assembly between them. In a preferred embodiment the reverse side of each PCB depicted contains hot chips like CPUs etc. and these are placed back to back with a two piece manifold assembly between them comprising an inner boiler as depicted in further detail in and . In a preferred embodiment said manifold components may be injection molded or cast etc. for economy of manufacturing although they may instead be machined or fabricated via alternative means. In a preferred embodiment one or more fluid compatible pressure sealing mechanisms are placed at the seam between the back to back manifold components in such a manner as to aid the operation of the inner boiler as depicted generally in and and specifically to aid in flow control as depicted in and to this end a void is provided for said seal or seals in the manifold manufacturing process. In a preferred embodiment said seal or seals are auto routed and placed as a step of the manifold component manufacturing process i.e. rather than inserting one or more O ring type seals at a later point in time e.g. during the assembly of manifold assembly .

In the example of heat exchangers affixed to the hot chips are immersed in the path of turbulent working fluid moving through the manifold assembly or inner boiler. As a special example the devices located at the top which is located for convenience only and need not be at a particular location or orientation in may represent two sided modules that may be extra hot and or heat tolerant e.g. a modular high density power supply device and participate in the inner boiler just like the other hot chips. However in this example one surface of the module may face the inner boiler while the other faces the outer boiler so that device cooling or fluid heating if you have the boiler s point of view may occur from both sides at the same time.

In a preferred embodiment the primary objective of the RUBE Inner Boiler apparatus is to ensure that the maximum case temperatures Tcase of high heat flux heat producing devices do not exceed particular thresholds in order to ensure that the devices do not produce more heat than their individual or collective desired target thresholds. The importance of this cannot be overstated because the ability to stay below said thresholds enables drastic reductions in power consumption for an entire class of integrated circuit devices. The idea here is that avoiding energy waste preemptively is a great improvement over recuperating a portion of the energy that would otherwise be wasted.

In a preferred embodiment the secondary objective of the RUBE Inner Boiler apparatus is to recuperate thermal energy dissipated by the electronic devices contained within so that said energy may be put to good use rather than wasting it e.g. by rejecting it to the environment as heat . and depict the basic mechanical concept of the inner boiler namely that there is an assembly or other mechanism capable of containing and isolating a set of selected heat producing chips from those not selected while preferentially cooling said selected chips by efficiently circulating working fluid to them recuperating the heat energy they emit and passing the heat energy downstream for reuse.

In a preferred embodiment the inner surfaces RUBE Double Boiler s inner boiler apparatus comprise one or more check valved manifold and heat exchanger mechanisms eight are partially depicted in while six are partially depicted in and . In a preferred embodiment said mechanisms may be injection molded or cast for economy of manufacturing although they may instead be machined or fabricated via alternative means. In a preferred embodiment each outer wall of the manifold assembly is a two piece manifold shell capable of serving as part of a sealed pressure vessel housing the remainder of the assembly s components and having thermal access to heat producing components located on a PCB fastened or otherwise attached to the major outer surface of each half of the two piece manifold . In a preferred embodiment said thermal access may be provided by openings manufactured into the major outer surface of each half of the two piece manifold no such openings are depicted in however .

In a preferred embodiment partially depicted in said assemblies may comprise any number of heat exchanger seals baseplate heat exchangers an example is shown but many commercial off the shelf units are suitable including those with non rectangular shapes heat producing devices not shown but typically electronics devices on a PCB and optional backing pressure plates to aid in providing clamping force such as may be placed on the outside of a PCB but also not shown . In a preferred embodiment the check valved manifold further comprises a liquid inlet vapor and liquid outlet two piece injection molded manifold chamber with one or more seams and seals between them inlet and optional outlet check valves either as individual components or individually constructed as part of a machined cast or injection molded channel with an attached check valve such as a flapper valve as depicted in and or ball and spring as depicted in or other low cracking force alternative for each baseplate heat exchanger and suitable molded in working fluid flow guides and channels within the two piece injection molded manifold chamber .

In a preferred embodiment the RUBE Inner Boiler accommodates the cooling of devices that may for the purposes of this discussion be conveniently categorized as either temperature sensitive or non temperature sensitive. In this context the former refers to devices whose operating characteristics e.g. power dissipation may vary considerably over their specified allowable temperature ranges whereas the operating characteristics of the latter do not. The two categories of devices typically coexist and may be colocated thus necessitating a strategy for dealing with both their respective needs within the same RUBE Inner Boiler nonetheless there may be multiple instances of the RUBE Inner Boiler and they may operate independently with differing devices and or at differing temperatures .

In a preferred embodiment the working fluid flows within a RUBE Inner Boiler are configured such that the temperature sensitive devices receive priority servicing in order to specifically drive such devices toward the desired operating characteristics and or thresholds i.e. by forcing such devices to operate within a specific sub range of the otherwise allowable range . As a second priority the non temperature sensitive devices are then serviced i.e. only after the needs of the temperature sensitive devices have been met . At all times both categories of devices must be kept within their respective operating temperature ranges and preferably well below the upper end of their individual ranges.

The types of temperature sensitive devices for which the RUBE Inner Boiler is well suited tend to be commercially available in multiple speed and temperature grades such as integrated circuits e.g. a CPU or processor having temperature variable power dissipation where increased operating temperature results in increased power dissipation . In general higher speed devices produce more heat than their otherwise equivalent counterparts and cost more than their lower speed counterparts. Furthermore devices that consume less power and produce less heat cost more than their otherwise equivalent and in particular speed equivalent counterparts. Thus high speed low power components tend to cost the most. Also the devices with the highest speeds are often unavailable as low power devices and certainly not in the lowest power grades by definition . Finally the fastest devices often have variable power dissipation as depicted in Table 21 for three different processors a commodity priced device A intended for consumer class PCs and two much more expensive premium devices B and C intended for server class computers where B is a standard temperature device and C is a low power and higher priced premium device.

In Table 21 which depicts three different temperature sensitive processors the desired power dissipation targets for say 40 watts or less are flagged with an asterisk. All power dissipation values shown are rounded to the nearest integer.

Although the allowable upper limit of temperature range is specified in Table 21 to be at least 67 C. for all three of this example s target processors Tcase Max is 71 C. for processors A and C and 67 C. for processor B the temperature sub ranges required to keep the processor operating at a power dissipation target of 30 watts or less would be defined more strictly e.g. Tcase Max must be no more than about 51 C. for processors A and C and 49 C. for processor B . Thus in this example flows within the RUBE Inner Boiler would be prioritized to ensure that the more restrictive temperature subrange is achieved by way of directing the least heated working fluid to the higher priority temperature sensitive devices first e.g. one or more processors as described in this example and to the lowest priority non temperature sensitive devices last. If there are multiple significantly differing temperature ranges among the devices those with the highest maximum ranges are placed last within their category e.g. a non temperature sensitive device with an upper operating limit of 70 C. would receive working fluid before another non temperature sensitive device with an upper operating limit of 100 C. so that the working fluid can absorb maximal heat energy without endangering the corresponding devices before exiting the RUBE Inner Boiler.

Table 21 illustrates that a power dissipation target of for example under 30 watts can only be achieved by holding the processor s maximum case temperature Tcase value to 51 C. for processor B and 49 C. for processors A and C . This is precisely the primary goal of the RUBE Inner Boiler which in a preferred embodiment uses a phase change working fluid that has a normal boiling point of 34 C. Under increased operating pressure the boiling point can go up somewhat while remaining well under a Tcase of 49 C. and we can use this fact to great advantage when rejecting heat to a warm ambient environment or heat sink for example by rejecting heat into the return loop of a chilled water system which contains water that has already been heated and thus will be further heated by the SHADOWS FRAME RUBE system thereby improving the efficiency of the chilled water system s external cooling devices . The reverse is also true the boiling point can be reduced if the internal operating pressure is reduced and we use this fact to increase the temperature delta between the boiling point and the target device temperature.

Furthermore it is clear that the RUBE Inner Boiler enables any of the processors depicted in Table 21 to be selected and still meet the example s under 30 watt goal which means that lower cost devices can be used without penalty. And finally while not depicted specifically in this table which is speed agnostic it may mean that the highest speed device can be used if desired which in this example is only available in a commodity part rather than as a premium priced lower power dissipation part .

The RUBE Inner Boiler is also a means for recuperating the heat energy dissipated by the relatively high heat flux heat producing devices so that to the extent practical it can be converted downstream to usable mechanical and or electrical energy. In this case the ability to reject the heat energy to ambient is not a RUBE consideration at all since RUBE can serve to preheat working fluid for an optional downstream power production system thereby increasing overall system efficiency.

The RUBE Inner Boiler basic fluid flow concept is depicted in . The inner boiler apparatus is colocated with the hot surfaces the surfaces with the largest heat flux of the most temperature sensitive hot devices and hottest of the heat producing devices which are so arranged that such placement is possible with a minimum pressure drop minimum or otherwise convenient number of manifolds or other possibly constraining criteria. In this basic scenario devices may be differentiated as to whether or not they are within the inner boiler apparatus or outside of it. Devices within the inner boiler apparatus may be relatively undifferentiated from each other with respect to how the basic flow accounts for any possible temperature sensitivities they may have i.e. whether one device is more temperature sensitive than other .

In a preferred embodiment once normal steady state operation is reached working fluid vapor may be expelled through outlet and little or no liquid is present. Liquid working fluid is forced into liquid inlet where it is equitably distributed within the manifold chamber and to each heat exchanger s inlet check valve which it can then enter since the working fluid is under pressure.

For each heat exchanger once the working fluid passes the corresponding inlet check valve it enters the volume enclosing heat exchanger where it circulates among the heat exchanger s fins pins or other heat exchange surfaces see possibly with the aid of optional flow directing baffles . Depending on the then current temperature and pressure the working fluid may acquire heat energy causing all or part of it to evaporate.

In a preferred embodiment such as for electronics thermal stabilization applications the working fluid may be an organic dielectric fluid with a boiling point between 20 C. and 40 C. such as 1 methoxy heptafluoropropane C3F7OCH3 . Other working fluids may also be suitable some examples of which are listed in section 10.3. In a preferred embodiment the working fluid expands substantially when heated and vaporizes easily. Since the inlet between and is check valved this expansion greatly pressurizes the volume enclosing the heat exchanger and the working fluid is expelled through the optional outlet check valve where it makes its way via outlet manifold chambers and to outlet thereby creating a partial vacuum within the volume enclosing heat exchanger which helps to pull in more liquid working fluid . The hotter the system gets the higher the pressure at which it can operate due to thermodynamically induced motive forces up to the maximum desired target temperature of the various heat producing devices or the maximum allowable enclosure pressure or the useful upper limit of the working fluid whichever is most constraining.

The inner boiler apparatus is colocated with the hot surfaces the surfaces with the largest heat flux of the most temperature sensitive hot devices and the hottest of the heat producing devices which are so arranged that such placement is possible with a minimum or otherwise convenient number of manifolds.

In keeping with the primary goal of driving the temperature sensitive devices toward a specific temperature threshold the internal routes of the working fluid may be configured to encounter these devices prior to encountering the non temperature sensitive devices.

In a preferred embodiment partly depicted in the inner boiler apparatus is oriented vertically although it is depicted horizontally here for convenience such that both the liquid inlet and vapor and liquid outlet are at the top. This allows gravity to aid in the flow of working fluid to temperature sensitive components and takes advantage of natural upwardly motive forces due to vapor escaping the hotter non temperature sensitive components. It works similarly to the embodiment of but with extra manifold chambers and between devices at different operating temperatures.

In a preferred embodiment once normal steady state operation is reached working fluid liquid and vapor may be expelled through outlet and little or no liquid may be present. Liquid working fluid is forced into liquid inlet where it is equitably distributed to the most heat sensitive components as described in the Basic Fluid Flow Concept for represented by the upper half of up to the point where the working fluid exits the volume enclosing the heat exchanger . At that point the working fluid is expelled through the optional outlet check valve where it makes its way via interior manifold chambers and to the inlet of a downstream heat exchanger thereby creating a partial vacuum within the volume enclosing the upstream heat exchanger which helps to pull in more liquid working fluid to the temperature sensitive component . The working fluid traverses the interior manifold chamber and to the inlet check valve of a downstream heat exchanger associated with an even hotter or less temperature sensitive component which it can then enter since the working fluid is still under pressure.

For each downstream heat exchanger once the working fluid passes the interior chamber and on into the corresponding chamber then into inlet check valve it subsequently enters the downstream volume enclosing heat exchanger where it circulates among the heat exchanger s fins pins or other heat exchange surfaces see possibly with the aid of optional flow directing baffles . Depending on the then current temperature and pressure the working fluid can acquire heat energy from the even hotter or less temperature sensitive component thus expanding significantly and causing all or part of the fluid to evaporate.

Since the inlet between and is check valved this expansion greatly pressurizes the downstream volume enclosing the heat exchanger and the working fluid is expelled through the optional outlet check valve where it makes its way via outlet manifold chambers and to outlet thereby creating a partial vacuum within the downstream volume enclosing heat exchanger which helps to pull in more liquid working fluid . The hotter the system gets the higher the pressure at which it can operate due to thermodynamically induced motive forces up to the maximum desired target temperature of the various heat producing devices or the maximum allowable enclosure pressure or the useful upper limit of the working fluid whichever is most constraining.

In a preferred embodiment one set of manifolds operates in the 30 C. to 40 C. range for a particular class of heat producing electronic chips while another set operates simultaneously in the 90 C. to 110 C. range for a different class of heat producing electronic chips. The same working fluid is used for both in fact the cooler system can feed the hotter system however this may require a boost in pressure which may be accomplished externally via pumps or via the RUBE Vapor Injector or a combination thereof. See also Critical Heat Flux Heat Flux RUBE RUBE Double Boiler RUBE Vapor Injector.

In a preferred embodiment the RUBE Double Boiler s inner boiler apparatus comprises one or more check valved manifold chambers six are depicted in and each with any number of heat exchanger seals baseplate heat exchangers an example is shown but many commercial off the shelf units are suitable including those with non rectangular shapes heat producing devices not shown but typically electronics devices on a PCB and backing pressure plates to aid in providing clamping force such as would be placed on the reverse side of a PCB but also not shown . The check valved manifold assemblies further comprise a liquid inlet vapor and liquid outlet two piece injection molded manifold chamber and with one or more seals between them an inlet and outlet check valve pair either as individual components or individually constructed as an injection molded channel with an attached check valve means such as a ball and spring or flapper as depicted by for each baseplate heat exchanger and suitable molded in or otherwise fabricated working fluid flow guides and channels within the two piece manifold chamber .

In a preferred embodiment each heat exchanger is of a suitable design and construction in conjunction with the design of the corresponding injection molded or otherwise fabricated manifold cavity so as to promote nucleation of an impinging working fluid and of suitable size and thickness which may vary among the potentially diverse or otherwise non homogeneous mix of heat exchangers within the inner boiler apparatus so that when the manifold assembly is mounted and secured to the PCB or other apparatus containing heat producing devices each heat exchanger is pressed directly and firmly against its corresponding heat producing device and fully covers the primary high heat flux surface of the device.

In an alternate embodiment fewer check valves are used possibly omitting either the individual ingress or egress check valves or both in favor of a single shared ingress or egress check valve respectively or possibly eliminating such valves altogether.

In an alternate embodiment all or some of the mechanical check valves are substituted with or augmented by electrical or electro mechanical valves for example from the class of valves that are similar to those used in fuel injection systems to control flow .

In a preferred embodiment care is exercised to ensure that all seals in this assembly are compatible with the selected working fluid. In a preferred embodiment such as for electronics thermal stabilization applications the working fluid may be an organic dielectric fluid with a boiling point between 20 C. and 40 C. such as 1 methoxy heptafluoropropane C3F7OCH3 in which case the seals preferentially comprise EPDM having minimal plasticizer content ideally zero . Other working fluids may also be suitable some examples of which are listed in section 10.3 and selection of other such fluids should be accompanied by analysis and selection of fluid appropriate seal materials. Each heat exchanger seal may be clamped between the two piece manifold chamber and the heat exchanger . In a preferred embodiment the heat exchanger may be attached to the two piece injection molded manifold chamber by suitable screws or other fasteners using the 4 corner holes . In a preferred embodiment in order to improve reliability and maintainability and to reduce manufacturing costs the two pieces of the manifold chamber may be injection molded out of Black Acetal Delrin which allows mass production and thus economies of scale. In a preferred embodiment rapid injection molding may be used to manufacture low volumes of the manifold chambers in order to reduce costs and lead times.

In a preferred embodiment primary heat transfer from hot surfaces or hot spots is effected via a baseplate heat exchanger which is attached to the underlying hot surfaces e.g. integrated circuit chip packages or other heat exchange surfaces by means of an epoxy having the properties of compatibility with any organic solvents that may used during manufacturing compatibility with the working fluid used during operation high temperature resistance resistance to repeated thermal cycling and exceptionally high thermal conductivity.

In a preferred embodiment the baseplate heat exchanger comprises a commodity water block baseplate of high quality such as the CNC machined C110 copper baseplate that is a component of the commercially available Swiftech www.Swiftech.com Apogee GT water block patent pending which has a thickness of 3 mm to promote a high surface compliance factor. The commercially available Koolance www.Koolance.com family of water blocks may be similarly acceptable. Such water blocks are typically designed using CFD computational fluid dynamics to specifically increase surface area coolant velocity and surface compliance with its mating hot surface while minimizing thermal resistance pressure drop and cost.

In an alternative embodiment a custom baseplate heat exchanger can be used to achieve specific packaging heat transfer weight cost availability manufacturing or other goals in accordance with necessary design trade offs without diverging from the concept taught here.

In a preferred embodiment it is desirable to apply special coatings or textures to the baseplate heat exchanger in order to improve surface area and increase the number of nucleation sites for the phase change working fluid. In a preferred embodiment the baseplate is treated by acid etching such as to achieve a rough 40 60 grit possibly in combination with other treatments including those which are mechanical or optical rather than chemical in order to create a large number of microfeatures on all surfaces thereby further increasing the surface area available for heat exchange. On the surfaces exposed to phase change working fluid this also serves to promote nucleate boiling.

In an electronics application such as a computing system the hottest surfaces are typically associated with the electronic chips with the highest transistor counts CPUs FPGAs switches network interfaces radios etc. and also with various power handling devices.

In a preferred embodiment with phase change working fluid both inside and outside the manifold the manifold and electronics are immersed in it the working fluid can fill any minute gaps between the hot surfaces and the baseplate and then boil off which means that surface compliance is much less important than it would be in a conventional implementation such as one requiring thermal grease which is specifically omitted here . Because a preferred baseplate is CNC machined from copper and then possibly gold plated in an alternative embodiment different thicknesses can easily be created if needed to accommodate potentially different heights of hot surfaces to be mated with. This allows a fixed manifold profile to be used with any variability shifted to differing baseplate heights as necessary.

Inspired by the Gifford Steam Injector invented in 1858 a variant of which is depicted in PRIOR ART the RUBE Vapor Injector is a means to 1 maintain a thermal load the boiler within a desired temperature range and 2 recuperate as much energy as possible from the heat dissipated by the load in order to convert the recuperated heat energy into mechanical energy specifically pressure energy that can be used as motive force to reduce or eliminate the energy that would otherwise be needed for circulation pumps in a phase change heating cooling and or power generation system.

In a preferred embodiment such as for electronics thermal stabilization applications the working fluid may be an organic dielectric fluid with a boiling point between 20 C. and 40 C. such as 1 methoxy heptafluoropropane C3F7OCH3 . Other working fluids may also be suitable some examples of which are listed in section 10.3. In a preferred embodiment the working fluid expands substantially when heated and vaporizes easily. See also RUBE RUBE Double Boiler RUBE Inner Boiler in the glossary.

In essence the RUBE Vapor Injector comprises three cones vapor cone combining cone and delivery cone with a throat or bottleneck between the latter two but specifically no overflow gap or overflow valve . The idea is to use a jet of working fluid vapor when available to augment the flow of working fluid into the boiler heating it up in the process.

In a preferred embodiment such as for electronics thermal stabilization applications the working fluid may be an organic dielectric fluid with a boiling point between 20 C. and 40 C. such as 1 methoxy heptafluoropropane C3F7OCH3 . Other working fluids may also be suitable some examples of which are listed in section 10.3. In a preferred embodiment the working fluid expands substantially when heated and vaporizes easily.

Working fluid with a boiling point below the desired upper threshold enters at check valved liquid inlet it is initially pumped but once the process gets going the working fluid is actually sucked from the inlet due to the thermodynamic effect of the partial vacuum created by condensing vapor in step C and to a lesser extent the Venturi effect . Depending on the actual thermodynamic conditions which in a preferred embodiment is actively monitored and controlled the feed pump s may continue to operate but at a reduced load.

Vapor from check valved vapor inlet enters the converging vapor cone where partial condensation occurs a partial vacuum is created and pressure energy is converted into velocity kinetic energy resulting in a high velocity jet at the nozzle of vapor cone but with a drop in pressure.

High velocity vapor from the nozzle of the vapor cone enters the converging combining cone where the vapor contacts and thoroughly mixes with liquid working fluid resulting in a high vacuum as complete condensation occurs. With a preferred working fluid such as methoxy nonafluorobutane the volume of the vapor is more than 100 times greater about 116 for methoxy nonafluorobutane than the volume of the preferred working fluid from which it was produced so when condensation occurs in the combining cone vapor returns to liquid with a typical reduction in volume of more than 100 1 resulting in a partial vacuum which provides suction at liquid inlet . 

In combining cone the vapor s kinetic energy is transferred to the liquid which results in a jet of heated liquid rushing through the throat of the combining cone and into the divergent delivery cone . Note that unlike the steam injector depicted in PRIOR ART there is no overflow gap and thus no overflow outlet or downstream overflow valve .

The diverging shape of the delivery cone converts the kinetic energy of the heated liquid into pressure energy that is at least slightly higher than boiler pressure which traverses delivery pipe and opens the check valved flow of working fluid for downstream delivery even against a backpressure.

Disabling conditions such as insufficient vapor speed imperfect vapor condensation say due to overly warm fluid at liquid inlet or an overly hot valve body cannot occur in the RUBE vapor injector because its function is to optimize the energy required for pumping rather than to enable pumping in the first place. On the other hand the hotter the load becomes the more efficiently the RUBE vapor injector operates and the greater free motive force it supplies. Working fluid can always be delivered to the delivery outlet if it is supplied at either inlet or . Because the RUBE vapor injector requires much less precision than a steam injector it is expected to be relatively cheaper to manufacture less precision machining if any .

In a preferred embodiment a facility that provides air based equipment cooling for example via HVAC ductwork and or CRAC cooled raised floor plenums connects to the FRAME means directly via an air cooled RUBE air cooled subcooler heat exchanger apparatus. This connection can occur in three different ways 

The RUBE apparatus can reject additional heat into the hot return side of the facility system increasing overall efficiency before the air or fluid is actually returned rather than creating an additional load on the cold supply side of the facility system . In another preferred embodiment the facility connects to the FRAME means or directly or indirectly through a heat exchanger into an embodiment of the STEER apparatus to which an embodiment of the RUBE apparatus is optionally attached.

An energy production and or peak shaving energy management capability whose goal is to reduce operational costs and enhance or enable survivability. FRAME works by significantly reducing the energy required to operate a heat dissipating system such as a computing system through the recuperative use of energy in general and by time shifting the generation and consumption of power to the most effective and or efficient time frames.

Typically the chilled water system CWS is one of three basic designs constant volume variable volume with constant evaporator flow or variable primary flow but all ultimately provide both a chilled water source and a warm water return. In a typical CWS a chiller cools water to between 40 F. and 45 F. 4 C. and 7 C. . The chilled water is distributed throughout the facility in a piping system and connected to local cooling units as needed. Typically a CWS cooled datacenter also distributes chilled underfloor air via raised flooring in this case the local cooling units may include a number of CRAC computer room air conditioning units comprising heat exchangers and air movers these move air over heat exchanger coils that have chilled water circulating through them thus chilling the air.

In a preferred embodiment given a FRAME subsystem means operating with an interface to a co located facility as depicted in where the facility is using air conditioning e.g. CRAC or HVAC or chilled water for cooling datacenter like heat loads e.g. a post use chilled water return temperature of 80 F. to 85 F. or less the facility can route some portion possibly all of its return air or return water directly or indirectly into a FRAME means as depicted in .

In a preferred embodiment the facility connects to the FRAME apparatus directly via a RUBE heat exchanger apparatus so that the RUBE apparatus can reject additional heat into the hot return side of the facility system increasing overall efficiency before the air or fluid is actually returned rather than creating an additional load on the cold supply side of the facility system . In another preferred embodiment the facility connects to the FRAME apparatus or directly or indirectly through a heat exchanger into an embodiment of the STEER apparatus to which an embodiment of the RUBE apparatus is optionally attached.

In another preferred embodiment facilities with roof access or other access to outside air or with access to a ground loop can easily reject heat energy while completely avoiding the additional energy cost associated with a CWS or HVAC system FRAME and specifically the RUBE apparatus gives up its waste heat at least partially via phase change which is thermally efficient since no compressor would be required for ambient temperatures up to 90 F. or more . Of course where applicable the waste heat could also be put to good use in other facility heating or preheating applications hot water heating snow removal etc. . The waste heat temperature optionally available from FRAME can be significantly higher by 10 F. to 30 F. or more than typical data center waste heat and therefore may be potentially more useful.

In a facility using CRAC units or equivalently for this description centralized air conditioning without chilled water chilled air is typically forced under a computer room raised floor to where it is needed with warmed return air moved back to the CRAC unit via a path near the ceiling in a well designed system there may also be hot and cold aisles but these have no bearing on this description . In a preferred embodiment the FRAME means is connected to said facility CRAC units in the warm return air path where the warm air provides a cooling effect that is utilized by the FRAME s RUBE liquid to air condenser means while also raising the average temperature of the air that is actually passed on to said CRAC units. In an alternate preferred embodiment the FRAME means is connected to the facility CRAC units in the cold air path where the air provides a cooling effect that is utilized by the RUBE liquid to air condenser in a manner not unlike typical air cooled datacenter equipment. In another preferred embodiment the FRAME means is connected to the facility CRAC units in both the cold air and warm return air paths with one or more dynamically controllable dampers that provide selectivity as to which air source path is primary and to what degree so as to be capable of accepting control inputs that allow the relative quantities of cooling air directed to the FRAME means and thereby regulating the temperature of the input air. In a preferred embodiment said dampers are controlled by the SLAM apparatus depicted in .

A setup similar to CRAC units can used with the HVAC Heating Ventilation Air Conditioning units often deployed in buildings other than datacenters except that traditional HVAC systems tend to utilize duct work rather than depending on a raised floor with underfloor air movement. Nonetheless in a preferred embodiment the FRAME means is connected to a facility HVAC system with the same set of air source constraints i.e. warm return air cold air or dynamically selectable as for a system based on one or more CRAC units but using ductwork rather than underfloor spaces for the cold air supply.

Given a facility that uses a chilled water system CWS for cooling and which optionally also has CRAC units comprising heat exchangers with air movers in a preferred embodiment the connection of the FRAME means to the air system can be strictly optional substituting instead a connection to the CWS itself with the FRAME means emulating a CRAC unit either directly or via a liquid to liquid heat exchanger.

Given a facility that uses a chilled water system CWS for cooling but which provides only CRAC units comprising heat exchangers with air movers without providing for chilled water distribution to non CRAC units in a preferred embodiment the FRAME means to the air system can be strictly optional substituting instead a connection to the chilled water system itself either directly or via a liquid to liquid heat exchanger.

Given a facility that uses a CWS for cooling and has no air movers said FRAME means connects to the chilled water system itself either directly or via a liquid to liquid heat exchanger. Typically the CWS is one of three basic designs 

In a preferred embodiment the FRAME apparatus is connected to the facility CWS units in the warm return water path where the warm return water provides a cooling effect that is utilized by the FRAME s RUBE condenser means while also raising the average temperature of the air that is actually passed on to said CRAC units. In an alternate preferred embodiment the FRAME means is connected to the facility CRAC units in the cold air path where the air provides a cooling effect that is utilized by the RUBE condenser in the same way as typical air cooled datacenter equipment. In another preferred embodiment the FRAME means is connected to the facility CRAC units in both the cold air and warm return air paths with one or more dynamically controllable dampers that provide selectivity as to which path is primary and to what degree so as to regulate the temperature and quantity of cooling air directed to the FRAME means. In a preferred embodiment said dampers are controlled by the SLAM apparatus depicted in .

PERKS is hybrid energy system combining UPS with a peak shaving system that directly captures excess or low cost energy from a multiplicity of sources when it is cheapest or most readily available and stores it for later reuse such as during peak periods when power is most expensive or less available . Unlike a UPS which remains charged just in case the PERKS capability continually captures and discharges stored energy just in time as needed so as to reduce the overall energy cost and maximize full processing availability. Depending on capacity and load PERKS may also serve as an extended runtime UPS.

External Thermal Exchange Storage. In a preferred embodiment thermal energy can be transferred to or from working fluids by pre heating or pre chilling them respectively at convenient points in time and storing said fluids into their respective locations in preparation for their subsequent use i.e. at a later time .

In a preferred embodiment relatively hot working fluid preheated or otherwise obtained from a source of relatively low grade heat e.g. above 85 C. can be stored externally in an insulated tank or other low heat loss storage means and such storage can be connected to the STEER apparatus directly or indirectly via a heat exchanger means then subsequently used to directly or indirectly supply thermal energy to the FORCE apparatus as a means to help generate electrical power on demand. In a preferred embodiment an engineered fluid with a relatively low boiling point e.g. 93 F. is used as the working fluid for temperatures up to approximately 260 F. In an alternative preferred embodiment a non toxic high grade low vapor pressure low viscosity thermal oil e.g. such as Paratherm is used for thermal energy storage and transfer for fluid temperatures up to approximately 650 F.

In a preferred embodiment relatively cold working fluid pre chilled or otherwise obtained from a source of at least low grade cold e.g. below 15 C. can be stored in an insulated tank or other low heat gain storage means. In a preferred embodiment an engineered phase change working fluid is used directly for this especially if very low temperatures are available to justify the expense such fluids are often pumpable to below minus 100 C. but are relatively expensive . In an alternative embodiment a more conventional and less expensive water glycol solution or other suitable fluid is used. In a preferred embodiment an engineered phase change working fluid have a very low freezing point e.g. below minus 100 C. is stored directly and maintained at a temperature well below the ambient temperatures anticipated to occur subsequently.

In a preferred embodiment opportunistic thermal sinks e.g. cool or cold ambient air ground loops liquid tanks etc. can be used directly e.g. as is or indirectly by cooling an intermediate working fluid to subcool or otherwise pre cool working fluids that can be stored in an insulated tank or other low heat gain storage means and such storage can be connected to the STEER apparatus directly or via a heat exchanger means then subsequently used to optimally supply thermal cooling in a low cost time shifted manner. In a preferred embodiment a combination of ground loops and underground liquid tanks serves not only to optimally supply thermal cooling by virtue of the intentional subterranean surface area but also serves as an important storage means.

PERKS As depicted in the context of the PERKS apparatus directly captures excess or low cost energy from a multiplicity of sources e.g. opportunistically such as when it is cheapest or most readily available and stores it for later i.e. time shifted use such as during peak periods e.g. when power is relatively more expensive or less available . In a preferred embodiment to directly capture available electrical energy batteries based on nano structured lithium titanate spinel oxide LTO electrode materials which replace the graphite electrode materials found in negative electrodes of conventional Li Ion batteries are used in order to achieve a high capacity battery array with a high cycle life thousands for full depth battery charge discharge cycles quick charge and discharge without heat issues or out gassing and relative insensitivity to ambient temperatures with no safety issues and no need to consume energy to control the ambient temperatures seen by the batteries . In an alternative preferred embodiment zinc bromine based flow batteries are used and these can source warm working fluid and sink both warm working and cool working fluid to maintain the desired electrolyte temperature range. In alternative embodiments other battery technologies are also feasible with commensurate enhancements or reductions in specific parameters.

In a preferred embodiment as depicted in the PERKS apparatus typically exchanges working fluids that are relatively warm at or below the fluid s boiling point which may be only 93 F. in a preferred embodiment or cool i.e. well below the fluid s boiling point but nowhere near freezing but these are primarily related to internal operation rather than as sources of thermal energy to be stored. In an alternate embodiment more extreme temperature ranges e.g. relatively hot and or cold may be accepted thermally stored and subsequently delivered thereby providing an energy reserve in thermal form.

Wind energy is another form of solar energy and often tends to peak during daylight hours diurnal cycle due to solar heating with dips in wind energy at night nocturnal cycle . Many SUREFIRE sites may be intentionally located where wind energy can be taken advantage of even if only on a small scale. Wind energy can be used to directly generate electricity for immediate use and excess electrical energy can be used to charge a PERKS battery array which can later provide electrical power on demand . Because wind speed is highly variable wind turbines tend to generate variable voltage variable frequency AC power wild AC which is subsequently conditioned i.e. rectified to DC and then optionally inverted back to stable AC with optional voltage and or phase changes along the way . All of the power conditioning actions that generate heat must normally viewed as a source of energy loss and thus a loss of efficiency.

In the Scrutiny SUREFIRE system however most or all of the power conditioning apparatus such as PERKS described elsewhere is colocated with or near the other electrical loads in the system so that any generated and otherwise lost heat energy associated with power conditioning may be recuperated and reused. For example whereas the alternators frequently found in turbomachinery and wind turbines typically provide local rectification i.e. within the alternator itself in a preferred embodiment remotely located SUREFIRE alternators output only wild AC with any necessary rectification taking place within the confines of FRAME energy recapturing apparatus . This provides three significant benefits 1 the alternators are simpler lighter and potentially more reliable 2 the wild AC may typically incur much lower distribution losses than rectified DC which is especially important for wind turbines atop a tall tower or otherwise located such that power distribution is a consideration and 3 the heat energy generated by rectification may be recuperated rather than being lost.

For another example battery charge discharge cycles also typically generate heat and this heat must normally be rejected from the system while also maintaining battery temperatures within strict limits for optimum life and ensuring that excessive discharge e.g. more than 50 discharged typically doesn t occur. However in a preferred embodiment of the PERKS subsystem a commercially available ZBB zinc bromine battery flow battery array may be colocated with the electrical loads and the heat energy from its charge discharge cycles is recuperated. Not only does this conserve energy but the ZBB array becomes highly tolerant of ambient temperature swings and by its nature can be routinely discharged to 0 i.e. 100 discharged without damage. Furthermore during periods with no charge discharge activity heat energy from the various other parts of the system already described can be used to maintain for free a thermal stable environment for the ZBB array whose electrolyte freezes at 10 C. 50 F. and which operates best in the temperature range 26 C. 80 F. to 32 C. 90 F. with an absolute operating range of 21 C. 70 F. minimum to 49 C. 120 F. maximum. In a preferred embodiment thermal stability of temperature sensitive battery array is maintained by via thermal and sensory interfaces to STEER apparatus in order to recuperate and redirect heat energy by sourcing or sinking it as appropriate.

The PERKS subsystem uses the power from the SCRAM subsystem s multi rail redundant AC power supplies to charge batteries when everything is fine i.e. when power is available and failures are not excessive thereby requiring no additional capacity.

As depicted in the FORCE apparatus is a kilowatt scale e.g. 0.5 KW to 50 KW modified Rankine cycle heat engine that may comprise the following in some combination electrical energy sources fuel or chemical energy sources thermal energy sources low temperature low pressure vapor turbines generators or alternators heaters working fluids including at least one appropriate organic working fluid for two phase liquid vapor operation heat exchangers including for example vaporizers superheaters recuperators desuperheaters heaters preheaters dehumidifiers condensers and subcoolers insulation reflectors sensors valves manifolds pumps miscellaneous plumbing apparatus etc.

In a preferred embodiment the FORCE apparatus may interface and integrate with the STEER apparatus depicted in for some or all of the internal connectivity i.e. the working fluid inputs and outputs among its internal subsystems where said working fluids provide a controllable means for thermal energy exchange. In an alternative preferred embodiment i.e. not involving the STEER apparatus depicted in the FORCE apparatus may interface directly or indirectly to the various apparatus depicted in for some or all of its working fluid inputs and outputs where said working fluids provide a controllable means for thermal energy exchange not depicted .

In a preferred embodiment the FORCE apparatus may interface with the PERKS apparatus depicted in for some or all of its electrical energy fuel inputs and outputs and or chemical energy e.g. fuel inputs. In an alternative preferred embodiment the FORCE apparatus may interface with the SCRAM apparatus depicted in for some or all of its electrical energy outputs not depicted .

In a preferred embodiment a primary object of the FORCE apparatus is to convert externally supplied electrical energy chemical energy e.g. one or more types of fuel and or thermal energy e.g. heat contained in some type of working fluid into electrical energy and or thermal energy that may then be provided as an output to other subsystems. In a preferred embodiment said electrical energy may be output directly to the PERKS apparatus for subsequent further conversion storage and or distribution. In a preferred embodiment high quality thermal energy may be provided as an output in addition to or in lieu of electrical energy. In a preferred embodiment said thermal energy may be output to the STEER apparatus for subsequent further transport conversion storage and or distribution.

In a preferred embodiment the FORCE apparatus depicted in may comprise closed loop thermodynamic circuits involving a single phase change working fluid that may be interchanged among the various subsystems of the FRAME apparatus depicted in . In a preferred embodiment such as when FORCE is integrates with electronics thermal stabilization applications the working fluid may be an organic dielectric fluid with a boiling point between 20 C. and 40 C. such as 1 methoxy heptafluoropropane C3F7OCH3 . Other working fluids may also be suitable some examples of which are listed in section 10.3. In a preferred embodiment the working fluid expands substantially when heated and vaporizes easily.

In a preferred embodiment the FORCE apparatus depicted in may be augmented with additional closed loop thermodynamic circuits involving one or more non phase change working fluids that may be interchanged among selected subsystems of the FRAME apparatus depicted in . In a preferred embodiment one said non phase change working fluid may be a thermal oil with a low vapor pressure e.g. less than 5 PSIA within a full operational temperature range of for example 49 C. 120 F. to 315 C. 600 F. such as commercially available Paratherm NF heat transfer fluid available from Paratherm Corp. 4 Portland Road West Conshohocken Pa. 19428 USA .

In a preferred embodiment the vapor turbine and generator or alternator may be combined into a single turboalternator or turbogenerator unit hereafter referred to as a turboalternator for simplicity an integrated unit comprising a turbine and a generator or alternator such that the combination shares a common direct drive shaft i.e. the turbine shares the same shaft with the alternator or generator forcing them to spin together .

In a preferred embodiment said turboalternator may be constructed so as to have only one moving part that being the shared shaft such that during operation the shared shaft may rotate at an essentially constant fixed rate in the range of 50 000 to 250 000 RPM and during said rotation may float hydrodynamically on a vapor layer created by its foils thus implementing quasi frictionless vapor bearings or gas bearings that may need no lubrication or maintenance wear occurs only during spin up and spin down such as when the rotational speed drops below a particular physical threshold that may be for example equivalent to 3 of its normal fixed rate at which point the foils of the turboalternator may begin to incur friction . In a preferred embodiment said turboalternator may be designed and constructed using techniques known to those skilled in the art so as to enable on the order of 25 000 to 50 000 spin up spin down cycles without maintenance and an operating life on the order of 100 000 hours more than 11 years of continuous operation .

In a preferred embodiment the turbine portion of said turboalternator may be of the radial inflow type specifically designed using techniques known to those skilled in the art so as to work well with a selection from among the preferred superheated working fluids preferred inlet temperatures e.g. 120 C. to 160 C. and preferred pressure ranges e.g. 3 bar to 8 bar and with an electrical load range appropriate for the intended purpose such that the characterizations of both the design point and selected off design points may be known and such that the relationship between inlet pressure and output power may be sufficiently understood so as to enable proper control.

In a preferred embodiment said turboalternator may be designed to operate at a specific fixed rotational rate subrange within an overall range of 50 000 to 250 000 RPM while allowing both the differential pressure i.e. the difference between inlet pressure and outlet pressure and the electrical load to vary under external control as long as the fixed rotational rate within said subrange is maintained i.e. a control function may be required so that for example if the electrical load is reduced then the differential pressure may also be reduced e.g. by reducing the inlet pressure as is common practice in order to ensure that the specified fixed rotational rate range is not exceeded . In a preferred embodiment the differential pressure may be reduced by some combination of decreasing the inlet pressure and or increasing the outlet pressure e.g. by creating backpressure downstream of the turboalternator outlet thereby increasing the range of external control options available. Referring to in a preferred embodiment said external control may be provided by a combination of the SLAM apparatus and the STEER apparatus .

In a preferred embodiment the system may comprise a multiplicity of said turboalternators having the same similar or widely differing capacities so that a control function within the system of which said turboalternators are a part may dynamically reconfigure and control said turboalternators in order to meet the needs of said system at a point in time. Referring to in a preferred embodiment said control function may be provided by a combination of the SLAM apparatus and the STEER apparatus .

In a preferred embodiment a family of turboalternators hereafter turboalternator family may be designed and constructed to accept a variable set of working fluids with a range of compatible properties. In a preferred embodiment said turboalternator family may be optimally designed for organic working fluids and most preferentially an organic dielectric fluid with a relatively low boiling point between for example 20 C. and 40 C. such as 1 methoxy heptafluoropropane C3F7OCH3 . Other suitable working fluids may include for example C5F12 C6F14 C4F9OCH3 C4F9CH3 C4F9OC2H5 C4F9C5H5 and CCl2FCH3 as well as others and may also include combinations of said fluids some of which may not be organic dielectric fluids having boiling points within the exemplary range.

In an alternative embodiment said turboalternator family members may be constructed at low cost by using off the shelf radial turbine and bearings means for example by repurposing a suitable mass produced refrigerator compressor turbine and operating it in reverse such that it effectively becomes a radial inflow turbine . In said alternative embodiment the availability of suitable components may severely constrain the turboalternator design and construction of said family members especially with respect to performance efficiency cycle life and runtime.

In a preferred embodiment said turboalternator family comprises a set of relatively miniature nanoturbine turboalternator units at the 10 KW 1.5 KW and 500 watt electrical output design points many other design points are possible including both much larger and much smaller power outputs and may be selected according to intended use operating with a common design point inlet temperature of 125 C. an outlet temperature exceeding 100 C. an inlet pressure of approximately 6 bar 87 PSIA and an outlet pressure of approximately 1 bar 14.5 PSIA with overall efficiency i.e. that being the product of adiabatic efficiency mechanical efficiency and alternator or generator efficiency typically greater than 60 . Note We use the nanoturbine label to denote a class of turbine machinery that is quantitatively smaller than the turbine machinery commonly referred to as microturbines rather than to denote the class of still smaller turbine machines that one might fabricate by integrating mechanical elements sensors actuators and electronics on a common silicon substrate using microfabrication technology commonly referred to as MEMS Micro Electro Mechanical Systems . To maintain a monotonically decreasing machine class nomenclature a MEMS based machine would most probably be referred to as a picoturbine which is the label used herein. The mass flow rates outlet temperatures rotational speeds and relative outputs at off design points e.g. at 5 bar 4 bar etc. may vary widely among the family members due to their inherent differences in electrical output and anticipated loads Table 22 provides an approximate cross family characterization that may be achieved for said preferred embodiment at said design points.

In a preferred embodiment said turboalternator families may output alternating current AC rather than rectifying it to direct current DC thereby avoiding rectification when AC is an acceptable output and also avoiding in this case an unnecessary energy wasting conversion or enabling rectification to occur remotely or at some distance from the turboalternator for example in order to simplify recapturing of waste heat energy from rectification . In a preferred embodiment said turboalternator families output single phase wild AC or alternating current AC voltage where neither the voltage nor the current is constant but for a given AC frequency both the voltage and current may vary from one power output level to another. For example as the power output increases the current may increase while the voltage decreases as is depicted in Table 23 for one of the members of said turboalternator family. In said embodiment the output frequency e.g. 1000 Hz may be a direct consequence of and therefore as stable as i.e. as constant as the turboalternator s actual rotational rate e.g. 50 000 RPM . In an alternative preferred embodiment an AC to DC rectification circuit may be co located with or attached to the turboalternator.

In an alternative preferred embodiment a turboalternator family may be constructed using e.g. by using known MEMS microfabrication techniques in conjunction with known turbomachinery design principles that comprises a set of quantitatively smaller picoturbine turboalternator units at the 10 watt 1.5 watt and 500 milliwatt electrical output design points many other design points are possible and may be selected according to intended use operating with a common design point inlet temperature of 125 C. outlet temperature exceeding 100 C. inlet pressure of up to 8 bar 116 PSIA and outlet pressure of 1 bar 14.5 PSIA . Note We use the picoturbine label to denote a class of turbine machinery that is quantitatively smaller than the turbine machinery we refer to as nanoturbines. 

The FORCE Post Turboalternator Recuperator hereafter simply recuperator when unambiguous is a counter current heat exchanger whose purpose is to recuperate the thermal energy remaining in the still superheated working fluid after an upstream turboalternator has reduced the pressure of said fluid. The temperature of the fluid at the recuperator s inlet is effectively equal to the temperature of the fluid at the turboalternator s outlet.

In the art the turbine component of a turboalternator is modeled as an adiabatic process i.e. one in which no heat is gained or lost by the system that accomplishes work by converting a pressure differential into mechanical energy which the alternator generator component subsequently converts into electrical energy . However in the real world adiabatic process efficiency is less than 100 so some heat may be lost and this partly accounts for a difference in the working fluid temperatures between the turbine s inlet and outlet with the outlet seeing a reduced temperature. In a preferred embodiment the turboalternator family described in 10.5.1 may have a common inlet temperature of approximately 125 C. 257 F. and an outlet temperature of approximately 100 C. 212 F. or more which may subsequently be the lowest temperature at the recuperator s inlet.

In a preferred embodiment the recuperator accepts a superheated working fluid in approximately the 100 C. 212 F. to 125 C. 257 F. temperature range as the hot stream to be cooled and accepts working fluid in liquid and or saturated vapor form in approximately the 20 C. 68 F. to 40 C. 104 F. temperature range as the cold stream to be heated.

In a preferred embodiment such as for electronics thermal stabilization applications the working fluid may be an organic dielectric fluid with a boiling point between 20 C. and 40 C. such as 1 methoxy heptafluoropropane C3F7OCH3 . Other working fluids may also be suitable some examples of which are listed in section 10.3. In a preferred embodiment the working fluid expands substantially when heated and vaporizes easily.

In a preferred embodiment said hot and cold streams use the same type of working fluid and are intentionally part of the same circuit thus enabling the convenient mixing of streams to accomplish specific objectives. In an alternative preferred embodiment said hot and cold streams use the same type of working fluid but are not part of the same circuit i.e. the hot and cold streams cannot mix under normal circumstances .

In a preferred embodiment a flat plate heat exchanger with adequate surface area and not excessive pressure drop may be used to implement a FORCE Post Turboalternator Recuperator. In an alternative embodiment some other fluid compatible heat exchanger with adequate surface area and not excessive pressure drop may be used.

FORCE The FORCE apparatus is a kilowatt scale e.g. 0.5 KW to 50 KW turboalternator means e.g. one or more differential pressure heat engines with mechanically coupled alternators or generators and heat source means designed and configured such that it can accept relatively low temperature e.g. 95 C. to 130 C. low pressure e.g. 3 8 bar working fluid e.g. in a preferred embodiment from the STEER apparatus in order to generate electrical power in a preferred embodiment the output is wild AC . In a preferred embodiment the slightly cooled e.g. by 20 C. to 30 C. pressure reduced e.g. to 1 bar working fluid is returned to the STEER apparatus where it can be mixed and or redistributed where needed in order to efficiently recuperate its residual heat energy. In an alternative embodiment the slightly cooled working fluid is routed through a heat exchanger means in order to reject unwanted heat energy to another system or to the ambient environment etc.

In a preferred embodiment involving the FORCE nanoturbine system a multiplicity of nanoturbines may be used when the total heat energy available exceeds the capacity of a single unit and or to achieve a specific level of redundancy e.g. in order to achieve an availability threshold .

In alternative preferred embodiment the FORCE nanoturbine system indicated above can be combined e.g. in a fixed configuration or dynamically via the STEER apparatus with one or more FPSE Free Piston Stirling Engine devices such that waste heat still present in the nanoturbine outlet stream is captured and used to heat one or more FPSE devices which convert the heat to mechanical energy and can therefore do useful work including the generation of electricity . In yet another alternative embodiment one or more FPSE devices take the place of single or multiple FORCE nanoturbine devices as described above.

SOLAR . Self Orienting Light Aggregating Receiver. In a preferred embodiment a system using a relatively low temperature phase change working fluid to receive heat energy from the sun for immediate use in which case it acts as a boiler or subsequent use and especially for the primary purpose of generating electricity. In an alternative embodiment a system using a relatively low vapor pressure working fluid for example an appropriate Paratherm thermal oil to receive heat energy from the sun for immediate or subsequent use. The heat energy in this context refers to energy that can be immediately used immediately or stored for later use to effect or help effect a liquid vapor phase change such as occurs by design in a boiler. Received energy heats and expands the phase change working fluid which may have been preheated via RUBE above and which in conjunction with optional vapor injection see RUBE Vapor Injector described elsewhere in the boiler feed circuit and in conjunction with a FORCE nanoturbine or FPSE Free Piston Stirling Engine in the boiler output circuit can be used to accomplish work and particularly to generate electricity.

SOLAR The SOLAR apparatus comprises some combination of means for tracking and or concentrating solar energy and directing it to a receiver means where it is collected and converted to thermal energy and transferred to a working fluid. In a preferred embodiment the SOLAR apparatus may also comprise a STEER apparatus interface for accepting and delivering working fluid to one or more companion subsystems e.g. the RUBE apparatus or FORCE apparatus etc. .

In an alternate preferred embodiment a means such as the FORCE apparatus or a subset of it may be co located with and possibly connected directly to the SOLAR apparatus in order to directly generate electrical power without the potential thermal energy losses associated with transporting working fluid. In another preferred embodiment the SOLAR apparatus may comprise some combination of concentrating and non concentrating photo voltaic PV means for generating electrical power accompanied by a means for recuperating thermal energy from said PV means and while also beneficially reducing the operating temperature of the PV means . In a preferred embodiment the means for recuperating thermal energy from said PV means may be provided by incorporating a RUBE recuperator assembly into the SOLAR apparatus . In still another preferred embodiment one or more and possibly all of the aforementioned energy capture and power generation means may be present allowing for dynamic reconfiguration and repurposing of the energy collection means and maximum flexibility in the generation and distribution of power from said energy. In a preferred embodiment the SOLAR apparatus may also comprise a thermal energy dissipation device or apparatus e.g. a radiator or heat exchanger for dissipating thermal energy e.g. through radiation convection and or conduction to the environment. In a preferred embodiment said thermal dissipation device or apparatus may take advantage of exposed metallic surfaces associated with the SOLAR apparatus . In a preferred embodiment said exposed metallic surfaces may include multi use surfaces capable of providing an optically reflective and or light concentrating surface on one side and dissipative and or physically protective surface on the other side. In a preferred embodiment the SOLAR apparatus may comprise a means for reorienting said multi use surfaces such that at least one configuration may protect the solar energy receiver while enabling simultaneous thermal energy dissipation. In a preferred embodiment the SOLAR apparatus comprises a means for reorienting said multi use surfaces such that one configuration may track the sun while reflecting and concentrating solar energy onto a receiver means while also still enabling thermal energy dissipation.

In a preferred embodiment each SHADOWS site and to a lesser extent any arbitrary datacenter is equipped with one or more SHADOWS SOLAR concentrating solar power systems in order to increase survivability and to decrease dependence on fuel reserves during off grid operation.

The sun occupies 32 minutes of arc i.e. approximately 0.53 degrees and is not a point source. The sun s 0.53 degree source is a good match for a 2.4 meter 8 foot parabolic dish having an aperture area of 4.5 m2 i.e. pi 1.2m 2 4.5 m2 approximately and a 3 db beamwidth of 0.71 C band .

If such a dish is covered with or composed of a highly reflective material in the optical sense and used as a parabolic solar reflector this corresponds to a theoretical maximum of about 4.5 KW of collectible solar energy given a solar insolation of 1000 W m2 and a tracking system to keep the dish on sun . The 2.4M dish is the largest low cost one piece dish available. Larger dishes are disproportionately more expensive both in CAPEX capital expense and OPEX operational expense and require significant labor and logistics just to handle them. Of course a multiplicity of smaller low cost dishes could also be used such as the 24 inch diameter polished aluminum dishes from Edmunds Scientific .

Normally the aperture opening where the feedhorn would be if the parabolic dish were used as an antenna is around 1 inch 2.54 cm in diameter for a 2.4M dish corresponding to a focal area of about 5.08 cm2 0.000508 m2 . This is corresponds to a solar concentration ratio of almost 9 000 suns 4.5 0.000508 0.000508 8 857 . The maximum solar concentration feasible with today s most advanced concentrator PV cells is about 1000 suns so we would need to defocus to a concentration of only 1000 suns. In a preferred embodiment defocusing would be achieved partly probably mostly by moving the receiver away from the focal point and away from the dish for our purposes and in an alternative embodiment partly by using a highly reflective 97.4 material that is slightly diffuse e.g. spacesuit material which is reflective but does not have a mirror finish .

In another alternative preferred embodiment a Cassegrain reflector apparatus is used where each parabolic reflector is accompanied by an hyperbolic subreflector at the focus point which reflects back through an opening in the center of the parabolic reflector and directs light onto the concentrator PV cells and other apparatus cooling etc. situated behind into the parabolic reflector. Depending on the materials used for the hyperbolic subreflector and the precision and quality of finish it could be sized to approximate the natural focal area of the parabolic dish in which case it would need to efficiently reflect a solar flux of almost 9 000 suns or in a preferred embodiment would be sized and shaped to be slightly defocused so as to reflect a solar flux approximately equal to or slightly greater than the maximum solar flux to be handled by the concentrator PV cells allowing for oversplash which is discussed further below after taking into account the hyperbolic subreflector efficiency. In a preferred embodiment the hyperbolic subreflector is highly polished but mass produced and would likely become extremely hot i.e. beyond the melting point of the subreflector without active cooling therefore in such an embodiment the subreflector would be treated as an intended receiver of heat energy and active cooling would be achieved by transferring the heat energy to an intermediate heat transfer fluid described further below .

Assuming that we defocus to 1000 suns the defocused hot spot area must be approximately equal to S m2 where 

At a solar insolation of 1000 W m 2 or about 100 W cm 2 Spectrolab s Improved Triple Junction ITJ PV cells for example are estimated to achieve an efficiency of at least 28 or 28 W cm 2. Ignoring reflector efficiency for now with a cell area of 45 cm 2 this corresponds to 1260 W of direct PV generated power 28 45 1260 . Most of the remaining solar energy 100 28 leaves about 72 is either absorbed by the PV cells or reflected from the PV cells and absorbed by the enclosing receiver s black body interior. Either way this leaves about 3240 W of collected heat energy 4500 W 1260 W 3240 W that must be removed from the receiver via a heat transfer fluid. Spectrolab s ITJ PV cells can operate at 1000 suns only if they re on a ceramic substrate that is actively cooled to around 105 C. 221 F. or less which can be trivially accomplished via liquid cooling and rejecting the waste heat to the air or into a ground loop or to some other heat sink. Note Some concentrating PV cells are maximally efficient at other intensities e.g. 500 suns and the effect is that of reducing intensity is to allow further defocusing which creates a large area possibly allowing more cells but also possibly reducing their cooling requirements. It is typically not possible to direct concentrated light onto only the PV cells and any such oversplashed light causes local heating wherever it touches so in a preferred embodiment a high quality black body is used as a secondary receiver of heat energy in order to capture it for downstream use.

In a preferred embodiment however the waste heat from the PV system above and in the case of an embodiment having an actively cooled Cassegrain subreflector any heat the subreflector produces via absorption and transfer to a working fluid is used to directly or indirectly drive a FORCE nanoturbine as part of an integration of the SHADOWS supercomputing system or other heat producing subsystem s with our local power generation capability.

A preferred embodiment comprises a combination of said PV system with a FORCE low temperature closed loop nanoturbine system along with a supercomputing or other heat producing subsystem s whose waste heat serves to preheats and partly or completely vaporizes the phase change working fluid. In a preferred embodiment the working fluid may be an organic dielectric fluid with a boiling point between 20 C. and 40 C. such as 1 methoxy heptafluoropropane C3F7OCH3 . Other working fluids may also be suitable some examples of which are listed in section 10.3. In a preferred embodiment the working fluid expands substantially when heated and vaporizes easily.

The hotter the various component parts of the system can be allowed to get the higher the pressure at which the thermal system can operate up to the maximum desired pressure in a preferred embodiment based on the FORCE nanoturbine the maximum desired pressure is that which is required as the turbine s inlet pressure which is only 3 to 6 bar and or target temperature of the heat producing devices or the useful upper limit of the working fluid whichever is lower. In a preferred embodiment one or more sets of RUBE manifolds described elsewhere in the supercomputer or other heat producing subsystem s preferably operates in the 30 C. to 40 C. range for a particular class of heat producing electronic chips in order to maximize reliability and minimize the power dissipation that occurs due to leaky transistors as such chips approach their maximum TDP temperatures the avoidance of which requires maintaining Tcase well below that while another set operates simultaneously and safely in the 90 C. to 110 C. range for a different class of heat producing electronic chips the PV devices described fall into the latter range along with certain power supply components and other devices . Any waste heat captured from the oversplash of concentrated light is expected to be below 130 C. if the preferred phase change fluid is used and possibly well above that if an intermediate heat transport fluid is used. In a preferred embodiment the same working fluid is used for all three temperature ranges in fact the cooler system can feed the hotter systems however this would typically require a boost in inlet pressure for the downstream hotter systems which can be accomplished externally via pumps or via the RUBE Vapor Injector described elsewhere .

In a preferred embodiment of our low temperature closed loop FORCE nanoturbine system we can either use the phase change working fluid directly to cool the PV cells to 105 C. or less or we can use an intermediate heat transfer transport fluid with a very low vapor pressure for example a thermal oil such as Paratherm to transport the heat to a point where it can be transferred to the phase change fluid via a heat exchanger. The choice of fluids and whether to use an intermediate heat transport fluid is largely driven by the proximity of the FORCE nanoturbine to the PV cells. In a preferred embodiment the PV cells FORCE nanoturbine and power consuming heat producing subsystem s are all colocated and no intermediate heat transport fluid is necessary for heating. In an alternative embodiment an intermediate fluid is used to actively cool the PV cells to 105 C. 221 F. or less while heating the intermediate heat transport fluid to around 93 C. 200 F. and then using it to preheat and or boil the phase change working fluid for the nanoturbine system. The intermediate heat transport fluid may be used immediately and or stored thermally for later use depending on the volume available the operational status of the FORCE nanoturbine system immediate electrical power demand etc. Normally however the intermediate heat transport fluid is supplied directly to the FORCE nanoturbine which in a preferred embodiment is colocated with the SOLAR collector apparatus thereby eliminating the energy loss that would occur if the nanoturbine were located further away.

Depending on the temperature of the cold source e.g. cooling water or other intermediate heat transport fluid which could range for example from 24 C. 55 F. down to 18 C. 0 F. or lower according to climate season etc. the Carnot efficiency of the nanoturbine ranges from a typical 24 to an infrequent 34 or more. Thus ignoring SOLAR collector efficiency for now and also ignoring energy recuperated elsewhere in the system the typical nanoturbine power available from a single 2.4 meter solar reflector dish would range from 775 W 24 of 3240 W to 1100 W 34 of 3240 W . However for each solar reflector that generates heat from the sun there is also an electrical load that generates heat and in a preferred embodiment this heat is collected and used to preheat the working fluid supplied to the PV cells. As a consequence at least 2200 W per reflector must be added to the energy provided to the nanoturbine system raising the pre Carnot figures from 3240 W to 5740 W 3240 2500 5740 . Recalculating the theoretical nanoturbine output based solely on Carnot efficiency yields a range of 1375 W 24 of 5740 W to 1950 W 34 of 5740 W .

Operating principles similar to those described in section 10.6.1 also hold for simpler non concentrating PV arrays and to a lesser extent for non PV arrays. To the extent such systems are not self orienting i.e. sun tracking they typically must be oriented toward the equator and angled to match the latitude plus or minus a few degrees. From a SHADOWS viewpoint two key considerations are that 

1 Due to their non concentrating nature and therefore lower efficiency per square foot of collector area such array tend to be much larger than their concentrating e.g. SOLAR counterparts and therefore may require more sun facing area than is readily available or affordable .

2 Due to their size relative to a SOLAR BLOOMER dish array for example such arrays may not be able to be easily protected from weather and other external risks.

Heat absorption can be an issue for non concentrating PV arrays since they tend to operate more efficiently at cooler temperatures and in any case the absorption of heat implies wasted energy. Depending on the specifics of a particular non concentrating PV array and the importance of collecting energy relative to the cost of doing so active cooling based on FRAME RUBE technology may be very appropriate.

Non PV solar arrays are designed specifically to collect heat energy and thus fit quite naturally with FRAME RUBE technology. Depending on the availability of adequate space for a non PV solar array integration with FRAME RUBE technology may be very appropriate.

Assuming maximum insolation and ignoring reflector inefficiency and other system inefficiencies for now the maximum total power available from a single solar reflector including recuperation of energy from its corresponding load is in the range of 2635 W 1260 1375 to 3210 W 1260 1950 . Thus during periods of high insolation a single reflector provides slightly more power than its corresponding 2500 W load with a system efficiency in the range of 58 2635 4500 to 71 3210 4500 . Excess electrical energy is used to charge a commercially available battery array for example a zinc bromine battery array which can then provide power on demand both peak shaving and backup power when it cannot be otherwise generated.

Energy storage whether thermal or electrical is an important part of the SUREFIRE concept. However even during periods of high insolation a single solar reflector doesn t provide enough excess capacity for storage except to provide ride through for passing clouds etc. . In general each 2500 W continuous load requires at least a second solar reflector dish nanoturbine etc. By associating a FORCE nanoturbine with a solar reflector it is simple to scale out the power capacity on a plug and play basis making it easy to provide excess daytime good weather capacity that can be stored for later use. Even when there is no sunshine the heat collected from electrical loads can be stored thermally for later use and or used to pre heat an intermediate heat transport fluid a portion of which is subsequently heated as necessary by a fuel fired boiler e.g. such as one that burns fuel whether renewable or not and then used to vaporize the selected phase change working fluid that feeds the FORCE nanoturbine.

The are numerous SUREFIRE site configurations possible in order to provide the basis of meeting a diverse set of needs. In general technologies taught in one example configuration are implicitly applicable to the others. The three exemplary configurations described each with its own unique properties are 

A preferred embodiment for housing a single SCRAM machine is an underground mini silo as depicted in and . The SCRAM machine is contained within the telescopic cylinder in and specifically within area as depicted in . The SUREFIRE Mini Silo is a preferred embodiment because by design its minimal configuration would enjoy the lowest cost of the three example configurations if deployed in volume which would enable affordable widespread deployment. The packaging of all of its major components is tailored especially to a silo configuration a cylindrical shape approximately 3 feet in diameter . The SUREFIRE Mini Silo can be configured to support various levels of performance in the 0.5 TFLOPS to 10 TFLOPS range per silo. It may be optionally co located with an expendable tower such as the LISTEN monopole described in 13.1 and depicted in which see .

As depicted in the mini silo s externally visible footprint is due to the radome top . In a preferred embodiment the radome and sub radome wall have a maximum diameter of approximately 8 to 10 feet and are constructed of a combat composite having the significant properties of radio transparency sufficient strength to withstand both positive and negative high pressures F5 tornados passing waves from nuclear blasts etc. . The radome material of has the same specifications as the radome surface material in which see and is similarly resistant to high velocity ammunition cutting torches etc. The specific radome dimensions including the resultant size and volume of the antenna bay are somewhat antenna dependent. depicts the radome as being at ground level when closed within an earth berm in this example but the radome is attached to the top of telescopic silo assembly and may thus be elevated above ground level by the maintenance lift equipment depicted directly below assembly in for service if required. An internal fuel tank approximately 3 feet in diameter and of arbitrary height is situated directly below the maintenance lift . The fuel capacity of internal tank is somewhat more than 52 gallons per vertical foot. In a preferred embodiment a pressurized nitrogen blanket occupies the void created as the tank is emptied in order to maintain a nearly oxygen free environment for the selected fuel.

A pair of cylindrical steel shells and provide the main fixed in ground assembly which includes an upper donut shaped external fuel tank all of which is set in reinforced concrete. In a preferred embodiment donut shaped fuel tank also labeled as EXT. FUEL 1 is about 18 inches in height 8 feet in diameter with a 3 foot diameter donut hole for the silo apparatus to pass through. If attacked successfully fuel tank will yield at most 500 gallons of fuel. A second external fuel tank also labeled as EXT. FUEL 2 is of arbitrary height 8 feet in diameter with a 3 foot diameter donut hole for the silo apparatus to pass through for the vertical portion of tank that overlaps the 3 foot diameter silo area . External tank has a fuel capacity of at least 325 gallons per vertical foot. As depicted in the portion of EXT. FUEL 2 that extends deeper than the bottom of internal fuel tank if any has no donut hole pass through and thus has an even higher fuel capacity of at least 375 gallons per vertical foot. and depict additional external storage and respectively that may be clustered underground around tank for arbitrarily increased capacity. All of the fuel tanks may be pressured with nitrogen blankets and the same or different fuels may be stored in the different tanks and and or .

The SUREFIRE Single Level Underground Vault depicted in is an alternate embodiment a larger diameter silo that may be affordably produced in fairly low quantities relative to the SUREFIRE Mini Silo and is able to accommodate a higher degree of conventional equipment than the SUREFIRE Mini Silo. The SUREFIRE Single Level Underground Vault is especially well suited to supercomputing accompanied by significant radio communications the silo itself serves as the base for relatively lightweight communications towers such as the expendable LISTEN monopole described in 13.1 and depicted in . The SUREFIRE Single Level Underground Vault can be configured to support various levels of performance in the 0.5 TFLOPS to 10 TFLOPS range per silo.

The simple unmanned underground vault depicted in has a nominal fuel capacity of 2000 gallons of biofuel e.g. B100 but can easily be extended to 20 000 gallons or more the bio oil storage capacity needs to be extended by approximately the same factor say to 300 gallons . The fuel capacity limitation has little to do with storage which can easily be extended further and is mostly tied to the predicted unattended lifetime of the generation equipment which in this case is anticipated to limit the need for fuel to about 20 000 gallons. Assuming an off grid or dead grid situation with no help from external renewable energy sources i.e. no wind and no sun such as could occur in a possible nuclear winter scenario the nominal fuel capacity of 2000 gallons would allow for four months of full power operation and more than 3 years in low power mode supporting communications and relatively little computing. Intermediate power modes of course have other run times.

On reason that this embodiment is an alternate rather than preferred is because the fueled power generation capability is based on a redundant pair of small modified liquid cooled diesel engines and although they are very durable they suffer from the normal wear factors associated with diesel engines.

In a preferred embodiment the fuel is B100 100 biodiesel such as per ASTM D6751 06b January 2007 which has high lubricity and many general other beneficial properties including being less toxic than table salt non polluting biodegradable and safe to handle . Since fuels like diesel and B100 are generally not stored for longer than 6 months special care must be taken to ensure their longevity. In a preferred embodiment the B100 is never exposed to oxygen from the point of its manufacture which includes the addition of a special antioxidant to delivery and storage where the tanks are maintained with a nitrogen blanket . Sufficient nitrogen is on site to maintain the nitrogen blanket as the fuel is expended. If and when the site is replenished with fuel the nitrogen must be replenished as well.

In order to run the diesel engines unattended they are modified to be self oiling from a relatively large reservoir 30 gallons of bio oil for 2000 gallons of stored fuel and proportionately more for large fuel storage capacities . The oil in the engines never needs to be changed because as the lubricating bio oil is pumped through the engines a tiny portion of it is continuously bled off and injected into the fuel feed. The bleed off injection rate is high enough to approximate an aggressive oil change regimen and low enough that the oil injected into the fuel feed causes no combustion issues. Note that the bio oil actually increases the site s fuel capacity somewhat since the oil is combusted along with the fuel. If and when the site is replenished with fuel the bio oil must be replenished as well.

The air filtration system is also modified so that a high level of external air contaminants is assumed for a period of time after which the level return to more normal values and so that the filtration area is sufficient to approximate an aggressive filter change regimen for a period that corresponds to the maximum run time for the given supply of fuel. Depending on the source of external air contaminants and whether they can be detected or predicted the site s control logic can simply opt to not run the generator for a period of time until the air clears the site can drop to a 0.5 TFLOPS rate and run on battery power alone for 24 hours or more . If and when the site is replenished with fuel the air filtration must be replenished as well.

The diesel generators liquid cooling systems are modified to use the biofuel itself as the coolant so no extra storage for coolant is required. The fuel from the main fuel storage is pulled into a local storage loop that is temperature controlled. The two primary heat sources are the site s electronics and the power generation equipment. The cold source is the earth itself which maintains a fairly stable temperature in the 45 F. to 65 F. range in the U.S. depending on latitude at depths below 10 feet or so. Ground loops which in a preferred embodiment may simply be attached to the metal walls of the vault are used to exhaust actual waste heat. However before heat energy is considered as waste it is first used to heat the fuel supply itself to the desired maintenance range. The engine coolant is preferentially circulated first through loops in the fuel tank and among those preferentially near the fuel pump feed point in order to reduce its viscosity and then those on any cold walls of the tank and then any other ground loops. Once coolant is separated from the stored fuel it is never again directly mixed with the stored fuel heating the fuel to 160 F. as engine coolant triggers an eventual degradation of the fuel so it becomes trapped in the soon to be burned coolant fuel supply loop. Since the coolant is burned as fuel it is replenished from storage at a rate equal to its consumption.

The biofuel can also be used as a secondary working fluid to cool the site s electronics via a liquid to liquid heat exchanger one liquid is the electronics working fluid such as C3F7OCH3 and the other side is biofuel which can be directly circulated from the tank . This has the effect of gently adding heat to the fuel storage which is designed to continually lose heat to the earth through the exterior walls.

Another reason that the depicted embodiment is an alternate rather than preferred is because the battery backup capability as may be apparent in the figure is based some combination of several conventional battery technologies most of which suffer from an inability to tolerate a 100 depth of discharge and a potentially restrictive maximum number of charge discharge cycles. In a preferred embodiment the battery backup capability would be based on a large scale zinc bromine battery system which can tolerate 100 depth of discharge indefinitely and thousands of charge discharge cycles. Other viable alternatives include chemistries based on nickel zinc nickel iron lithium iron phosphate lithium ion lithium polymer nickel hydrogen used in satellites or silver zinc.

This type of site although it is unmanned and unattended has the potential for intruders and has extensive identification and authentication controls and other intrusion prevention features. In the event of intrusion the DEFEND system provides internal defenses that include but are not limited to visual and auditory discomfort smoke and non lethal electrification.

In a preferred embodiment of this type of site the power system would be based on PERKS which substitutes heat engines for combustion engines with significantly increased efficiency resulting in lower fuel consumption and longer runtime for a given fuel reserve. Note that to the extent that other power systems are available such as PERKS in addition to diesel engines the priority use of heat both from the electronics and from the diesel engines is to generate power and do peak shaving via the PERKS heat engines which can accept waste heat from numerous sources . In this scenario the only heat put into the fuel storage tank is the minimal heat to be rejected from the heat engines cycles plus any additional heat needed if any to maintain the minimum target fuel storage temperature.

The SUREFIRE Multi Level Underground Vault is an alternate embodiment also in a silo configuration that is likely to require a somewhat substantial level of site engineering and preparation prior to deployment. A typical deployment scenario would be underneath literally a commercial class wind turbine 100 KW or more . While the basic design is straightforward to replicate its site preparation may not be due to the facility depth and likely permitting issues. The SUREFIRE Multi Level Underground Vault can be configured to support various levels of performance in the 2 TFLOPS to 50 TFLOPS range per silo.

Excessive unused or unusable wind turbine power must be diverted to an appropriate load or the wind turbine must be shut down. In a preferred embodiment rather than simply divert unused energy the energy may be captured in thermal cells in the form of heat energy transferred to a suitable thermal medium e.g. water thermal oil etc. for storage. The heat may later be transformed back to electrical energy this may be done by the PERKS subsystem .

As an example assume the maximum energy to divert and capture is 108 KW 480VAC 3 phase which is the maximum output of a particular wind turbine. Normally however the energy would normally be significantly less than 60 KW. Software can control the combination of cells used for any particular storage event.

In this example each cell can present a maximum electrically dissipative load of 11 000 watts 2 elements at 5500 watts each which means it can capture energy at the maximum rate of 11 000 joules second 1 watt 1 joule second . If the two elements in each cell are wired in series one cell can occupy each phase of the load so cells can be used in groups of three we assume this for now .

Assuming the water is initially at 86 F. and can be heated to 200 F. delta T 114 F. At 8.1 pounds per gallon 80 gallons of water weighs 648 pounds. The energy capacity of the cell is thus 648 pounds 114F 73 872 pound degrees F. which is 77 920 186 joules. At a fill rate of 11 000 joules second the maximum capacity can be reached in 7083.6532 seconds or about 1.96 hours. This means that the thermal cell can absorb 11 KW in 1.96 hours which is 21.6 KWH of energy. At 94 storage efficiency said apparatus can recuperate at most 20 KWH of what we store. At 48VDC this corresponds to 424 amp hours AH . Assuming a water source temperature of 200 F. and a sink temperature of 55 F. the theoretical maximum Carnot efficiency is 38 which means our 424 AH dwindles to a maximum of 161AH. With a rectifier efficiency of 93 this further dwindles to 150AH. Thus a set of 3 cells has a capacity of 3 150AH 450AH 48VDC. 12 cells together have a collective capacity of 1800AH which is roughly the same capacity as a 1600AH battery string but for less than 30 of the cost .

The DEFEND system is intended for use with SUREFIRE sites which are unmanned and unattended by design.

In a preferred embodiment in sites where DEFEND is deployed with SUREFIRE the two are highly integrated along with the WARN system in an alternative embodiment DEFEND and or WARN may be add on systems .

In order to mitigate the risks associated with the potential for intruders SUREFIRE sites may have extensive identification and authentication controls and other intrusion prevention features and in a preferred embodiment these may integrate with the DEFEND system potentially triggering various defenses.

In a preferred embodiment the DEFEND subsystem may be integrated with and informed by the WARN system. DEFEND may actively protect the overall system from intruders including through the use of physical mechanisms where appropriate. Note that stored and in process information at a SUREFIRE site can be safe from theft and misuse due to the properties of CHARM as described in section 8 even if the DEFEND system is unable to prevent or deter a particular attack.

In the event of intrusion the DEFEND system may provide internal defenses that include but are not limited to man traps visual auditory and other sensory discomfort smoke and non lethal unless use of lethal force is authorized and appropriate directed energy and or electrification. In a preferred embodiment these and other defenses may be deployed as needed in accordance with applicable security policy.

WARN is an automated threat detection assessment and recommendation system based on multiple sensors and diverse data feeds that advises the DEFEND system and potentially external parties with actionable information as to the nature and severity of threats. WARN works in conjunction with the BELIEF system and LISTEN system and other active sensor systems not discussed here. WARN s responsibilities include the acquisition and generation of actionable information that can be used to dynamically shift critical information processing loads away from threatened or other high risk areas such as those which routinely occur as natural hazards.

Most of the area of the contiguous 48 states is at substantial risk for at least one hazard earthquake volcanic etc. and some areas are at risk for several. The remaining areas are subject to other hazards e.g. winter storms blizzards ice storms hail or drought .

The WARN system incorporates technology to generate actionable information for various threats including tornados and other severe storms which can nicely complement existing lightning and tornado detection means. The WARN system design uses multi sensor fusion in conjunction with Bayesian reasoning to dynamically determine a joint probability distribution for various threats and risks based on all available risk information including data feeds and known cause effect relationships.

The WARN system technology can provide an additional detection means to complement existing tornado detection means. When major Internet peering points are overlayed onto a map of tornado risk areas it may be seen that a number of these peering points lie within high risk areas. With existing practice destruction of a peering point can severely cripple Internet communication for dependent clients. The WARN technology is designed to detect tornado and certain other risks so that the SHADOWS infrastructure can proactively and dynamically adapt to changing conditions such as the risk of loss of a peering point and continue to honor its information processing commitments.

The WARN system enables the SHADOWS infrastructure to proactively take appropriate measures based on perceived and actual threats. As can be seen by similarly overlaying selected major Internet peering points onto a map of lightning risk areas a number of these peering points lie within high risk areas. Although lightning protection systems are widely deployed in practice the realities are that no exposed structure is safe from a direct lightning strike. In addition to accepted lightning protection practices the WARN technology is designed to detect lightning so that the SHADOWS infrastructure can proactively minimize the risk of a direct strike by collapsing external structures during periods of greatest risk getting them out of harm s way.

By using sensors with a long stand off range the Scrutiny LISTEN system part of WARN may enable sites at lower risk to compensate for sites at highest risk without going offline.

Datacenter services must survive earthquakes as well as tornados and other threats. Because earthquake detection technology provides little or no warning of an impending event seismic risk has been an important factor in the design of the SHADOWS infrastructure. For example almost all data storage and retrieval operations which are handled by the CHARM system as described in section 8 occur without the use of spinning hard disk drives or with minimal use especially in high risk areas.

The CHARM system described in section 8 enables the SHADOWS infrastructure to store retrieve and process information without relying on spinning disk drives.

The LISTEN subsystem provides sensory input to the WARN system including visual infrared IR seismic and radio frequency RF data that may be used alone or in conjunction with a Bayesian belief system and historical data to provide early warning detection and tracking of certain threats including in particular severe storms and especially tornados. depicts a preferred embodiment of a LISTEN monopole based configuration with top mounted apparatus for severe storm detection it also provides communications . In a preferred embodiment fixed monopole is a radio transparent composite material with a typical length height of approximately 60 feet with an attached Lindenblad antenna array a multiplicity of HAWT type depicted or VAWT type not shown small wind turbines on masts along with various communications antennas . The monopole and the equipment array attached atop it are relatively expendable compared to that contained in the underground SUREFIRE vault see for details to which it typically attaches. A non expendable survivable telescopic mast and equipment apparatus are depicted in and which see to avoid destruction e.g. by tornado hurricane seismic events etc. the mast and attached equipment retract into a protected configuration that is either underground or mobile . Visual and IR input may be provided by any combination of integrated video and or IR camera sensing circuitry and or commercial camera apparatus not depicted in . Seismic input may be provided primarily by accelerometers and inertial navigation system INS components embedded in the SLAM subsystem described in section 10.1 as well as by commercial seismic detection apparatus.

The primary focus of this section is to describe the design of two types of specialized antenna systems Moxon Rectangle and Lindenblad capable of collecting RF data that may be optimally used in the detection and tracking of severe storms especially tornados. In a preferred embodiment in order to maximize the accuracy and precision for storm detection purposes said antenna systems need to operate in the frequency range of 30 to 60 MHz and preferentially in the range 49 to 59 MHz and most preferentially at the target storm signal frequencies of 49 MHz 52.25 MHz and 59 MHz and in the case of a single frequency only constraint at 52.25 MHz. As described here these antenna systems are designed to have a stand off range in excess of 30 miles so in addition to improving the survivability of potentially threatened SHADOWS sites there is potential to provide life saving early warning e.g. of actual tornados and or lightning for nearby communities especially those within stand off range but also any that may lie within an oncoming storm track .

Several direction finding DF options are relevant to radio frequency RF based storm detection and tracking as need by LISTEN each with advantages and disadvantages.

In a preferred embodiment the DF function of LISTEN is to provide bearings to desired target storm signals on 49 55.25 and 59.75 MHz. There are two basic network systems for arriving at a reliable bearing to and position of a target signal. shows both options.

Both scenarios presume that the readings from each DF antenna are processed within an interconnected network for correlation. On the left the system uses mono directional bearings from each DF antenna to arrive at a position of the target. On the right the DF antennas are presumed to present a 180 ambiguity of bearing readings. However correlation by the network center yields one and only one possible target position. Under coordinated computer control both systems can work equally well. The only limitation of the ambiguous system is when only one DF antenna provides a bearing. In this case a mono directional bearing provides at least directional information although not a position.

Commercially developed RF based DF systems are widely available although the number of candidates may decrease as various makers specialize in systems for certain frequency ranges. HF systems for frequencies up to 30 MHz and capable of handling skip as well as line of sight signals have been common for decades. More recently a number of techniques have appeared for the VHF and UHF range from about 88 MHz upward. The frequency range relevant to LISTEN falls into the somewhat neglected zone on DF concerns.

Commercial makers of DF systems have also focused on military and home security issues involved in DF work. Hence there appear to be many more hand held and vehicular systems than systems designed for permanent installation. An additional factor involved in the main focus of commercial systems is a very high cost per unit. Therefore one required decision is whether to purchase a vendor offering as is or modified for the project or whether to fabricate the system in house.

Most commercial systems use vertical polarization in order to arrive at a sharp null or clear phase difference detection. One of the systems sketched in the following notes uses horizontal polarization for line of sight signals. Which polarization is most apt to the nature of the target signals requires a review of existing signal records prior to a final decision. Because polarization may vary the decision may have to rest of a predominance of polarization rather than a uniform pattern.

Of the available systems three appear to be most nearly suited to LISTEN. One is the use of the Moxon rectangle to obtain an unambiguous bearing to the target. A second is the use of Doppler techniques for an equally unambiguous bearing to the target. A third is the Adcock system which provides a 180 bearing ambiguity but which can be enhanced with a sensing antenna to remove the ambiguity.

The Moxon rectangle requires the use of the side nulls to obtain a clear bearing to the target signal. In some operating environments the rear lobes to not have a sufficient null 180 from the forward lobe to provide reliable detection. However the side lobes are always from 100 to 120 from the main forward direction. This fact allows reliable determination of the forward and rearward direction. A simple process of splitting the difference between these nulls from a rotating antenna with forward and rearward detection provides a reliable bearing to the target signal.

By design and in practice the Moxon rectangle is oriented and operated vertically in which case the rearward null may be deep and unambiguous. However this mode of operation is neither discussed nor considered here.

1. The antenna can be locally fabricated to precise dimensions for each detection frequency. Its 50 ohm feedpoint impedance allows direct connection to standard cables or receiver input terminals.

2. The antenna size is about 70 75 of a comparable Yagi so that the antenna can fit within pods planned for the installation.

3. When oriented horizontally it is responsive to horizontally polarized signals or elliptically polarized signals with a significant horizontal component.

4. When oriented horizontally antennas above and below the Moxon tend not to affect the position of the side lobes allowing considerable confidence in the bearings derived from splitting the direction between them.

5. The antenna requires fabrication for specific frequencies used in DF service to ensure that the side lobes are deep enough for reliable bearing determination.

7. Since the Moxon rectangle has not previously been used horizontally for DF service there is little applicable field experience and no commercial product support including software .

Doppler systems can be as simple or complex has one desires with as few as four antennas as shown in and as many as sixteen. The greater the number of antennas the greater the system s ability to read out bearings to high accuracy. However off the shelf systems tend to have prices that climb exponentially as the number of antennas increases arithmetically. Behind the cost increase are increases in the receiving equipment complexity and the amount of software needed to arrive at a bearing. Doppler systems provide unambiguous readings.

For simplicity of presentation the sketch in depicts only four antennas. Typically Doppler systems use monopoles rather than dipoles spaced less than a quarter wavelength apart. Larger spacing allows for certain discrepancies to creep into the detection of the phase differences among the antenna. As well the systems typically use monopoles with a common sheet or screen that forms the ground plane for each antenna and for the system. The function of the common ground plane is also to reduce the effects of objects below the antennas that might interfere with accurate detection. As a consequence many Doppler systems are specifically designed for service on top of vehicles.

The principles of Doppler system operation appear in . To simplify graphics the target signal source is aligned with two of the antennas. The graph of phase relationships is not precise but provides only a general idea of what a Doppler systems detects from each of its four antennas.

Doppler systems typically use one of two systems for detection. The least expensive is a timed sample from each antenna to determine the phase relationship among the received signals.

More complex systems may use independent receiving channels with a common local oscillator chain to preserve all phase relationships. Exact electronics tend to be proprietary minimizing the available information. Nevertheless effective Doppler DF systems with limited 10 accuracy have been constructed by amateur radio operators.

1. Doppler systems are vertically polarized and may be ineffective for target signals that are mainly horizontally polarized thus Doppler systems may complement horizontally oriented Moxon systems .

2. Doppler systems do not require exact antenna tuning and so are usable over a considerable span of frequencies. The LISTEN requirements would easily fit within the normal range of a Doppler system designed for the center of the range.

3. Doppler antennas have a relatively small X Y footprint extending somewhat over a quarter wave on a side. However the antennas require vertical space amounting to another quarter wave and so would not fit within the relatively flat pod radome contemplated in a preferred embodiment of LISTEN.

4. Doppler antenna systems do not require rotation simplifying the mechanical requires at the tower structures.

5. Doppler antennas may be sensitive to conductive structures above the antennas although they are relatively immune to disturbances from conductive structures below the antennas.

6. Doppler accuracy and the complexity of the antenna receiving and computational systems may be directly related.

The second oldest direction finding system extant uses Adcock antennas first patented in 1919 only the use of small loops is older . The system was first developed for use in the HF range with skip signals although it has also proven effective with ground wave or line of sight signals. Today there are Adcock systems in service for a wide variety of frequencies primarily within the government and military.

In the pattern to the right shows the Adcock antenna at its center. However the actual antenna would be at right angles to the azimuth pattern shown. Hence without the graphical distortion to the antenna position it would not show up at all . The antenna dimensions are not critical but the elements should be considerably less than half wavelength apart to avoid the development of additional nulls.

With or without a sensing antenna as a third element the impedance of the Adcock antenna array is very low. Hence it requires impedance transformation to raise to the normal equipment levels. This process normally incurs significant signal strength loss that the equipment must restore within its amplification chain. Commercial systems using Adcock principles are available.

1. Like Doppler systems the Adcock system is vertically polarized with low sensitivity to line of sight horizontally polarized signals.

2. The antenna system requires continuous rotation during DF service with or without the addition of a sensing antenna.

3. The antenna elements form a small package that may easily fit within small RF transparent pods for weather protection.

4. The relative sensitivity of the Adcock antennas to nearby conductive materials in any direction is unknown. This factor might affect the placement of such a system on the LISTEN tower assemblies.

5. The Adcock antennas exhibit a very low feedpoint impedance and thus require intervening impedance transformation components prior to equipment entry.

6. It is likely that the Adcock system requires specialized receiving equipment with or without a sensing antenna element in order to maintain calibration. Hence such a system may require purchase from a vendor with possibly prohibitive pricing. However such purchases may reduce the amount of software development necessary for an Adcock based antenna configuration.

These are only representative of the candidate antennas the first decisive factor should be the most likely polarization of the target signals for DF work and then a best compromise matrix related to goals and constraints.

This section provides background on and designs for three Moxon rectangle antennas to be used in a preferred embodiment at 49 52.25 and 59 MHz in a directional detection system that is particularly suited for the detection and tracking of tornados and electrical storms. The designs include electrical dimensions for lightweight 0.375 diameter aluminum elements and preliminary physical construction suggestions for antennas that can be enclosed and rotated within relatively flat e.g. saucer or Frisbee shaped horizontally oriented protective radomes and pole or tower mounted with relatively low wind loading such as that of the PODIUM masthead depicted in .

The Moxon rectangle was originally conceived and designed as a vertically oriented two element directional parasitic beam that employs two forms of element coupling. Like a Yagi Uda array elements couple inductively via near fields surrounding parallel elements. In addition The Moxon rectangle folds its elements toward each other resulting in additional capacitive coupling between element tips. The resulting array creates a compact two element structure that achieves a very high front to back ratio typically associated only with three element and larger Yagi Uda arrays.

Although the Yagi exhibits about 1.5 dB higher forward gain than the Moxon both rear patterns show similarities. The patterns in are free space E plane and H plane radiation patterns that correspond to the azimuth patterns of both antennas when used horizontally and vertically respectively. The patterns are not to scale since each pattern is normalized to place maximum forward gain at the outermost plot ring.

In both cases the H plane or vertical pattern shows the deepest single null for unambiguous detection of direction. Both antennas in the horizontal plane show small rearward lobes. The E plane pattern of the Moxon is nearly cardioidal in this plane resulting in smaller narrower rear lobes.

Using either type of antenna for null based direction finding requires attention to the rear lobe structure. shows the critical bearings within the horizontal Moxon pattern. The pattern shown is for a Moxon rectangle 30 feet above average ground the intended use height for the antenna in a preferred embodiment.

Bearing A is the direction of maximum forward gain. This bearing is not generally suited for direction finding since the lobe is very broad. Consequently the signal strength would vary almost undetectably over a fairly wide angular span. Bearings B and B are side nulls. In the Moxon pattern these bearing occur about 110 from the main forward lobe bearing in contrast to a value of 90 applicable to virtually all Yagi designs. With respect to null based direction finding the side nulls require the system to note and ignore them since they would produce a false target bearing.

Bearing C occurs 180 from the bearing of the highest forward gain. The rearward pattern and this bearing require close attention. First the coincidence of bearing C with the highest front to back ratio occurs only in properly designed Moxon rectangles and Yagi arrays . Second placing an array above ground at a height below about 5 wavelengths reduces the ultimate depth of the rearward null relative to its free space or theoretical value. In the present case the 180 front to back ratio is close to 30 dB which is about 6 dB weaker than the rearward lobes at maximum strength. As a consequence using a null based antenna in a direction finding system requires careful design of null detection both to avoid falsing on a side null and to find the true bearing of the target at the center null between the rear lobes.

Dimension A is the total side to side width of the array and applies to both the driver and the reflector. Dimension B is the driver fold back or tail . The corresponding reflector tail is shown as dimension D. Between the element tips is a gap dimension C. Of all dimensions associated with the Moxon rectangle the gap is the most critical one. Physical antennas using a Moxon rectangle design should set the gap within about 0.125 of the design value. The other dimensions are somewhat less critical. Dimension E shows the sum of B C and D to indicate the maximum front to rear width of the antenna.

For uniformity of performance including the feedpoint impedance and the frequency of maximum front to back ratio the project requires separate designs for each specified frequency. Table 24 provides the relevant dimensions in inches feet and meters see for dimension designations . Each section of the table also lists the total length of both the driver and the reflector elements. The feedpoint gap is a part of the driver element. Hence each half of the driver must be one half the total element length minus a small amount needed to establish a non conductive gap between driver halves. The dimensions are derived from a computer design model and program developed some years back using regression analysis on a large number of optimized test cases. Each set of dimensions has been tested in a NEC 4 model and these models are available in either .NEC or .EZ format.

The answer to the question of why the project needs 3 different antennas one for each frequency appears in part in . When the 52.25 MHz design is modeled at both 49 and 59 MHz the other specified storm signal frequencies the rearward portions of the pattern do not have the characteristics necessary for a null based direction finding system. The operating passband for the system is about 18.5 a figure that exceeds the impedance passband of virtually all directive antennas. The actual operating bandwidth for obtaining a satisfactory rearward null in the pattern is normally very narrow perhaps 100 kHz and often less. This limitation applies to both horizontally and vertically oriented antennas . Hence precise construction is required to obtain the desired performance.

At a height of 30 feet about 1.5 wavelengths at the specified frequencies the antenna shows an elevation angle of maximum radiation also called the take off or TO angle of 9 which is particularly suited to long range storm detection. For reference shows the elevation and the azimuth patterns of the antenna where the azimuth pattern is at the TO angle. Should there be any question about the detected signal occurring at a high elevation angle relative to the antenna and its elevation lobes higher angle azimuth patterns may be easily explored. The performance of the antenna at the 30 foot level is adequate for many purposes. The maximum forward gain is 11.7 dBi with a maximum 180 front to back ratio of between 29 and 30 dB. The feedpoint impedance is calculated to be about 53 ohms.

The Moxon rectangle is straightforward in terms of construction. In a preferred embodiment the antenna can be constructed with non conductive support materials and single lengths of 0.375 inch diameter 6063 T832 aluminum tubing for each half element. Since the reflector is a continuous or unsplit element the element halves require a conductive junction. A short 2 inch to 4 inch section of 0.25 inch diameter rod easily joins the half elements.

The element fold backs to create the tails require careful fabrication although a plumber s copper tubing bender is usable. The radius should be large enough to avoid tubing fractures which are more common with the specified material than with softer materials. A radius bend may distort the dimensions slightly relative to the modeled dimensions which presume sharp right angles. In a preferred embodiment as shown in the distortion may be absorbed into dimension A since a very slight lengthening of that dimensions tends to simply reduce the feedpoint impedance by a few Ohms. The element ends may be fixed at the specified separation by inserting a non conductive rod into each tip and using standard fasteners to secure the mechanical connection.

Each end of the boom should have a plate about 0.125 inches thick if the material is as sturdy as polycarbonate to support and align the elements. A round boom may require mechanical fasteners for the plate connection but a square boom may allow epoxy to join the boom and plate. Element alignment fasteners should appear near the outer ends of each plate. Driver alignment may be assured despite the gap between halves by inserting a non conductive rod into the inner ends of each half element. The support plates should be long enough to prevent significant element sag along the unsupported part or their overall length. specifies a bottom view meaning that the plates and the element are beneath the boom. This mode of construction generally simplifies aligning the elements in a level plane.

The driver requires a pair of connections between the element halves and the two parts inner conductor and outer braid of the coaxial cable. shows the use of fasteners although direct conductive bonding may be possible. The connections require two cautions. First any fasteners used must not be large enough in diameter to sever the non conductive alignment rod at the driver center. Second the copper wires of the cable require separation from the aluminum by a stainless steel washer or other device to prevent electrolysis which might corrode one or both metals and degrade the electrical continuity at the operating frequencies.

Since the elements extend only 43 inches maximum at 49 MHz from the boom the 0.375 inch diameter tubing should be self supporting especially in the absence of wind loads within the protection of the pod radome . If the elements create a small droop it can in no way harm the electrical performance of the antenna. At 0.375 inch in diameter 6063 T832 aluminum tube weighs about 0.044 pounds per linear foot. Therefore the weight of each half element may be less than eight ounces. Total antenna weight may be about two pounds plus the weight of the boom plate hub assembly. The designs presented in this section are electrically sound within the limits of normal antenna operation. The construction steps are subject to considerable variation depending on the exact materials chosen for the antenna support and rotation system.

This section reviews a series of if then propositions related to the use of Moxon rectangles as the main antenna arrays for null based direction finding using the target frequencies. Included are minimum vertical and horizontal stacking distances required for use of the 180 rear null as the main null detector as well as vertical stacking distances that are usable if the bearing is determined by the centered direction between the symmetrically placed deep side nulls.

The technique for determining the required stacking distances involves placing 3 Moxon rectangles within a single NEC 4 model. Each antenna is activated on its own frequency with the others passive. The resulting radiation pattern represents the direct action of the activated antenna plus the interactions from the nearby presence of the inactive antennas. The result is an accurate portrayal of the transmitting and the receiving pattern of the active antenna at its assigned frequency. The desired target storm signals determine the frequencies used for the antennas which for the preferred embodiment are 49.0 55.25 and 59.75 MHz.

The following designs rest on the premise that the 180 null relative to the main forward beam bearing is the primary null detection mode for determining the heading to the desired signal.

The median value for a wavelength within the project passband 49 60 MHz is about 20 feet which may be used as a reasonable approximation of wavelength. The maximum practical height for a vertical stack of Moxon rectangles is about 70 feet. If the lowest frequency antenna is placed at 30 feet above ground then the higher frequency antennas may be stacked at a maximum of one wavelength intervals above the first antenna. The resulting array has the general appearance shown in .

The antennas for the upper two frequencies are adversely affected by the presence of the other antennas in the stack. The elevation patterns give only a small clue to the pattern distortion. The elevation angle of the main or strongest lobe is shifted upward. However the lowest lobe has normal forward gain. As the azimuth plots show clearly the influence of the arrays for other frequencies is sufficient to distort the rear lobe structure so that no null region appears at 180 opposite the main forward bearing.

Despite the absence of null region 180 opposite the main forward bearing the sidelobes remain very deep at more than 30 dB below the forward heading.

If the 180 bearing from the main forward bearing requires a null region in order to accomplish the direction finding task vertical stacking may be impractical. For the passband of interest 49 60 MHz with a median wavelength of about 20 feet stacking distances of greater than one wavelength per array result in overall array heights that may be extremely high. The added height may present very significant structural challenges.

Horizontal separation between the individual Moxon rectangles may be more convenient since each array might have its own support tower along with an omnidirectional basic detection antenna . In an alternative embodiment the arrays may be separated without limit until the individual antennas cease to have azimuth patterns whose main lobes vary from the anticipated direction. shows the resulting array layout using a linear set up.

For minimal pattern distortion the required separation is about 10 wavelengths or about 200 feet between each antenna. Hence the total line of antennas requires 400 feet. depicts the antennas pointed at right angles to the line of arrays. Sampled patterns at both this orientation and with the antennas pointed along the line of arrays yield the results in .

As can be seen in for angles tangential to the line of arrays the patterns are normal at each project frequency. The strongest elevation lobe is always the lowest lobe which falls between 8 and 9 for the 30 foot uniform antenna height. Also forward gain is uniform falling between 11.6 and 11.7 dBi. The middle row of azimuth patterns shows completely normal characteristics with all main headings properly directed and all rearward lobe structures having a 180 null region. When the antennas are pointed along the line of arrays pattern distortions emerge due to the proximity of the frequencies used. In this sample the 59.75 MHz beam is in the lead position and points away from the others so its pattern is completely normal. The absence of influences results from the very high front to back ratio of a Moxon rectangle. The remaining two antennas have either one or two antennas ahead of them. Hence their patterns show distortions. For many communication purposes the distortions would not be fatal. However for null based direction finding the distortions to the rear lobes make the antennas unreliable in this alignment even with a spacing of 10 wavelengths between antennas.

It is possible to detect the Moxon rectangle side nulls and to take a bearing between the nulls. provides a typical Moxon rectangle azimuth pattern with the antenna 30 feet above average ground. The left portion of the pattern may be examined in two stages beginning with the general shaping of the small rear lobes.

The rear lobes show a null region C at 180 from the main forward bearing A . This null is about 5 dB relative to the maximum strength of the two quartering rear lobes. However the depth of this lobe may vary according to the quality of the ground beneath the antenna the height above ground and the presence of other antennas or conductive structures in the vicinity of the antenna. The range of variation in the null depth runs from 0 dB to perhaps 15 dB depending on the conditions which are not always fully predictable in advance.

More reliable are the two side nulls in the Moxon rectangle pattern B and B . Their depth is virtually always 7 dB or more relative to the quartering rear lobes and 30 dB down from the main forward lobe strength. These side nulls also have the advantage of always occurring more than 90 from the main forward heading. As a consequence one can always unambiguously determine the forward from the rearward direction. The lobes appear between 100 and 120 away from the main forward heading. Under these conditions the direction of the desired signal is always the center value between the side nulls. One may determine this direction by a simple detection of one null and then finding the other using either the forward lobe or the rearward lobes as a reference.

The use of the side nulls for direction finding allows a simpler antenna arrangement a vertical stack. The patterns in show distortions to the rearward lobes that prevents the use of the 180 null in direction finding. However in all cases the side nulls remain intact and are highly usable with suitable apparatus for side null direction finding.

As shown in even a smaller separation between the antennas in the vertical stack produces usable side nulls. The most shallow null appears in the pattern for the 49 MHz antenna and its is about 29 dB below the main forward lobe. The use of closer intervals between the antennas in the vertical stack reduces the mast length by half

Given apparatus for side null direction finding the task of obtaining a target bearing may be divided into two steps. The two steps presume that the fine gradations of the rotation device make rotation a relative slow process. The first step in the bearing process would be to rotate the antenna through a maximum signal strength reading which would be very broad in angular displacement and continue rotation until the detection of the first null. Since side nulls occur between 100 and 120 relative to the main forward bearing one might use this reading and assume an angle of 110 . The result provides a preliminary heading for detection equipment until the rotation is complete with the detection of the second side null. At this point one may calculate a much more precise target heading and replace the preliminary reading. The initial reading may be accurate to perhaps 5 while the second may be accurate to about 1 .

Stacking considerations applicable to the Moxon rectangle and most other directional arrays are several as used in null based direction finding. Rearward null techniques require a very widely spaced horizontal arrangement with potential ambiguities within the relatively shallow 180 null. Side null techniques allow a single vertical stack of antennas with only moderate separation requirements.

This section provides background information on the basic properties of the Lindenblad dipole array for omnidirectional service. It should contain enough information to allow an evaluation on whether the antenna is suitable for switching into a Doppler method direction finding dipole array.

The Lindenblad omnidirectional circularly polarized dipole array consists of four dipoles each of which is tilted at 45 to the horizontal as one faces the array. For the LISTEN frequencies each dipole is 106.95 inches and consists of 0.375 inch diameter aluminum tubing these dimensions may be adjusted for any desired element diameter . shows the general outlines of a practical Lindenblad array.

In a preferred embodiment each dipole is a quarter wavelength from the center of the array a relatively critical spacing relative to the angle of each dipole. The resonant impedance of each dipole in this configuration is close to 105 ohms. The array feeds each dipole in phase with each other dipole. Therefore the array requires four lines that are electrically one half wavelength. RG 62 coaxial cable is satisfactory for this purpose. With a velocity factor of 0.84 an electrical half wavelength is about 91.8 inches long. The use of half wavelength lines ensures that the dipole feedpoint impedance can replicate at the junction of the lines and the 93 ohm characteristic impedance of the line ensures broadband operation. The net impedance of the four lines in parallel connection at the junction is about 26 ohms. A 35 ohm section of line that is electrically about 80 inches long with a passband center frequency of 54 MHz can provide a broadband match for a main 50 ohm feedline. It is not necessary to specify a particular physical length for the line since there are several different ways to create a 35 ohm line ranging from the use of RF 83 cable to paralleling lengths of RG 59 RG 6 and other cables in the 70 ohm to 75 ohm range.

The Lindenblad design arose in the early 1940s in the search for an antenna that would serve television transmission needs atop the Empire State Building in New York City N.Y. USA . Receivers used a variety of antennas in a mix of linear polarizations both vertical and horizontal. The solution would have to radiate a circularly polarized signal in the X Y plane that is parallel to the ground. N. E. Lindenblad developed a solution but World War II delayed its development.

In its original configuration the free space elevation or theta patterns for the Lindenblad array are quite symmetrical. The slight variation in the patterns facing a dipole and the patterns at 45 to any dipole reflects the requirement for optimizing the tilt angle. In these patterns the tilt angle is constant at 45 . The phi or azimuth pattern shows a slight squaring comparable to the pattern of an ordinary turnstile pair of dipoles. Because much of the Lindenblad radiation occurs at relatively low elevation angles the array produces good gain. Table 27 shows the gain of the array at various heights above ground as measured in wavelengths . Within the LISTEN passband a wavelength is about 20 feet. The suggested project antenna height of about 30 feet is therefore about 1.5 wavelengths above ground.

A Lindenblad array may be constructed for either left hand or right hand polarization simply by reversing the angle of each dipole as shown in . However with regard to an intended use of a preferred embodiment for storm detection and tracking no information is presently available that would give one mode of circular polarization priority over the other.

Regardless of the direction of circularity the Lindenblad s patterns are essentially elliptical with an axial ratio of between 0.45 and 0.55. Although this value is not true circularity the antenna responds almost equally to sources that are vertically polarized or horizontally polarized. shows the relative strengths of the left hand and the right hand components of the pattern. The dominant mode of circular polarization is at least 10 dB stronger than the opposing mode. The pattern also shows the previously noted slight squaring although the maximum differential is about 1 dB between maximum and minimum gain.

The selection of frequencies for the patterns is arbitrary so long as it falls within a project passband of say between 49 and 59 MHz . The ratio of left to right handed polarization is almost constant over the entire passband. Additionally the patterns show that the Lindenblad radiates little or no energy upward at very high elevation angles. Hence the antenna is suitable for placement below other antennas with similar frequency ranges. However the antenna is also suited to independent use.

The Lindenblad is not only broadband in its omnidirectional characteristics but it is also broadband in its feedpoint impedance with the application of proper matching techniques. shows the 50 ohm SWR curve of the array shown in . As the curve shows the antenna has considerable reserve capability beyond the frequency limits explored here.

The Lindenblad array as an omnidirectional antenna is capable of handling signals of any polarization for basic signal detection. Since the polarization of these signals is not fully established an antenna that responds equally to vertical and horizontal linear polarizations seems appropriate to the application. In one embodiment the Lindenblad may rest below direction finding antennas at a higher physical level. However the basic structure of the Lindenblad resembles the array of monopoles often used in Doppler mode direction finding. In a preferred embodiment in conjunction with existing Doppler mode DF the Lindenblad may be switched into this mode of operation. In a preferred embodiment the switching point is at the junction of the 4 RG 62 cables. If the quarter wavelength array radius one half wavelength between facing dipoles is sufficient for the intended application the Lindenblad can serve both roles initial signal detection and Doppler mode determination of its bearing. The savings in both cost and physical complexity are relatively obvious.

13.1.5 Lindenblad Omni Directional Elliptically Polarized Dipole Arrays With Full Length Shortened Capped Elements

Refer to . Relative Proportions of Lindenblad Arrays with Decreasing Element Length and the Addition of T Type End Caps

Refer to . SWR Curves of Full Length 75 Length and 50 Length Lindenblad Arrays Relative to Their Self Resonant Element Impedance

This section provides follow up information to section 13.1.4 which teaches an unadorned Lindenblad array. The modeling test described here evaluates the feasibility of shortening the dipole elements and using end caps to re establish self resonance leading to a preferred embodiment that retains the full length dipoles thus rejecting the use of capped elements .

To evaluate the feasibility of shortening Lindenblad elements by using end hats or caps the original model of the Lindenblad in section 13.1.4 was reconstructed. Although end hats or caps may consist of any symmetrical structure at the element ends so long as it is at right angles to the element T structures were selected for simplicity. The model remained at 20 feet above average ground as in the earlier report however performance would not change significantly between heights of 20 feet and 40 feet or more. For initial evaluation purposes the original model s full length elements 75 length elements and 50 length elements were used as test cases. As depicted in the modifications result in very different array appearances. The view shown is from the top or bottom . Therefore the dipoles themselves are foreshortened by their 45 angle relative to the ground. However the T caps are shown full size. Note that the array radius cannot change without a total redesign of the array and a reduction in performance.

Modeling the additional structures is not a small process. Even for a relatively simple model it requires the addition of two wires to each end of each dipole. In addition various trials are necessary to establish the proper length of the T caps in order to approximate self resonance at the design frequency of 54 MHz. Tables 28A and 28B compare the wire structures of the models for full length elements and for 50 length elements as a sample of the required additions. For this initial feasibility test T cap wire lengths were adjusted in one inch intervals so self resonance is only approximated.

Note the difference in complexity between the two models represented by Tables 28A and 28B. Table 28A requires only 4 rows one per dipole and constant 21 inch segments. Table 28B is significantly more complex requiring 20 rows 5 as many with both 17 inch and 5 inch segments.

The increment by which the required end hat grows increases at a faster rate than the reduction in dipole length. Unless operating bandwidth is not a significant performance parameter dipole lengths below 70 to 75 of full size are not recommended. T caps are the longest structures required for end hats. If the number of spokes is increased the length of each spoke decreases up to a limit of about 60 spokes. At this level the hat performs almost identically to a solid disk with a radius of about one third the length of each T spoke. For spoke type end hats the use of a perimeter wire connecting the outer ends of the spokes can also reduce the required spoke length.

The use of end hats is the most efficient method of shortening element lengths that is it yields the closest approximation of full size performance. However shorter elements can always produce lower self resonant impedance values and a narrower operating bandwidth. At the design frequency the optionally advantageous Lindenblad pattern does not change. shows a reference pattern which holds for all three models. The relative squareness of the total far field pattern does not significantly change at the design frequency and the maximum to minimum gain is steady at about 1 dB. However there are differences relative to the passband end frequencies. The ratio of right hand to left hand circular polarization remains at a constant 8 dB.

Table 30 summarizes the performance of the full length and 75 length models at 49 54 and 60 MHz in order to sample properly the performance change over the anticipated operating passband.

The average gain for the full azimuth sweep does not change significantly with the length of the dipoles. However as the dipoles are shortened at the passband edges the differential between maximum and minimum gain increases. Since the relative circularity of the polarization does not change much these values may be quite acceptable.

The most notable feature of the shortened and capped dipoles is the narrowing SWR passband. shows the SWR curves for each version of the Lindenblad. The curves use the self resonant impedance of each dipole as a reference the curves use no matching components. The curves are a measure of the shrinking operating bandwidth that accompanies dipole length reduction.

Although the curve for the 75 length version of the array appears to be usable it suffers a second problem besides the SWR at the band edges. The full length dipoles produce a parallel connection impedance of about 26 ohms at the design frequency 54 MHz . This impedance is relatively easily matched across the entire passband to a 50 ohm main feedline. The 75 length dipoles produce a parallel connection impedance of about 23 ohms while the comparable impedance for the 50 length version is about 14 ohms. The lower the parallel connection impedance the more difficult it is to achieve an adequate wide band match to 50 ohms except by complex network means.

The hatted shortened dipole arrays suffer a second disadvantage relative to the full length version of the array. For all forms of end hatting from simple tees to solid surface disks the end structures add wind stresses to the dipoles that are larger than the wind stresses from additional dipole length. Hatted dipoles resist the wind from two directions rather than from one or more precisely from four directions rather than two although the dipole tilt makes the final wind calculations even more complex . Hence the end structures reduce the durability of the element. In winter hats may also increase ice loading over and above the level seen on linear elements.

In an alternate embodiment using hatted versions of the Lindenblad array may be advantageous. However since the dipole length does not alter the array radius does not increase performance and adds both matching and structural complexities a preferred embodiment may use simple full length dipoles.
