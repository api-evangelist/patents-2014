This patent application is a continuation in part of and claims priority in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 843 029 entitled Vehicle Control and Gateway Module filed on Mar. 15 2013 which is in turn a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 046 549 entitled Air Seeder Monitoring and Equalization System Using Acoustic Sensors. The entire disclosures of the above noted patent applications are incorporated by reference in its entirety herein.

The present invention relates generally to a material flow monitoring and equalization system and more particularly to a system for measuring and balancing the flow of seeds and or other material through an air seeding system using acoustic sensors and adjustable flow restrictors. This invention also relates generally to certain new and useful improvements in vehicle control and more particularly to a control system allowing wireless access to and control of a vehicle s subsystems.

The general principle of an air seeding system is to dispense seeds and or other particulate matter fertilizers herbicides etc. from a hopper or other container into a moving flow of air where the moving air will carry it through a series of branching tubes to a point where it will ultimately be deposited into the soil. The particulate matter is typically metered in a controlled fashion as it is dispensed from the hopper allowing the total rate of material distributed to be controlled. However once the material leaves the hopper it is difficult to determine precisely which portion takes which specific path through the branching network of tubes to eventually make its way to the end of the seed tubes and be placed into the soil. An air seeding system represents a complex fluid dynamics problem in which a single initial flow of air and suspended particulate material may be continuously divided and redirected through multiple tubes to manifold towers where it is then split off into branching seed tubes of varying lengths to a point of eventual discharge into the soil. Sharp turns bends and forks in the distribution tubes cause restrictions on the material flow and make balancing the system for even seed and particulate dispersal problematic. A modern air seeder may plant well over 100 rows of seeds simultaneously. If a partial or full blockage develops in one or more of the particulate flow tubes air flow and therefore particulate flow increases proportionately in the remaining tubes further complicating the balancing problem. To optimize the distribution of material and maintain an even balance of distribution an air seeding system must employ some type of particulate flow monitoring system which measures the amount of particulate material flowing in the distribution tubes the particulate flow path a means by which the flow may be adjusted so that an operator can balance the system prior to field use and a means to detect particulate flow disruption or blockage during use should field conditions cause the system to become unbalanced.

It should be noted that the term blockage will be used generally throughout the specification to refer to either a full and a partial blockage in some part of the air seeding system. A partial blockage will still allow some amount of air and material to flow past it but will reduce the flow noticeably. A full blockage will not allow any material to flow past it although it may be possible for a small amount of air to leak past a full blockage .

Seed monitoring systems do exist in prior art. One type of seed monitoring system uses optical sensors which detect changes in the amount of light being received from a light source as seeds and other particles pass between the light source and a sensor blocking light that would otherwise impinge on the sensor. The attenuation of the light received is related to the amount of material passing through the beam. These optical sensors are subject to a number of problems particular to the technology. One such problem is caused by the non uniformity of the intensity of the light beam used to sense the particles moving in the tube. If the beam intensity is not uniform and two different but identically shaped and sized particles move through different parts of the light beam they will produce different results to the receptor even though they are identical particles. Hence the amount of material passing in the tube is not directly correlated to the amount of light that reaches the optical sensor which can result in an incorrect determination of the actual amount of material passing in the tube. In addition the optical sensors may not be able to detect at all certain material that is moving through locations in the seed tubes that are not covered by the beam. Attempts to create more uniform or more complete light beams to correct these problems have been inadequate or overly complex. As a result although in optimal conditions optical sensing systems may work well in detecting total tube blockage they are not very effective in measuring overall material flow particularly in situations where a great deal of material is flowing in the tubes.

Optical based seed monitoring systems are also susceptible to problems in normal use caused by a build up of dust and other foreign matter that can be found inside an air seeder. Often this build up is gradual causing the sensor to lose calibration over time becoming less capable of accurately detecting material flow. This build up can ultimately block sensors and or light sources completely causing the system to determine that a large amount of material is moving through the seed tube or that a blockage has occurred.

Another source of inaccurate readings in an optical seed monitoring system is that when two or more particles happen to line up in such a manner that an imaginary line drawn between them is parallel to the axis of the beam of light from the transmitter to the receiver one particle can occlude another causing them to be read as a single particle instead of multiple particles. In other words one or more particles can hide in the shadow of another particle as they pass through the beam and not have an effect on the quantity of the light reaching the sensor adversely affecting the ability of the sensor to accurately measure material flow. Further compounding this problem is that not all particles are uniformly shaped i.e. spherical . An example of one such particle is a wheat seed which is more or less cylindrical in shape. Such a particle will occlude the beam of light to a greater or lesser extent depending upon the orientation of the seed as it passes through the light beam. As a result it is generally not possible to tell with a reasonable degree of accuracy the amount of material moving past an optical sensor in an air seeder.

Another type of material flow monitoring system uses a piezoelectric sensor that is placed into a seed tube such that the moving particles strike the face of the sensor. When a particle strikes the piezoelectric sensor the sensor is momentarily deformed causing the sensor to generate a small electrical charge. The magnitude of the electrical charge is detected by an electronic circuit and the particle is counted accordingly.

However piezoelectric sensors have a number of characteristics that can limit their usefulness when used in an air seeding application or other similar harsh environments. The sensors are high impedance and hence susceptible to interference by strong voltage fields in the environment. This characteristic demands that the sensor be placed close to the detection circuit in order to minimize the effects and occurrences of these fields. This is particularly a problem in an environment like that of an air seeder where collisions of seeds dust fertilizer and other particles generate a large amount of static electricity and where high electromagnetic field strengths are likely. Placing the sensing electronics in these areas as dictated by the necessity to place the high impedance piezoelectric sensors close to their electronic discrimination circuitry exposes them to premature failure as a result of electrostatic discharge and circuit overvoltage.

Another problem with piezoelectric sensors is that the crystal is prone to damage by cracking if overstressed. Because it is desirable to produce a signal strong enough to overcome the background noise inherent in an air seeding system and because the amplitude of the signal generated by the sensor is directly proportional to the deflection of the crystal piezoelectric sensors are often placed such that maximum deflection of the crystal is achieved which requires location directly in the path of the material flow such that some material will strike the sensor pad with maximum impact. Being so placed the piezoelectric sensors are subject to damage through impact and abrasion in being stuck by numerous large or fast moving particles in the air stream small stones for example over a prolonged period of time. Further complicating matters even though these sensors are placed directly in the path of material flow they are characteristically struck by a relatively small portion of the total material flowing in the sensor tube and hence are incapable of accurately measuring the total amount of material flowing in the line due to the relatively small amount of material that actually strikes the sensor.

In yet another embodiment the piezoelectric sensors are designed such that a pin is attached perpendicular to the surface of the sensor. In this design the piezoelectric crystal is not placed directly in the path of the material which helps to mitigate damage which may be caused by material directly striking the piezoelectric material. This implementation is further beneficial in that the magnitude of the output signal of the sensor is amplified by virtue of the lever arm that is formed by the distance from the point of impact of the material on the pin to the surface of the piezoelectric material to which it is attached. However a major drawback of this implementation is that material often gets lodged in the sensor tube because of the pin obstructing a portion of the flow path. Another serious drawback of this design is that the pins often fail after a period of use due to being repeatedly struck by the particles in the air stream. These sensors also fail to accurately measure the amount of material flowing in the line because only very small amount of the material actually strikes the pin.

Yet another drawback to currently deployed piezoelectric sensor based systems or any prior art system that places electronic sensors in or near to the stream of material is that they require that the electronics associated with the sensors be replicated in every location where the sensors are installed. With current state of the art air seeders employing a hundred or more tubes the cost of these sensors if deployed in every tube can become a significant impediment to the deployment of the system.

In an attempt to save system costs some air seeding systems will place sensors in only a small percentage of seed tubes and use those sensors to estimate the overall performance of the machine. An example of such a system is a material flow monitoring system that uses piezoelectric sensors mounted on top of secondary distribution manifolds in an air seeder to estimate the amount of material flowing into the manifold. In this embodiment a piezoelectric sensor is caused to vibrate when material striking the inside top of the distribution manifold creates vibrations which are transmitted along a mounting bolt into the sensor. The principle of operation is that the amount of vibration transmitted up through the mounting bolt is directly proportional to the amount of material striking the manifold top. The assumption is that if a material distribution line leaving the distribution manifold becomes blocked the amount of material entering the manifold will decrease causing the noise generated to decrease which will indicate that a line is blocked.

However this system suffers from a number of serious shortcomings principal of which is the lack of sensitivity of the system to partial blockages whereby the flow to an individual tube may become partially restricted without substantially changing the total material flow into the distribution manifold inasmuch as airflow and hence material flow will increase in the remaining distribution lines should one or more distribution lines become partially blocked. Another shortcoming of this system is that the amount of signal presented to the sensor can be highly variable from one manifold to the next on a single machine with multiple manifolds. Inasmuch as this system uses a common sense line and hence a common blockage sensing threshold the level at which the system must be set in order to operate without causing blockage alarms must necessarily be less than the least sensitive node in the system. Therefore the system can operate without alarm should a secondary distribution line become blocked or partially blocked in a manifold with a higher threshold requirement. Additionally since this system is designed as a blockage monitoring system it lacks both the sensitivity and granularity to be used as a material flow measurement system. Finally this system and others like it that do not use a sensor in each final run are incapable of being used to help balance the flow of material across the final distribution runs of an air seeder system.

An important metric for measuring the balance of an air seeder system is the Coefficient of Variation. Coefficient of Variation or CV is a technical term used to describe the variability in the metering and distribution of material from the seed hopper throughout the seed tubes and into the soil. The CV is expressed as a percentage difference between the various final seed runs known as secondary seed tubes across the width of a seeder. The Prairie Agricultural Machinery Institute has published guidelines for CV values as its basis for rating the uniformity of distribution for seeding implements. These guidelines describe the rating scale as a CV greater than 15 is unacceptable a CV between 10 and 15 is acceptable and a CV less than 10 is good.

If there is not a sensor capable of measuring material flow in every secondary seed tube the only method of determining the CV for an air seeder is to run material through the system collect the output of each of the final distribution tubes in separate containers weigh the containers and compare their weights. This is obviously a laborious process which may have to be repeated multiple times as an individual is attempting to balance a system.

Even if sensors described in prior art are used in every secondary seed tube on an air seeder these sensors are not for the most part designed to measure material flow but rather are designed to detect lack of material flow blockage . Assuming these sensors could be used to accurately measure material flow there still is currently no efficient way of balancing the outputs of these tubes based on the data from the sensors. Some air seeding systems utilize hinged diverters or baffles at a branching point in a tube to direct more or less air flow down one of the two branches but this can only affect the flow of the two branches of that particular tube in relation to each other and does not correct any imbalance which may exist further downstream in the system.

Another problem common to all modern air seeders is the severe environmental conditions under which the equipment must operate. These conditions include extremes in vibration dust temperature humidity shock and moisture. As a consequence electrical and electronics components utilized in these systems must be very robust or risk premature failure. It is undesirable to introduce components into this environment that by virtue of their electrical complexity are prone to failure. Unfortunately that is precisely the situation with many of the flow monitoring systems in use today. Monitor systems of the present art for the most part employ sensors which are uniquely powered and addressed resulting in hundreds of connections which are prone to failure due to the severe environmental conditions under which they must operate.

What is needed in the art is an inexpensive but accurate method of sensing and measuring the material flow in every secondary seed tube on an air seeder simultaneously as well as a means for controlling or changing the air flow in each individual seed tube on the implement based on data derived from these sensors so as to properly balance the system and attain optimum seed uniformity.

Modern vehicles are generally operated with relatively sophisticated control systems including digital processors and other electronic components. Such control systems typically include monitors and other user interface devices for enabling operators to monitor and control operations. Designing and manufacturing monitors and other interface devices for retrofitting on existing equipment can be challenging due to the wide variety of equipment systems and functions which must be accommodated. For example tractors implements and other equipment commonly used for agriculture typically have specialized monitoring and display requirements associated with their operations. Cultivating planting spraying and harvesting operations are commonly monitored and controlled with special purpose devices for maximizing crop yields and optimizing equipment usage efficiencies. Various OEM and after market systems and devices are commercially available for these purposes.

Some attempts have been made to address these challenges by decentralizing the display intelligence and moving the processing power out to each vehicle and or implement and then creating a dumb display that can accept industry standard messages from vehicles and implements which contain display directives. Virtual terminals meeting industry standard protocol requirements and compatible with various vehicles and implements are commercially available but are often subject to cost performance and installation disadvantages. What is needed in the art is a method and system for controlling vehicles and implements and displaying information therefrom using inexpensive wireless mobile devices. Operators can move the mobile devices to alternative locations including outside the vehicles while still using the mobile devices for vehicle controls monitors and displays. Operators can use the wireless networking capabilities of the mobile devices to tie into any number of external third party applications via cloud server interfaces.

In accordance with the teachings of the present invention a particulate flow measurement monitoring and balancing system is disclosed. The system has a particular use for monitoring and measuring the particulate flow in a pneumatic system such as an air seeder such particulate flow consisting of seeds fertilizer or a combination of both seeds and fertilizer and based upon data derived from sensors in the system provide a means to simply and effectively balance the material flow being dispensed by a plurality of seed tubes so as to affect uniform distribution of the material across the field. Each system consists of a plurality of discrete sensors placed in the particulate flow tubes such that the signals received are analyzed by a computational means the data from which is transmitted to a central operator interface.

Each discrete sensor consists of an acoustic sensing means which is placed into the flow of material such that substantially all of the particulate traveling in the tube strikes the sensing means. In striking the sensing means the particulate undergoes a change in momentum resulting in an impulse of energy being transferred from the material into sound power. The sound power is directed by an acoustic pathway onto a MEMS microphone the output of which is digitized and analyzed with respect to energy and frequency. Numerous acoustic pathways are directed to a single computational means thus reducing the complexity of the system and the number of required electrical connections.

An operating system can consist of one or many computational nodes and one or many discrete sensors. Each node will be capable of communicating with each other node and with a master operator interface node on a system by wireless means.

A new vehicle control and gateway module will be described. The invention described herein is centered around an electronics module called the gateway module which acts as a bridge between the proprietary communication busses standard on a vehicle such as those commonly seen on commercial agricultural and construction vehicles including the standardized communication busses used for operator displays in the vehicle and various external remotely located wireless networks including but not limited to personal area networks local area networks LANs mesh networks wide area networks WANs metropolitan area networks and cellular networks . The gateway module receives messages from one system from one or more of the vehicle busses or from one or more of the off board wireless networks interprets the message translates it into a form appropriate to the receiving system and transmits it to the receiving system seamlessly. This allows a mobile device to access data from the vehicle as needed or even to be used as a controller for the vehicle. It also allows an application programming interface API to be created that will allow an external web based application to access and use vehicle generated data such as vehicle service information vehicle or implement status seed or chemical quantity etc. .

As required detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein however it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention which may be embodied in various forms. Therefore specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting but merely as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present invention in virtually any appropriately detailed structure.

Certain terminology will be used in the following description for convenience in reference only and will not be limiting. For example up down front back right and left refer to the invention as oriented in the view being referred to. The words inwardly and outwardly refer to directions toward and away from respectively the geometric center of the embodiment being described and designated parts thereof. Said terminology will include the words specifically mentioned derivatives thereof and words of similar meaning.

With reference now to the drawings and in particular to thereof a new air seeder monitoring and equalization system embodying the principles and concepts of the present invention will be described.

While the exact configuration of the system shown in does not limit the present invention certain components of the system should be highlighted for clarity. Additional details on the configuration and operation of the air seeding system are provided in which will be discussed shortly. The air cart consists of one or more hoppers which contain the material that is to be dispensed into the soil during operation. The material to be dispensed may be a particulate which may consist of any particles suitable for achieving the purpose described herein such as seeds grains herbicides fertilizers chemicals etc. or any combination thereof however for the purposes of this discussion the material will be referred to generically in the text of this specification as seeds. Any operations described herein in reference to seeds may also be applied to any other appropriate particulate or combination without changing the inventive concept.

It is important to note that the air cart may actually have more than one hopper and that each hopper may contain a different type of material. For example one hopper may include seed and a second hopper may contain fertilizer or other chemicals. It is also possible that the air seeding system may itself include more than one air cart with each air cart potentially holding a different type of material. The exact number of air carts in an air seeding system as well as the exact number of hoppers per air cart can vary within the scope of the invention presented herein.

A fan is connected to the air cart and is used to introduce a flow of air into the implement which is used to carry seeds throughout the system. In general terms seeds are dropped into a primary manifold from the hopper where they enter into the flow of air provided by the fan . The seeds flow from the primary manifold to the primary seed tube to secondary seed tubes not shown in distributed throughout the tool bar . The air and seeds flow through the tool bar and are deposited into a furrow dug in the ground by openers . The openers are blades which extend into the soil and create furrows for holding the seeds as they are drawn through the ground. As the tractor and air seeding system continue forward the furrows created by the openers are pushed shut by closers covering the dispensed seeds with soil.

Referencing now to a cutaway view of a portion of the air seeding system is shown detailing the path of seeds and particulate flow through the system. As with is intended to show an exemplary system to outline the functioning of a typical air seeding system and is not meant to be limiting in any way. Various changes to the configuration and components of the system can be made without affecting the overall inventive concept presented herein.

For the example embodiment of an air seeding system shown in we will use the terms primary and secondary to indicate a component s relative position on the example air seeding system shown. In this example seeds leaving the hopper first enter into a primary manifold where they are divided into one or more primary seed tubes. The primary seed tubes carry the seeds away from the air cart and onto the tool bar where the primary seed tubes each flow into a secondary manifold where the flow of material is once again divided. From each secondary manifold the seeds flow into secondary seed tubes and eventually down into the furrow being made in the ground by the openers on the air seeder. It should be noted that the exact configuration of the manifolds and seed tubes is not critical to the key inventive concepts presented herein and that the present invention will work on any configuration of air seeder. What is critical to the inventive concepts presented herein is that the amount of material flowing through each of the final seed runs in the system just prior to the seeds leaving the machine and flowing into the earth below is sensed as described herein. In the example system presented in the figures contained herein these final seed runs are referred to as secondary seed tubes but they could be called by another name in another system. This example system is further described with the appropriate reference designators in the following text.

The air cart includes a hopper which holds the seeds to be dispensed by the implement. The seeds are released from the hopper falling into a conduit that is connected to the rest of the system. As the seeds pass into the conduit the rate of their flow is controlled by a metering system . The seeds fall through the conduit into the primary manifold where they are introduced to the flow of air produced by the fan . The fan is connected to the primary manifold by a hose .

The seeds are propelled out of the primary manifold by the flow of air and enter into one or more primary seed tubes . From the primary seed tube the seeds travel into a secondary manifold where the flow of seeds is split or branched in several directions and directed into a plurality of secondary seed tubes . The secondary seed tubes then deliver the seeds down into and behind the opener where the seeds fall down into the furrow in the ground created by the opener . Block in shown in the location between the secondary manifold and the secondary seed tube is one possible location for the sensor and restrictor components described in detail in .

As illustrated in the length of the primary seed tubes will vary depending on which secondary manifold they are routed to. The primary seed tubes are routed over the structure of the tool bar and may each have dips and bends where the flow of seed material can be slowed or otherwise disturbed. The secondary manifolds are typically raised on towers and the primary seed tubes rise up into the towers causing the flow of material to flow straight up directly against gravity. Within the secondary manifolds the flow of material is branched in twelve different directions in this example and follows the air flow into the secondary seed tubes . Similar to the primary seed tubes the secondary seed tubes must also be routed from the secondary manifolds across the structure of the tool bar and into the furrows behind the openers . The flow of air created by the fan is split ninety six times in this example and each branch of this flow has a different geometry and length creating different impediments to the flow of air and airborne material and hence completely different flow characteristics. Creating a system in which this flow of material is balanced with all of the flows coming into the openers on the system are essentially the same is an extremely difficult task. The present invention provides an inexpensive yet accurate particulate flow monitor and a method of balancing the flow of particulate throughout the entire particulate flow path of a pneumatic system such as an air seeding system.

Throughout this specification various terms may be used interchangeably to describe the present invention. As previously discussed the term seeds will be used generally to cover any type of particulate that is a material made up of particles or droplets that is flowing through a system. Although the examples given herein primarily represent an air seeding system the same inventive concepts may be applied to any particulate flow system in which particles or droplets of material are pushed through the system by a flow of air. Because the systems being described are based on flowing air the term pneumatic system may be applied to these particulate flow systems. In general the term pneumatic means filled with air especially compressed or forced air.

The detailed description describes various embodiments and features of a particulate flow monitor or simply flow monitor which for the purposes of this description is a means of sensing the amount of particulate matter flowing through a pneumatic system at a given time. Other terms for a particulate flow monitor may include seed flow monitor or material flow monitor. 

One inventive component of the present invention is an acoustic sensor also referred to as an acoustic transducer. The purpose of the acoustic sensor or transducer is to transform the sound waves generated by the flow of particulate material in a pneumatic system into electrical signals representing the amount of particulate flow through the flow paths of the pneumatic system. Sound waves are created by the vibrations of an object in air which causes the air to be compressed in waves or impulses. The acoustic sensor detects the pneumatic impulses created by particulate striking the face of the acoustic sensor and directs them into an internal microphone where the impulses are transformed into electrical signals to be interpreted by a processor.

For the purposes of this discussion the term processor or controller is used in a general sense to describe electronic and or software means for processing signals and or data generated by a system and may refer to a microprocessor a microcomputer or a separate computer system. A processor may be part of an electrical signal generator which is a module or collection of modules or functions that interpret data items or events such as pneumatic impulses and output electrical signals representing the data items or events.

The present invention also provides a means of displaying or outputting the electrical signals and or the information they represent. This may be done using a direct mounted computer monitor that is a display built in or directly wired into a vehicle or application or on a handheld computing device. The term handheld computing device is intended to generally refer to any type of easily portable computing platform that does not require being directly wired into a vehicle or application. One example of such a device is the iPad manufactured by Apple Inc. Other examples may include a laptop computer a tablet computer or even a personal cellular phone with sufficient processing and displaying capabilities.

The present invention will now be described in additional detail in the following text and the remaining figures.

Referencing now to an embodiment of an acoustic sensor used for detecting the amount of seeds and material flowing through the system will be discussed. shows a stand alone cutaway view of an acoustic sensor of the present invention. The acoustic sensor is a mechanical component that is designed to pick up amplify and direct sound from the inside of a seed tube into a separate electronics module called a blockage monitoring node . The blockage monitoring node is not shown in but is presented in detail in and shows one embodiment of how the blockage monitoring node may be mounted along with one or more acoustic sensors .

In a sensor plate is mounted over a hollow acoustic chamber . In the preferred embodiment the sensor plate is constructed of a durable material such as stainless steel which can withstand the impact of seeds rocks and other materials which may enter the material stream flowing through the air seeding system and can also transmit sound into the acoustic chamber . Although stainless steel offers an ideal surface that provides high amplitude signals and is both strong and resistant to corrosion it is important to note that any appropriate material can be used to create the sensor plate . A gasket is placed over or between the sensor plate and the acoustic chamber to prevent material from getting inside the acoustic chamber thereby affecting the acoustic properties of the sensor and also as a means of holding the sensor plate in place. The gasket may be a separate piece or may be applied as a paste in a dispensing operation. The gasket is a flexible or spongy material that can be readily compressed to form an airtight seal between the sensor plate and the acoustic chamber .

The acoustic chamber is designed such that it can direct the sound picked up from objects striking the sensor plate and direct them toward the back of the acoustic chamber where they enter a transmitting hose . The sound travels through the transmitting hose and is directed into the blockage monitoring node shown in .

In the preferred embodiment the acoustic chamber is made from an injection molded plastic such as those plastics commonly used for the construction of electronics enclosures and which withstand the extreme conditions found in the harsh environment of an air seeding system. However the acoustic chamber may be constructed by any appropriate manufacturing technique and using other materials without changing the inventive concept of the acoustic chamber .

The selection of materials is very important for the design of an acoustic sensor. The thickness and density of the material for example the sensor plate will determine the frequency of the sound data that is transmitted into the acoustic chamber and thus the sensor design can be tuned such that the frequencies it produces fall into an environmental sweet spot which is relatively free of background noise. Similarly the design of the transmitting hose is critical. The material of the transmitting hose can have a filtering or attenuating effect on the noise that is transmitted down its length. If the transmitting hose is too soft it may also collapse and cut off sound transmissions. The material should be chosen with consideration for stiffness and such that the filtering effect of the transmitting hose will not attenuate the frequencies in the system sweet spot. 

The transmitting hose in the preferred embodiment is constructed from a length of rubber hose. This material is flexible and allows the transmitting hoses of several separate acoustic sensors to be easily routed to a nearby blockage monitoring node . However the transmitting hose may be made in a different manner in a different geometry or with a different material without altering its function which is to create a conduit of sound which directs the sounds from the acoustic sensor into a blockage monitoring node .

The acoustic sensor is a simple mechanical solution which can be easily and inexpensively manufactured. The acoustic sensor does not contain electronics but instead routes the sounds it detects to a remotely located node where the sounds can be processed. As shown in the outputs of several acoustic sensors can be directed into a single blockage monitoring node so that the total amount of electronics on the air seeding system can be minimized significantly reducing system cost and increasing system reliability.

Referencing now the acoustic sensor is shown mounted on a hollow tubular sensor housing . The sensor housing provides a mounting point for the acoustic sensor . In the preferred embodiment the sensor housing is mounted between the secondary manifold and the secondary seed tube placed in the position marked as in and as shown in . The sensor housing is essentially a rigid piece of tubing bent at an angle such that the acoustic plate of the acoustic sensor will be impacted by seeds . The acoustic sensor is mounted in an opening at the bend of the sensor housing such that the acoustic plate is directly exposed to the flow of material leaving the secondary manifold . Multiple seeds are blown into the sensor housing following seed travel paths A shown here as examples where they impact the acoustic plate and are deflected back down into the sensor housing and continue traveling down into the secondary seed tubes . Sounds created by the impacts of the seeds on the acoustic plate are transmitted into the acoustic chamber and then are directed into the transmitting hose .

It should be noted that the sensor housing could be designed such that it is an integral part of the acoustic sensor or it could be a separate piece that connects the output of the secondary manifold to the input of the secondary seed tubes . Although the angle of the sensor housing is shown to be approximately 90 degrees in the figures the ideal angle may be different and would be calculated based on the geometry of the air seeding system for which the sensors are being designed. The angle of the acoustic sensor would be optimized such that is presents the acoustic plate to the flow of seeds such that the sounds of impact can be adequately detected without adversely affecting the flow of material.

Returning to for each hose port there is a corresponding MEMS microphone and a corresponding analog switch . MEMS is an acronym which stands for Micro Electro Mechanical Systems and is used generally to refer to small devices or components which are micrometers microns in size. The MEMS microphones receive the sound waves through the hose port as they travel down from the transmitting hose from the acoustic sensor . The analog switches are used by the blockage monitoring node to select which of the input streams from the MEMS microphones should be processed at a given time.

MEMS microphones are preferred for several reasons. Not only are the MEMS microphones very small parts contributing to a small blockage monitoring node but they are also manufactured from a process that produces consistent parts with very little part to part variation. This is important because it means that no calibration is required to account for the large part to part variations seen in traditional non MEMS microphone components.

A general purpose processor is provided to control the basic operations of the blockage monitoring node . A channel selector circuit is controlled by the general purpose processor and is used to toggle the analog switches to select which of the MEMS microphones should be processed. The audio signals captured by the MEMS microphones are sent to an audio processor . In the preferred embodiment the audio processor is a high end audio frequency processor ideally suited for processing the frequency based audio data captured from the acoustic sensors .

The blockage monitoring node contains a communications module which is responsible for communicating the analyzed audio signals and related data to a remote device such as a central display in the tractor cab. Alternatively the communications module may transmit the data to an off board device such as a tablet computer or similar handheld computing platform. In the preferred embodiment the communications module is a wireless transceiver capable of both transmitting and receiving information via a wireless protocol. An alternative embodiment of the communications module is the circuitry required to communicate over a hardwired connection such as a serial communications bus.

The blockage monitoring node also has a power supply circuit which is used to process and regulate the power coming into the blockage monitoring node and provide it as necessary at the proper voltage level for the functional blocks shown in . In one embodiment the blockage monitoring node will receive power from the implement or tractor through a wired connection. In another embodiment the blockage monitoring node could have its own internal power source such as a battery pack.

In at least one embodiment the blockage monitoring node contains a global navigation satellite system GNSS receiver to provide information on the location of the blockage monitoring node in three dimensional space. The GNSS receiver may comprise any appropriate device for receiving signals from geosynchronous satellites and or ground based stations. Common examples of deployed available GNSS systems include the global positioning system GPS and the Russian GLONASS system.

The general purpose of the GNSS receiver is to allow the blockage monitoring node to determine its current position at any given moment in time and by knowing its current position to be able to calculate a ground speed by determining how far the air seeding system has moved between two points in time and to determine whether the air seeding system has reached the end of the field which it may determine by detecting a reducing ground speed combined with consecutive changes in position that indicate the vehicle is turning around .

Also some embodiments of the blockage monitoring node may include the ability to accept inputs other than the audio signals entering the blockage monitoring node through the hose ports . For instance the blockage monitoring node may accept a work switch input which could be a digital switch input indicating that the operator of the air seeder has stopped the flow of seed through the system perhaps because they have reached the end of the field and are turning around and do not wish to seed in this area . Another potential input the blockage monitoring node may receive is an alternative ground speed input from a source such as a speed sensor that may already exist on the system . Inputs such as the work switch input and alternative ground speed input as well as additional outputs may enter and leave the blockage monitoring node through one or more I O connectors . A block of input output circuitry would control and process the inputs and outputs from the blockage monitoring node .

A MEMS microphone is mounted to the back or bottom side of a PCB positioned so that a resistive membrane A built into the MEMS microphone is directly in line with a hole A that passes through the thickness of the PCB . On the top or front side of the PCB that is on the side of the PCB opposite that of the MEMS microphone an acoustic coupler is attached to the PCB with an adhesive A. The hollow center of the acoustic coupler B is positioned such that it lines up above the hole A in the PCB . The end of the transmitting hose the other end of which is attached to the acoustic sensor is placed over top of the acoustic coupler . Sounds passing into the acoustic sensor as pressure waves are directed into the transmitting hose travel down the transmitting hose into the acoustic coupler and pass through hole A to strike the resistive membrane A. The resulting vibrations on the resistive membrane A are detected in the MEMS microphone as changes in electrical characteristics which can be interpreted by other electronics not shown mounted on or near the PCB .

It should be noted that other types of non MEMS microphones could be used without changing the inventive concepts of the present invention. MEMS microphones are used for their size reliability and uniformity as described previously. Also the technology used for the MEMS microphones of the present invention is resistive in which the amount of resistance in the membrane changes when it is compressed by sound waves and this technology is inherently immune to the environmental noise present in an air seeding system.

The intent of is to show how the components of the present invention would be utilized on a typical secondary manifold tower . In the preferred embodiment the blockage monitoring node is attached to a rigid vertical section of the primary seed tube . As material flows up through the primary seed tube it enters into a secondary manifold and is split into multiple sub streams. For simplicity shows only two such branches from the secondary manifold one going to the left and one going to the right but in reality these branches would occur in several directions directed radially out from the center of the secondary manifold . The sensor housing attached to each acoustic sensor acts as a connector from the secondary manifold to the secondary seed tubes . As the branched flow of material passes through the sensor housings the seeds impact the acoustic sensors before continuing to flow into the secondary seed tubes . The sounds thus created by the impacts are directed into the transmitting hoses and travel down into the blockage monitoring node where the sounds are processed to determine the amount of flow traveling into each secondary seed tube .

The previous figures have illustrated how the present invention is used to determine the amount of material flow traveling through an air seeding system such as that shown in . This is done by using the acoustic sensors detailed in in conjunction with the blockage monitoring nodes detailed in . By thus equipping every secondary seed tube with the sensors and modules described in these figures a value of material flow as calculated from the relative audio signal detected within each seed tube can be calculated for these seed tubes. Additional details on how these material flow values are determined and how they are used are provided later in and the corresponding textual description. Once these material flow values are determined measures can be taken to balance the material flows so that the flow is consistent within every secondary seed tube. Although existing prior art systems offer very little in the way of a means for balancing the material flow within the seed tubes the present invention differs from the prior art by offering a means for adjusting the flow within each secondary seed tube independently based upon data derived from the sensors . For example this could be accomplished by providing an adjustable air flow restrictor within each secondary seed tube as a means of balancing the material flow values across the air seeding system.

The air flow restrictor has a hollow center that allows air and material to flow through it allowing it to be placed in line anywhere in the secondary seed tube . An alternative method of introducing the air flow restrictor would be to make it integral to the sensor housing of the acoustic sensor assembly. shows an alternative embodiment of the acoustic sensor assembly of where the air flow restrictor is built into the lower half of the sensor housing . In this position the flow of air and material entering the secondary seed tube can be restricted by turning the outer adjustment shell to close down the fingers . Note that the outer adjustment shell is shown here with a non tapered exterior but the interior of the outer adjustment shell is still tapered as will be shown in cutaway views in .

The information obtained by the acoustic sensors as processed by the blockage monitoring nodes is communicated to an operator. If a blockage is detected in one or more of the secondary seed tubes then this condition should be displayed to the operator of the air seeding system so that appropriate steps can be taken to clear the condition. In addition to be able to equalize the output of all of the secondary seed tubes an operator must be able to have access to the output values of all of the seed tubes in order to make corrections. Once these current output values are known an operator can correct an imbalance in the system by manually adjusting the air flow restrictors on the appropriate secondary seed tubes in order to change the air and material flows in those tubes.

In an alternative embodiment of the present invention the air flow restrictors might be connected to electric motors or otherwise automatically controlled. In this embodiment an electronics module possibly a variation of the blockage monitoring node or a separate module could be entered into an automatic balancing mode. In this mode the electronics module could read the seed flow rates for all of the secondary tubes on the system check for imbalances and then drive the electric motors or other automatic means to adjust the air flow restrictors automatically without manual intervention. This would enable automatic adjustment of a system every time an operator pulls the air seeding system into a new field or changes crops.

The handheld computing device may be used as both a system display and control device. In one embodiment the handheld computing device is a commercially available computing platform such as a version of the iPad computing device available from Apple Inc. or any similar commercial computing platform. In an alternative embodiment the handheld computing device is a custom designed handheld computing platform which can be specifically designed for use with the present invention.

The handheld computing device can receive and transmit wireless messages with the blockage monitoring nodes . In one operating scenario one or more of the blockage monitoring nodes detects a drop in sound level from one or more of the acoustic sensors to which it is connected. This information is transmitted to the handheld computing device in the form of wireless messages . The handheld computing device receives the wireless messages processes the information contained within them and determines what to display on the handheld computing device .

In the preferred embodiment the algorithms that determine how to interpret the data transmitted by the blockage monitoring nodes are located on the handheld computing device . By locating the algorithms inside the handheld computing device the blockage monitoring nodes may have less powerful inexpensive processors reducing the overall system cost. In an alternative embodiment the algorithms for determining if there is a blockage are located within each blockage monitoring node instead of in the handheld computing device . In this alternative embodiment the handheld computing device effectively becomes a sort of dumb display and is only used to display the results calculated by the blockage monitoring nodes . Although in the preferred embodiment the handheld computing device does the majority of the processing it may be desirable to have the blockage monitoring nodes communicate with an existing dumb display on the tractor instead of to the handheld computing device . In these cases the blockage monitoring nodes may need to do all of the processing and send display directives to a non processing dumb display instead of allowing a handheld computing device to do the processing.

For the purposes of this discussion a dumb display or non processing display shall be defined as a display with very limited processing power which must be commanded what it should display through messages sent to it by a separate electronics module. Many modern tractor manufacturers provide such non processing dumb displays for their tractors as the displays must be capable of receiving and displaying information from different implements hay balers air seeders spray equipment etc. from various manufacturers. Instead of trying to create a single display type that contains all of the processing power and algorithms needed for all of the various types of implements the tractor manufacturers instead often provide a single dumb display which simply displays the information it receives from a separate module mounted on the implement.

In this way the intelligence is encapsulated in the electronics on the implement and a single dumb display type will work with many different kinds of implements. In order to communicate with a single display type all of the implements must send messages in a standardized format to the display in the tractor. One example of such a non processing display is the GreenStar display found on tractors manufactured by the John Deere Company of Moline Ill. The GreenStar display is an ISOBUS virtual terminal where ISOBUS refers to a standardized open communications network technology for connecting electronic devices on agricultural equipment and virtual terminal refers to a display which follows the ISOBUS standard. An ISOBUS virtual terminal accepts messages from implements using the industry standard ISO 11873 communications protocol. Any implement that can send the proper commands using this communications protocol is capable of displaying information on the GreenStar display. Many other types of ISOBUS virtual terminals are available. provides additional information on how the present invention might communicate to an existing non processing display such as an ISOBUS virtual terminal.

Referring now to several examples of user interface pages will be described. The pages shown in these figures are intended to be examples only and not limiting in any way and are representative of any number of similar pages that could be created for the application. For the purposes of this discussion these user interface screens will be shown as they might appear being displayed on a handheld computing device . It should be noted however that similar screens could be displayed on any type of displaying device including an ISOBUS virtual terminal as previously described and as illustrated in .

In the screen illustrated in a summary view of the entire air seeder implement is shown. In this view numeric designators refer to the number of a specific secondary manifold on the seeder. shows 12 separate numeric designators showing that the air seeder implement now connected to the machine has 12 separate secondary manifolds . Next to each numeric designator is a manifold status . In this embodiment a manifold status of OK indicates that the manifold in question is operating correctly no blockages . A manifold status other than OK will appear next to secondary manifolds which have one or more problems. For example as shown in a manifold status A stating NO CONNECTION is shown next to the entry for manifold and manifold status B showing the numbers 1 3 5 6 next to the entry for manifold .

A connection icon appears to the right of each manifold status including statuses A and B . The connection icon may be an animated icon such as a spinning disk or any appropriate symbol when the wireless connection to the blockage monitoring nodes on the corresponding secondary manifold is working properly. An alternative form of the connection icon A is used to indicate a malfunctioning or non existent wireless connection between the handheld computing device and the corresponding secondary manifold . In the embodiment shown in an X is used for the alternative connection icon A to indicate a bad connection. The manifold status A of NO CONNECTION is shown as an additional indication that the wireless connection is faulty. As previously indicated the status labels specific graphics and the number and arrangement of onscreen components is intended to be an example only and not meant to be limiting in any way.

The manifold status B showing the numbers 1 3 5 6 as shown in is used to indicate that the corresponding secondary manifold is detecting partial or full blockages on the first third fifth and sixth secondary seed tubes on that manifold. The fault condition shown in this would likely have been caused by a detected and significant decrease in the amount of noise received from the acoustic sensors associated with the secondary seed tubes numbered and on the secondary manifold numbered .

Each user interface screen such as the one shown on the display screen in will also likely contain one or more navigation controls . In the navigation controls are displayed along the bottom of the display screen and include buttons for moving to additional user interface screens shown here with labels Implements and Profiles and a Help button shown here as a circle with a lowercase i inside it .

In this embodiment the manifold information page of displays the current coefficient of variance CV numbers for each secondary seed tube on Manifold as a bar graph . The bar graphs are created and displayed on the display screen such that the exact middle point of each bar graph represents the average flow rate across all of the secondary seed tubes on this secondary manifold . The far left side of each bar graph represents 0 flow rate. The far right side of each bar graph represents twice the average flow rate. Each bar graph is preceded by a numeric designator indicating the number of the corresponding secondary seed tube . The CV numbers displayed to the right of the bar graphs represent the percentage that a secondary seed tube is either above or below the average. For example secondary seed tube number 2 the second bar graph from the top of the display screen shows that its current CV is 4 meaning that the flow rate in that secondary seed tube is 4 greater than the average of all the secondary seed tubes on this secondary manifold . Secondary seed tube number 14 near the bottom of the display screen is 4 below the average shown as 4 . The overall average flow rate across all secondary seed tubes for the displayed manifold is shown at the top of the page.

A center line is displayed as a visual reference and represents 0 CV it represents the average flow rate . A dashed line is used to show the point to which a bar graph must drop before the system will indicate a blockage or partial blockage has occurred. An alarm percentage is displayed beneath the dashed line showing the actual percentage drop that will trigger a blockage alarm. The alarm percentage shown in this example is 10 indicating that an alarm will be triggered when one or more of the bar graphs falls at least 10 below the average flow rate. In a preferred embodiment this alarm percentage and the relative position of the dashed line are user adjustable allowing the operator to pick a different alarm percentage .

When an alarm condition occurs the graphics shown on the bar graphs may change as an indication of the condition. Bar graph A shown corresponding to secondary seed tube in has dropped below the dashed line and is thus shown as a different color than the other bar graphs . The corresponding CV value A shows 20 a significant drop from the average flow rate. Bar graph B has dropped to 0 indicating either a total blockage condition no seed flow or an error in receiving data from the corresponding secondary seed tube or blockage monitoring node . The CV value B is shown as an exclamation point in this example to indicate a serious condition exists.

Navigation controls are provided for this page as well. In this example left and right arrows are provided to move from one manifold display to the next and a Back button is provided to return the operator to the screen that was previously displayed. The navigation controls shown here are intended to be representative of any type of virtual user control that allows the operator to navigate through the screens.

The display screen of the profile selection screen shown in has a profile list A listing all of the profiles that have been defined by the operator. A selection indicator is used to indicate which profile is currently selected. The operator can choose a different profile by touching the profile name from the profile list A. Example navigation controls allow the operator to add delete or edit profiles.

As a profile may contain switch definitions for multiple manifolds a slider bar or similar control is provided to move the display up or down to make other manifold switch sets visible . Example navigation controls may include buttons to save an edited profile or cancel editing mode and return to the previous screen.

The example pages shown in are intended to be representative of the types of operations that could be done using the handheld computing device . They should not be considered complete and a person skilled in the art should realize that any number of display and control pages could be created. The fundamental concept presented herein is that a wireless display the handheld computing device can be used as a user interface and display for the air seeding system of the present invention.

It should be noted that in one embodiment of the present invention much of the configuration system described in may be stored in the blockage monitoring nodes instead of or in addition to storing this information in the handheld computing device . By storing configuration information such as profile definitions in the blockage monitoring nodes it becomes possible to swap out one handheld computing device for another allowing multiple handheld computing devices to be used with the system without requiring a complete re configuring of the system and redefinition of profiles. Since the blockage monitoring nodes are meant to be mounted directly to the implement the configuration information can be stored here with the implement for which it is defined instead of solely on the handheld computing device .

In an embodiment using a tractor display connected to a communications bus a wireless to serial node must be introduced to intercept the wireless communications transmitted by the blockage monitoring nodes and convert them to ISO 11873 messages for transmission over the communications bus . This added component the wireless to serial node allows the present invention to work with existing tractor displays . Also shown on are bus terminators which are required by some communications physical layer implementations.

The embodiment shown in is a significant advance in the art because a typical tractor display such as an ISOBUS virtual terminal supplied by an original equipment manufacturer such as John Deere CASE IH etc. is very expensive and may be several thousand dollars. If the same functionality can be supplied by an off the shelf handheld computing device for a few hundred dollars this is a significant benefit to the operator. The handheld computing device may also be taken off of the tractor and used for other purposes further reducing the system cost.

In the alternative embodiments shown in the wireless communication link could be replaced with direct wired communication links but this would add additional system costs and decrease the system reliability additional wiring provides additional failure points in the system . Also although the ISO 11873 communications standard is described above in some detail any similar protocol or messaging scheme can be supported using the same invention.

A processor controls the operations of the wireless to serial node and contains instructions for processing the information received from the wireless communications circuitry or optional radios or cellular modem and sends it to the serial communications interface which packages the data received wirelessly into messages based on the particular serial communications protocol employed by the system. A connector provides a connection point for the communications bus . An antenna is provided to allow the wireless to serial node to receive and transmit information wirelessly. The wireless to serial node includes a power supply circuit to regulate incoming power and convert it to the levels required for the circuitry within the node. Power may be supplied from the vehicle or implement routed through the connector or may come from an optional internal power source such as a battery pack.

The remaining figures illustrate some of the operational aspects of the present invention. illustrate one embodiment of an algorithm for determining when an air seeding system using the present invention is stopping or turning around at the end of a field allowing the blockage alarms to be disabled to prevent false alarms. During normal operation the acoustic sensors will determine the relative amount of seed flowing through the secondary seed tubes based on the sound level present in the tubes. If one or more of the acoustic sensors detects a sudden drop in sound level the blockage monitoring node will determine that the corresponding seed tube has a partial or full blockage and will indicate an alarm condition in at least one embodiment the determination of whether there is an alarm condition may actually take place in the handheld computing device based on information it receives from the blockage monitoring node .

However when the air seeder reaches the end of the field the operator typically lifts the implement the components of the air seeding system that are in contact with the ground such as the openers turns off the flow of seed and begins to turn around to make the next pass down the field. Since the flow of seed is stopped during the turn the acoustic sensors will detect a drop in sound level which may in turn be falsely interpreted by the system as a blockage. To prevent false alarms in this manner some means for detecting when the implement has been lifted must be provided such that the system can tell the difference between a blockage and the operator turning off the air flow through the system.

One means of doing this is to provide a work switch input to the blockage monitoring node such as that shown in . In one embodiment this work switch input is a digital input that is high when the implement is lowered and seed flow is enabled and low when the implement is lifted and seed flow is turned off. The blockage monitoring node reads the current state of the work switch input and enables or disables the alarms accordingly. As previously discussed in certain embodiments of the present invention the blockage monitoring node may simply pass the state of the work switch input along with the data detected from the acoustic sensors to the handheld computing device and it is actually the handheld computing device that determines whether or not an alarm should be sounded.

In some air seeding systems however there may not be a work switch input or the work switch input may be malfunctioning. In these circumstances it is possible to detect the conditions normally associated with seed flow being disabled by using information already present in the system of the present invention. graphically depicts what happens to the seed flow during a typical work stoppage and outlines an algorithm for determining if alarms should be disabled or enabled when a work stoppage is detected.

T1 indicates the time when the seed flow first drops below the threshold . This time is reached when the seed flow begins to drop off due to either a blockage or a work stoppage .

T2 indicates the time when the seed flow stops dropping and reaches a steady state below the threshold . This might occur for instance during a work stoppage when the seed flow has completely stopped remains steady at zero flow for a period of time .

T3 indicates the time when the seed flow begins to rise again. This may occur after a work stoppage when the seed flow is resumed. Since seed flow will not jump immediately back to its former full flow level the seed flow takes some time to climb back above the threshold .

T4 indicates the time when the seed flow climbs back above the threshold presumably after a work stoppage has ended and seed flow begins to return to the previous level.

By defining acceptable durations between these key timing events T1 through T4 the system can be configured so that it can detect the difference between a blockage and a normal end of field work stoppage. For example if the time between T1 when the seed flow first falls below the threshold and T2 when seed flow reaches steady state takes too long that is it exceeds a pre defined timer an alarm may be sounded. However if T2 steady state is reached before the pre defined timer expires the alarm is disabled meaning that steady state has been achieved and seed flow is considered off.

Section or step of defines the variables used in the algorithm. Most of the variables are flags which are Boolean type variables set to either true or false indicating the presence or absence of a certain condition. For instance if the FLOW RISING flag is true that is an indication that the seed flow is currently increasing.

Section indicates what happens when the seed flow is below the threshold and currently falling but the VISUAL ALARM flag is false. In this case the visual alarm flag is set to true and the ALARM TIMER is reset to 0. Section will only occur when the seed flow first drops below the threshold.

Sections and are all only executed when the VISUAL ALARM flag is already true when the seed flow is below the threshold . Section checks to see how long the seed flow has been falling and if it has been falling longer than the pre defined ALARM TIMEOUT period the audible alarm is sounded AUDIBLE ALARM set to true .

Section checks to see if the seed flow has been in a steady state for too long exceeding the ALARM TIMEOUT . If the ALARM TIMEOUT is exceeded the audible alarm is also sounded in this case.

Section checks to see if the seed flow has been rising for too long. If the ALARM TIMEOUT period is exceeded the audible alarm is sounded.

Finally Section resets the ALARM TIMEOUT AUDIBLE ALARM and VISUAL ALARM flags once the seed flow is no longer below the threshold .

It should be noted that the algorithm outlined in is an example only and is not intended to represent an optimized algorithm or to limit the implementation of the algorithm in any way. One skilled in the art understands that changes can be made to the algorithm shown without deviating from the general idea of the algorithm. For example instead of a single ALARM TIMEOUT variable the algorithm may use up to three separate alarm timeout variables one each for the scenarios covered in Sections and of . Other changes are also possible.

In the preferred embodiments of an air seeding system as described herein a design was chosen to reduce the overall system cost while still providing sufficient functionality e.g. in processing of the acoustic data captured by the present invention. This was achieved by providing one blockage monitoring node for multiple microphones potentially more than 20 acoustic sensors may be plugged into a single blockage monitoring node . Since a single blockage monitoring node has to process sound data received by multiple microphones a multiplexing approach is used where a blockage monitoring node listens to one microphone for a short period of time then moves on to the next and so on until the blockage monitoring node has sampled all of the microphones and begins again. These multiplexed signals are then converted into the frequency domain and analyzed to produce an estimate for the overall sound power seen by the system. This sound power is a relative indication of the amount of flow in a system or in a given seed tube. Instead of showing the exact amount of seed flowing in each tube the system provides the amount of flow relative to the average of all seed tube flow rates. One embodiment of an algorithm for determining a sound power estimate in this fashion is provided in which will be discussed shortly.

However by reducing the amount of or eliminating completely the multiplexing that occurs possibly by increasing the number of processors available for each microphone the sound data could be processed in the time domain. This would allow a system to count the actual number of seeds that strike the acoustic sensor instead of providing a relative flow rate. Working in the time domain in this fashion would allow elements of the present invention to be used in other applications. For instance the acoustic sensors described in this specification could be used in a grain loss monitor in which grain falling out of the back of a combine and therefore lost to the harvester could be detected by placing an acoustic sensor or an array of acoustic sensors on the back of the combine such that grain falling out of the harvester would first hit the acoustic sensor and be detected. The acoustic sensors and electronic components described herein enable processing in both the frequency and time domains. While this specification describes the inventions use on an air seeding system it is important to note that the same components can be used in similar material flow applications including agricultural and other applications.

A fast Fourier transform FFT is performed on the raw data from the left and right channels Steps L R . This creates a frequency spectrum containing imaginary and real spectrum information. The algorithm then finds the absolute value of the spectrum Steps L R and the spectrum is scaled so that the frequency data of interest is better displayed Steps L R . The average of the frequency bins of interest is found to produce an instantaneous sound power measurement Steps L R . If the data is out of range indicating a reset of the gain and error information is needed Steps L R the algorithm resets the gain and error covariance Steps L R and a new sample is obtained Step . This is repeated until a valid instantaneous power measurement is obtained Steps L R .

Once a valid instantaneous power measurement is obtained the algorithm computes the gain required for the Kalman filter Steps L R the running sound power estimate is updated Steps L R and the error covariance is updated Steps L R . Finally an updated sound power estimate is delivered and sent to the handheld computing device for processing and display.

Having described a preferred embodiment it will become apparent that various modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the accompanying claims. In particular the components of the present invention described herein and in the accompanying drawings may be used in different configurations and combinations than described in the examples described above. The arrangement of seed tubes blower fans manifolds and other components can vary significantly from one air seeding system to the next. The present invention can be easily adapted to these alternative configurations without changing the inventive concepts presented herein.

Also as previously discussed the components of the present invention can be adapted for use in other material flow applications. One such application previously discussed in this specification is a grain loss sensor where acoustic sensors may be used perhaps in an array to detect grain falling from the back of a combine. In the grain loss application the air flow restrictors of the present invention would not be used but versions of both the acoustic sensors and blockage monitoring nodes would be employed. These components could be used similarly in any system in which an amount of material is flowing through a system.

Referring now to is a software architecture diagram showing the various layers of software resident in at least one embodiment of a vehicle gateway module. In this view the physical gateway module is shown as a dashed line to indicate that the software layers depicted represent various pieces of software embedded within the gateway module . Additional detail on the gateway module the hardware will be presented in .

The software architecture of at least one embodiment of a gateway module includes a hardware interface layer which includes routines for interfacing to and controlling the various physical hardware devices and components that will be further explained in connection with . The hardware interface layer is essentially the firmware that controls the primary functions of the physical hardware components.

The architecture also contains an ISO 11783 software layer which is responsible for creating proprietary messages in ISO 11783 format. The messages can be used to control functions on the vehicle or an attached implement or to receive information from the vehicle or the attached implement. The ISO 11783 layer can also create or receive Virtual Terminal messages messages that match the Virtual Terminal protocol specification of the ISO 11783 standard such that it can communicate with any attached standard Virtual Terminal. The ISO 11783 layer is responsible for translating messages and data back and forth between ISO 11783 format and other forms which may be used by the gateway module such as information received by the gateway module from one of the wireless networks with which it is communicating.

ISO 11783 also known as ISO BUS or ISOBUS is a common communication protocol used by the agriculture industry and is based on the J1939 Controller Area Network CAN protocol published by the Society of Automotive Engineers SAE . The ISO 11783 standard specifies a serial data network for control and communications on forestry and agricultural vehicles and implements. The ISO 11783 standard consists of several parts each of which describes a different aspect of the standard. Most notably ISO 11783 Part 6 describes the Virtual Terminal standard. By providing a gateway module which can convert between the type of messages and information typically sent over a wireless network used by a mobile device into a standardized protocol used by a Virtual Terminal it is possible for the mobile device to act as a Virtual Terminal or for the mobile device to provide control directives to a vehicle in the same way that an operator would through the use of a Virtual Terminal.

The use of ISO 11783 in and in all examples throughout this specification is intended to be exemplary only and is in no way limiting. Any standard protocol may be used including a future protocol. Therefore the use of ISO 11783 can be replaced with any appropriate standardized communication protocol without deviating from the intent of the invention described herein.

The software architecture of the gateway module contains a web interface layer which has software which can interpret internet commands such as those written in HTML hypertext markup language the language upon which most webpages are written and built. HTML5 the fifth revision of the HTML standard is currently under development and will include many new syntactical features which allow the easier implementation of multimedia features. This web interface layer allows vehicle specific and third party web based applications to be executed on the gateway module .

Particularly a vehicle control application is provided to allow access to certain vehicle and implement subsystems and data as well as control of certain subsystems. Requests are made by the vehicle control application in the form of a web style request an HTML command through the web interface layer which is received by the ISO 11783 layer which translates the request into ISO 11783 format for transmittal on one of the vehicle s communications busses. Information is returned to the vehicle control application via the reverse of this request path.

Similarly applications provided by third parties such as vendors of seed requesting data on seed usage from a planter for example can gain access to data contained within the gateway module by making requests through the third party application interface layer . These requests by third party applications are passed down from a cloud or internet server as will be described in additional detail in .

In addition to accepting and processing requests made by third party applications passed down from the cloud server the third party application interface layer also allows third party applications to be hosted directly on the gateway module . This means that an original equipment manufacturer OEM using a version of the gateway module can create variations of the control software as required to operate their vehicles and implements and can install them as applications directly on the gateway module . The third party application interface layer has knowledge of function calls available within the vehicle control application that allow it to access desired functions.

A processor serves as the primary control for the gateway module executing the embedded software and controlling the functions of the system including the module . The gateway module has serial communications ports for sending messages to other parts of the vehicle system. Serial communications on the vehicle may include but are not limited to ISO 11783 messages CAN messages and other proprietary messages in a serial format.

Wireless communications circuitry is used to control the exchange of information with various wireless networks which may include but are not limited to IEEE 802.11 WiMAX Bluetooth Zigbee or any other appropriate wireless communications protocol. One or more cellular modems are provided to allow the gateway module to communicate via cellular networks. The gateway module can include a global navigation satellite system GNSS transceiver .

The gateway module can provide control to a vehicle or receive inputs from a vehicle using digital and analog inputs and outputs the number of which can vary from zero to several of each type based on the needs of the system. The gateway module may also have a number of motor drive circuits that can be used to engage motor drives on a vehicle or implement.

The gateway module can comprise for example only an electronic control module with a first connection connected to the vehicle implement subsystems and a second connection connected to a virtual terminal .

It should be noted that the block diagram shown in is one embodiment of a gateway module and is not meant to be limiting in any way. Variations can be made to the number and types of circuits included without deviating from the inventive concept. For example a gateway module embodiment with no digital and analog inputs and outputs and no motor drive circuits would still meet the intent of the invention described herein. There are other variations possible which can be made as well while still maintaining the concept of a module which provides a bridge or translation pathway between hard wired vehicle based or application based communication busses and wireless networks.

The gateway module optionally communicates with one or more mobile devices such as a smart phone tablet computer notebook computer etc. over a wireless communications means such as an IEEE 802.11 connection or any appropriate wireless connection. A user operating the mobile device can use an application running on the device and written specifically for the vehicle or application on which the gateway module is mounted for accessing data and controlling the vehicle by issuing wireless commands. The commands can be translated into standard protocol messages for the vehicle as previously described in the detailed description of and .

In this way the mobile device can actually be used in place of the virtual terminal as the primary display and control interface to the vehicle and or the implement attached to the vehicle. This allows the operator to replace a potentially expensive piece of hardware the virtual terminal that was specifically designed for use in the vehicle with an inexpensive and multipurpose mobile device that the operator may already own for another purpose. This also has the added advantage of allowing the operator to leave the cab of the vehicle with the display in the form of the mobile device instead of the hard wired virtual terminal which gives the operator greater freedom and enables features that could not be done with a permanently mounted single purpose display.

In addition to enabling communication with one or more mobile devices the gateway module allows the vehicle to communicate with a cloud server over a wireless communication means such as a cellular network or any appropriate wireless protocol . The cloud server is an internet based set of resources that comprises one or more physical servers and which can draw upon additional resources as the need demands. The cloud server may optionally offer a single company hosted database which stores information collected from a fleet of deployed vehicles and or implements each with their own gateway modules or the cloud server can provide direct access to a number of external applications shown here as A through N but collectively referred to as over a separate communication means . Communication means may be implemented as a wireless connection such as a cellular connection or any of the various wireless network protocols available or as a wired connection to the internet and the cloud server .

These external applications can make requests through the cloud server to the gateway module . These requests are received by the gateway module through the third party application interface and are translated into machine specific requests as previously described in this document.

It should be noted that some embodiments of the system of will used both a virtual terminal and one or more mobile devices in conjunction. This system embodiment may require an application or software to manage the handoff of primary control between the hard wired virtual terminal and the mobile devices . detail possible embodiments of security and safety schemes for managing this handoff. It should be noted that providing security and safety schemes such as those described enables additional system functionality including the handoff of control from the on board system to a second system external to the vehicle system entirely. For example as shown in it would be possible for an operator of a grain truck to control the unload auger on a combine to enable the transfer of harvested crop from the combine to the grain truck without requiring an operator in the harvester. An ideal system should also protect against the inadvertent activation or hijacking by a non authorized external system. We turn now to .

In this initial state the hard wired display is acting as and designated the primary display and the mobile device is acting as and designated the secondary display . The definition of primary display as used in this context is the display through which the operator can command changes to the vehicle system such as turning a subsystem on and off commanding state changes etc. A secondary display in this context is a display which cannot be used currently to command changes to the vehicle system. A secondary display can receive data from the vehicle system and provide readouts and data based on that data but a secondary display is not allowed to command changes directly.

For additional clarity alternate terms for primary display and secondary display that have been used in the past are master display and slave display respectively. The terms master and slave can carry negative connotations however because of reminders of and allusions to human slavery and so these terms have fallen out of fashion and are rarely used today. The reference to these terms is provided for completeness and to avoid ambiguity. These terms will not be used again in this specification and are provided only for additional historic background.

The human operator decides that he or she would like to use a mobile device as the primary display Step and uses the mobile device to initiate a request for control. The mobile device sends a request for control Step to the hard wired display . The hard wired display receives the request and assuming the current system state allows control by a mobile device the hard wired display displays a message to the operator who must then provide manual approval for the change in primary display status Step . The hard wired display then relinquishes control to the mobile device Step .

It should be noted that the transactions shown in represent one possible embodiment of the system and one skilled in the art should see that it is possible to modify the steps shown without deviating from the intent of the current invention. For example it may be possible for the change is display status could happen without requiring approval by a human operator . That is Step as shown in may not be necessary if enough intelligence is built into the gateway module shown in .

It is also important to know that the requests and messages shown passing between the hard wired display and the mobile device do not necessarily pass directly between the displays but are in reality passed into the gateway module as shown in . In the embodiment of the system shown in it is actually the gateway module that manages the interactions with the displays using the hard wired display and mobile device as the interface to the human operator . The arrows shown in therefore should not be seen as the direct transfer of data among the actors in the system but as the hand off of control within the system.

Optionally the human operator can use the hard wired display as an interface to demand control back from the mobile device Step . The hard wired display then seizes control back from the mobile device and informs the mobile device that it is taking control Step . The mobile device then relinquishes control to the hard wired display Step .

When the system is in state and the mobile device drops out that is it loses power or connectivity or is shut off one of two things may happen in the state transition diagram. If the mobile device drops out and the hard wired display is present transition control returns by default to the hard wired display and the system enters back into state . If however the mobile device drops out and the hard wired display is not present that is it has gone offline lost power or is otherwise unavailable transition then the system moves into a safe state state and stays in state until the system is powered on and off or otherwise reset. It should be noted that state can also be entered from state if the hard wired display stops functioning for some reason transition .

When the mobile device is the primary display state the mobile device may also release control on purpose transition and return control to the hard wired display returning to state . Finally it is possible that when the system is in state a second mobile device may request control from the current mobile device transition . When this happens the system returns to state albeit using a new and different mobile device now.

If the gateway module determines that the external device should be designated as the primary display then the gateway module may decide to limit the accessibility to the vehicle implement subsystems . For instance maybe the gateway module would only grant access to the subsystem for controlling the auger and not to any other subsystem.

This selective limited access granting suggests that multiple security schemes can be put in place for the sharing of system privileges or limiting access based on role or need. shows a table describing possible security modes in which the system of the present invention might operate granting certain privileges to system actors based on pre defined conditions or scenarios.

The first entry in the table of is a control scheme called role based security. Under this scheme the gateway module will grant access to only the vehicle or implement subsystems need to fulfill a certain role. As described in the previous two paragraphs for example perhaps the gateway module would only give access to the auger control functions because it knows that the requesting device is filling the role of grain truck. 

The second entry in is conditional security so named because access to certain subsystems will only be granted to a requesting device when a certain condition exists. For example the gateway module may decide not to give access to dangerous subsystems such as the ability to spin the shaft of a power take off or PTO shaft to a mobile device when the operator is not in the seat of the vehicle. This can be used as a safety feature to limit control of the vehicle when the location of the operator is in question.

The third entry is pre approval security whereby the operator can put the current primary display into a mode where it knows to expect a request to relinquish control thereby granting pre approval to the display. In this mode for example an operator in the cab of the vehicle can use the hard wired display to pre approve this own mobile device . Then when the operator leaves the cab with the mobile device he or she can use the mobile device to request control knowing the request will be approved and that no other device can jump in front of the operator s device before the operator makes the request .

The fourth type of control scheme is manual approval security. Under this scheme the hard wired display stays in control as the primary display but allows the secondary displays to request the ability to do things each of these requests requiring approval by someone at the primary display in the cab. This mode might be useful for allowing two people one in the cab and one external with a mobile device to work in conjunction while preventing dangerous situations in which two displays are trying to control the same subsystem.

Finally the fifth example of a control scheme or security mode is shared operations security in which two or more separate displays share access simultaneously to the vehicle subsystems but each separate display has access to and control of a different mutually exclusive set of subsystems features. That is if two displays are used simultaneously display may control system features A and B and display may control system features C and D. Each system feature would only be controlled by a single display at any given time.

It would be obvious to one skilled in the art that there are other types of control schemes that are enabled based on the system architecture of the present invention and that the examples in are not intended to be limiting.

Finally although the examples provided in this document describe the hand off between a hard wired display and one or more mobile devices it should be noted that this invention could be implemented with any of the following permutations without deviating from the intent of the present invention. These permutations are as follows 

Other external applications that might take advantage of the present invention may be suggested through the description of an example operational scenario which will be done through the description of . The remaining figures show example embodiments of applications or application interfaces as they might appear on a mobile computing device when used with the vehicle control and gateway module of the present invention. These images and the corresponding descriptions are not meant to be limiting in any way but show only potential embodiments of application menus and screens that the use of the present invention would enable.

Similarly the application could remotely access weather conditions and other information at A B and access a schedule of available workers to see who is available who is currently working on a job and who is on vacation or otherwise not available. An add menu allows the user to schedule new operations to the schedule. The add menu consists of an operations submenu a vehicle implement submenu and an operational status submenu . The operations submenu allows the user to enter information on the new operation being scheduled such as type of seed name and location of the field and date and time of the operation. The vehicle implement submenu allows the user to choose the vehicle and the implements to be used. The operator assigns the operation using the submenu . The operational status submenu accesses information on the vehicle and or implements through direct communications with the vehicle and implements or indirectly through the cloud server and displays it to the user such that the user knows if maintenance is required before a task can be started or if there are any existing issues with the vehicle or implement.

The map or image displayed on the display screen may show one or more active fields where agricultural or other operations may be scheduled. These fields may be shaded in different textures or colors such as A and B where a certain texture or color A B may indicate a status of an operation on that field . For example a field displayed with color A may indicate that the operation scheduled for this particular field is completed while a field displayed with color B may indicate the operation scheduled in that field is currently underway or partially complete.

The image may also display real objects in or near the fields such as trees and roads . Superimposed on top of the image are small location indicators which denote the location of actual vehicles or implements that are currently deployed in the fields . By hovering over or clicking on one of these location indicators an information tag A may be displayed offering additional information on the vehicle or implement at that specific location.

When a blockage actually occurs on an air seeding machine using the current invention the user can stop the vehicle undock the mobile device from the vehicle cab and carry it with them to the implement. The mobile device can then be used to execute diagnostic tests on the implement access schematics of the implement or vehicle through the connection to the cloud server make a request for a part or service to an online provider or even have a live chat with someone who can assist in the repair. shows one example of an application that can be used to test the functionality of the implement attached to the vehicle while standing next to the implement holding the mobile device and using it to execute a diagnostic test on the implement.

A mobile computing device includes a display screen which may be the primary interface to the user displaying graphical and textual information and providing a touch screen input interface. The mobile computing device has a power switch . In this exemplary application the operator can stand outside of an air cart an implement consisting of a hopper which can drop seed and other material from the hopper down through a meter roll into an air stream for seeding or into an unloading auger and can use the mobile computing device to calibrate the meter roll. The application on the display screen offers a meter roll gauge which shows the percent to which the meter roll has been engaged. It is typical in these systems that in order to calibrate the meter roll the meter must first be primed which means it must be full of seed or other material. The application shown in provides an interface to the vehicle control and gateway module that allows the meter roll to be spun a few times to ensure that it is filled with seed. In the application shown in the meter roll is engaged when the operator pushes the screen on the point marked A and the point marked B. By requiring the operator to engage opposite sides of the display screen to engage the meter roll a safety feature is provided preventing the operator from accidentally engaging the meter roll. Operators are thus prevented from activating the meter roll while accessing the internal workings of the meter roll mechanism.

Use Case 4 ECU needs to be re registered i.e. moved from one implement to another or installing a replacement .

The wireless connections to the vehicle implement cloud server and other wireless devices and services enable the system described in the present invention to completely integrate operations with online schedule and status information and provide access to appropriate parties through external application interfaces.
