This application is a Continuation of USPTO Ser. No. 12 758 138 with a U.S. filing date of Apr. 12 2010 which is incorporated herein by reference.

Various types of digital devices including communication devices require activation using a dedicated server for the subject device to become operational. Wireless devices figure prominently among the devices requiring various forms of activation using computer server equipment.

The emerging device market is expected to grow significantly in near future. As wireless market penetration increases across the world the availability of new devices provides the opportunity for all markets to grow at more accelerated rates. For emerging markets this will help drive even faster adoption of wireless services as entire lines of new wireless communication enabled devices from laptops to cameras become available. For more mature markets defined as those markets that will reach 100 wireless voice service saturation by about 2015 the emerging devices market is expected to experience continued strong growth.

Smart phones and mobile navigation industry devices are among the devices experiencing rapid growth. Growth in sales of smart phones as well as the emergence of vendor driven application stores and marketplaces are changing the dynamics of the mobile communication industry. In the navigation space the integration of GPS into smart phones has accelerated. As more and more consumer mass market electronic devices are developed they will become more mobile and the transmission and receipt of information will become prominent features for the marketing of such devices.

Some emerging product features include cameras with SIM cards and the ability to download electronic books vie e Book readers. Even household appliances like refrigerators and hot water heaters are becoming wireless enabled. The communication industry is experiencing a period of major advances in device and user interface design which will lead to rapid changes in mobile user behavior and the services consumers demand when on the move resulting in an increased need for automated activation applications.

The product growth discussed above will drive significant device activation request volume in the coming years. Initially notebook computers with wireless cards and Smart phones are likely to dominate among new wireless devices. However later on the adoption of more advanced consumer electronic wireless devices with embedded connectivity telematics and devices combining computing capabilities telephone connectivity and gaming will become more prevalent and drive even stronger growth as the industry progresses.

The above discussed growth in wireless connectivity will require a correspondingly large amount of activation and device management capacity. However existing approaches to activating new mobile devices impose significant obstacles to efficiently and rapidly activating new devices. First existing activation procedures are complex and time consuming thereby imposing significant inconvenience and expenditure of time in activating new devices. Second currently activation and registration of new devices is usually conducted at retail outlets by service personnel affiliated with a particular communications service provider. The above approaches pose obstacles to efficiently integrating the ever expanding array of mobile devices into wireless communication networks. Accordingly there is a need in the art for improved systems and methods for activating and managing new mobile devices.

According to one aspect the present invention is directed to a method that may include receiving an activation request from a first subscriber device at a communication convergence platform identifying a service provider associated the first subscriber device composing a service activation request compatible with a communication protocol for the identified service provider and transmitting said service activation request from the platform to the identified service provider.

Other aspects features advantages etc. will become apparent to one skilled in the art when the description of the preferred embodiments of the invention herein is taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

In the following description for purposes of explanation specific numbers materials and configurations are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. It will be apparent however to one having ordinary skill in the art that the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances well known features may be omitted or simplified so as not to obscure the present invention. Furthermore reference in the specification to phrases such as one embodiment or an embodiment means that a particular feature structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the invention. The appearances of phrases such as in one embodiment or in an embodiment in various places in the specification do not necessarily all refer to the same embodiment.

The platform may also provide a dynamic product catalog to match selected offers to appropriate consumers during the activation and account setup procedures.

An embodiment of the platform may also be linked directly into the operating systems of the emerging device providers. This process is essentially a Grab and Go activation process. An embodiment of the platform may include a next generation extension to its core platform that will enable activation functionality in addition to the operating systems of the devices and link them to the platform.

Extending the reach of the communication platform into the actual operating system level of the subscriber devices will preferably enable devices once turned on or opened up to enable the user of the device to easily use a Grab and Go Activation Process at the operating system level. The foregoing process may be facilitated by adding the feature of a software wizard to guide a user of the subscriber device through an activation process.

Employing the system discussed above manufacturers of subscriber devices may become able to provide consumers who purchase the devices with an automated pre qualification an automated credit check and or a choice of CSP. This approach is helpful in providing a subsidized device offering. Once the consumer has selected a preferred CSP customers through the platform can activate and manage the subscriber device in real time on an ongoing basis. This approach will also enable end users of the devices to become acquainted with the service and brand name of the entity responsible for the functionality of the platform and the associated wizard . It is expected that the public recognition of the entity providing the platform and wizard will expand that consumers will become familiar with the grab and go activation process as consumers have done in the past with the Apple Iphone process.

The expanded functionality may be embodied within an Application Programming Interface API that is easy to use and that allows subscribers to activate services and devices using methods that are preferably independent of the network the subscriber devices will operate on or the type of service being requested. Accordingly an embodiment of the platform disclosed herein is intended to serve as a single sthece for all encompassing subscriber device management which may include the operations listed below 

An embodiment of the platform may also be supported with fallout capabilities that with the aid of manual support staff can quickly resolve problems with subscriber transactions. Herein the term fallout generally corresponds to a self healing capability of the communication convergence platform disclosed herein. The problem handling process is supported in the workflow and is tailored to ensure accurate and quick resolution. A preferred embodiment of the fallout management system and method is characterized by the following attributes 

1. Specific bases are established whereby problems may be resolved a by using automated methods or b by directing buckets of fallout data to selected data queues to await human intervention by trained debugging specialists 

2. The system may establish access restrictions that only allow trained qualified specialists to access the applicable data buckets 

3. The deployment of automatic email and electronic messaging preferably operates to quickly provide status information and reports on problems to subscribers and provide the ability to accept corrected information online for rebooting the system in the event of a breakdown 

4. Administrative tools allow the platform to provide specific configurations around Service Level Agreements SLAs for each device type as well as dynamic work capabilities to modify workflow as required.

5. The system may be provide an interactive Voice Response IVR platform that enables subscribers to check the status of one or more transactions and or make simple move add or change requests.

An embodiment of the platform disclosed herein is supported by end to end real time reporting that provides complete real time visibility into the subscriber management process for emerging device and CSP customers. The system preferably also provides both inbound and outbound automated calling capabilities if needed with an automated IVR platform that can be readily configured to improve the subscriber management process and reduce costs. The standard offer and associated pricing excludes manual calls. These calls can be supported and will be priced on a per minute basis.

The Payment Card Industry PCI Data Security Standard DSS is a set of comprehensive requirements for enhancing payment account data security. The standard was developed by the founding payment brands of the PCI Security Standards Council including American Express Discover Financial Services JCB International MasterCard Worldwide and Visa Inc. International to help facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures on a global basis. The PCI DSS is a multifaceted security standard that includes requirements for security management policies procedures network architecture software design and other critical protective measures. This comprehensive standard is intended to help organizations proactively protect customer account data. An embodiment of the platform will conform with the PCI standards. In this manner the platform disclosed herein may add to the functions of communication connectivity that is independent of device type OS type and server type with the ability to enable purchases money transfers and other financial transactions as needed by users of the subscriber devices.

Platform may include Application Programming Interface API order manager visibility manager workflow manager and or gateway manager . CSPs may include any desired number of communication service providers also referred to herein as carriers including for instance server company 1 server 2 and or server 3 . Respective devices may communicate with platform using XML formatted communications .

The benefits of the configuration of an embodiment of the platform of are now briefly summarized here. The interface between devices and platform preferably provides a common front end connection to platform for the devices to a place orders b check for service availability c perform credit checks d bundle information e initiate activation of a new device f enable re activation of a device that was for any reason disabled and or g ongoing management of the subscriber device .

An embodiment of the communication interface between platform and service providers provides a a single point of interface for carriers and or service fulfillment partners such as retailers and or credit providers and or b a defined set of rules that carriers and partners may use to connect to one another. The interface preferably reduces the time needed to process transactions the cost of the transactions and the risk associated with engaging new subscriber devices and new service providers on the CSP side of the interface the right side in the view of .

In this embodiment activation software within platform may proceed with several steps for activating the subscriber device. Specifically the activation software also referred to herein as the activation widget may perform a pre qualification check on the device. The activation widget may further perform a credit check on the user owner of the device to ensure that the owner is considered to have a credit rating suitable for the CSP or other entity advancing communication services to the device owner prior to the owner paying any fees for such services. If the pre qualification check and the credit check return favorable results the activation widget may complete and finalize the activation process.

An embodiment of platform is a scalable high performance multi tenant system that enables device providers to enable on demand order processing and subscriber management services. Platform preferably employs a standard set of XML based APIs that enable activation and management of services and devices independently of the network they operate on. An embodiment of platform preferably includes a composite application composed of several program modules such as modules that are pre integrated to provide a complete end to end solution. Platform provides a standard workflow that orchestrates interactions with many third party systems typically involved in device activation and subscriber management. These third party systems include major communication service providers 3PL providers merchant banks and common enterprise billers thereby also facilitating the processing of retail purchasing and associated financial transactions in addition to the activation and management of subscriber devices.

The solution is intended to be integrated easily with customer back office systems and be fed by subscriber facing channels such as e Commerce web sites or telesales centers. Once a request from a subscriber device and associated data is captured that information is preferably transformed into an XML message and then sent to platform to process transactions particular to that subscriber facing front end system which may include API . Once a transaction order is received at platform the transaction is preferably processed according to standard business rules that have been specifically encoded and configured to work with the CSP that is designated to work with the device that requested the transaction. In this manner platform preferably operates as a universal communications interface between a plurality of devices employing their respective operating systems and communication protocols on one side and a plurality of CSPs having their respective operating systems communication protocols and command structures. Deploying a universal interface such as platform in this manner beneficially removes the burden of enabling each device and each CSP to communicate with a plethora of different communication counterparts an arrangement that would require extensive and redundant communication capabilities within the various devices and the various CSPs .

The Activation Gateway AG comprises the software core that the platform is based on. The AG code base may include three distinct but complementary standard modules that enable the platform experience 1 the Gateway Manager 2 the Workflow Manager and 3 the Visibility Manager . A brief overview of the major technical components and infrastructure will follow in this document.

The Gateway Manager orchestrates incoming and outgoing messaging between platform and integrates with customer front end order capture platforms third party systems that provide services such as tax calculations address validation fraud identification and payment processing as well as CSP OSS BSS infrastructures. Additionally gateway manager is operable to provide status updates to clients and end users via emails and or SMS messaging to keep the customer continually informed of order status. This eliminates unnecessary subscriber calls thereby reducing the customer order processing expense while supporting an exceptional subscriber experience. Platform may provide XML schema that define the messages that platform will accept or transmit. Example of the messages that pass into or out of the platform include 

Order Request An Order Request message provides the ability to order a single product or certain combinations of the products for a new or existing customer. This request will receive a synchronous Stream Closure and can also trigger various Order Status notifications to be sent to the URL provided in the incoming Order Request.

Order Status Request An Order Status Request provides the ability to query for the status of an Order Request. This message type is not required to receive Order Status Notifications but provides the capability for the sender to inquire for a real time status request should the need arise. This request will receive an Order Status Notification synchronously.

Inventory Check Request The Inventory Check Request may be used to verify available inventory levels prior to submitting an Order Request. This information would commonly be used to inform subscribers of potential out of stock conditions or to limit available purchase options. This request will receive an Inventory Check Response synchronously.

Coverage Check Request The Coverage Check Request may be used to determine the carrier s service availability for a specific geographic region. This request will receive a Coverage Check Response synchronously.

Suspend Resume Request A Suspend Resume Request message provides the ability to temporarily disable service for existing subscriber and or to re enable that service. This request will receive a synchronous Stream Closure and can also trigger many based upon business rules Order Status notifications to be sent to the URL provided in the incoming Suspend Resume Request.

Disconnect Request The Disconnect Request may be used to permanently deactivate services for an existing subscriber. This request will receive a synchronous Stream Closure and can also trigger many based upon business rules Order Status notifications to be sent to the URL provided in the incoming Disconnect Request.

RMA Request An RMA Request is used to return equipment and disconnect services for an existing subscriber. This request will receive a synchronous Stream Closure and can also trigger many based upon business rules Order Status notifications to be sent to the URL provided in the incoming RMA Request.

By streamlining all procurement processes from pre order through service activation and billing account updates workflow manager preferably reduces cost and time impediments that often delay the process of delivering products and services to subscribers. Operation of workflow manager may enable one or more of the following features centralized queue management for maximum productivity real time visibility into transaction and revenue management and or automated fallout management and exception handling.

Additionally the workflow manager may include business logic for identifying how orders are managed through the platform . Based on order type workflow manager may apply the appropriate business validation logic. Supported validation rules include but are not limited to the following number portability fraud velocity service availability credit check inventory check and or address normalization and validation order qualification automated vs. manual processing of CSP order types and or existing subscriber inquiry.

In the event a transaction needs to be processed manually because it did not pass a validation rule or was forced out of automation intentionally due to business rules platform may employ dynamic work queues to help customers manage work in a timely and orderly fashion. Dynamic work queues allow manual work to be logically segregated and worked based on exception type. Each work queue provides real time reporting in terms of the number of orders in queue the length of time in queue and SLA compliance.

Finally the workflow manager is operable to orchestrate its activities with those of the gateway manger to broker information exchange with third parties and with the CSP OSS BSS infrastructure. Based on this exchange the workflow manager may track and apply status changes to an order as it progresses through the activation process and also schedule future work activities against the order.

An embodiment of visibility manager serves as the business intelligence vehicle for the platform . The visibility manager module collects analyzes and presents order and system information at various points in the progress of the activation and other processes. Subscribers may use the visibility manager to review real time reports or use this tool to create ad hoc reports that are needed to manage the business. One objective of visibility manager is to provide the customer subscriber with complete access to status information for each transaction order throughout the lifecycle of the order and provide the user with multifaceted reports that will help them make informed business decisions. This module is able to provide a wide variety of pre defined reports. Key reports tracking activity on numerous different CSPs may be generated at predefined intervals and transmitted to the client s e mail account or made available in visibility manager under password protection. Subscribers may also determine how they wish to consume reporting data which can be reported either through a reporting tool such as Cognos or in a raw. CSV format.

The overall purpose of the Activation Gateway is to provide a common XML interface which device manufacturers eTailors enterprise groups and partners can use to order telecommunications equipment and services as well as manage the lifecycle of a subscriber account and order. The API and system renders the differences in communication protocol among other features between the various CSPs irrelevant to the subscriber devices. This provides the benefit of allowing the customers to write to a single interface that enables communication with any network CSP they may want to employ. All messaging sent from and to the customer systems are in a standardized form and complex messaging and interface differences between multiple carriers are preferably abstracted away by platform . An example of this abstraction can be seen in the message to activate a device. A single standardized message may be employed to activate a device on many different communication service provider networks.

The foundation Java interfaces classes and database objects beneficial for implementing platform constitute the Core Components . Core components provide underlying functionality that builds upon a Java Enterprise Edition base. These components are preferably developed and maintained individually but are tested and pre integrated in the reference implementation. Components can be used separately or may all be deployed when a solution warrants their inclusion.

Gateway Framework The Gateway Framework is the collection of services that works in concert with the Handler Framework to receive transaction requests from customer front end systems.

Connector Framework Connectors are used to submit requests and responses from the external systems used to process transactions once these transactions have been received.

Workflow Framework Workflow is configured in a series of database tables. The Workflow is used for orchestrating the automated processing of orders.

Client Servlet Framework The Client Servlet and related classes provide a framework for the Graphical User interface. It uses XSL to format pages to the appropriate output XHTML HTML .

Dynamic Work Queue Framework Once a transaction has been received and requires manual work by customer service representatives CSR and or back office personnel it is collected into a dynamically generated work queue where CSRs can pull orders to be manually process based on their training

The Gateway Framework provides core libraries for handling incoming messaging in platform . The Gateway Framework leverages standard container security Authentication and Authorization for API communications provided by WebLogic or any other Java Enterprise container . The Gateway Framework can be implemented to support a variety of incoming message types such as XML messages CORBA requests RMI procedure calls web services or any other interoperation protocol. Specifically platform may include an XML Gateway implementation and is configured to accept and transmit XML messages over HTTPS . RosettaNet is supported as well.

The Handler Framework supports receiving and persisting orders received by platform . When a transaction is received the handler framework instantiates the correct handler for both the type of transaction and the step in the workflow then processes the transactional data received in the incoming message.

Platform can support a specific message type suitable for placing generic multi line item orders. More generally speaking there are at least two types of messages relating to external systems inbound and outbound. Inbound messages are sent from the external client system to the Gateway Manager . The purpose of an inbound message is to ask the platform to perform a certain task such as process an order. When the XML gateway receives an inbound message it holds open the connection until the message is validated against the appropriate internal XML schema. Once the platform completes its validation process and persists the message it returns a synchronous Stream Closure message to the external client indicating whether the incoming message was accepted. Outbound messages are sent from the platform back to the external client system. The purpose of an outbound message is to notify an external client of particular events such as a status update to an activation request that is being processed. Outbound messages are posted to the external client URL that was specified as part of the inbound message.

In an automated order management environment one of the major development efforts is building software components that can interact with external remote systems and services. Platform provides a rich library of existing connectors to major third party systems that can be leveraged by any customer. The connector framework provides a context for building reusable components to facilitate the delivery and maintainability of classes that connect the platform implementation to the needed external systems and services. Fundamentally a connector can provide a type of connection. Finally the connector framework makes use of the workflow framework for scheduling calls and retries to remote systems services and captures both the request and response in a database table to support a variety of tracing audit and debugging needs. The Connector Framework is designed to support both synchronous and asynchronous conversations.

The Workflow Framework provides a configurable context to orchestrate a series of steps that may be taken to complete the automated processing of transactions. The workflow is driven by the transaction s status. Developers configure the workflow by defining rows in various database tables during development cycles based on the business requirements established by business stakeholders for working and completing processing. Each time a transaction s status is updated it is evaluated within the workflow framework against the database configuration for its disposition. The disposition of an order may be defined as being the next step in the workflow.

One of the more important concepts to understand before implementing a workflow is the fundamental design of the category and status matrix. The Categories need to represent basic steps in the business process. Each Category is then associated with a variety of distinct states that indicate what has transpired for each of those steps in the business process.

The Scheduler Framework is a cluster aware scheduling engine that provides a framework for invoking tasks. The Workflow Framework primarily uses the Scheduler Framework to coordinate workflows which can occur immediately based on a state value or at a specific point in time. The Scheduler Framework also supports generic housekeeping tasks and invocation of specific tasks during start up. Scheduling is accomplished by making entries in the Workflow configuration.

The dynamic work queue DWQ may be used to locate distribute and assign the manual processing of orders across one or more call centers. As a general rule orders in the queues are orders that do not have a completed or cancelled status. Orders may qualify for queues based on latest status of the order or any criteria that can be expressed in an SQL query. When orders are being processed through the system it is possible that any order could be in multiple work queues simultaneously. DWQ provides operations management the ability to manage orders and assign work. DWQ supports both the grouping of orders and the ability to pull orders to be worked based on criteria specific to the needs of the task at hand. DWQ may be used by CSRs to pull orders for processing based on individual system permissions granted to a CSR and order SLA criteria. CSR s pull the orders from a queue to push the order to the next step in the process or to its completion. Each time a representative pulls from the queue the user locks the order. Another user will not be able to pull the same order from a queue until the order has been released. Finally DWQ gives the capability to track how long representatives work on orders and the number and types of orders processed. DWQ s are hot deployable meaning that they can be changed real time with no need to redeploy the application.

The Client Servlet provides a framework for the XML driven browser based GUI for the platform. This is a flexible framework that supports building of complex web pages. With this arrangement developers preferably produce and maintain only XSL style sheets JavaScript and generate configuration information. Documents are preferably compressed to minimize session memory and bandwidth usage. This framework preferably uses the Authentication Framework for authentication and authorization container based security. This framework preferably includes built in support for localization.

At step the subscriber device may be opened or powered on. This step prompts the activation wizard to conduct IP geo location of the device . At step wizard may conduct a query of platform to determine service availability. Upon receiving a result from the query subscriber device may select a carrier carrier may generally correspond to one of servers of and request that a list of communication products be made available for evaluation and selection. At step platform may return a list of product choices to subscriber device . Thereafter subscriber device may select desired communication services and features and a rate plan . Subscriber device may also provide account information to the wizard . After step wizard may query the subscriber device hardware to get SIM IMEI information therefor. Thereafter activation wizard may issue an activation request to platform .

Having received sufficient information from the subscriber device platform then preferably interacts with carrier back office and insurance provider to complete the activation process as described in the following steps.

Platform may conduct an account enquiry of Carrier . Thereafter an order validation step may be conducted between platform and carrier . At step insurance provider may provide insurance to platform .

Internal checks may then be conducted by platform . Thereafter additional checks may be conducted which may include but are not limited to credit check fraud check the availability of Local Number Portability LNP and or address validation. Account setup may be initiated between platform and carrier . A rate plan may then be set . An insurance notification may then be transmitted from insurance provider to platform . At step service may be activated for subscriber device . Once service is successfully activated platform may notify software wizard of the completion of successful activation.

In an embodiment RAM and or ROM may hold user data system data and or programs. I O adapter may connect storage devices such as hard drive a CD ROM not shown or other mass storage device to computing system . Communications adapter may couple computing system to a local wide area or global network . User interface adapter may couple user input devices such as keyboard scanner and or pointing device to computing system . Moreover display adapter may be driven by CPU to control the display on display device . CPU may be any general purpose CPU.

It is noted that the methods and apparatus described thus far and or described later in this document may be achieved utilizing any of the known technologies such as standard digital circuitry analog circuitry any of the known processors that are operable to execute software and or firmware programs programmable digital devices or systems programmable array logic devices or any combination of the above. One or more embodiments of the invention may also be embodied in a software program for storage in a suitable storage medium and execution by a processing unit.

When a new device is to be provisioned on the network an order may be placed to the convergence platform in one of plural states. A generic command such as Provision a New Device on X network may be sent and the convergence platform can translate that command into the appropriate interface commands for communicating with the relevant CSP. Alternatively the command from the requester may be in the form of a set of plural specific provisioning commands which are in a generic language. In this manner the same language may be used to provision new devices on any one of plural CSPs.

In still a third methodology the requester may issue individual commands in the language of the particular CSP on which the device is to be provisioned. This will allow third parties that already have requester computer systems in place for particular CSP s to continue to use them.

When the convergence platform receives a request to provision a new device it can examine the initial few commands and make a determination as to whether it must translate the one or more generic commands into a larger number of individual commands and whether any specific individual commands are in a generic language and may require translation into a specific language of a particular CSP. Alternatively if all the commands are in the specific language of the particular CSP on which the device is to be provisioned the convergence platform may simply pass them through unaltered.

Although the invention herein has been described with reference to particular embodiments it is to be understood that these embodiments are merely illustrative of the principles and applications of the present invention. It is therefore to be understood that numerous modifications may be made to the illustrative embodiments and that other arrangements may be devised without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.
