This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 based on U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 827 863 filed May 28 2013 the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

The following detailed description of example implementations refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements.

A technical computing environment TCE may include a computing environment that allows users to perform tasks related to disciplines such as but not limited to mathematics science engineering medicine business etc. more efficiently than if the tasks were performed in another type of computing environment such as an environment that required the user to develop code in a conventional programming language such as C C Fortran Pascal etc. The TCE may use an array a vector and or a matrix as basic elements.

The TCE may provide a graphical environment for modeling and simulating combinatorial and sequential decision logic based on state machines and flow charts. The decision logic may enable users to combine graphical and tabular representations including state transition diagrams flow charts state transition tables and truth tables to model how a system reacts to events time based conditions and external input signals. The graphical environment may generate models such as a textual model a graphical model with one or more model elements e.g. blocks one or more input signals and one or more output signals a combination of a textual model and a graphical model etc. The TCE may exist for creating computer generated models such as graphical behavioral models that represent dynamic systems. A model may include a plurality of graphical objects such as blocks or icons. A model may be executed to simulate the operation or behavior of the system being modeled. Executing the model may be referred to as simulating the model.

The TCE may provide a textual environment that includes a high level language and an interactive environment for numerical computation visualization and programming. The textual environment may enable users to analyze data develop algorithms create models and applications manipulate matrices plot functions and data implement algorithms create user interfaces and interface with programs written in other languages including C C Java and Fortran. Unlike the graphical environment which models how a system reacts to events and time based conditions the textual environment includes an imperative or declarative language with no concept of logical model physical and or simulation time and events.

Conventional action languages for the graphical environment e.g. Stateflow consisted of statically typed scalar based languages such as for example C C etc. are diagrams of an overview of an example implementation 100 described herein. In the example a textual environment of the TCE may be provided in a graphical environment of the TCE. Time based and event based simulation may be introduced into the language of the textual environment while maintaining the syntax and style of the language. The textual environment may have no concept of time or events without a user explicitly maintaining timers in the textual environment language. The graphical environment may enable a user to create graphical functions that include different input and output types. For example an input or an output may include a numeric type e.g. a single precision type a double precision type a signed integer type an unsigned integer type etc. a character type e.g. text strings a structure type e.g. a structure array a cell array type etc.

As shown below in the graphical environment may be enhanced so that textual code understood by the textual environment may be utilized in graphical functions. A user may leave data types of a graphical function unspecified and the graphical and textual environments may automatically generate specialized code for different combinations of input and output types of the graphical function. With reference to a user may utilize a TCE of a computing device to create a state chart. The state chart may include state block A state block B and a graphical function block. State block A may include a representation of a calculation to be performed and state block B may include a representation of a further calculation to be performed. The graphical function block may include a graphical function that is referenced in state block A and state block B.

As further shown in state block A may include textual code e.g. y function type1 understood by a textual environment of the TCE and state block B may include textual code e.g. y function type2 understood by the textual environment of the TCE. The textual code of state block A may include a function call function an output variable y and an input variable type1 with a first data type e.g. a double precision type . The textual code of state block B may include the function call function the output variable y and an input variable type2 with a second data type e.g. an unsigned integer type different than the first data type. The graphical function block may include textual code e.g. yy function uu understood by the graphical environment of the TCE. The textual code of the graphical function block may include an input variable uu and an output variable yy .

After the state chart is created or imported the user may utilize the computing device to initiate execution of the state chart. During execution of the state chart the TCE may parse the textual code of the graphical function block into the input variable uu and the output variable yy and may parse the function call into the input variables type1 and type2 and the output variable y . The TCE may process the input and output variables of the graphical function block and the input and output variables of the function call to generate code as shown in . For example the graphical environment of the TCE may process the input and output variables of the graphical function block and the textual environment of the TCE may process the input and output variables of the function call. The TCE may provide a first version of the function e.g. function with first data type type1 in a first function of the generated code and may provide a second version of the function e.g. function with second data type type2 in a second function of the generated code. The generated code may include code e.g. C code Hardware Description Language HDL code etc. that may be utilized by a physical device e.g. a robot manufacturing equipment etc. . The TCE may cause the computing device to embed the generated code in one or more physical devices.

With reference to the user may utilize the TCE to create a state chart that includes state block A and a graphical function block. State block A may include a representation of a calculation to be performed and the graphical function block may include a graphical function that is referenced in state block A. As further shown in state block A may include textual code e.g. y2 function u1 u2 understood by the textual environment of the TCE. The textual code of state block A may include a function call function a call output wildcard e.g. an output variable y2 and input variables u1 and u2 . The call output wildcard may indicate that the first output variable is optional and may be ignored. The graphical function block may include textual code e.g. yy1 yy2 function uu1 uu2 understood by the graphical environment of the TCE. The textual code of the graphical function block may include input variables uu1 and uu2 and output variables yy1 and yy2 . The graphical function block may also include a first portion associated with output variable yy1 and a second portion associated with output variable yy2.

After the state chart is created or imported the user may utilize the computing device to initiate execution of the state chart. During execution of the state chart the TCE may parse the textual code of the graphical function block into the input variables uu1 and uu2 and the output variables yy1 and yy2 and may parse the function call into the input variables u1 and u2 the call output wildcard e.g. and the output variable y2 . The TCE may process the input and output variables of the graphical function block and the input and output variables of the function call to generate code as shown in . For example the graphical environment of the TCE may process the input and output variables of the graphical function block and the textual environment of the TCE may process the input and output variables of the function call. When generating the code the TCE may ignore the first portion of the graphical function since the first portion is associated with the first output variable yy1 which may be ignored based on the call output wildcard. The TCE may provide a version of the function e.g. function with only the second portion of the graphical function in a function of the generated code as further shown in .

With reference to the user may utilize the TCE to create a state chart that includes state block A and a graphical function block. State block A may include a representation of a calculation to be performed and the graphical function block may include a graphical function that is referenced in state block A. As further shown in state block A may include textual code e.g. y1 function u1 understood by the textual environment of the TCE. The textual code of state block A may include a function call function an output variable y1 and an input variable u1 . The graphical function block may include textual code e.g. yy1 function uu1 uu2 understood by the graphical environment of the TCE. The textual code of the graphical function block may include two input variables uu1 and uu2 and an output variable yy1 .

After the state chart is created or imported the user may utilize the computing device to initiate execution of the state chart. During execution of the state chart the TCE may parse the textual code of the graphical function block into the input variables uu1 and uu2 and the output variable yy1 and may parse the function call into the input variable u1 and the output variable y1 . The TCE may process the input and output variables of the graphical function block and the input and output variables of the function call to generate code as shown in . For example the graphical environment of the TCE may process the input and output variables of the graphical function block and the textual environment of the TCE may process the input and output variables of the function call. When generating the code the TCE may ignore the second input variable uu2 of the graphical function block since the function call only includes one input variable u1 . The TCE may provide a version of the function e.g. function with only the first input variable uu1 of the graphical function in a function of the generated code as further shown in .

Such an arrangement may provide a user of a TCE with flexibility in defining input and output variables associated with functions and or function calls. This may provide the user with tools to create a variety of state charts and or models that include the language of the textual environment.

Client device may include a device capable of receiving generating storing processing executing and or providing information in a manner described herein. For example client device may include a computing device such as a desktop computer a laptop computer a tablet computer a handheld computer a server a mobile phone e.g. a smart phone a radiotelephone etc. or a similar device. In some implementations client device may receive information from and or transmit information to server device .

TCE may be provided within a computer readable medium of client device . Alternatively or additionally TCE may be provided in another device e.g. server device that is accessible by client device . TCE may include hardware or a combination of hardware and software that provides a computing environment that allows users to perform tasks related to disciplines such as but not limited to mathematics science engineering medicine business etc. more efficiently than if the tasks were performed in another type of computing environment such as an environment that required the user to develop code in a conventional programming language such as C C Fortran Pascal etc. In some implementations TCE may include a dynamically typed programming language e.g. the M language a MATLAB language a MATLAB compatible language a MATLAB like language etc. that can be used to express problems and or solutions in mathematical notations. A model may be declarative in that the model may not allow the user to explicitly specify when a state of a machine that the model is executing on changes. In a declarative model the user may not explicitly specify an order in which state changes in the model. In an imperative model the user may explicitly specify when a particular state may change e.g. relative to other state changes .

For example TCE may use an array as a basic element where the array may not require dimensioning. These arrays may be used to support array based programming where an operation may apply to an entire set of values included in the arrays. Array based programming may allow array based operations to be treated as high level programming that may allow for example operations to be performed on entire aggregations of data without having to resort to explicit loops of individual non array operations. In addition TCE may be adapted to perform matrix and or vector formulations that can be used for data analysis data visualization application development simulation modeling algorithm development etc. These matrix and or vector formulations may be used in many areas such as statistics image processing signal processing control design life sciences modeling discrete event analysis and or design state based analysis and or design etc.

TCE may further provide mathematical functions and or graphical tools e.g. for creating plots surfaces images volumetric representations etc. . In some implementations TCE may provide these functions and or tools using toolboxes e.g. toolboxes for signal processing image processing data plotting parallel processing etc. . In some implementations TCE may provide these functions as block sets or in another way such as via a library etc.

TCE may be implemented as a text based environment e.g. MATLAB software Octave Python JavaScript Comsol Script MATRIXx from National Instruments Mathematica from Wolfram Research Inc. Mathcad from Mathsoft Engineering Education Inc. Maple from Maplesoft Extend from Imagine That Inc. Scilab from The French Institution for Research in Computer Science and Control INRIA Virtuoso from Cadence Modelica or Dymola from Dassault Systemes etc. and a graphically based environment e.g. Simulink software Stateflow software SimEvents software Simscape software etc. by The MathWorks Inc. VisSim by Visual Solutions LabView by National Instruments Dymola by Dassault Systemes SoftWIRE by Measurement Computing WiT by DALSA Coreco VEE Pro or SystemVue by Agilent Vision Program Manager from PPT Vision Khoros from Khoral Research Gedae by Gedae Inc. Scicos from INRIA Virtuoso from Cadence Rational Rose from IBM Rhapsody or Tau from Telelogic Ptolemy from the University of California at Berkeley aspects of a Unified Modeling Language UML or SysML environment etc. . In some implementations TCE may include a hybrid environment that includes one or more of the above referenced text based environments and one or more of the above referenced graphically based environments.

TCE may include a programming language e.g. the MATLAB language that may be used to express problems and or solutions in mathematical notations. The programming language may be dynamically typed and or array based. In a dynamically typed array based computing language data may be contained in arrays and data types of the data may be determined e.g. assigned at program execution time.

For example suppose a program written in a dynamically typed array based computing language includes the following statements 

Now suppose the program is executed for example in a TCE such as TCE . During run time when the statement A hello is executed the data type of variable A may be a string data type. Later when the statement A int32 1 2 is executed the data type of variable A may be a 1 by 2 array containing elements whose data type are 32 bit integers. Later when the statement A 1.1 2.2 3.3 is executed since the language is dynamically typed the data type of variable A may be changed from the above 1 by 2 array to a 1 by 3 array containing elements whose data types are floating point. As can be seen by this example data in a program written in a dynamically typed array based computing language may be contained in an array. Moreover the data type of the data may be determined during execution of the program. Thus in a dynamically type array based computing language data may be represented by arrays and data types of data may be determined at run time.

TCE may provide mathematical routines and a high level programming language suitable for non professional programmers and may provide graphical tools that may be used for creating plots surfaces images volumetric representations or other representations. TCE may provide these routines and or tools using toolboxes e.g. toolboxes for signal processing image processing data plotting parallel processing etc. . TCE may also provide these routines in other ways such as for example via a library local or remote database e.g. a database operating in a computing cloud remote procedure calls RPCs and or an application programming interface API . TCE may be configured to improve runtime performance when performing computing operations. For example TCE may include a just in time JIT compiler.

In some implementations TCE may provide a graphical environment for modeling and simulating combinatorial and sequential decision logic based on state machines and flow charts. The decision logic may enable users to combine graphical and tabular representations including state transition diagrams flow charts state transition tables and truth tables to model how a system reacts to events time based conditions and external input signals. The graphical environment may generate models such as a textual model a graphical model with one or more model elements e.g. blocks one or more input signals and one or more output signals a combination of a textual model and a graphical model etc.

In some implementations TCE may provide a textual environment that includes a high level language and an interactive environment for numerical computation visualization and programming. The textual environment may enable users to analyze data develop algorithms create models and applications manipulate matrices plot functions and data implement algorithms create user interfaces and interface with programs written in other languages including C C Java and Fortran. Unlike the graphical environment which models how a system reacts to events and time based conditions the textual environment may include an assignment based imperative language with no concept of logical model physical and or simulation time and events.

In some implementations and as further shown in TCE may include a parser a transformer a graphical engine and a textual engine .

In practice device may include additional components fewer components different components or differently arranged components than those shown in . Additionally or alternatively one or more components of device may perform one or more functions described as being performed by another one or more components of device .

As shown in process may include receiving a chart with a textual portion and a graphical portion block . For example TCE may enable a user of client device to create a model or to instruct client device to receive the model from another source e.g. server device a CD ROM a flash memory etc. . In some implementations the model may include a chart with a graphical hierarchy of one or more chart elements e.g. areas or regions associated with one or more states referred to herein as state blocks one or more input signals and one or more output signals. For example assume that a chart has state blocks A B and C and that state block A includes state block B and a transition to state block C. An arrangement that includes a state block containing one or more state blocks and or transitions to one or more state blocks may be referred to as a graphical hierarchy. Each of the chart elements may correspond to a status of a physical device a subsystem a model etc. of a system being modeled e.g. chart elements may behavioral so that a state may correspond to a status of a device a subsystem etc. .

In some implementations the chart may include graphical symbols transitions and or state transitions associated with the state blocks of the chart. The graphical symbols may include for example textual information that provides event based conditions time based conditions invariants etc. to the state blocks transitions junctions etc. In some implementations one or more of the state blocks transitions and or state transitions may include textual code that may be understood and processed by textual engine of TCE . The textual code may include for example one or more functions matrices data etc. that may be understood and processed by textual engine .

In some implementations TCE may cause client device to display a user interface so that the user may create and or view the model and the chart. For example the user may utilize the user interface to create the state blocks for the chart and to connect the state blocks together. The user may associate the graphical symbols with the state blocks and or other elements of the chart e.g. transitions state transitions junctions etc. and may add the textual code in the one or more state blocks. The user may utilize the user interface to provide the chart within the model.

As further shown in process may include parsing the chart into a textual portion and a graphical portion block . For example parser of TCE may receive information associated with the chart and may identify based on the information a portion of the chart that may be understood and processed by textual engine e.g. a textual portion and a portion of the chart that may be understood and processed by graphical engine e.g. a graphical portion . In some implementations parser may have access to a data structure e.g. a database that stores syntax associated with the language of the textual environment of TCE e.g. and understood by textual engine . Parser may compare the chart information with the syntax stored in the data structure and may determine that particular portions of the chart information match the syntax. Parser may designate the matching portions of the chart information as the textual portion. For example parser may designate functions arrays matrices algorithms etc. in the chart as the textual portion.

In some implementations parser may have access to a data structure e.g. a database that stores information associated with the graphical environment of TCE e.g. and understood by graphical engine . Parser may compare the chart information with information stored in the data structure and may determine that particular portions of the chart information match the information in the data structure. Parser may designate the matching portions of the chart information as the graphical portion. For example parser may designate time based conditions event based conditions other conditions hierarchy information etc. as the graphical portion.

As further shown in for the textual portion block TEXTUAL PORTION process may include processing the textual portion with the textual engine to generate textual results block . For example parser may provide the textual portion of the chart to textual engine and textual engine may process the textual portion of the chart to generate textual results. In some implementations textual engine may execute the textual portion of the chart to generate the textual results. For example assume that the textual portion of the chart includes a function for performing matrix calculations on data. In such an example textual engine may execute the function so that the matrix calculations are performed on the data. The matrix resulting from the calculations may be referred to as textual results. In another example assume that the textual portion of the chart includes an algorithm for performing data analysis. In this example textual engine may execute the algorithm so that the data analysis is performed. The results of the data analysis may be referred to as textual results.

As further shown in for the graphical portion block GRAPHICAL PORTION process may include transforming if necessary the graphical portion into a form understood by the graphical engine block . For example parser may determine whether any of the graphical portion of the chart will not be understood by graphical engine . In some implementations parser may identify text in the graphical portion that may not be understood by graphical engine . For example assume that the graphical portion includes the text before abs a eig b 1 10 1 10 sec and that graphical engine does not understand the text since graphical engine needs to calculate a time to execute the text. In this example parser may provide the text to transformer and transformer may transform the text into a form understood by graphical engine . For example transformer may transform the text to utilize counters maintained by the graphical environment e.g. Simulink so that a time e.g. one second two seconds etc. may be calculated by graphical engine . In some implementations transformer may provide the transformed text to graphical engine for processing. In some implementations the text provided in the graphical portion may include textual operations e.g. after abs a eig b 1 10 1 10 sec that are understood by the textual environment such as for example TCE operations.

In some implementations parser may provide the remaining graphical portion e.g. which may be understood by graphical engine directly to graphical engine . In some implementations parser may determine that all of the graphical portion may be understood by graphical engine . In such a situation parser may provide the entire graphical portion to graphical engine and transformer may not be utilized.

As further shown in for the graphical portion block GRAPHICAL PORTION process may include processing the graphical portion with the graphical engine to generate graphical results block . For example parser may provide to graphical engine the graphical portion of the chart that is understood by graphical engine . Transformer may provide to graphical engine any of the graphical portion that has been transformed into a form that is understood by graphical engine . Graphical engine may process the graphical portion of the chart to generate graphical results. In some implementations graphical engine may execute the graphical portion of the chart to generate the graphical results. For example assume that the graphical portion of the chart includes instructions to combine graphical and tabular representations. In such an example graphical engine may execute the instructions so that the graphical and tabular representations are combined. The resulting combination may be referred to as graphical results. In another example assume that the graphical portion of the chart includes an event based condition e.g. transition to state block A when a function is calculated . In this example graphical engine may execute the event based condition so that state block A is transitioned to. The results of the execution of the event based condition may be referred to as graphical results. In some implementations graphical engine may execute textual information.

As further shown in process may include combining the textual results with the graphical results to generate chart results block . For example TCE may combine the textual results generated by textual engine with the graphical results generated by graphical engine to generate chart results. In some implementations the chart results may include results associated with execution of the chart. For example assume that the textual results include a calculation of a function bar and that the graphical results include utilizing the calculation when a state block B is transitioned to. In such an example the chart results may include transitioning to state block B and utilizing the calculation of the function bar. In another example assume that the textual results include performing a matrix calculation and that the graphical results include computing the time period based on the array based computations. In such an example the chart results may include determining when the time period has expired and utilizing the matrix calculation after the time period has expired and or utilizing the matrix calculation to determine the time period. In some implementations the chart may model reactive systems via state machines and flow charts within a model. In some implementations the chart may use a variant of a finite state machine notation which may enable representation of hierarchy parallelism event broadcast and or history within the chart. In some implementations the chart may provide state transition tables and or truth tables. In some implementations the chart may represent discrete modes of a system by a state may control how a system responds to faults and failures within the system and may schedule when specific tasks occur e.g. either within the chart or within an overall model .

As further shown in process may include utilizing the chart results to execute the model and generate model results block . For example TCE may utilize the chart results in the model e.g. during execution of the model to generate model results. In some implementations the model results may include results associated with execution of the model based on the chart results. For example assume that the chart results include transitioning to state block B and utilizing a calculation of a function bar. After state block B is transitioned to and the function bar is calculated TCE may utilize the function calculation in the model to generate the model results. In another example assume that the chart results include determining when a time period has expired and utilizing the computations to determine the time period. After the matrix calculation is performed TCE may utilize the matrix calculation in the model to generate the model results and or to determine the time period.

Although shows example blocks of process in some implementations process may include additional blocks fewer blocks different blocks or differently arranged blocks than those depicted in . Additionally or alternatively two or more of the blocks of process may be performed in parallel.

The sine wave block may include a representation of a sine wave that is to be displayed by the scope block. In example assume that the sine wave block provides a chart in signal e.g. a sine wave signal to the chart block. The chart block may include a representation of a chart that processes the sine wave signal so that it may be understood by the scope block. The chart block may include a graphical portion and a textual portion. The chart block may receive the chart in signal and may process the chart in signal to produce a chart out signal e.g. a voltage time signal to be displayed by the scope block . The chart block may provide the chart out signal to the scope block. The scope block may include a representation of an oscilloscope that displays constantly varying signal voltages as a function of time. The scope block may receive the chart out signal and may display the signal e.g. a voltage time signal . In some implementations the chart block may include a chart that may be executed based on different execution semantics provided by a user and or inferred from the model. The execution semantics may include dynamic notions associated with continuous time for example computing the time derivatives of a dynamic system based on matrix calculations etc. In some implementations the chart may be provided in an environment that includes multiple domains.

As further shown in TCE may instruct client device to display an option to execute the model. For example user interface may display a window or some other display mechanism that requests whether the user wants to execute the model. If the user elects to execute the model e.g. via selection of a Yes button with a mouse or other selection mechanism TCE may execute the model. In some implementations the user may select a Play button with the mouse and TCE may execute the model. In order to execute the model assume that TCE needs to execute the chart block as shown in a user interface of . In some implementations the model may include computational semantics associated with graphical and textual elements and may include computational semantics associated with various blocks in the model. In some implementations TCE may debug the model before or during execution of the model or generation of code.

As shown in user interface the chart may include a graphical hierarchy of state blocks A B C and D. The graphical hierarchy may include the arrangement of the state blocks in the chart. For example state block A may be transitioned to first state block B may be transitioned to second state block C may be transitioned to third and state block D may be transitioned to last. The state blocks may include state information provided by graphical symbols. For example state block A may include the graphical symbols en a data 3 and du u buffer chart in u buffer 1 end 1 e.g. which may be parsed by graphical engine into a portion du that may be understood by graphical engine and another portion u buffer chart in u buffer 1 end 1 that may be understood by textual engine state block B may include the graphical symbols en chart out a data state block C may include the graphical symbols en foo and state block D may include the graphical symbols en chart out data. Some or all of the graphical hierarchy state blocks A B C and D and the graphical symbols may be understood by graphical engine . State block A may also include textual code e.g. a function foo that may be understood by textual engine . In some implementations the textual code may include text for a function e.g. foo bar etc. text for a matrix e.g. C 1 2 3 array based text dynamically typed text dynamic assignments script or function name spaces etc. e.g. text that ignores certain output arguments a function with logic that involves a caller s number of output arguments fixed point quantities that use integer containers to specify approximate floating point values . In some implementations graphical engine may execute graphical code and textual code e.g. C code but may not execute dynamically typed and or array based code. In some implementations textual engine may execute the dynamically typed array based code.

As further shown in when the chart wakes up the default transitions of the chart may be executed. For example an action in a default transition e.g. data 4 u buffer zeros 128 1 may be executed and state block A may be marked as active. Graphical symbols of state block A e.g. an entry action en a data 3 may be executed and default transitions inside state block A may be executed to establish an active child of state block A e.g. mark state block B as active . Graphical symbols of state block B e.g. an entry action en chart out a data may be executed and the chart execution may be complete e.g. the chart may go to sleep since no child states remain. When the chart sleeps state blocks A and B may be active. A next time the chart wakes up graphical symbols of state block A e.g. the during action du u buffer chart in u buffer 1 end 1 may be executed since there are no direct outer transitions of state block A. Outer transitions of state block B may be checked and since there is no condition the transition to state block C may be assumed to be true. Therefore the chart may transition from state block B to state block C. State block C may become active and state block A may remain active. The chart may keep waking up according to solver settings and or system dynamics and may wake up many times or a few times. Every time the chart wakes up the outer transitions of all active state blocks may be checked for example in a top down manner. If an outer transition of a particular state block is not true a during action of the particular state block may be executed. Otherwise a transition may occur to a next state block. This may result in one or more executions of the during action of state block A e.g. du u buffer chart in u buffer 1 end 1 .

At some point the chart may wake up with a condition specified in an outer transition of state block C e.g. after 3 sec being true after state block C is first entered. When this condition is true a transition from state block C may occur. State block C may be marked as inactive when state block C is exited. State block A may be marked as inactive since the outer transition of state block C e.g. after 3 sec leaves a graphical boundary of state block A. State block C may transition to state block D and state block D may be marked as active. At this time only state block D may be active in the chart. Graphical symbols of state block D e.g. an entry action en chart out data may be executed at this time.

As further shown in TCE may instruct client device to display an option to execute the chart or may automatically execute the chart when the model is executed. For example user interface may display a window or some other display mechanism that requests whether the user wants to execute the chart. If the user elects to execute the chart e.g. via selection of a Yes button with a mouse or other selection mechanism TCE may execute the chart to generate chart information as further shown in . Chart information may include information associated with the graphical hierarchy state blocks A B C and D the graphical symbols the textual code and or execution of the graphical hierarchy state blocks A B C and D the graphical symbols and or the textual code. In some implementations the chart may be executed based on conditions in a model e.g. a time based block diagram model . For example if a temperature in a model of an HVAC system exceeds a certain value e.g. at a particular time a status of a heater device may change from on to off.

In some implementations TCE may begin searching at a lowest level of the graphical hierarchy for data and or a function and move up the graphical hierarchy level by level until the data function is found. In some implementations TCE may include a global or logical workspace that may be searched first or last for example for data and or a function. In some implementations TCE may execute the chart by executing one or more transitions by executing in microsteps by executing all events and actions at a hierarchical level etc. Each microstep may result in a set of transitions that result in a stable state configuration e.g. the result of one state chart execution . A state machine may continue to execute microsteps until no state transitions are possible from a current state configuration.

As shown in assume that TCE provides chart information to parser . For example TCE may provide to parser the information associated with the graphical hierarchy and the state of the chart e.g. the hierarchy and active state information of state blocks A B C and D the information associated with the graphical symbols e.g. chart out data after 3 sec etc. the information associated with the textual code e.g. the function foo and or the execution of the graphical hierarchy state blocks A B C and D the graphical symbols and or the textual code. Parser may parse chart information into information associated with graphical symbols that are not understood by graphical engine information associated with the graphical hierarchy and state blocks A B C and D and information associated with the textual code.

Information may not be generated if all of the graphical symbols in chart information are understood by graphical engine . In such a situation parser may provide information associated with the graphical symbols directly to graphical engine . In one example information may include the text after 3 sec or after abs a eig b 1 10 1 10 sec which may not be understood by graphical engine since graphical engine does not understand TCE language syntax e.g. abs a eig b . In this example parser may provide the text to transformer and transformer may transform the text into a form understood by graphical engine e.g. transformed graphical symbols as shown in . For example transformer may transform the text to utilize counters maintained by the graphical environment e.g. Simulink so that a time e.g. one second two seconds etc. may be calculated by graphical engine . Information associated with the graphical hierarchy and state blocks A B C and D may include for example the hierarchy and state information of state blocks A B C and D information identifying that state A is a parent state for state B etc. Information associated with the textual code may include for example information associated with the function foo.

As shown in graphical engine may receive information associated with graphical symbols e.g. chart out a data transformed graphical symbols e.g. counters information associated with the graphical hierarchy and state e.g. the hierarchy and state information of state blocks A B C and D and information associated with the textual code e.g. the functions foo abs eig A 

Graphical engine may provide information associated with textual code to textual engine . Textual engine may process information to generate textual results . In example assume that textual results include numerical results from executing the textual code e.g. the function foo and or an intermediate representation IR from compiling the textual code. Textual engine may provide textual results to graphical engine . Graphical engine may process information transformed graphical symbols information and textual results to generate chart results . In example assume that chart results include the calculations performed by one or more of state blocks A B C and or D numerical results from executing the textual code e.g. the function foo and or an intermediate representation IR from compiling the textual code.

After one or more portions of the chart are executed and chart results are generated TCE may utilize chart results to execute the model. For example as described above in connection with the chart may wake up and execute one or more of state blocks A B C and D. In some implementations the chart may execute one or more portions of a model and or the model may execute one or more portions of the chart. As shown in TCE may cause client device to display a user interface that includes the executed model. As shown in user interface the chart block may receive an input signal e.g. a sine wave from the sine wave block and may output a voltage time signal based on the input signal to the scope block. As further shown the voltage time signal may correspond to the calculations performed by state blocks A B C and or D and or the calculation of the function foo.

As indicated above are provided merely as an example. Other examples are possible and may differ from what was described with regard to .

As shown in process may include receiving a TCE state chart with a function and function call to the function block . For example TCE may cause client device to display a user interface to a user of client device . The user interface may include mechanisms e.g. menus buttons icons libraries etc. that enable the user to create a state chart for TCE . In some implementations the user may wish to create a state chart with one or more chart elements e.g. state blocks one or more input signals and one or more output signals. Each of the state chart elements may be associated with a state of a physical device a subsystem another model etc. of a system being modeled.

In some implementations the user of client device may utilize TCE to import the state chart into TCE from memory e.g. memory or storage component of client device . In some implementations the user of client device may utilize TCE to import the state chart into TCE from another source such as for example server device or an external memory device e.g. a CD ROM a flash memory etc. .

In some implementations the state chart may include at least one state block and at least one function block. The state block may include textual code e.g. a function call that is understood by graphical engine and or textual engine of TCE . The function call may call a function provided in the function block of the state chart. The function call may include one or more call input variables and one or more call output variables. The function block may include textual code e.g. the function that is understood by graphical engine and or textual engine of TCE . The function may include one or more function input variables and one or more function output variables.

As further shown in process may include initiating execution of the TCE state chart block . For example the user may instruct TCE to execute the state chart and TCE may initiate execution of the state chart based on the user s instruction. In some implementations TCE may initiate execution of the state chart when the user inputs a command or selects a display mechanism e.g. a button a menu item etc. that instructs TCE to execute the state chart. For example TCE may cause client device to display an Execution button in the user interface. When the user selects the Execution button the selection may cause TCE to initiate execution of the state chart. In another example TCE may cause client device to display a command window in the user interface. The user may enter a command e.g. execute state chart in the command window and TCE may initiate execution of the state chart based on the entered command. In some implementations the state chart may be an element in a larger model or another state chart and execution of the model may initiate execution of the state chart. In some implementations the state chart may be executed based on for example an asynchronous call a sample time hit a zero crossing etc.

As further shown in process may include parsing the function into function input s and or function output s block . For example parser or graphical engine of TCE may receive chart information associated with the state chart. In some implementations the chart information may include information associated with state blocks sections of the state blocks textual code of the state blocks etc. provided in the state chart. TCE may identify based on the chart information a portion of the state chart that may be understood and processed by graphical engine e.g. the function input variable s and or output variable s and a portion of the state chart that may be understood and processed by textual engine e.g. the call input variable s and or output variable s .

In some implementations parser or graphical engine may have access to a data structure e.g. a database that stores information associated with the graphical environment of TCE e.g. and understood by graphical engine . Parser or graphical engine may compare the chart information with information stored in the data structure and may determine that particular portions of the chart information match the information in the data structure. Parser or graphical engine may designate the matching portions of the chart information as a graphical portion. For example parser or graphical engine may designate the function input variable s and or the function output variable s as the graphical portion. Parser may provide the function input variable s and or the function output variable s to graphical engine .

As further shown in process may include parsing the function call into call input s and or call output s block . For example parser or graphical engine may have access to a data structure e.g. a database that stores syntax associated with the language of the textual environment of TCE e.g. and understood by textual engine . Parser or graphical engine may compare the chart information with the syntax stored in the data structure and may determine that particular portions of the chart information match the syntax. Parser or graphical engine may designate the matching portions of the chart information as a textual portion. For example parser or graphical engine may designate the call input variable s and or the call output variable s as the textual portion. Parser or graphical engine may provide the call input variable s and or the call output variable s to textual engine .

As further shown in process may include processing the function input s output s and the call input s output s block . For example graphical engine may process the function input variable s and or the function output variable s . In some implementations textual engine may process the call input variable s and or the call output variable s . In some implementations based on the processing by graphical engine and textual engine TCE may determine that the function is called two or more times e.g. by the function call with different data types for the call input variable s and or the call output variable s . For example assume that a function fun is called three times by a function call with three call input variables. A first call input variable x x8 may include an unsigned integer data type a second call input variable x double may include a double precision data type and a third call input variable x single may include a single precision data type. In this example TCE may determine that function fun is called three times with three different data types e.g. an unsigned integer data type a double precision data type and a single precision data type for the call input variables.

In some implementations based on the processing by graphical engine and textual engine TCE may determine that at least one call output variable of the function call includes a call output wildcard. For example assume that a function fun includes two function output variables xx1 and xx2 and that a function call includes a call output wildcard e.g. or some other alphabetical numeric or alphanumeric character or characters and a call output variable x2. In this example TCE may determine that at least one call output variable of the function call to function fun includes the call output wildcard.

In some implementations based on the processing by graphical engine and textual engine TCE may determine that a number of function input variables is greater than a number of call input variables and or may determine that a number of function output variables is greater than a number of call output variables. For example assume that a function fun includes two function input variables xx1 and xx2 and one function output variable yy1. Further assume that a function call to function fun includes one call input variable x1 and one call output variable y1. In this example TCE may determine that the number e.g. two of function input variables is greater than the number e.g. one of call input variables and that the number e.g. one of function output variables is equal to the number e.g. one of call output variables.

As further shown in if the function is called two or more times with different data types for the call input s and or the call output s block DIFFERENT DATA TYPES process may include generating code for the state chart that includes a method for each different data type block . For example if TCE determines that the function is called two or more times e.g. by the function call with different data types for the call input variable s and or the call output variable s TCE may generate code for the state chart that includes a call e.g. a procedure a method a function etc. in different programming paradigms for each of the different data types.

In some implementations assume that a function fun is called three times by a function call with three call input variables. A first call input variable x x8 may include an unsigned integer data type a second call input variable x double may include a double precision data type and a third call input variable x single may include a single precision data type. In this example TCE may generate code that includes a first function a second function and a third function. The first function may include function fun implemented with first call input variable x x8. The second function may include function fun implemented with second call input variable x double. The third function may include function fun implemented with third call input variable x single. In some implementations the generated code may include code e.g. C code C code HDL code Java Javascript Python an intermediate representation for another compile such as LLVM machine code assemble etc. that may be utilized by a physical device e.g. a robot manufacturing equipment etc. .

As further shown in if at least one call output of the function call includes a call output wildcard block CALL OUTPUT WILDCARD process may include generating code for the state chart that includes a function with particular function output s based on the call output wildcard block . For example if TCE determines that at least one call output variable of the function call includes a call output wildcard TCE may generate code for the state chart and based on the call output wildcard that includes a function with particular function output variable s .

In some implementations assume that a function fun includes two function output variables xx1 and xx2 e.g. fun xx1 xx2 fun and that a function call callbar includes a call output wildcard and a call output variable x2 e.g. x2 fun . In this example TCE may generate code that includes a function. The function may include function fun implemented with only function output variable xx2. TCE may ignore function output variable xx1 since the call output wildcard corresponds with function output variable xx1 and may not implement function output variable xx1 in the function. In some implementations the function call may include two or more output wildcards and TCE may ignore function output variables that correspond to the two or more output wildcards. In some implementations the function call may include one or more input wildcards and TCE may ignore function input variables that correspond to the one or more input wildcards.

As further shown in if a number of function input s is greater than a number of call input s block FUNCTION INPUT S CALL INPUT S process may include generating code for the state chart that includes a method with the number of function input s being equal to the number of call input s block . For example if TCE determines that a number of function input variables is greater than a number of call input variables TCE may generate code for the state chart that includes a function with the number of function input variables being equal to the number of call input variables.

In some implementations assume that a function fun includes two function input variables xx1 and xx2 and one function output variable yy1 e.g. yy1 fun xx1 xx2 . Further assume that a function call to function fun includes one call input variable x1 and one call output variable y1 e.g. y1 fun x1 . In this example TCE may generate code that includes a function. The function may include function fun implemented with only function input variable xx1. TCE may ignore function input variable xx2 since the function call only includes call input variable x1 that corresponds with function input variable xx1 and may not implement function input variable xx2 in the function. In some implementations a number of call input variables may be greater than a number of function input variables and TCE may match call input output variables and function input output variables based on a predetermined parameter e.g. by name . In such implementations textual engine may utilize default values e.g. provided by the user or automatically generated for inputs that are not provided may analyze the function to determine whether there is a well defined behavior with a single input may generate an error message based on lazy evaluation may request user input dynamically at execution time etc.

In some implementations if TCE determines that a number of function output variables is greater than a number of call output variables TCE may generate code for the state chart that includes a function with the number of function output variables being equal to the number of call output variables. For example assume that a function fun includes one function input variable xx1 and two function output variables yy1 and yy2 e.g. yy1 fun xx1 and yy2 fun xx1 . Further assume that a function call to function fun includes one call input variable x1 and one call output variable y1 e.g. y1 fun x1 . In this example TCE may generate code that includes a function. The function may include function fun implemented with only function output variable yy1. TCE may ignore function output variable yy2 since the function call includes only call output variable y1 that corresponds with function output variable yy1 and may not implement function output variable yy2 in the function.

In some implementations a user may specify additional function input variables in a function. For example the user may create a function fun with the syntax yy1 fun uu1 uu2 additional where additional may correspond to additional function input variables. This may enable the user to specify an arbitrary number of call input variables in a function call. For example the user may create a function call with the syntax y1 fun u1 u2 u3 u4 u5 where u1 through u5 may correspond to call input variables. In this example TCE may correlate call input variable u3 with function input variable additional1 may correlate call input variable u4 with function input variable additional2 and may correlate call input variable u5 with function input variable additional3. Such an arrangement may provide flexibility into how many call input variables are included in the function call.

As further shown in if the function is called with the same data types for the call input s and or the call output s if the call output s do not include a call output wildcard and if a number of function input s equals a number of call input s block SAME DATA TYPES NO CALL OUTPUT WILDCARD FUNCTION INPUT S CALL INPUT S process may include generating code for the state chart that includes a function that correlates the function with the function call block . For example if TCE determines that the function is called e.g. by the function call with the same data types for the call input variable s and or the call output variable s determines that no call output variables of the function call include a call output wildcard and determines that a number of function input variables is equal to a number of call input variables TCE may generate code for the state chart that includes a function correlating the function with the function call.

In some implementations TCE may cause client device to provide the generated code for display to the user. In some implementations TCE may cause client device to store the generated code in memory e.g. memory storage component etc. associated with client device and or server device . In some implementations TCE may cause client device to embed the generated code in a physical device e.g. a robot manufacturing equipment etc. so that the physical device may operate based on the generated code.

Although shows example blocks of process in some implementations process may include additional blocks fewer blocks different blocks or differently arranged blocks than those depicted in . Additionally or alternatively two or more of the blocks of process may be performed in parallel.

In example assume that the user utilizes TCE to create the state chart or to import the state chart into TCE and the model. For example the user may select the state chart block of the model in user interface and TCE may display a user interface that enables the user to create the elements of the state chart as shown in . As shown TCE may cause client device to display the state chart as the user creates the state chart or after the user imports the state chart. In example assume that the state chart includes a first state block e.g. state block A a second state block e.g. state block B and a function block. State block A may include a representation of calculations to be performed. As further shown in state block A may include a first function call to a function foo e.g. y u8 foo u u8 with a first call input u u8 and a first call output y u8 . The first function call the first call input and the first call output may be understood by textual engine of TCE . State block B may include a second function call to function foo e.g. y u8 foo u u8 with a second call input u double and a second call output y double . The second function call the second call input and the second call output may be understood by textual engine of TCE . In example assume that first call input u u8 includes an unsigned integer data type and that second call input u double includes a double precision data type.

The function block may include a graphical function e.g. yy foo uu with a function input uu and a function output yy . The graphical function may include paths for calculating yy such as for example a first path e.g. yy uu when uu is greater than zero and a second path e.g. yy uu 3 when uu is less than or equal to zero. The graphical function the function input and the function output may be understood by graphical engine of TCE .

After creating or importing the state chart assume that the user instructs TCE to execute the model by entering an execute model command or by selecting an execute model button as shown in . TCE may execute the model and the state chart based on the user s instruction. When the state chart is executed by TCE state block A may execute first function call y u8 foo u u8 which may cause the graphical function block to execute with first function input u u8 and first function output y u8. State block B may execute second function call y double foo u double which may cause the graphical function block to execute with second function input u double and second function output y double.

As shown in when executing the state chart TCE may provide chart information to parser of TCE . The chart information may include for example information associated with the arrangement of state blocks A and B information associated with the first function call e.g. y u8 foo u u8 information associated with the second function call e.g. y double foo u double information associated with the graphical function e.g. yy foo uu etc. Parser may divide the chart information into a function portion and a function call portion. In example assume that the function portion includes the syntax foo yy and uu and that the function call portion includes the syntax foo y u8 u u8 y double and u double.

As further shown in parser may provide the function portion to graphical engine and graphical engine may process the function portion to generate function based code for generated code . Generated code may include code that may be utilized by a physical device. Parser may provide the function call portion to textual engine and textual engine may process the function call portion to generate function call based code for generated code . In example TCE may utilize the function based code and the function call based code to provide a first version of the graphical function e.g. foo with the unsigned integer data type u u8 in a first function of generated code . TCE may utilize the function based code and the function call based code to provide a second version of the graphical function e.g. foo with the double precision data type u double in a second function of generated code . TCE may cause client device to display generated code to the user to store generated code and or to embed generated code in one or more physical devices.

In example now assume that the user utilizes TCE to create another state chart or to import the state chart into TCE and the model. For example the user may select the state chart block of the model in user interface and TCE may display a user interface that enables the user to create the elements of the state chart as shown in . As shown TCE may cause client device to display the state chart as the user creates the state chart or after the user imports the state chart. In example assume that the state chart includes a state block e.g. state block A and a function block. State block A may include a representation of calculations to be performed. As further shown in state block A may include a function call to a function bar e.g. y2 bar u1 u2 with call inputs u1 and u2 a call output wildcard e.g. a first call output and a second call output y2 . The function call the call inputs the call output wildcard and the second call output may be understood by textual engine of TCE . In example assume that placement of the call output wildcard indicates that the first call output is optional and may be ignored.

The function block may include a graphical function e.g. yy1 yy2 bar uu1 uu2 with function inputs uu1 and uu2 and function outputs yy1 and yy2 . The graphical function may include a first portion with paths for calculating yy1 such as for example a first path e.g. yy1 uu1 when uu1 is greater than zero and a second path e.g. yy1 uu1 3 when uu1 is less than or equal to zero. The graphical function may include a second portion with paths for calculating yy2 such as for example a first path e.g. yy2 uu2 when uu2 is greater than ten and a second path e.g. yy2 uu2 3 when uu2 is less than or equal to ten. The graphical function the function inputs and the function outputs may be understood by graphical engine of TCE . In example assume that placement of the call output wildcard indicates that the first portion of the graphical function may be ignored.

After creating or importing the state chart assume that the user instructs TCE to execute the model by entering an execute model command or by selecting an execute model button as shown in . TCE may execute the model and the state chart based on the user s instruction. When the state chart is executed by TCE state block A may execute the function call y2 bar u1 u2 which may cause the graphical function block to execute the second portion with function input uu2 and function output yy2.

As shown in when executing the state chart TCE may provide chart information to parser of TCE . The chart information may include for example information associated with the arrangement of state block A information associated with the function call e.g. y2 bar u1 u2 information associated with the graphical function e.g. yy1 yy2 bar uu1 uu2 etc. Parser may divide the chart information into a function portion and a function call portion. In example assume that the function portion includes the syntax bar yy1 yy2 uu1 and uu2 and that the function call portion includes the syntax bar y2 u1 and u2.

As further shown in parser may provide the function portion to graphical engine and graphical engine may process the function portion to generate function based code for generated code . Generated code may include code that may be utilized by a physical device. Parser may provide the function call portion to textual engine and textual engine may process the function call portion to generate function call based code for generated code . TCE may ignore the first portion of the graphical function since the first portion is associated with the first output variable yy1 which may be ignored based on the location of the call output wildcard in the function call. In example TCE may utilize the function based code and the function call based code to provide a version of the graphical function e.g. bar with only the second portion of the graphical function in a function of generated code . TCE may cause client device to display generated code to the user to store generated code and or to embed generated code in one or more physical devices.

In example now assume that the user utilizes TCE to create still another state chart or to import the state chart into TCE and the model. For example the user may select the state chart block of the model in user interface and TCE may display a user interface that enables the user to create the elements of the state chart as shown in . As shown TCE may cause client device to display the state chart as the user creates the state chart or after the user imports the state chart. In example assume that the state chart includes a state block e.g. state block A and a function block. State block A may include a representation of calculations to be performed. As further shown in state block A may include a function call to a function baz e.g. y1 baz u1 with a call input u1 and a call output y1 . The function call the call input and the call output may be understood by textual engine of TCE .

The function block may include a graphical function e.g. yy1 baz uu1 uu2 with function inputs uu1 and uu2 and a function output yy1 . The graphical function may include paths for calculating yy1 such as for example a first path e.g. yy1 uu2 when nargin e.g. which may indicate either uu1 or uu2 is greater than zero and a second path e.g. yy1 uu1 when nargin is less than or equal to zero. The graphical function the function inputs and the function output may be understood by graphical engine of TCE . In example assume that TCE ignores the second function input uu2 of the graphical function since the function call only includes one call input u1 .

After creating or importing the state chart assume that the user instructs TCE to execute the model by entering an execute model command or by selecting an execute model button as shown in . TCE may execute the model and the state chart based on the user s instruction. When the state chart is executed by TCE state block A may execute the function call y1 baz u1 which may cause the graphical function block to execute the second path with function input uu1 and function output yy1.

As shown in when executing the state chart TCE may provide chart information to parser of TCE . The chart information may include for example information associated with the arrangement of state block A information associated with the function call e.g. y1 baz u1 information associated with the graphical function e.g. yy1 baz uu1 uu2 etc. Parser may divide the chart information into a function portion and a function call portion. In example assume that the function portion includes the syntax baz yy1 uu1 and uu2 and that the function call portion includes the syntax baz y1 and u1.

As further shown in parser may provide the function portion to graphical engine and graphical engine may process the function portion to generate function based code for generated code . Generated code may include code that may be utilized by a physical device. Parser may provide the function call portion to textual engine and textual engine may process the function call portion to generate function call based code for generated code . TCE may ignore the second function input uu2 of the graphical function since the function call only includes one call input u1 . In example TCE may utilize the function based code and the function call based code to provide a version of the function e.g. baz with only the first function input uu1 of the graphical function in a function of generated code . TCE may cause client device to display generated code to the user to store generated code and or to embed generated code in one or more physical devices.

As indicated above are provided merely as an example. Other examples are possible and may differ from what was described with regard to .

In some implementations TCE may generate and display a user interface that enables the user to troubleshoot a read before write error as shown in . As shown user interface may include a section indicating that the state chart stopped just before entering state block A and before any execution time e.g. 0.000000 has elapsed. User interface may also include a breakpoints section that enables the user to set breakpoints for the state chart. A breakpoint may indicate a point at which TCE halts execution of the state chart. For example the user may set breakpoints upon chart entry upon state entry during an event broadcast etc. In another example if the user puts a breakpoint in a graphical function and various different functions are created the breakpoints may be carried over into each of the different functions.

User interface may include an error check section that enables the user to select error checking options for the state chart. For example the user may elect to check for state inconsistency transition conflict etc. in the state chart. User interface may include an animation section in which the user may enable or disable animation. User interface may include a section indicating that a runtime error e.g. data read before write occurred in a block e.g. TCE State Chart of a model e.g. TCE Model . The section may also indicate that the runtime error includes data object x being read before being written to. 

As indicated above are provided merely as an example. Other examples are possible and may differ from what was described with regard to .

The foregoing disclosure provides illustration and description but is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the implementations to the precise form disclosed. Modifications and variations are possible in light of the above disclosure or may be acquired from practice of the implementations.

A component is intended to be broadly construed as hardware firmware or a combination of hardware and software.

User interfaces may include graphical user interfaces GUIs and or non graphical user interfaces such as text based interfaces. The user interfaces may provide information to users via customized interfaces e.g. proprietary interfaces and or other types of interfaces e.g. browser based interfaces etc. . The user interfaces may receive user inputs via one or more input devices may be user configurable e.g. a user may change the sizes of the user interfaces information displayed in the user interfaces color schemes used by the user interfaces positions of text images icons windows etc. in the user interfaces etc. or may not be user configurable. Information associated with the user interfaces may be selected and or manipulated by a user of a technical computing environment TCE e.g. via a touch screen display a mouse a keyboard a keypad voice commands etc. .

The term code is to be broadly interpreted to include text based code that may be automatically executed e.g. C code C code Hardware Description Language HDL code very high speed integrated circuits VHSIC HDL VHDL code Verilog Java and or other types of hardware or software based code that may be compiled and or synthesized binary code that may be executed e.g. executable files that may directly be executed by an operating system bitstream files that can be used to configure a field programmable gate array FPGA Java byte code object files combined together with linker directives source code makefiles etc. text files that may be executed in conjunction with other executables e.g. Python text files a collection of dynamic link library DLL files with text based combining configuration information that connects pre compiled modules an extensible markup language XML file describing module linkage etc. etc. In one example code may include different combinations of the above identified classes e.g. text based code binary code text files etc. . Alternatively or additionally code may include code generated using a dynamically typed programming language e.g. the M language a MATLAB language a MATLAB compatible language a MATLAB like language etc. that can be used to express problems and or solutions in mathematical notations. Alternatively or additionally code may be of any type such as function script object etc. and a portion of code may include one or more characters lines etc. of the code.

It will be apparent that systems and or methods as described herein may be implemented in many different forms of software firmware and hardware in the implementations illustrated in the figures. The actual software code or specialized control hardware used to implement these systems and or methods is not limiting of the implementations. Thus the operation and behavior of the systems and or methods were described without reference to the specific software code it being understood that software and control hardware can be designed to implement the systems and or methods based on the description herein.

Even though particular combinations of features are recited in the claims and or disclosed in the specification these combinations are not intended to limit the disclosure of possible implementations. In fact many of these features may be combined in ways not specifically recited in the claims and or disclosed in the specification. Although each dependent claim listed below may directly depend on only one claim the disclosure of possible implementations includes each dependent claim in combination with every other claim in the claim set.

No element act or instruction used herein should be construed as critical or essential unless explicitly described as such. Also as used herein the articles a and an are intended to include one or more items and may be used interchangeably with one or more. Furthermore as used herein the term set is intended to include one or more items and may be used interchangeably with one or more. Where only one item is intended the term one or similar language is used. Further the phrase based on is intended to mean based at least in part on unless explicitly stated otherwise.
