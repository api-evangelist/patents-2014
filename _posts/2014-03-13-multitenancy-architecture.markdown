This application is related to U.S. Non Provisional application Ser. No. 14 177 392 filed Feb. 11 2014 entitled SECURITY DEVICE WITH PROGRAMMABLE SYSTOLIC MATRIX CRYPTOGRAPHIC MODULE AND PROGRAMMABLE INPUT OUTPUT INTERFACE by Richard J. Takahashi the entire contents of which application is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.

At least some embodiments disclosed herein relate to security processing and data storage in general and more particularly but not limited to security processing in a multi tenancy architecture.

In existing solutions to multi tenancy each customer is physically separated with its own network and network equipment with required protection. As the data center customer base expands this expansion requires additional floor space. This additional floor space requires costly new buildings and all of its related infrastructure in order to meet the new customer demands.

Multi tenancy is a business model in which many companies governments and other entities store their data in a commonly shared data center or storage array. There are data centers to conserve floor space that will store multiple customers data in a common storage area. One problem with such storage is that a given customer s data is stored mixed with the data for many of the other customers. Thus an operator or equipment error may lead to the given customer s data accidently or inadvertently being read or accessed by one or more of the other customers.

In one embodiment the crypto module design of provides features such as hard wired one time programmable options and custom analog digital circuits for flexible physical partitioning for un encrypted plain text and encrypted cipher text separation.

In one embodiment each cryptographic module is implemented using a systolic matrix array configuration.

The multiple layers above combined with two dimensional systolic arrays provides a three dimensional systolic matrix architecture for security device .

Various additional non limiting embodiments of security device are now described below. In one or more embodiments security device may provide one or more of the following advantages 

1. A fast data rate encryptor at hundreds of gigabits full duplex e.g. for meeting future optical network data rates .

2. A programmable systolic architecture consisting of FPGAs and CPUs. The security device is flexible and programmable requiring only software upgrades for different versions and features.

3. Multi tenancy to secure an entity s or individual user s data. Each entity user s data will be encrypted decrypted using a unique key per the entity user. In this way each entity user s data will be uniquely encrypted decrypted and stored in a common data storage area. If by operator or machine error the wrong data is accessed and mistakenly sent to another of the entity users using the storage area the data is still safe since it will not be decrypted by the correct entity user key. Various embodiments for a multi tenancy architecture are discussed below in the section titled Multi Tenancy Architecture .

4. A multi level security architecture to secure different levels of classified data using a single security device e.g. an encryptor . Each classification of data will be encrypted decrypted using a unique key per the data class. In this way each classification of data will be uniquely encrypted decrypted and stored in a common storage area. If by operator or machine error the wrong data is accessed and mistakenly sent to another level of classification the data is still safe since it is not decrypted by the correct user key.

6. A flexible high density I O to interface to network equipment at multiple customer or other source sites. Also the flexible I O can be programmed for mixed interface types e.g. 10 Gbs Ethernet Infiniband or PCI express thus requiring no interface bridging network equipment.

7. A replaceable flexible I O physical panel that can be customized for a specific network installation without the need to re design the main chassis of security device .

Specifically un encrypted or plain text data e.g. incoming data packets enters physical interface and is routed by programmable input interface to packet input engine . Data packets are routed by input engine to an appropriate cryptographic core in cryptographic processing engine .

A security association SA key lookup is used in packet engine or to determine appropriate keys for loading from a key memories array to cryptographic engine via a key manager interface or as defined in the packet header. These keys are used for security processing of the corresponding data packet.

After encryption by processing engine encrypted packets are provided to packet output engine for routing to programmable output interface . The encrypted data leaves via physical interface .

Programmable interfaces and may be formed using FPGAs or other programmable devices e.g. as described above for I O interfaces or of . In one embodiment physical interfaces and may form a part of interchangeable physical input output interface . In one embodiment physical interface is implemented as a removable physical card.

In one embodiment FPGAs and form a portion of the systolic matrix array configuration illustrated in and may be coupled to the packet input and output engines and cryptographic processing engine using serial buses. The packet input and output engines and cryptographic engine are formed using FPGAs to provide a two dimensional systolic array of a top systolic layer. In one example data and control processing is performed in two dimensions using the six FPGA units e.g. FPGA and packet input engine as illustrated in .

In one embodiment the sub blocks in the packet input engine or packet output engine such as packet routing packet multiplexer and IP context lookup are implemented in a systolic matrix array configuration as was discussed above. Data comes into the packet engine and the packet engine looks at the packets including the context and decides where to route each packet. Then the packet engine determines that a packet requires a particular security association which is implemented using a key lookup. The packet engine associates the key to the incoming data. The key is read out and the data is encrypted or decrypted in one of the crypto cores.

In one embodiment high speed memory is coupled to the input and output packet engines and may be any type of high speed memory in various embodiments.

In one embodiment all primary processing works in a matrix. Data is constantly flowing in two dimensions. For example data is flowing horizontally keys are flowing up vertically and control information is flowing down vertically as part of the two dimensional processing.

Additional variations details and examples for various non limiting embodiments of the above security processing system are now discussed below. In a first variation with reference to the programmable input output interface is a router switch that selects one of the crypto modules to receive forwarded packets. A router and switch are incorporated inside the input output interface . For example if a first packet comes through a second port the first packet will be routed to crypto module number six. Crypto module number six will later route the first packet back out through that same second port of original entry.

There may be two components to the programmable I O interface. On one side the interface programs the type of I O that is desired. The other side of the interface is the router switch. The router switch multiplexer knows which crypto module is to receive a given packet. Also the router switch knows which crypto module is ready for processing of a packet. For example if crypto module number one is ready for processing it will flag itself as being ready for processing. For example there is a semaphore flag or packet header bits used that tells I O interface which module is ready to process data. Whatever port is used to bring in the data that data will be processed in one of the crypto modules and then tagged out back to the same port when later being decrypted and sent out from storage e.g. the packet is tagged with some identification of the port using a tag . The tag is used to redirect the packet back to the correct port of original entry.

The crypto module has a security association that determines which keys go with which packet. The programmable input output may allow programming of different applications because of the use of FPGAs. The back end of the router switch will accommodate the type of input output to be used. The router switch will identify the crypto module to be used. When reprogramming the programmable interface a new physical interface needs to be interchanged or installed. The main security device chassis is not changed out only the I O portion is being changed.

In one embodiment remote ports are basically control ports. The protocol for the remote port may typically be a Simple Network Management Protocol SNMP protocol or any other management protocols The key fill port is where the keys are filled into the security device. The crypto ignition key ignites the security device.

With reference to the Interbus serial bus mentioned above coordinates the operation of the two input output interfaces . The Interbus handles any protocol issues between the router and the switch functions of these interfaces. The Interbus is used to provide communication between the FPGAs of the systolic array during operation of the security device. In one example the Interbus helps to coordinate operation as to which crypto module will receive an incoming packet.

Processor manages control plane operation. Processor also configures components when a new security protocol will be used uses routing tables sets the configuration sets up the programmability and sets up the power on self test. Processor also may facilitate key loading. The key fill port on the front of user panel operates under control by processor .

With reference to a secure boot is used to guarantee that the data booted into the FPGAs of the cryptographic module is proper. The secure boot is executed when the unit is turned on or at boot up. The code is authenticated by the system. The FPGAs are programmed at every boot up of the unit or any time that the unit is reset. Each crypto module may have its own CPU which controls programming.

With reference to external key management is a location that the keys may be stored for passing to the security device . A network operator loads the keys into the external key management . The security device loads the keys into the crypto modules. There is key tagging in the packet headers and inside the crypto module. When a packet comes into the security device the packet is associated with a given key and the packet contains information used to route the packet. The external key management can load keys in real time or only a single time. Network services management is remote management which provides control status setting up of the security device unit and sending of the status back to a user. The other external management services could be used to track how many other units are in the field what the units are doing whether each unit is running and what configuration the unit is in.

In one embodiment data packets include key tags customer tags and packet tags. The packet tag tells what type of packet is coming in. The customer tag identifies the company or source of the data. The key tag tells what key goes with what packet. Each tag is looked at by the packet engine to determine how the packet is going to be routed within the crypto module .

Now discussing an embodiment regarding flexible physical partitioning each cryptographic module may be physically isolated by design. So only a certain packet will go through a module number one and only certain other packets will go through module number two. For example crypto module number one may only process a certain style of packet. Crypto module number two may only process packets for a particular customer. Thus it is physically partitioned. For example customer number one s data is tagged as belonging to customer number one for sending it to the specific crypto module. The router determines this requirement and only that particular crypto module can process that customer s packet.

Regarding internal key management in the crypto module s performance the key manager loads the keys and further decides how the keys are dispersed within the crypto module based on the tagging of the incoming data packet. Keys are stored in the selectable key cache . The key manager decides based on the tagging of the data packet what keys will be associated with the current packet. This provides key agility.

With reference to API may be programmed to map into any of several different external key managers . The use of API thus provides increased flexibility.

A controller not shown is configured to select a first set of keys from a plurality of key sets . Each of the key sets corresponds to one of the plurality of data sources . The first set of keys e.g. Key Set 1 is used by the security device to encrypt the first data. Common encrypted data storage receives the encrypted first data from security device .

The controller may be for example a key manager as discussed further below. In one embodiment the security device includes the controller. In one embodiment the controller is an internal key manager e.g. as discussed above for and internal key manager .

In one embodiment the first data is a first data packet and security device is configured to detect a tag of the first data packet that identifies the first data source e.g. Source 1 . The controller selects the first set of keys Key Set 1 based on the detection of the tag.

Each of the plurality of data sources is typically located at a different physical location for a respective user e.g. an entity such as a company or individual using the common encrypted data storage to store data sent over a network e.g. the Internet or another communication link to the security device .

Each of the security devices is configured for cryptographic processing and receives incoming data from at least one data source . Each of the key managers is associated with a user e.g. corporation or an individual . For example a given user may control an external key manager that provides keys to one of the security devices for cryptographic processing of that user s data. A switch receives the incoming data from data source and routes the incoming data to one of the security devices. For example switch may route the data to the security device that corresponds to the user that sent the data for storage.

Each key manager is coupled to a respective one of the security devices and each key manager is configured to provide a set of keys to a particular security device for encryption of incoming data associated with the respective user. The incoming data is then stored in common encrypted data storage after the encryption.

Switch is used to route the encrypted data from the security device to encrypted data storage . When data is read from common encrypted data storage switch routes the data to the appropriate security device for decryption processing.

In one embodiment security devices include a first security device Security Device 1 . The key managers include a first key manager Key Manager 1 . The first security device comprises a key cache not shown configured to store a first set of keys e.g. Key Set 1 as shown in that are received from the first key manager. The first set of keys is loaded into a cryptographic core not shown of the first security device and then used to encrypt data packets in the incoming data.

In security device is shown located at a physical location or site of the first user. In other embodiments security device may be located at the physical location of common encrypted data storage . In these other embodiments key manager may still remain at physical location under the control of the first user.

Input key cache and output key cache each store a plurality of key sets. A first set of keys is selected from the key sets stored in key cache to encrypt a first data packet by the input core . Packet input engine is configured to detect a header of the first data packet and to address the first set of keys. In one embodiment the cryptographic module includes a processor not shown configured to verify that the packet input engine is authorized to address the first set of keys.

The cryptographic module includes a key loader controller to load keys for example from an external key manager via an application programming interface. The key loader controller loads the first set of keys for storage in key cache prior to receipt of the first data packet by the cryptographic module. In one embodiment key cache and key cache are each configured so that a key cache failure causes the respective key cache to be zeroized.

Stored keys are loaded into the appropriate cryptographic core or from key cache or . The packet input engine provides a signal e.g. an addressing signal used by input key cache to select the first set of keys for use by the cryptographic core in encrypting incoming data packets. Packet output engine addresses keys in key cache in a similar way for decrypting outgoing packets.

Packet output engine provides encrypted data packets from the input core when writing data to common encrypted data storage . Packet output engine detects a header of each data packet when reading from the common encrypted data storage in order to address a set of keys in output key cache for decrypting each data packet by output core . Output core provides the decrypted data packets to packet input engine which sends the data packets to one of data sources of .

In one embodiment input key cache stores a set of keys for encryption and output key cache stores a set of keys for decryption. The cryptographic module is configured to zeroize input core the input key cache and key loader controller after encrypting the first data packet. Output core output key cache and key loader controller are zeroized after decrypting data packets read from common encrypted data storage .

In one embodiment as described in more detail below a secure multi tenancy system is provided to encrypt a customer s data to minimize or avoid situations where data is mistakenly read by another customer. The system reduces the risk of unauthorized access to a customer s data.

The packet input engine performs header detections or modifications and will authenticate and associate the customer s data. Once the data is authenticated and identified packet input engine will address the unique specific customer s key in input key cache . The input key cache stores this customer s specific keys. The input key cache also has a fail safe and key authentication processor not shown to verify the packet input engine is authorized to address the keys within the input key cache.

Key loader controller loads and verifies keys and addresses from the packet input engine . A fail safe feature of the input key cache and key loader controller is that any key cache failure will result in a zeroized key cache. The key loader controller and the respective input or output key cache is designed to ensure the proper key is associated with the data that will be encrypted or decrypted. The key controller and each key cache is designed to be fail safe in that if there is any failure in the key controller or one of the key caches the cryptographic module will fail to a known state and the data will not be compromised.

Each of the key caches is designed to store for example one or more millions of keys. In one embodiment each key cache writes keys one way to its respective cryptographic core i.e. input core or output core .

Packet output engine performs header detections or modifications and authenticates and associates the customer s data read from common encrypted data storage . Once the data is authenticated and identified packet output engine addresses output key cache . The output key cache operates similarly to the input key cache discussed above.

Each cryptographic core is an encryption decryption engine to encrypt or decrypt the data from the packet input output I O engines discussed above. The keys are loaded from the respective key caches as was discussed above.

In some embodiments the multi tenancy architecture detects the packet header and associates the keys that will be encrypted decrypted. There is an option provided for the keys in the key cache to be encrypted using a key encryption key or to be un encrypted. The multi tenancy architecture is configured to provide selected encrypted data into common storage area e.g. for data storage or for internal network processing and use . In one embodiment the multi tenancy architecture authenticates the I O packet engines to the associated encryption and decryption keys within the respective input or output key cache for simultaneous two way data traffic. The system requires that data be encrypted with a set of keys associated to a specific customer s data.

The multi tenancy architecture may have fail safe features to ensure in cases of failure that the multi tenancy architecture will fail to a safe state. Each key cache may be coupled to a fail safe key loader controller to authenticate the packet engines and send the correct key addresses. The key cache may be fail safe with authentication. The cryptographic core may use fail safe features and key agility to process keys from the respective key cache and data from the input output packet engine.

Additional variations details and examples for various non limiting embodiments of the multi tenancy architecture system are now discussed below. In a first variation data is coming in from many different customers. Data is stored in one large database and in an encrypted form. For example a first company s key and a second company s key are each loaded into the multi tenancy system. The first company s key is selected for processing the first company s data.

In another variation no entity but the customer is able to see the keys of the customer. The customer controls the keys by interacting with the key manager discussed above. The customer s keys cannot be lost by a data storage center operator and cannot be used by another company.

In one example each customer owns its own security device unit and controls and manages its own key manager. The other equipment of the data storage center can be commonly owned and operated by the data storage center operator.
