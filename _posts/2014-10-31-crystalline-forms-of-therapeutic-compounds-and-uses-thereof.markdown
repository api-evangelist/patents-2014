This invention relates to crystalline forms of a therapeutic compound useful for treating diseases including proliferative diseases and diseases associated with angiogenesis such as cancer and macular degeneration.

Growth factors play an important role in angiogenesis lymphangiogenesis and vasculogenesis. Growth factors regulate angiogenesis in a variety of processes including embryonic development wound healing and several aspects of female reproductive function. Undesirable or pathological angiogenesis is associated with diseases including diabetic retinopathy psoriasis cancer rheumatoid arthritis atheroma Kaposi s sarcoma and hemangioma Fan et al. 1995 16 57 66 Folkman 1995 1 27 31 . Angiogenic ocular conditions represent the leading cause of irreversible vision loss in developed countries. In the United States for example retinopathy of prematurity diabetic retinopathy and age related macular degeneration are the principal causes of blindness in infants working age adults and the elderly respectively. Efforts have been developed to inhibit angiogenesis in the treatment of these conditions R. Roskoski Jr. 62 2007 179 213 .

Therefore there is a need for new therapeutic compounds for the treatment of diseases associated with the aberrant signaling of growth factors and diseases associated with angiogenesis such as cancer macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy.

In certain embodiments the subject is a non human animal. In certain embodiments the animal is fish. A patient refers to a human subject in need of treatment of a disease.

The terms administer administering or administration as used herein refer to implanting absorbing ingesting injecting inhaling or otherwise introducing a crystalline form of Compound 3 or a pharmaceutical composition thereof in or on a subject.

As used herein the terms treatment treat and treating refer to reversing alleviating delaying the onset of or inhibiting the progress of a disease described herein. In some embodiments treatment may be administered after one or more signs or symptoms of the disease have developed or have been observed. In other embodiments treatment may be administered in the absence of signs or symptoms of the disease. For example treatment may be administered to a susceptible subject prior to the onset of symptoms e.g. in light of a history of symptoms and or in light of genetic or other susceptibility factors or exposure to a pathogen . Treatment may also be continued after symptoms have resolved for example to delay or prevent recurrence.

An effective amount of a Compound 3 crystalline form described herein refers to an amount sufficient to elicit a desired biological response i.e. treating the condition. As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in this art the effective amount of a crystalline form of Compound 3 described herein may vary depending on such factors as the desired biological endpoint the pharmacokinetics of the Compound 3 crystalline form the condition being treated the mode of administration and the age and health of the subject. An effective amount encompasses therapeutic and prophylactic treatment. For example in treating cancer an effective amount of a Compound 3 crystalline form described herein may reduce the tumor burden or stop the growth or spread of a tumor. In treating macular degeneration an effective amount of a Compound 3 crystalline form described herein may improve sight reduce the risk of vision loss or prevent central vision loss from worsening.

A therapeutically effective amount of a Compound 3 crystalline form described herein is an amount sufficient to provide a therapeutic benefit in the treatment of a condition or to delay or minimize one or more symptoms associated with the condition. A therapeutically effective amount of a Compound 3 crystalline form described herein means an amount of a crystalline form of Compound 3 alone or in combination with other therapies which provides a therapeutic benefit in the treatment of the condition. The term therapeutically effective amount can encompass an amount that improves overall therapy reduces or avoids symptoms signs or causes of the condition and or enhances the therapeutic efficacy of another therapeutic agent. In certain embodiments a therapeutically effective amount of crystalline form of Compound 3 or composition thereof is the amount needed to inhibit angiogenesis in a subject.

The term prophylactically effective amount can encompass an amount that improves overall prophylaxis or enhances the prophylactic efficacy of another prophylactic agent.

As used herein the term growth factor refers to a naturally occurring substance e.g. a protein or a steroid hormone capable of stimulating cellular growth proliferation and or cellular differentiation. Growth factors may act as signaling molecules between cells and or promote cell differentiation and maturation.

A proliferative disease refers to a disease that occurs due to abnormal growth or extension by the multiplication of cells Walker Cambridge University Press Cambridge UK 1990 . A proliferative disease may be associated with 1 the pathological proliferation of normally quiescent cells 2 the pathological migration of cells from their normal location e.g. metastasis of neoplastic cells 3 the pathological expression of proteolytic enzymes such as the matrix metalloproteinases e.g. collagenases gelatinases and elastases or 4 the pathological angiogenesis as in proliferative retinopathy and tumor metastasis. Exemplary proliferative diseases include cancers i.e. malignant neoplasms benign neoplasms angiogenesis inflammatory diseases and autoimmune diseases.

As used herein the term angiogenesis refers to the physiological process through which new blood vessels form from pre existing vessels. Angiogenesis is distinct from vasculogenesis which is the de novo formation of endothelial cells from mesoderm cell precursors. The first vessels in a developing embryo form through vasculogenesis after which angiogenesis is responsible for most blood vessel growth during normal or abnormal development. Angiogenesis is a vital process in growth and development as well as in wound healing and in the formation of granulation tissue. However angiogenesis is also a fundamental step in the transition of tumors from a benign state to a malignant one leading to the use of angiogenesis inhibitors in the treatment of cancer. Angiogenesis may be chemically stimulated by angiogenic proteins such as growth factors e.g. VEGF .

The terms neoplasm and tumor are used herein interchangeably and refer to an abnormal mass of tissue wherein the growth of the mass surpasses and is not coordinated with the growth of a normal tissue. A neoplasm or tumor may be benign or malignant depending on the following characteristics degree of cellular differentiation including morphology and functionality rate of growth local invasion and metastasis. A benign neoplasm is generally well differentiated has characteristically slower growth than a malignant neoplasm and remains localized to the site of origin. In addition a benign neoplasm does not have the capacity to infiltrate invade or metastasize to distant sites. Exemplary benign neoplasms include but are not limited to lipoma chondroma adenomas acrochordon senile angiomas seborrheic keratoses lentigos and sebaceous hyperplasias. In some cases certain benign tumors may later give rise to malignant neoplasms which may result from additional genetic changes in a subpopulation of the tumor s neoplastic cells and these tumors are referred to as pre malignant neoplasms. An exemplary pre malignant neoplasm is a teratoma. In contrast a malignant neoplasm is generally poorly differentiated anaplasia and has characteristically rapid growth accompanied by progressive infiltration invasion and destruction of the surrounding tissue. Furthermore a malignant neoplasm generally has the capacity to metastasize to distant sites. The term metastasis metastatic or metastasize refers to the spread or migration of cancerous cells from a primary or original tumor to another organ or tissue and is typically identifiable by the presence of a secondary tumor or secondary cell mass of the tissue type of the primary or original tumor and not of that of the organ or tissue in which the secondary metastatic tumor is located. For example a prostate cancer that has migrated to bone is said to be metastasized prostate cancer and includes cancerous prostate cancer cells growing in bone tissue.

As used herein the term cancer refers to a malignant neoplasm 25th ed. Hensyl ed. Williams Wilkins Philadelphia 1990 . Exemplary cancers include but are not limited to acoustic neuroma adenocarcinoma adrenal gland cancer anal cancer angiosarcoma e.g. lymphangiosarcoma lymphangioendotheliosarcoma hemangiosarcoma appendix cancer benign monoclonal gammopathy biliary cancer e.g. cholangiocarcinoma bladder cancer breast cancer e.g. adenocarcinoma of the breast papillary carcinoma of the breast mammary cancer medullary carcinoma of the breast brain cancer e.g. meningioma glioblastomas glioma e.g. astrocytoma oligodendroglioma medulloblastoma bronchus cancer carcinoid tumor cervical cancer e.g. cervical adenocarcinoma choriocarcinoma chordoma craniopharyngioma colorectal cancer e.g. colon cancer rectal cancer colorectal adenocarcinoma connective tissue cancer epithelial carcinoma ependymoma endotheliosarcoma e.g. Kaposi s sarcoma multiple idiopathic hemorrhagic sarcoma endometrial cancer e.g. uterine cancer uterine sarcoma esophageal cancer e.g. adenocarcinoma of the esophagus Barrett s adenocarinoma Ewing s sarcoma ocular cancer e.g. intraocular melanoma retinoblastoma familiar hypereosinophilia gall bladder cancer gastric cancer e.g. stomach adenocarcinoma gastrointestinal stromal tumor GIST germ cell cancer head and neck cancer e.g. head and neck squamous cell carcinoma oral cancer e.g. oral squamous cell carcinoma throat cancer e.g. laryngeal cancer pharyngeal cancer nasopharyngeal cancer oropharyngeal cancer hematopoietic cancers e.g. leukemia such as acute lymphocytic leukemia ALL e.g. B cell ALL T cell ALL acute myelocytic leukemia AML e.g. B cell AML T cell AML chronic myelocytic leukemia CML e.g. B cell CML T cell CML and chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL e.g. B cell CLL T cell CLL lymphoma such as Hodgkin lymphoma HL e.g. B cell HL T cell HL and non Hodgkin lymphoma NHL e.g. B cell NHL such as diffuse large cell lymphoma DLCL e.g. diffuse large B cell lymphoma follicular lymphoma chronic lymphocytic leukemia small lymphocytic lymphoma CLL SLL mantle cell lymphoma MCL marginal zone B cell lymphomas e.g. mucosa associated lymphoid tissue MALT lymphomas nodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma splenic marginal zone B cell lymphoma primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma Burkitt lymphoma lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma i.e. Waldenstr m s macroglobulinemia hairy cell leukemia HCL immunoblastic large cell lymphoma precursor B lymphoblastic lymphoma and primary central nervous system CNS lymphoma and T cell NHL such as precursor T lymphoblastic lymphoma leukemia peripheral T cell lymphoma PTCL e.g. cutaneous T cell lymphoma CTCL e.g. mycosis fungiodes Sezary syndrome angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma extranodal natural killer T cell lymphoma enteropathy type T cell lymphoma subcutaneous panniculitis like T cell lymphoma and anaplastic large cell lymphoma a mixture of one or more leukemia lymphoma as described above and multiple myeloma MM heavy chain disease e.g. alpha chain disease gamma chain disease mu chain disease hemangioblastoma hypopharynx cancer inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors immunocytic amyloidosis kidney cancer e.g. nephroblastoma a.k.a.

Inflammatory diseases include without limitation atherosclerosis arteriosclerosis autoimmune disorders multiple sclerosis systemic lupus erythematosus polymyalgia rheumatica PMR gouty arthritis degenerative arthritis tendonitis bursitis psoriasis cystic fibrosis arthrosteitis rheumatoid arthritis inflammatory arthritis Sjogren s syndrome giant cell arteritis progressive systemic sclerosis scleroderma ankylosing spondylitis polymyositis dermatomyosifis pemphigus pemphigoid diabetes e.g. Type I myasthenia gravis Hashimoto s thyroditis Graves disease Goodpasture s disease mixed connective tissue disease sclerosing cholangitis inflammatory bowel disease Crohn s disease ulcerative colitis pernicious anemia inflammatory dermatoses usual interstitial pneumonitis UIP asbestosis silicosis bronchiectasis berylliosis talcosis pneumoconiosis sarcoidosis desquamative interstitial pneumonia lymphoid interstitial pneumonia giant cell interstitial pneumonia cellular interstitial pneumonia extrinsic allergic alveolitis Wegener s granulomatosis and related forms of angiitis temporal arteritis and polyarteritis nodosa inflammatory dermatoses hepatitis delayed type hypersensitivity reactions e.g. poison ivy dermatitis pneumonia respiratory tract inflammation Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome ARDS encephalitis immediate hypersensitivity reactions asthma hayfever allergies acute anaphylaxis rheumatic fever glomerulonephritis pyelonephritis cellulitis cystitis chronic cholecystitis ischemia ischemic injury reperfusion injury allograft rejection host versus graft rejection appendicitis arteritis blepharitis bronchiolitis bronchitis cervicitis cholangitis chorioamnionitis conjunctivitis dacryoadenitis dermatomyositis endocarditis endometritis enteritis enterocolitis epicondylitis epididymitis fasciitis fibrositis gastritis gastroenteritis gingivitis ileitis iritis laryngitis myelitis myocarditis nephritis omphalitis oophoritis orchitis osteitis otitis pancreatitis parotitis pericarditis pharyngitis pleuritis phlebitis pneumonitis proctitis prostatitis rhinitis salpingitis sinusitis stomatitis synovitis testitis tonsillitis urethritis urocystitis uveitis vaginitis vasculitis vulvitis vulvovaginitis angitis chronic bronchitis osteomylitis optic neuritis temporal arteritis transverse myelitis necrotizing fascilitis and necrotizing enterocolitis. Ocular inflammatory diseases include but are not limited to allergy of the eye uveitis e.g. anterior uveitis intermediate uveitis and posterior uveitis conjunctivitis panuveitis cyclitis scleritis episcleritis optic neuritis retrobulbar optic neuritis keratitis e.g. immune keratitis and infectious keratitis blepharitis meibomian gland disease or dysfunction corneal ulcer conjunctival ulcer and symptoms caused by them ocular inflammatory diseases caused by ocular disorders ocular inflammatory diseases caused by a physical injury post surgical inflammation and dry eye e.g. dry eye syndrome .

As used herein an autoimmune disease refers to a disease arising from an inappropriate immune response of the body of a subject against substances and tissues normally present in the body. In other words the immune system mistakes some part of the body as a pathogen and attacks its own cells. This may be restricted to certain organs e.g. in autoimmune thyroiditis or involve a particular tissue in different places e.g. Goodpasture s disease which may affect the basement membrane in both the lung and kidney . The treatment of autoimmune diseases is typically with immunosuppressants e.g. medications that decrease the immune response. Exemplary autoimmune diseases include but are not limited to glomerulonephritis Goodpasture s syndrome necrotizing vasculitis lymphadenitis peri arteritis nodosa systemic lupus erythematosis rheumatoid arthritis psoriatic arthritis systemic lupus erythematosis psoriasis ulcerative colitis systemic sclerosis dermatomyositis polymyositis anti phospholipid antibody syndrome scleroderma perphigus vulgaris ANCA associated vasculitis e.g. Wegener s granulomatosis microscopic polyangiitis urveitis Sjogren s syndrome Crohn s disease Reiter s syndrome ankylosing spondylitis Lyme arthritis GuillainBarre syndrome Hashimoto s thyroiditis and cardiomyopathy.

The term autoinflammatory disease refers to a category of diseases that are similar but different from autoimmune diseases. Autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases share common characteristics in that both groups of disorders result from the immune system attacking a subject s own tissues and result in increased inflammation. In autoinflammatory diseases a subject s innate immune system causes inflammation for unknown reasons. The innate immune system reacts even though it has never encountered autoantibodies or antigens in the subject. Autoinflammatory disorders are characterized by intense episodes of inflammation that result in such symptoms as fever rash or joint swelling. These diseases also carry the risk of amyloidosis a potentially fatal buildup of a blood protein in vital organs. Autoinflammatory diseases include but are not limited to familial Mediterranean fever FMF neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease NOMID tumor necrosis factor TNF receptor associated periodic syndrome TRAPS deficiency of the interleukin 1 receptor antagonist DIRA and Beh et s disease.

The term biological sample refers to any sample including tissue samples such as tissue sections and needle biopsies of a tissue cell samples e.g. cytological smears such as Pap or blood smears or samples of cells obtained by microdissection samples of whole organisms such as samples of yeasts or bacteria or cell fractions fragments or organelles such as obtained by lysing cells and separating the components thereof by centrifugation or otherwise . Other examples of biological samples include blood serum urine semen fecal matter cerebrospinal fluid interstitial fluid mucus tears sweat pus biopsied tissue e.g. obtained by a surgical biopsy or needle biopsy nipple aspirates milk vaginal fluid saliva swabs such as buccal swabs or any material containing biomolecules that is derived from a first biological sample. Biological samples also include those biological samples that are transgenic such as transgenic oocyte sperm cell blastocyst embryo fetus donor cell or cell nucleus.

The term ocular disease or ocular disorder refers to any eye disease and or disorder. For example ocular diseases can be disorders of the eyelid lacrimal system and orbit disorders of conjunctiva disorders of sclera cornea iris and ciliary body disorders of choroid disorders of retina glaucoma disorders of optic nerve and visual pathways ocular neovascularization diseases or disorders ocular inflammatory diseases or disorders of ocular muscles. Additionally ocular disease can also refer to discomfort following injury surgery or laser treatment. Diseases and disorders of the eye or ocular diseases include but are not limited to retinopathy diabetic retinopathy retinal vein occlusion macular degeneration age related macular degeneration dry eye syndrome blepharitis inflammatory meibomian gland disease uveitis allergic conjunctivitis glaucoma macular edema diabetic macular edema cystoid macular edema and rosacea of the eye . Dry eye syndrome DES otherwise known as keratoconjunctivitis sicca KCS keratitis sicca sicca syndrome or xerophthalmia is an eye disease caused by decreased tear production or increased tear film evaporation commonly found in humans and some animals.

The term age related macular degeneration or AMD is an ocular disease which usually affects older adults and results in a loss of vision in the center of the visual field the macula because of damage to the retina. It occurs in dry and wet forms. It is a major cause of blindness and visual impairment in older adults 50 years .

Macular degeneration can make it difficult or impossible to read or recognize faces although enough peripheral vision remains to allow other activities of daily life. The macula is the central area of the retina which provides the most detailed central vision. In the dry nonexudative form cellular debris called drusen accumulate between the retina and the choroid and the retina can become detached. In the wet exudative form which is more severe blood vessels grow up from the choroid behind the retina and the retina can also become detached. It can be treated with laser coagulation and with medication that stops and sometimes reverses the growth of blood vessels. Macular degeneration includes some macular dystrophies affecting younger subjects as well as age related macular degeneration AMD or ARMD which is more commonly known. AMD begins with characteristic yellow deposits drusen in the macula between the retinal pigment epithelium and the underlying choroid. Most patients with these early changes referred to as age related maculopathy have good vision. Patients with drusen can go on to develop advanced AMD. The risk is considerably higher when the drusen are large and numerous and associated with disturbance in the pigmented cell layer under the macula. Recent research suggests that large and soft drusen are related to elevated cholesterol deposits and may respond to cholesterol lowering agents.

The term macular edema refers to the ocular diseases cystoid macular edema CME or diabetic macular edema DME . CME is an ocular disease which affects the central retina or macula of the eye. When this condition is present multiple cyst like cystoid areas of fluid appear in the macula and cause retinal swelling or edema. CME may accompany a variety of diseases such as retinal vein occlusion uveitis and or diabetes. CME commonly occurs after cataract surgery. DME occurs when blood vessels in the retina of patients with diabetes begin to leak into the macula. These leaks cause the macula to thicken and swell progressively distorting acute vision. While the swelling may not lead to blindness the effect can cause a severe loss in central vision.

The term glaucoma refers to an ocular disease in which the optic nerve is damaged in a characteristic pattern. This can permanently damage vision in the affected eye and lead to blindness if left untreated. It is normally associated with increased fluid pressure in the eye aqueous humor . The term ocular hypertension is used for patients with consistently raised intraocular pressure TOP without any associated optic nerve damage. Conversely the term normal tension or low tension glaucoma is used for those with optic nerve damage and associated visual field loss but normal or low TOP. The nerve damage involves loss of retinal ganglion cells in a characteristic pattern. There are many different subtypes of glaucoma but they can all be considered to be a type of optic neuropathy. Raised intraocular pressure e.g. above 21 mmHg or 2.8 kPa is the most important and only modifiable risk factor for glaucoma. However some may have high eye pressure for years and never develop damage while others can develop nerve damage at a relatively low pressure. Untreated glaucoma can lead to permanent damage of the optic nerve and resultant visual field loss which over time can progress to blindness.

The term uveitis refers to an inflammatory disease of the uvea the vascular layer of the eye sandwiched between the retina and the white of the eye sclera . The uvea extends toward the front of the eye and consists of the iris choroid layer and ciliary body. Uveitis includes anterior uveitis intermediate uveitis and posterior uveitis. A most common type of uveitis is an inflammation of the iris called iritis anterior uveitis . Uveitis may also occur at the posterior segment of the eye e.g. at the choroid . Inflammation of the uvea can be recurring and can cause serious problems such as blindness if left untreated accounts for 10 of blindness globally . Early diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent the complications of uveitis.

The term dry eye or dry eyes refers to an ocular disease in which there are insufficient tears to lubricate and nourish the eye. Tears are necessary for maintaining the health of the front surface of the eye and for providing clear vision. Patients with dry eyes either do not produce enough tears or have a poor quality of tears. Dry eye is a common and often chronic problem particularly in older adults. With each blink of the eyelids tears are spread across the front surface of the eye known as the cornea. Tears provide lubrication reduce the risk of eye infection wash away foreign matter in the eye and keep the surface of the eyes smooth and clear. Excess tears in the eyes flow into small drainage ducts in the inner corners of the eyelids which drain in the back of the nose. Tears are produced by several glands e.g. lacrimal gland in and around the eyelids. Tear production tends to diminish with age with various medical conditions or as a side effect of certain medicines. Environmental conditions such as wind and dry climates can also affect tear volume by increasing tear evaporation. When the normal amount of tear production decreases or tears evaporate too quickly from the eyes symptoms of dry eye can develop. The most common form of dry eyes is due to an inadequate amount of the water layer of tears. This condition called keratoconjunctivitis sicca KCS is also referred to as dry eye syndrome. 

The term diabetic retinopathy refers to retinopathy i.e. a disease of the retina caused by complications of diabetes which can eventually lead to blindness. Diabetic retinopathy may cause no symptoms mild vision problems or even blindness. Diabetic retinopathy is the result of microvascular retinal changes. Hyperglycemia induced intramural pericyte death and thickening of the basement membrane lead to incompetence of the vascular walls. These damages change the formation of the blood retinal barrier and also make the retinal blood vessels become more permeable. The pericyte death is caused when hyperglycemia persistently activates protein kinase C PKC encoded by Prkcd and p38 mitogen activated protein kinase MAPK to increase the expression of a previously unknown target of PKC 6 signaling Src homology 2 domain containing phosphatase 1 SHP 1 a protein tyrosine phosphatase. This signaling cascade leads to PDGF receptor dephosphorylation and a reduction in downstream signaling from this receptor resulting in pericyte apoptosis. Small blood vessels such as those in the eye are especially vulnerable to poor control over blood sugar. An overaccumulation of glucose and or fructose damages the tiny blood vessels in the retina. During the initial stage called nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy NPDR most patients do not notice any change in their vision. Early changes that are reversible and do not threaten central vision are sometimes termed simplex retinopathy or background retinopathy. As the disease progresses severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy enters an advanced proliferative diabetic retinopathy PDR stage when blood vessels proliferate. The lack of oxygen in the retina causes fragile new blood vessels to grow along the retina and in the clear gel like vitreous humor that fills the inside of the eye which may result in bleeding cloudy vision retina damage or tractional retinal detachment.

The term VEGF is used interchangeably with vascular endothelial growth factor herein. VEGF includes but is not limited to VEGF related proteins such as placenta growth factor P1GF VEGF A VEGF B VEGF C VEGF D VEGF E and VEGF F. The term VEGF also covers a number of proteins from two families that result from alternate splicing of mRNA from a single 8 exon VEGF gene. The two different families are referred to according to their terminal exon exon 8 splice site the proximal splice site denoted VEGF or distal splice site VEGF . In addition alternate splicing of exon 6 and 7 alters their heparin binding affinity and amino acid number in humans VEGF VEGF VEGF VEGF VEGF VEGF VEGF the rodent orthologs of these proteins contain one fewer amino acid . These domains have important functional consequences for the VEGF splice variants as the terminal exon 8 splice site determines whether the proteins are pro angiogenic proximal splice site expressed during angiogenesis or anti angiogenic distal splice site expressed in normal tissues . In addition inclusion or exclusion of exons 6 and 7 mediate interactions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans HSPGs and neuropilin co receptors on the cell surface enhancing their ability to bind and activate the VEGF receptors VEGFRs . The term VEGF also encompasses VEGF receptors. There are three main subtypes of VEGFR numbered 1 2 and 3. Also they may be membrane bound mbVEGFR or soluble sVEGFR depending on alternative splicing.

The term particle refers to a small object fragment or piece of a substance that may be a single element inorganic material organic material or mixture thereof. Examples of particles include polymeric particles single emulsion particles double emulsion particles coacervates liposomes microparticles nanoparticles macroscopic particles pellets crystals e.g. crystalline forms of compounds or active pharmaceutical agent aggregates composites pulverized milled or otherwise disrupted matrices and cross linked protein or polysaccharide particles each of which have an average characteristic dimension of about less than about 1 mm and at least 1 nm where the characteristic dimension or critical dimension of the particle is the smallest cross sectional dimension of the particle. A particle may be composed of a single substance or multiple substances. In certain embodiments the particle is not a viral particle. In other embodiments the particle is not a liposome. In certain embodiments the particle is not a micelle. In certain embodiments the particle is substantially solid throughout. In certain embodiments the particle is a nanoparticle. In certain embodiments the particle is a microparticle.

The term nanoparticle refers to a particle having a characteristic dimension of less than about 1 micrometer and at least about 1 nanometer where the characteristic dimension of the particle is the smallest cross sectional dimension of the particle. A crystalline nanoparticle is referred to as a nanocrystal. 

The term microparticle refers to a particle having a characteristic dimension of less than about 1 millimeter and at least about 1 micrometer where the characteristic dimension of the particle is the smallest cross sectional dimension of the particle.

The term nanostructure refers to a structure having at least one region or characteristic dimension with a dimension of less than about 1000 nm e.g. less than about 300 nm less than about 200 nm less than about 100 nm or less than about 50 nm. Typically the region or characteristic dimension will be along the smallest axis of the structure. Examples of such structures include nanowires nanorods nanotubes branched nanocrystals nanotetrapods tripods bipods nanocrystals nanodots quantum dots nanoparticles branched tetrapods e.g. inorganic dendrimers and the like. Nanostructures can be substantially homogeneous in material properties or in certain embodiments can be heterogeneous e.g. heterostructures . Nanostructures can be e.g. substantially crystalline substantially monocrystalline polycrystalline amorphous or a combination thereof. In one aspect each of the three dimensions of the nanostructure has a dimension of less than about 1000 nm e.g. or even less than about 300 nm less than about 200 nm less than about 100 nm or less than about 50 nm. Nanostructures can comprise one or more surface ligands e.g. surfactants .

The terms crystalline or substantially crystalline when used with respect to nanostructures refer to the fact that the nanostructures typically exhibit long range ordering across one or more dimensions of the structure. It will be understood by one of skill in the art that the term long range ordering will depend on the absolute size of the specific nanostructures as ordering for a single crystal cannot extend beyond the boundaries of the crystal. In this case long range ordering will mean substantial order across at least the majority of the dimension of the nanostructure. In some instances a nanostructure can bear an oxide or other coating or can be comprised of a core and at least one shell. In such instances it will be appreciated that the oxide shell s or other coating need not exhibit such ordering e.g. it can be amorphous polycrystalline or otherwise . In such instances the phrase crystalline substantially crystalline substantially monocrystalline or monocrystalline refers to the central core of the nanostructure excluding the coating layers or shells . The terms crystalline or substantially crystalline as used herein are intended to also encompass structures comprising various defects stacking faults atomic substitutions and the like as long as the structure exhibits substantial long range ordering e.g. order over at least about 80 of the length of at least one axis of the nano structure or its core . In addition it will be appreciated that the interface between a core and the outside of a nanostructure or between a core and an adjacent shell or between a shell and a second adjacent shell may contain non crystalline regions and may even be amorphous. This does not prevent the nanostructure from being crystalline or substantially crystalline as defined herein. The term monocrystalline when used with respect to a nanostructure indicates that the nanostructure is substantially crystalline and comprises substantially a single crystal. When used with respect to a nanostructure heterostructure comprising a core and one or more shells monocrystalline indicates that the core is substantially crystalline and comprises substantially a single crystal. When not used with respect to a nanostructure the term monocrystalline to materials that are composed of substantially a single crystallite of substantially the same size and orientation.

 Nanocrystal is a nanostructure that is substantially monocrystalline. A nanocrystal thus has at least one region or characteristic dimension with a dimension of less than about 1000 nm e.g. less than about 300 nm less than about 200 nm less than about 100 nm or less than about 50 nm. Typically the region or characteristic dimension will be along the smallest axis of the structure. Examples of such structures include nanowires nanorods nanotubes branched nanowires nanotetrapods nanotripods nanobipods nanocrystals nanodots quantum dots nanoparticles nanoribbons and the like. Nanostructures can be substantially homogeneous in material properties or in certain embodiments can be heterogeneous e.g. heterostructures . Optionally a nanocrystal can comprise one or more surface ligands e.g. surfactants . The nanocrystal is optionally substantially single crystal in structure a single crystal nanostructure or a monocrystalline nanostructure . While nanostructures for use in the present invention can be fabricated from essentially any convenient material or material preferably the nanostructure is prepared from an inorganic material e.g. an inorganic conductive or semiconductive material. A conductive or semi conductive nanostructure often displays 1 dimensional quantum confinement e.g. an electron can often travel along only one dimension of the structure. Nanocrystals can be substantially homogeneous in material properties or in certain embodiments can be heterogeneous e.g. heterostructures . The term nanocrystal is intended to encompass substantially monocrystalline nanostructures comprising various defects stacking faults atomic substitutions and the like as well as substantially monocrystalline nanostructures without such defects faults or substitutions. In the case of nanocrystal heterostructures comprising a core and one or more shells the core of the nanocrystal is typically substantially monocrystalline but the shell s need not be. The nanocrystals can be fabricated from essentially any convenient material or materials.

The term polycrystalline refers to materials that are composed of many crystallites of varying size and orientation. When used with respect to nanostructures the term polycrystalline refers to a crystalline nanostructure that is not monocrystalline.

A biocompatible material refers to a material that does not typically induce an adverse response when inserted or injected into a subject. The adverse response includes significant inflammation and or acute rejection of the material by the immune system of the subject for instance via a T cell mediated response. It is recognized that biocompatibility is a relative term and that some degree of immune response is to be expected even for materials that are highly compatible with living tissues of the subject. However as used herein biocompatibility refers to the acute rejection of a material by at least a portion of the immune system i.e. a material that lacks biocompatibility i.e. being non biocompatible in a subject provokes an immune response in the subject that is severe enough such that the rejection of the material by the immune system cannot be adequately controlled and often is of a degree such that the material must be removed from the subject in order for the subject to be as well as it was before the non biocompatible material was introduced into the subject. One test to determine biocompatibility of a material is to expose the material to cells e.g. fibroblasts or epithelial cells in vitro the material is considered biocompatible if it does not result in significant cell death at moderate concentrations e.g. at concentrations of about 50 micrograms 10cells. In certain embodiments there is no significant cell death if less than about 20 of the cells are dead even if phagocytosed or otherwise uptaken by the cells. In some embodiments a material is biocompatible if contacting it with cells in vitro results in less than 20 cell death and if the administration of the material in vivo does not induce unwanted inflammation or other adverse responses. In certain embodiments a biocompatible material is biodegradable. A non limiting example of biocompatible materials is biocompatible polymers including biocompatible copolymers .

A biodegradable material refers to a material that is able to degrade chemically and or biologically e.g. by hydrolysis or enzymatic activity within a physiological environment such as within the body or when introduced to cells. For instance the material may be one that hydrolyzes spontaneously upon exposure to water e.g. within a subject and or may degrade upon exposure to heat e.g. at temperatures of about 37 C. . Degradation of a material may occur at varying rates depending on the material used. For example the half life of the material the time at which 50 of the material is degraded into smaller components may be on the order of days weeks months or years. The material may be biologically degraded e.g. by enzymatic activity or cellular machinery for example through exposure to a lysozyme. In some embodiments the material may be broken down into smaller components that cells can either reuse or dispose of without significant toxic effect on the cells e.g. fewer than about 20 of the cells are killed when the components are added to cells in vitro . Non limiting examples of biodegradable materials are biodegradable polymers including biodegradable copolymers . Examples of biodegradable polymers include but are not limited to poly ethylene glycol poly propylene oxide poly ethylene glycol triblock copolymers poly vinyl alcohol PVA poly lactide or poly lactic acid poly glycolide or poly glycolic acid poly orthoesters poly caprolactones polylysine poly ethylene imine poly acrylic acid poly urethanes poly anhydrides poly esters poly trimethylene carbonate poly ethyleneimine poly acrylic acid poly urethane poly beta amino esters and copolymers thereof e.g. poly lactide co glycolide PLGA .

Combinations of the above referenced ranges are possible e.g. a molecular weight of at least about 2 kDa and less than about 15 kDa . Other ranges are also possible. The molecular weight of the polymer of the coating may be determined using any known technique such as light scattering and gel permeation chromatography. Other methods are known in the art. Although the particles of the invention and the coating thereof may each include polymers in some embodiments the particles of the invention comprise a hydrophobic material that is not a polymer or pharmaceutical agent. Non limiting examples of non polymeric hydrophobic materials include for example metals waxes and organic materials e.g. organic silanes and perfluorinated or fluorinated organic materials .

In some embodiments the surface altering agents or portions thereof are chosen to facilitate transport of the particle through or into a mucosal barrier e.g. mucus or a mucosal membrane . In certain embodiments described herein one or more surface altering agents are oriented in a particular configuration in the coating. In some embodiments in which a surface altering agent is a triblock copolymer such as a triblock copolymer having a hydrophilic block hydrophobic block hydrophilic block configuration a hydrophobic block may be oriented towards the surface of the core and hydrophilic blocks may be oriented away from the core surface e.g. towards the exterior of the particle . The hydrophilic blocks may have characteristics that facilitate transport of the particle through a mucosal barrier. The particular chemical makeup and or components of the coating and surface altering agent s can be chosen so as to impart certain functionality to the particles such as enhanced transport through mucosal barriers.

In some embodiments at least one particle of the invention includes a core and a coating surrounding the core. A particle including a core and a coating on the core is referred to as a coated particle. In certain embodiments at least one particle of the invention includes a core but not a coating on the core. A particle including a core but not a coating on the core is referred to as an uncoated particle. 

It should be understood that a coating which surrounds a core need not completely surround the core although such embodiments may be possible. For example the coating may surround at least about 10 at least about 30 at least about 50 at least about 70 at least about 90 or at least about 99 of the surface area of a core. In some cases the coating substantially surrounds a core. In other cases the coating completely surrounds a core. In other embodiments a coating surrounds less than about 100 less than about 90 less than about 70 or less than about 50 of the surface area of a core. Combinations of the above referenced ranges are also possible e.g. surrounding at least 70 and less than 100 of the surface area of a core .

The material of the coating may be distributed evenly across a surface of the core in some cases and unevenly in other cases. For example the coating may include portions e.g. holes that do not include any material. If desired the coating may be designed to allow penetration and or transport of certain molecules and components into or out of the coating but may prevent penetration and or transport of other molecules and components into or out of the coating. The ability of certain molecules to penetrate and or be transported into and or across a coating may depend on for example the packing density of the surface altering agents forming the coating and the chemical and physical properties of the components forming the coating. As described herein the coating may include one layer of material i.e. a monolayer or multilayers of materials. A single type or multiple types of surface altering agent may be present.

The coating of particles of the invention can have any suitable thickness. For example the coating may have an average thickness of at least about 1 nm at least about 3 nm at least about 10 nm at least about 30 nm at least about 100 nm at least about 300 nm at least about 1 m or at least about 3 m. In some cases the average thickness of the coating is less than about 3 m less than about 1 m less than about 300 nm less than about 100 nm less than about 30 nm less than about 10 nm or less than about 3 nm. Combinations of the above referenced ranges are also possible e.g. an average thickness of at least about 1 nm and less than about 100 nm . Other ranges are also possible. For particles having multiple coatings each coating may have one of the thicknesses described herein.

The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may allow for the coating of the particles of the invention with hydrophilic surface altering moieties without requiring covalent association of the surface altering moieties to the surface of the core. In some embodiments the core having a hydrophobic surface is coated with a polymer described herein thereby causing a plurality of surface altering moieties to be on the surface of the core without substantially altering the characteristics of the core itself. For example the surface altering agent may be present on e.g. adsorbed to the outer surface of the core. In other embodiments a surface altering agent is covalently linked to the core.

In certain embodiments in which the surface altering agent is adsorbed onto a surface of the core the surface altering agent may be in equilibrium with other molecules of the surface altering agent in solution optionally with other components e.g. in a pharmaceutical composition . In some cases the adsorbed surface altering agent may be present on the surface of the core at a density described herein. The density may be an average density as the surface altering agent is in equilibrium with other components in solution.

In some embodiments the present invention relates to coated particles comprising a core comprising crystalline Form A or crystalline Form B of Compound 3 described herein and a coating surrounding the core. In some embodiments the coating comprises a hydrophilic material. The coating may comprise one or more surface altering agents described herein such as a polymer and or a surfactant e.g. a PVA a poloxamer a polysorbate e.g. TWEEN 80 . Other coatings or surface altering agents useful in the present invention are described for example in U.S. patent Publication Nos. 2013 0316001 2013 0316006 2013 0323179 2013 0316009 2012 0121718 2010 0215580 and 2008 0166414 which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.

In some embodiments the compositions and methods involve the use of poloxamers that aid particle transport in mucus. Poloxamers are typically nonionic triblock copolymers comprising a central hydrophobic block e.g. a poly propylene oxide block flanked by two hydrophilic blocks e.g. poly ethylene oxide blocks . Poloxamers have the trade name PLURONIC . Examples of PLURONIC polymers that may be useful in the embodiments described herein include but are not limited to F127 poloxamer 407 F38 F108 poloxamer 338 F68 F77 F87 F88 F98 L101 L121 L31 L35 L43 L44 L61 L62 L64 L81 L92 N3 P103 P104 P105 P123 P65 P84 and P85. In certain embodiments the molecular weight of the hydrophobic block of the triblock copolymer of the hydrophilic block hydrophobic block hydrophilic block configuration is at least about 2 kDa and the two hydrophilic blocks constitute at least about 15 wt of the triblock copolymer.

In certain embodiments the compositions and methods involve the use of polysorbates that aid particle transport in mucus. Polysorbates are typically derived from PEGylated sorbitan a derivative of sorbitol esterified with fatty acids. Common brand names for polysorbates include TWEEN ALKEST CANARCEL . Examples of polysorbates include polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate e.g. TWEEN 80 polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate e.g. TWEEN 60 polyoxyethylene sorbitan monopalmitate e.g. TWEEN 40 and polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate e.g. TWEEN 20 .

It should be understood that components and configurations other than those described herein may be suitable for certain particles and pharmaceutical compositions and that not all of the components described are necessarily present in some embodiments.

In some embodiments particles of the invention when introduced into a subject may interact with one or more components in the subject such as mucus cells tissues organs particles fluids e.g. blood microorganisms and portions or combinations thereof. In some embodiments the coating of the inventive particle can be designed to include surface altering agents or other components with properties that allow favorable interactions e.g. transport binding and adsorption with one or more materials from the subject. For example the coating may include surface altering agents or other components having a certain hydrophilicity hydrophobicity surface charge functional group specificity for binding and or density to facilitate or reduce particular interactions in the subject. One example is choosing a hydrophilicity hydrophobicity surface charge functional group specificity for binding and or density of one or more surface altering agents to reduce the physical and or chemical interactions between the particle and mucus of the subject so as to enhance the mobility of the particle through mucus. Other examples are described in more detail below.

In some embodiments once a particle is successfully transported into and or across a mucosal barrier e.g. mucus or a mucosal membrane in a subject further interactions between the particle and the subject may take place. In some embodiments in which the core comprises a pharmaceutical agent or compound of the invention the conversion breakdown release and or transport of the pharmaceutical agent from the particle can lead to certain beneficial and or therapeutic effects in the subject. Therefore the particles of the invention can be used for the treatment and or prevention of certain diseases.

Examples for the use of the particles of the invention are provided below in the context of being suitable for administration to a mucosal barrier e.g. mucus or a mucosal membrane in a subject. It should be appreciated that while many of the embodiments herein are described in this context and in the context of providing a benefit for diseases that involve transport of materials across a mucosal barrier the invention is not limited as such and the particles pharmaceutical compositions and kits of the invention may be used to treat and or prevent other diseases.

In some embodiments the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention comprise MPPs that include a crystalline form of Compound 3 and optionally at least one additional pharmaceutical agent each of which is associated with polymer carriers via encapsulation or other processes. In other embodiments the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention comprise MPPs without any polymeric carriers or with minimal use of polymeric carriers. Polymer based MPPs may have one or more inherent limitations in some embodiments. In particular in light of drug delivery applications these limitations may include one or more of the following. A Low drug encapsulation efficiency and low drug loading encapsulation of drugs into polymeric particles is often inefficient as generally less than 10 of the total amount of drug used gets encapsulated into particles during manufacturing additionally drug loadings above 50 are rarely achieved. B Convenience of usage pharmaceutical compositions based on drug loaded polymeric particles in general typically need to be stored as dry powder to avoid premature drug release and thus require either point of use re constitution or a sophisticated dosing device. C Biocompatibility accumulation of slowly degrading polymer carriers following repeated dosing and their toxicity over the long term present a major concern for polymeric drug carriers. D Chemical and physical stability polymer degradation may compromise stability of encapsulated drugs. In many encapsulation processes the drug undergoes a transition from a solution phase to a solid phase which is not well controlled in terms of physical form of the emerging solid phase i.e. amorphous vs. crystalline vs. crystalline polymorphs this is a concern for multiple aspects of pharmaceutical composition performance including physical and chemical stability and release kinetics. E Manufacturing complexity manufacturing especially scalability of drug loaded polymeric MPPs is a fairly complex process that may involve multiple steps and a considerable amount of toxic organic solvents. Therefore by avoiding or minimizing the need to encapsulate pharmaceutical agents into polymeric carriers certain limitations of polymeric MPPs with respect to drug loading convenience of usage biocompatibility stability and or complexity of manufacturing may be addressed.

It should be appreciated however that in other embodiments pharmaceutical agents may be associated with polymer carriers via encapsulation or other processes. Thus the description provided herein is not limited in this respect. For instance despite the above mentioned drawbacks of certain mucus penetrating particles including a polymeric carrier in certain embodiments such particles may be preferred. For example it may be preferable to use polymer carriers for controlled release purposes and or for encapsulating certain pharmaceutical agents that are difficult to formulate into particles. As such in some embodiments described herein particles that include a polymer carrier are described.

In some embodiments the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention involve the use of poly vinyl alcohols PVAs a water soluble non ionic synthetic polymer to aid particle transport in mucus such as described in U.S. patent Publication No. 2013 0316009 which is herein incorporated by referenced in its entirety. The pharmaceutical compositions may involve making MPPs or MPCs by for example an emulsification process in the presence of specific PVAs. In certain embodiments the pharmaceutical compositions and methods involve making MPPs or MPCs from pre fabricated particles by non covalent coating with specific PVAs. In some embodiments the pharmaceutical compositions and methods involve making MPPs in the presence of specific PVAs without any polymeric carriers or with minimal use of polymeric carriers. It should be appreciated however that in other embodiments polymeric carriers can be used.

Particles of the invention comprising crystalline forms of Compound 3 e.g. crystalline Form B may have reduced mucoadhesiveness. A material in need of increased diffusivity through mucus may be hydrophobic may include many hydrogen bond donors or acceptors and or may be highly charged. In some cases the material may include a crystalline or amorphous solid material. The material which may serve as a core may be coated with a suitable polymer described herein thereby forming a particle with a plurality of surface altering moieties on the surface resulting in reduced mucoadhesion. Particles of the invention having reduced mucoadhesion may alternatively be characterized as having increased transport through mucus being mobile in mucus or mucus penetrating i.e. mucus penetrating particles meaning that the particles are transported through mucus faster than a negative control particle. The negative control particle may be a particle that is known to be mucoadhesive e.g. an unmodified particle or core that is not coated with a coating described herein such as a 200 nm carboxylated polystyrene particle.

Particles of the invention may be adapted for delivery e.g. ocular delivery to mucus or a mucosal surface of a subject. The particles with surface altering moieties may be delivered to the mucosal surface of a subject may pass through the mucosal barrier in the subject and or prolonged retention and or increased uniform distribution of the particles at mucosal surfaces e.g. due to reduced mucoadhesion.

Furthermore in some embodiments the particles of the invention having reduced mucoadhesion facilitate better distribution of the particles at the surface of a tissue of a subject and or have a prolonged presence at the surface of the tissue compared to particles that are more mucoadhesive. For example a luminal space such as the gastrointestinal tract is surrounded by a mucus coated surface. Mucoadhesive particles delivered to such a space are typically removed from the luminal space and from the mucus coated surface by the subject s natural clearance mechanisms. The particles of the invention with reduced mucoadhesion may remain in the luminal space for relatively longer periods compared to the mucoadhesive particles. This prolonged presence may prevent or reduce clearance of the particles and or may allow for better distribution of the particles on the surface of the tissue. The prolonged presence may also affect the particle transport through the luminal space e.g. the particles may distribute into the mucus layer and may reach the underlying epithelium.

In certain embodiments the core of the particles of the invention coated with the polymer of the coating may pass through mucus or a mucosal barrier in a subject exhibit prolonged retention and or increase uniform distribution of the particles at mucosal surfaces e.g. such substances are cleared more slowly e.g. at least about 2 times about 5 times about 10 times or even at least about 20 times more slowly from a subject s body as compared to a negative control particle of the invention.

The mobility of the particles of the invention in mucus may be characterized in e.g. the relative velocity and or diffusivity of the particles. In certain embodiments the particles of the invention have certain relative velocity which is defined as follows 

The relative velocity can be measured by a multiple particle tracking technique. For instance a fluorescent microscope equipped with a CCD camera can be used to capture 15 s movies at a temporal resolution of 66.7 ms 15 frames s under 100 magnification from several areas within each sample for each type of particles sample negative control and positive control. The sample negative control and positive control may be fluorescent particles to observe tracking. Alternatively non fluorescent particles may be coated with a fluorescent molecule a fluorescently tagged surface agent or a fluorescently tagged polymer. An advanced image processing software e.g. Image Pro or MetaMorph can be used to measure individual trajectories of multiple particles over a time scale of at least 3.335 s 50 frames .

In some embodiments a particle described herein has a relative velocity of greater than or equal to about 0.3 greater than or equal to about 0.4 greater than or equal to about 0.5 greater than or equal to about 0.6 greater than or equal to about 0.7 greater than or equal to about 0.8 greater than or equal to about 0.9 greater than or equal to about 1.0 greater than or equal to about 1.1 greater than or equal to about 1.2 greater than or equal to about 1.3 greater than or equal to about 1.4 greater than or equal to about 1.5 greater than or equal to about 1.6 greater than or equal to about 1.7 greater than or equal to about 1.8 greater than or equal to about 1.9 or greater than or equal to about 2.0 in mucus. In some embodiments a particle described herein has a relative velocity of less than or equal to about 10.0 less than or equal to about 8.0 less than or equal to about 6.0 less than or equal to about 4.0 less than or equal to about 3.0 less than or equal to about 2.0 less than or equal to about 1.9 less than or equal to about 1.8 less than or equal to about 1.7 less than or equal to about 1.6 less than or equal to about 1.5 less than or equal to about 1.4 less than or equal to about 1.3 less than or equal to about 1.2 less than or equal to about 1.1 less than or equal to about 1.0 less than or equal to about 0.9 less than or equal to about 0.8 or less than or equal to about 1.7 in mucus. Combinations of the above noted ranges are possible e.g. a relative velocity of greater than or equal to about 0.5 and less than or equal to about 6.0 . Other ranges are also possible. The mucus may be for example human cervicovaginal mucus.

In some cases a particle described herein may pass through mucus or a mucosal barrier at a rate of diffusivity that is at least about 10 times 20 times 30 times 50 times 100 times 200 times 500 times 1000 times 2000 times 5000 times 10000 times or more higher than a control particle or a corresponding particle. In some cases a particle described herein may pass through mucus or a mucosal barrier at a rate of diffusivity that is less than or equal to about 10000 times higher less than or equal to about 5000 times higher less than or equal to about 2000 times higher less than or equal to about 1000 times higher less than or equal to about 500 times higher less than or equal to about 200 times higher less than or equal to about 100 times higher less than or equal to about 50 times higher less than or equal to about 30 times higher less than or equal to about 20 times higher or less than or equal to about 10 times higher than a control particle or a corresponding particle. Combinations of the above referenced ranges are also possible e.g. at least about 10 times and less than or equal to about 1000 times higher than a control particle or a corresponding particle . Other ranges are also possible.

For the purposes of the comparisons described herein the corresponding particles may be approximately the same size shape and or density as the particles of the invention but lack the coating that makes the particles of the invention mobile in mucus. In some embodiments the measurement of the geometric mean square displacement and rate of diffusivity of the particles e.g. the corresponding particles and particles of the invention is based on a time scale of about 1 second about 3 seconds or about 10 seconds. Methods for determining the geometric mean square displacement and rate of diffusivity are known in the art. The particles of the invention may pass through mucus or a mucosal barrier with a geometric mean squared displacement that is at least about 10 times about 30 times about 100 times about 300 times about 1000 times about 3000 times about 10000 times higher than corresponding particles or negative control particles. In some embodiments the particles of the invention pass through mucus or a mucosal barrier with a geometric mean squared displacement that is less than about 10000 times higher less than about 3000 times higher less than about 1000 times higher less than about 300 times higher less than about 100 times higher less than about 30 times higher or less than about 10 times higher than negative control particles or corresponding particles. Combinations of the above referenced ranges are also possible e.g. at least about 10 times and less than about 1000 times higher than negative control particles or corresponding particles . Other ranges are also possible.

In some embodiments particles of the invention diffuse through a mucosal barrier at a rate approaching the rate or diffusivity at which the particles can diffuse through water. In some embodiments the particles of the invention pass through a mucosal barrier at a rate or diffusivity that is less than about 1 100 less than about 1 300 less than about 1 1000 less than about 1 3000 less than about 1 10 000 of the diffusivity that the particles diffuse through water under similar conditions. In some embodiments particles of the invention pass through a mucosal barrier at a rate or diffusivity that is greater than or equal to about 1 10 000 greater than or equal to about 1 3000 greater than or equal to about 1 1000 greater than or equal to about 1 300 or greater than or equal to about 1 100 of the diffusivity that the particles diffuse through water under similar conditions. Combinations of the above referenced ranges are also possible e.g. greater than or equal to about 1 3000 and less than 1 300 the diffusivity that the particles diffuse through water under similar conditions . Other ranges are also possible. The measurement of diffusivity may be based on a time scale of about 1 second or about 0.5 second or about 2 seconds or about 5 seconds or about 10 seconds.

In some embodiments the particles of the invention diffuse through human cervicovaginal mucus at a diffusivity that is less than about 1 500 of the diffusivity that the particles diffuse through water. In some embodiments the measurement of diffusivity is based on a time scale of about 1 second or about 0.5 second or about 2 seconds or about 5 seconds or about 10 seconds.

In certain embodiments the present invention provides particles that travel through mucus such as human cervicovaginal mucus at certain absolute diffusivities. For example the particles of described herein may travel at diffusivities of at least about 1 10 m s 2 10 m s 5 10 m s 1 10 m s 2 10 m s 5 10 m s 1 10 m s 2 10 m s 4 10 m s 5 10 m s 6 10 m s 8 10 m s 1 10 m s 2 10 m s 5 10 m s 1 m s or 2 m s. In some cases the particles may travel at diffusivities of less than or equal to about 2 m s less than or equal to about 1 m s less than or equal to about 5 10 m s less than or equal to about 2 10 m s less than or equal to about 1 10 m s less than or equal to about 8 10 m s less than or equal to about 6 10 m s less than or equal to about 5 10 m s less than or equal to about 4 10 m s less than or equal to about 2 10 m s less than or equal to about 1 10 m s less than or equal to about 5 10 m s less than or equal to about 2 10 m s less than or equal to about 1 10 m s less than or equal to about 5 10 m s less than or equal to about 2 10 m s or less than or equal to about 1 10 m s. Combinations of the above referenced ranges are also possible e.g. greater than or equal to about 2 10 m s and less than or equal to about 1 10 m s . Other ranges are also possible. In some cases the measurement is based on a time scale of about 1 second or about 0.5 second or about 2 seconds or about 5 seconds or about 10 seconds.

It should be appreciated that while the mobility e.g. relative velocity and diffusivity of the particles of the invention may be measured in human cervicovaginal mucus the mobility may be measured in other types of mucus as well.

In certain embodiments a particle described herein comprises surface altering moieties at a given density. The surface altering moieties may be the portions of a surface altering agent that are for example exposed to the solvent containing the particle. As an example the hydrolyzed units blocks of PVA may be surface altering moieties of the surface altering agent PVA. In another example the PEG segments may be surface altering moieties of the surface altering agent PEG PPO PEG. In some cases the surface altering moieties and or surface altering agents are present at a density of at least about 0.001 units or molecules per nm at least about 0.002 at least about 0.005 at least about 0.01 at least about 0.02 at least about 0.05 at least about 0.1 at least about 0.2 at least about 0.5 at least about 1 at least about 2 at least about 5 at least about 10 at least about 20 at least about 50 at least about 100 units or molecules per nm or more units or molecules per nm. In some cases the surface altering moieties and or surface altering agents are present at a density of less than or equal to about 100 units or molecules per nm less than or equal to about 50 less than or equal to about 20 less than or equal to about 10 less than or equal to about 5 less than or equal to about 2 less than or equal to about 1 less than or equal to about 0.5 less than or equal to about 0.2 less than or equal to about 0.1 less than or equal to about 0.05 less than or equal to about 0.02 or less than or equal to about 0.01 units or molecules per nm. Combinations of the above referenced ranges are possible e.g. a density of at least about 0.01 and less than or equal to about 1 units or molecules per nm . Other ranges are also possible. In some embodiments the density values described above may be an average density as the surface altering agent is in equilibrium with other components in solution.

Those skilled in the art would be aware of methods to estimate the average density of surface altering moieties see for example Budijono et al. 2010 360 105 110 Joshi et al. 1979 104 153 160 . For example as described herein the average density of surface altering moieties can be determined using HPLC quantitation and DLS analysis. A suspension of particles for which surface density determination is of interest is first sized using DLS a small volume is diluted to an appropriate concentration e.g. about 100 g mL and the z average diameter is taken as a representative measurement of particle size. The remaining suspension is then divided into two aliquots. Using HPLC the first aliquot is assayed for the total concentration of core material and for the total concentration of the surface altering moiety. Again using HPLC the second aliquot is assayed for the concentration of free or unbound surface altering moiety. In order to get only the free or unbound surface altering moiety from the second aliquot the particles and therefore any bound surface altering moiety are removed by ultracentrifugation. By subtracting the concentration of the unbound surface altering moiety from the total concentration of surface altering moiety the concentration of bound surface altering moiety can be determined. Since the total concentration of core material was also determined from the first aliquot the mass ratio between the core material and the surface altering moiety can be determined. Using the molecular weight of the surface altering moiety the number of surface altering moiety to mass of core material can be calculated. To turn this number into a surface density measurement the surface area per mass of core material needs to be calculated. The volume of the particle is approximated as that of a sphere with the diameter obtained from DLS allowing for the calculation of the surface area per mass of core material. In this way the number of surface altering moieties per surface area can be determined.

In certain embodiments the particles of the invention comprise surface altering moieties and or agents that affect the zeta potential of the particle. The zeta potential of the particle may be for example at least about 100 mV at least about 30 mV at least about 10 mV at least about 3 mV at least about 3 mV at least about 10 mV at least about 30 mV or at least about 100 mV. The zeta potential of the particle may also be for example less than about 100 mV less than about 30 mV less than about 10 mV less than about 3 mV less than about 3 mV less than about 10 mV less than about 30 mV or less than about 100 mV. Combinations of the above referenced ranges are possible e.g. a zeta potential of at least about 30 mV and less than about 30 mV . Other ranges are also possible.

The coated particles described herein may have any suitable shape and or size. In some embodiments a coated particle has a shape substantially similar to the shape of the core. In some cases a coated particle described herein may be a nanoparticle i.e. the particle has a characteristic dimension of less than about 1 micrometer where the characteristic dimension of the particle is the diameter of a perfect sphere having the same volume as the particle. In other embodiments larger sizes are possible e.g. about 1 10 microns . A plurality of particles in some embodiments may also be characterized by an average size e.g. an average largest cross sectional dimension or an average smallest cross sectional dimension for the plurality of particles . A plurality of particles may have an average size of for example less than or equal to about 10 m less than or equal to about 5 m less than or equal to about 1 m less than or equal to about 800 nm less than or equal to about 700 nm less than or equal to about 500 nm less than or equal to 400 nm less than or equal to 300 nm less than or equal to about 200 nm less than or equal to about 100 nm less than or equal to about 75 nm less than or equal to about 50 nm less than or equal to about 40 nm less than or equal to about 35 nm less than or equal to about 30 nm less than or equal to about 25 nm less than or equal to about 20 nm less than or equal to about 15 nm or less than or equal to about 5 nm.

In some embodiments particles described herein that may be administered in inhalant or aerosol formulations comprise one or more pharmaceutical agents such as adjuvants diagnostic agents imaging agents or therapeutic agents useful in inhalation therapy. The particle size of the particulate medicament should be such as to permit inhalation of substantially all of the medicament into the lungs upon administration of the aerosol formulation and may be for example less than about 20 microns e.g. in the range of about 1 to about 10 microns e.g. about 1 to about 5 microns although other ranges are also possible. The particle size of the medicament may be reduced by conventional means for example by milling or micronisation. Alternatively the particulate medicament can be administered to the lungs via nebulization of a suspension. The final aerosol formulation may contain for example between 0.005 90 w w between 0.005 50 between 0.005 10 between about 0.005 5 w w or between 0.01 1.0 w w of medicament relative to the total weight of the formulation. Other ranges are also possible.

It is desirable but by no means required that the formulations described herein contain no components which may provoke the degradation of stratospheric ozone. In particular in some embodiments propellants are selected that do not contain or do not consist essentially of chlorofluorocarbons such as CClF CClF and CFCCl.

The aerosol may comprise propellant. The propellant may optionally contain an adjuvant having a higher polarity and or a higher boiling point than the propellant. Polar adjuvants which may be used include e.g. C aliphatic alcohols and polyols such as ethanol isopropanol and propylene glycol preferably ethanol. In general only small quantities of polar adjuvants e.g. 0.05 3.0 w w may be required to improve the stability of the dispersion the use of quantities in excess of 5 w w may tend to dissolve the medicament. Formulations in accordance with the embodiments described herein may contain less than 1 w w e.g. about 0.1 w w of polar adjuvant. However the formulations described herein may be substantially free of polar adjuvants especially ethanol. Suitable volatile adjuvants include saturated hydrocarbons such as propane n butane isobutane pentane and isopentane and alkyl ethers such as dimethyl ether. In general up to 50 w w of the propellant may comprise a volatile adjuvant for example up to 30 w w of a volatile saturated C Chydrocarbon. Optionally the aerosol formulations according to the invention may further comprise one or more surfactants. The surfactants can be physiologically acceptable upon administration by inhalation. Within this category are included surfactants such as L phosphatidylcholine PC 1 2 dipalmitoylphosphatidycholine DPPC oleic acid sorbitan trioleate sorbitan mono oleate sorbitan monolaurate polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate natural lecithin oleyl polyoxyethylene ether stearyl polyoxyethylene ether lauryl polyoxyethylene ether block copolymers of oxyethylene and oxypropylene synthetic lecithin diethylene glycol dioleate tetrahydrofurfuryl oleate ethyl oleate isopropyl myristate glyceryl monooleate glyceryl monostearate glyceryl monoricinoleate cetyl alcohol stearyl alcohol polyethylene glycol 400 cetyl pyridinium chloride benzalkonium chloride olive oil glyceryl monolaurate corn oil cotton seed oil and sunflower seed oil.

The formulations described herein may be prepared by dispersal of the particles in the selected propellant and or co propellant in an appropriate container e.g. with the aid of sonication. The particles may be suspended in co propellant and filled into a suitable container. The valve of the container is then sealed into place and the propellant introduced by pressure filling through the valve in the conventional manner. The particles may be thus suspended or dissolved in a liquefied propellant sealed in a container with a metering valve and fitted into an actuator. Such metered dose inhalers are well known in the art. The metering valve may meter 10 to 500 L and preferably 25 to 150 L. In certain embodiments dispersal may be achieved using dry powder inhalers e.g. spinhaler for the particles which remain as dry powders . In other embodiments nanospheres may be suspended in an aqueous fluid and nebulized into fine droplets to be aerosolized into the lungs.

Sonic nebulizers may be used because they minimize exposing the agent to shear which may result in degradation of the particles. Ordinarily an aqueous aerosol is made by formulating an aqueous solution or suspension of the particles together with conventional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and stabilizers. The carriers and stabilizers vary with the requirements of the particular composition but typically include non ionic surfactants TWEENS PLURONIC or polyethylene glycol innocuous proteins like serum albumin sorbitan esters oleic acid lecithin amino acids such as glycine buffers salts sugars or sugar alcohols. Aerosols generally are prepared from isotonic solutions.

It is appreciated in the art that the ionic strength of an inventive pharmaceutical composition that comprises a plurality of particles of the invention may affect the polydispersity of the plurality of the particles. The ionic strength may also affect the colloidal stability of the plurality of the particles. For example a relatively high ionic strength of the pharmaceutical composition may cause the plurality of particles to coagulate and therefore may destabilize the pharmaceutical composition. In some embodiments the pharmaceutical composition is stabilized by repulsive inter particle forces. For example the plurality of particles may be electrically or electrostatically charged. Two charged particles may repel each other preventing collision and aggregation. When the repulsive inter particle forces weaken or become attractive the plurality of particles may start to aggregate. For instance when the ionic strength of the pharmaceutical composition is increased to a certain level the charges e.g. negative charges of the plurality of particles may be neutralized by the oppositely charged ions present in the pharmaceutical composition e.g. Na ions in solution . As a result the plurality of particles may collide and bond to each other to form aggregates e.g. clusters or flocs of larger sizes. The formed aggregates of particles may also differ in size and thus the polydispersity of the pharmaceutical composition may also increase. For example an inventive pharmaceutical composition comprising similarly sized particles may become a pharmaceutical composition comprising particles having various sizes e.g. due to aggregation when the ionic strength of the pharmaceutical composition is increased beyond a certain level. In the course of aggregation the aggregates may grow in size and eventually settle to the bottom of the container and the pharmaceutical composition is considered colloidally unstable. Once the plurality of particles in a pharmaceutical composition form aggregates it is usually difficult to disrupt the aggregates into individual particles.

Certain pharmaceutical compositions of the invention show unexpected properties in that among other things the presence of one or more ionic tonicity agents e.g. a salt such as NaCl in the pharmaceutical compositions at certain concentrations actually decreases or maintains the degree of aggregation of the particles present in the pharmaceutical compositions and or does not significantly increase aggregation. In certain embodiments the polydispersity of the pharmaceutical composition decreases is relatively constant or does not change by an appreciable amount upon addition of one or more ionic tonicity agents into the pharmaceutical composition. For example in some embodiments the polydispersity of a pharmaceutical composition is relatively constant in the presence of added ionic strength and or when the added ionic strength of the pharmaceutical composition is kept relatively constant or increased e.g. during a formation and or dilution process described herein . In certain embodiments when the ionic strength increases by at least 50 the polydispersity increases by less than about 300 less than about 100 less than about 30 less than about 10 less than about 3 or less than about 1 . In certain embodiments when the ionic strength is increased by at least 50 the polydispersity increases by greater than or equal to about 1 greater than or equal to about 3 greater than or equal to about 10 greater than or equal to about 30 or greater than or equal to about 100 . Combinations of the above noted ranges are possible e.g. an increase in polydispersity of less than 30 and greater than or equal to 3 . Other ranges are also possible.

The ionic strength of a pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be controlled e.g. increased decreased or maintained through a variety of means such as the addition of one or more ionic tonicity agents e.g. a salt such as NaCl to the pharmaceutical composition. In certain embodiments the ionic strength of a pharmaceutical composition of the invention is greater than or equal to about 0.0003 M greater than or equal to about 0.001 M greater than or equal to about 0.003 M greater than or equal to about 0.01 M greater than or equal to about 0.03 M greater than or equal to about 0.1 M greater than or equal to about 0.3 M greater than or equal to about 1 M greater than or equal to about 3 M or greater than or equal to about 10 M. In certain embodiments the ionic strength of a pharmaceutical composition of the invention is less than about 10 M less than about 3 M less than about 1 M less than about 0.3 M less than about 0.1 M less than about 0.03 M less than about 0.01 M less than about 0.003 M less than about 0.001 M or less than about 0.0003 M. Combinations of the above noted ranges are possible e.g. an ionic strength of greater than or equal to about 0.01 M and less than about 1 M . Other ranges are also possible. In certain embodiments the ionic strength of a pharmaceutical composition of the invention is about 0.1 M about 0.15 M or about 0.3 M.

In certain embodiments the polydispersity of a pharmaceutical composition does not change upon addition of one or more ionic tonicity agents into the pharmaceutical composition. In certain embodiments the polydispersity does not significantly increase upon addition of one or more ionic tonicity agents into the pharmaceutical composition. In certain embodiments the polydispersity increases to a level described herein upon addition of one or more ionic tonicity agents into the pharmaceutical composition.

The polydispersity of an inventive pharmaceutical composition that comprises a plurality of particles of the invention may be measured by the polydispersity index PDI . In certain embodiments the PDI of the pharmaceutical composition is less than about 1 less than about 0.8 less than about 0.6 less than about 0.4 less than about 0.3 less than about 0.2 less than about 0.15 less than about 0.1 less than about 0.05 less than about 0.01 or less than about 0.005. In certain embodiments the PDI of the pharmaceutical composition is greater than or equal to about 0.005 greater than or equal to about 0.01 greater than or equal to about 0.05 greater than or equal to about 0.1 greater than or equal to about 0.15 greater than or equal to about 0.2 greater than or equal to about 0.3 greater than or equal to about 0.4 greater than or equal to about 0.6 greater than or equal to about 0.8 or greater than or equal to about 1. Combinations of the above noted ranges are possible e.g. a PDI of greater than or equal to about 0.1 and less than about 0.5 . Other ranges are also possible. In certain embodiments the PDI of the pharmaceutical composition is about 0.1 about 0.15 or about 0.2. In certain embodiments the pharmaceutical composition is highly dispersible and does not tend to form aggregates. Even when the particles do form aggregates the aggregates may be easily broken up into individual particles without rigorously agitating the pharmaceutical composition.

For example in some embodiments the polydispersity of a composition and or formulation is relatively constant in the presence of added ionic strength and or when the added ionic strength of the composition and or formulation is kept relatively constant or increased e.g. during a formation and or dilution process . In certain embodiments when the ionic strength increases by at least 50 the polydispersity increases by less than or equal to about 200 less than or equal to about 150 less than or equal to about 100 less than or equal to about 75 less than or equal to about 50 less than or equal to about 30 less than or equal to about 20 less than or equal to about 10 less than or equal to about 3 or less than or equal to about 1 . In certain embodiments when the ionic strength is increased by at least 50 the polydispersity increases by greater than or equal to about 1 greater than or equal to about 3 greater than or equal to about 10 greater than or equal to about 30 or greater than or equal to about 100 . Combinations of the above noted ranges are possible e.g. an increase in polydispersity of less than or equal to 50 and greater than or equal to 1 . Other ranges are also possible.

Generally it is desired that a formulation is sterile before or upon administration to a subject. A sterile formulation is essentially free of pathogenic microorganisms such as bacteria microbes fungi viruses spores yeasts molds and others generally associated with infections. In some embodiments compositions and or formulations including the coated particles described herein may be subject to an aseptic process and or other sterilization process. An aseptic process typically involves sterilizing the components of a formulation final formulation and or container closure of a drug product through a process such as heat gamma irradiation ethylene oxide or filtration and then combining in a sterile environment. In some cases an aseptic process is preferred. In other embodiments terminal sterilization is preferred.

Examples of other sterilization methods include radiation sterilization e.g. gamma electron or x ray radiation heat sterilization sterile filtration and ethylene oxide sterilization. The terms radiation and irradiation are used herein interchangeably. Unlike other sterilization methods radiation sterilization has the advantage of high penetrating ability and instantaneous effects without the need to control temperature pressure vacuum or humidity in some instances. In certain embodiments the radiation used to sterilize the coated particles described herein is gamma radiation. Gamma radiation may be applied in an amount sufficient to kill most or substantially all of the microbes in or on the coated particles. The temperature of the coated particles described herein and the rate of radiation may be relatively constant during the entire gamma radiation period. Gamma irradiation may be performed at any suitable temperature e.g. ambient temperature about 40 C. between about 30 to about 50 C. . Unless otherwise indicated measurements of gamma irradiation described herein refer to ones performed at about 40 C.

In certain embodiments the compositions and or formulations described herein are packaged as a ready to use shelf stable suspension. Eye drop formulations are traditionally liquid formulations solutions or suspensions which can be packaged in dropper bottles which dispense a standard drop volume of liquid or in individual use droppers typically used for preservative free drops used once and disposed . They can be stored in suspension and may retain the characteristics which allow the particles to avoid adhesion to mucus.

In one aspect the present invention provides methods of preparing the particles of the invention. Methods of preparing similar particles have been described in U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2013 0316001 2013 0316006 2013 0316009 and 20130323179 each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

The core of the particle may be formed by any suitable method. Suitable methods may include for example top down techniques i.e. techniques based on size reduction of relatively large particles into smaller particles e.g. milling or homogenization or bottom up techniques i.e. techniques based on the growth of particles from smaller particles or individual molecules e.g. precipitation or spray freezing into liquid .

In some embodiments the core of the particle may be coated with a coating. For example the core may be provided or formed in a first step and then the core may be coated in a second step. In some embodiments the core particle is formed and coated substantially simultaneously e.g. in a single step .

In some embodiments the particle is formed by a method that involves using a formulation process a milling process and or a dilution process. In certain embodiments a method of forming the particle includes a milling process optionally with a formulation process and or a dilution process. A formulation process may be used to form a suspension comprising a core material one or more surface altering agents and other components such as solvents tonicity agents chelating agents salts and or buffers e.g. a sodium citrate and citric acid buffer each of which is as described herein. The formulation process may be performed using a formulation vessel. The core material and other components may be added into the formulation vessel at the same time or different times. A mixture of the core material and or one or more other components may be stirred and or shaken or otherwise agitated in the vessel to facilitate suspending the components to form the suspension. The temperature and or pressure of the core material other components and or mixture may also be individually increased or decreased to facilitate the suspending process. In some embodiments the core material and other components are processed as described herein in the formulation vessel under an inert atmosphere e.g. nitrogen or argon and or protected from light. The suspension obtained from the formulation vessel may be subsequently subject to a milling process which may be followed by a dilution process.

In some embodiments involving a core comprising a solid material e.g. crystalline compound of the invention a milling process may be used to reduce the size of the solid material to form particles in a micrometer to nanometer size range. The milling process may be performed using a mill or other suitable apparatus. Dry and wet milling processes such as jet milling cryo milling ball milling media milling sonication and homogenization are known and can be used in methods of the invention. For example in a wet milling process a suspension of the solid material to be used to form the core core material is agitated with or without excipients to reduce the size of the core to be formed. Dry milling is a process wherein the core material is mixed with milling media with or without excipients to reduce the size of the core to be formed. In a cryo milling process a suspension of the core material is mixed with milling media with or without excipients under cooled temperatures. In certain embodiments when surface altering agents are employed a suspension comprising coated particles is obtained from the milling process. In certain embodiments when surface altering agents are not employed a suspension comprising uncoated particles is obtained from the milling process.

The suspension of particles coated or uncoated of the invention obtained from a milling process may be further processed with a dilution process. A dilution process may be used to achieve a target dosing concentration by diluting a suspension of particles that were formed during a milling process with or without surface altering agents and or other components. In certain embodiments when a suspension of coated particles that comprise a first surface altering agent is processed with a dilution process involving a second surface altering agent a suspension of coated particles that comprise the second surface altering agent is obtained from the dilution process. In certain embodiments when a suspension of coated particles that comprise a surface altering agent is processed with a dilution process involving no or the same surface altering agent a suspension of coated particles that comprise the surface altering agent is obtained from the dilution process. In certain embodiments when a suspension of uncoated particles is processed with a dilution process involving a surface altering agent a suspension of coated particles comprising the surface altering agent is obtained from the dilution process. The dilution process may be performed using a product vessel or any other suitable apparatus. In certain embodiments the suspension of the particles is diluted i.e. mixed or otherwise processed with a diluent in the product vessel. The diluent may contain solvents surface altering agents tonicity agents chelating agents salts anti microbial agents or a combination thereof as described herein. The suspension and the diluent may be added into the product vessel at the same time or different times. In certain embodiments when the suspension is obtained from a milling process involving milling media the milling media may be separated from the suspension before the suspension is added into the product vessel. The suspension the diluent or the mixture of the suspension and the diluent may be stirred and or shaken or otherwise agitated to form the particles and or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. The temperature and or pressure of the suspension the diluent or the mixture may also be individually increased or decreased to form the coated particles. In some embodiments the suspension and the diluent are processed in the product vessel under an inert atmosphere e.g. nitrogen or argon and or protected from light.

In some embodiments the core and or coated particles may be produced by milling of a solid material e.g. a pharmaceutical agent in the presence of one or more surface altering agents. Small particles of a solid material may require the presence of one or more surface altering agents which may function as a stabilizer in some embodiments in order to stabilize a suspension of particles without agglomeration or aggregation in a liquid solution. In some such embodiments the stabilizer may act as a surface altering agent forming the coated particles of the invention.

As described herein a method of forming the core and or the coated particles may involve choosing a surface altering agent that is suitable for both milling and forming a coating on the core wherein the coating renders the particle mucus penetrating.

In a wet milling process milling may be performed in a dispersion e.g. an aqueous dispersion containing at least one surface altering agent a grinding medium a solid to be milled e.g. a solid pharmaceutical agent and a solvent.

As described herein in some embodiments a surface altering agent may act as a stabilizer a surfactant and or an emulsifier. In some embodiments the surface altering agent may aid particle transport in mucus.

A stabilizer used for milling may form the coating of a particle of the invention wherein the coating renders the particle mucus penetrating. The stabilizer may also be exchanged with one or more other surface altering agents after the particle has been formed. For example a first stabilizer surface altering agent may be used during a milling process and may form a first coating of the particle of the invention and all or part of the first stabilizer surface altering agent may then be exchanged with a second stabilizer surface altering agent to form a second coating of the particle. In some embodiments the second stabilizer surface altering agent may render the particle mucus penetrating more than the first stabilizer surface altering agent. In some embodiments a particle comprising multiple coatings that include multiple surface altering agents is formed by a method of the invention.

Any suitable grinding medium can be used for milling. In some embodiments a ceramic and or polymeric material and or a metal can be used. Examples of suitable materials include zirconium oxide silicon carbide silicon oxide silicon nitride zirconium silicate yttrium oxide glass alumina alpha alumina aluminum oxide polystyrene poly methyl methacrylate titanium and steel. A grinding medium may have any suitable size. For example the grinding medium may have an average diameter of at least about 0.1 mm at least about 0.2 mm at least about 0.5 mm at least about 0.8 mm at least about 1 mm at least about 2 mm or at least about 5 mm. In some cases the grinding medium may have an average diameter of less than about 5 mm less than about 2 mm less than about 1 mm less than about 0.8 less than about 0.5 mm or less than about 0.2 mm. Combinations of the above referenced ranges are also possible e.g. an average diameter of at least about 0.5 millimeters and less than about 1 mm . Other ranges are also possible.

A solvent may be used for milling. The choice of the solvent suitable for milling may depend on factors like the solid material e.g. a solid pharmaceutical agent being milled the particular type of stabilizer surface altering agent e.g. one that may render the particle mucus penetrating and the grinding material. The solvent suitable for milling may be one of those solvents that do not substantially dissolve the solid material or the grinding material but dissolve the stabilizer surface altering agent to a suitable degree. Examples of the solvents suitable for milling include water aqueous solutions buffered solutions alcohols e.g. ethanol methanol and butanol and mixtures thereof each of which may optionally include other components such as one or more pharmaceutical excipients polymers pharmaceutical agents salts preservative agents viscosity modifiers tonicity modifiers taste masking agents antioxidants and pH modifiers. In some embodiments the solvent suitable for milling is an organic solvent.

A pharmaceutical agent described herein e.g. a crystalline form of Compound 3 may have a suitable solubility in a solvent suitable for milling such as a solubility in one or more ranges described herein for aqueous solubility or for solubility in a coating solution. A pharmaceutical agent having a relatively low solubility in a solvent e.g. water or a coating solution may be preferred because a milling process described herein typically requires a material e.g. a pharmaceutical agent to be in a solid form in order for the material to be milled. In some cases if the material to be milled has a relatively high soluble in a solvent e.g. water or a coating solution used in the milling process milling may not be conducted because significant or complete dissolution of the material to be milled in the solvent will occur. In certain embodiments a relatively high solubility of a solid material e.g. a solid pharmaceutical agent in a solvent is at least about 1 mg mL at least about 3 mg mL or at least about 10 mg mL at 25 C. In certain embodiments a relatively low solubility of a substance e.g. a pharmaceutical agent in a solvent is less than about 1 mg mL less than about 0.3 mg mL less than about 0.1 mg mL less than about 0.03 mg mL less than about 0.01 mg mL less than about 0.003 mg mL or less than about 0.001 mg mL at 25 C. The solid material may have these or other ranges of solubilities at any point throughout the pH range e.g. from pH 1 to pH 14 .

In other embodiments the core and or coated particles may be formed by an emulsification process or technique emulsification known in the art. See e.g. U.S. Patent Publication No. 20130316006. Generally emulsification techniques may involve dissolving or dispersing a material to be used as the core in a solvent this solution or dispersion is then emulsified in a second immiscible solvent thereby forming a plurality of particles comprising the material. Suitable emulsification techniques may include formation of oil in water emulsions water in oil emulsions water oil water emulsions oil water oil emulsions solid in oil in water emulsions and solid in water in oil emulsions etc. with or without subsequent solvent removal for example by evaporation or extraction. Emulsification techniques are versatile and may be useful for preparing core particles comprising pharmaceutical agents having a relatively low aqueous solubility as well as pharmaceutical agents having a relatively high aqueous solubility.

In some embodiments the core particles described herein may be produced by emulsification in the presence of one or more surface altering agents. In some such embodiments the stabilizer may act as a surface altering agent forming a coating on the particle i.e. the emulsification and coating steps may be performed substantially simultaneously .

In some embodiments a method of forming a core particle by emulsification involves choosing a stabilizer that is suitable for both emulsification and for forming a coating on the particle and rendering the particle mucus penetrating. For example as described in more detail below it has been demonstrated that 200 500 nm nanoparticles of a model polymer PLA produced by emulsification in the presence of certain PVA polymers resulted in particles that can penetrate physiological mucus samples at the same rate as well established PEGylated polymeric MPP. Interestingly it was observed that only a subset of PVA polymers tested fit the criteria of being suitable for both emulsification and for forming a coating on the particle that renders the particle mucus penetrating as described in more detail below.

In other embodiments the particles are first formed using an emulsification technique following by coating of the particles with a surface altering agent.

Any suitable solvent and solvent combinations can be used for emulsification. Some examples of solvents which can serve as oil phase are organic solvents such chloroform dichloromethane ethyl acetate ethyl ether petroleum ether hexane heptane and oils such as peanut oil cottonseed oil safflower oil sesame oil olive oil corn oil soybean oil and silicone oil. Some examples of solvents which can serve as water phase are water and aqueous buffers. Other solvents are also possible.

The core and or coated particles may also be formed by a precipitation process or technique precipitation . Precipitation techniques e.g. microprecipitation nanoprecipitation crystallization and controlled crystallization may involve forming a first solution comprising the material that is to form the core e.g. a pharmaceutical agent and a first solvent wherein the material has a relatively high solubility in the first solvent. The first solution may be added to a second solution comprising a second solvent that is an anti solvent in which the material has a relatively low solubility thereby forming a plurality of particles comprising the material. In certain embodiments the second solvent is miscible with the first solvent. In some embodiments one or more surface altering agents and or surfactants may be present in the first and or second solutions. A coating may be formed during the process of precipitating the core e.g. the coating of the particles may be formed substantially simultaneously when the precipitation is performed to form the coated particles of the invention.

In other embodiments the core of the particles of the invention is first formed using a precipitation technique following by coating of the core with a surface altering agent to form the coated particles of the invention.

In some embodiments a precipitation technique may be used to form polymeric core of the particles of the invention with or without a pharmaceutical agent. Generally a precipitation technique involves dissolving a polymer that is to form the core in a first solvent in the presence or absence of a pharmaceutical agent to form a solution. The solution is then added to a second solvent that is an anti solvent and is miscible with the first solvent in the presence or absence of one or more excipients to form the core of the particles. In some embodiments precipitation is useful for preparing a polymeric core comprising one or more pharmaceutical agents having a relatively low aqueous solubility.

Polymers suitable for forming all or portions of a core and or surface altering agent may also include a poly ethylene glycol vitamin E conjugate hereinafter PEG VitE conjugate . The particles compositions and or formulations including a PEG VitE conjugate and methods of making and using the particles compositions and or formulations are provided in more detail in international PCT application publication WO2012 061703 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

The molecular weight of the PEG portion of the PEG VitE conjugate may be selected so as to aid in the formation and or transport of the particle across a mucosal barrier as described herein. In some embodiments use of a PEG VitE conjugate with a PEG portion having a molecular weight greater than about 2 kDa may allow for greater penetration of the particles through a mucosal barrier as compared to use of a PEG VitE conjugate with a PEG portion having a molecular weight less than about 2 kDa. Additionally in certain embodiments a higher molecular weight PEG portion may facilitate drug encapsulation. The combined ability to act as a surfactant and to reduce mucoadhesion provides important benefits as compared to other commonly used surfactants for drug encapsulation. In some cases the molecular weight of the PEG portion of the PEG VitE conjugate is between about 2 kDa and about 8 kDa or between about 3 kDa and about 7 kDa or between about 4 kDa and about 6 kDa or between about 4.5 kDa and about 6.5 kDa or about 5 kDa.

In some embodiments a precipitation technique may be used to form particles comprised predominantly of a pharmaceutical agent e.g. a crystalline form of Compound 3 . In certain embodiments the particles of the invention formed by the precipitation technique comprise predominantly a crystalline form of Compound 3 that is a nanocrystal. Generally such a precipitation technique involves dissolving Compound 3 that is to form the core in a first solvent which is then added to a second solvent that is an anti solvent in which the crystalline form of Compound 3 has a relatively low solubility in the presence or absence of one or more pharmaceutical excipients to form the core or uncoated particle. In some embodiments this technique may be useful for preparing for example particles of pharmaceutical agents that are slightly soluble 1 10 mg mL very slightly soluble 0.1 1 mg mL or practically insoluble 

A pharmaceutical agent described herein e.g. a crystalline form of Compound 3 may have a suitable solubility in the first and second solvents suitable for precipitation such as a solubility in one or more ranges described herein for aqueous solubility or for solubility in a coating solution. A pharmaceutical agent having a relatively high solubility in the first solvent e.g. an organic solvent may be preferred. In certain embodiments the pharmaceutical agent substantially or completely dissolves in the first solvent. A pharmaceutical agent having a relatively low solubility in the second solvent e.g. water or a coating solution may also be preferred. In certain embodiments the solubility of the pharmaceutical agent in a mixture of the first and second solvents is lower than the solubility of the pharmaceutical agent in the first solvent. The relatively high solubility and relatively low solubility are as described herein.

Another exemplary method of forming the core and or coated particle is a freeze drying process or technique known in the art. See e.g. U.S. Patent Publication No. 2013 0316006. In this technique Compound 3 may be dissolved in an aqueous solution optionally containing a surface altering agent. The solution may be immediately flash frozen and freeze dried. Dry powder can be reconstituted in a suitable solvent e.g. an aqueous solution such as water at a desired concentration.

If the surface altering agent is present in the solvent prior to freeze drying it may be present at any suitable concentration such as a concentration of at least about 0.001 w v at least about 0.005 w v at least about 0.01 w v at least about 0.05 w v at least about 0.1 w v at least about 0.5 w v at least about 1 w v or at least about 5 w v in the aqueous solution. In some instances the surface altering agent is present in the solvent at a concentration of less than or equal to about 5 w v less than or equal to about 1 w v less than or equal to about 0.5 w v less than or equal to about 0.1 w v less than or equal to about 0.05 w v less than or equal to about 0.01 w v or less than or equal to about 0.005 w v . Combinations of the above referenced ranges are also possible e.g. a concentration of at least about 0.01 w v and less than or equal to about 1 w v . Other ranges are also possible.

The concentration of surface altering agent present in the solvent may be above or below the critical micelle concentration CMC of the surface altering agent depending on the particular surface altering agent used. In other embodiments stable particles can be formed by adding excess counter ion to a solution containing a pharmaceutical agent. The precipitate can then be washed by various methods such as centrifugation. The resultant slurry may be sonicated. One or more surface altering agents may be added to stabilize the resultant particles.

Other methods of forming core particles are also possible. For example additional techniques of forming the core and or coated particles include coacervation phase separation melt dispersion interfacial deposition in situ polymerization self assembly of macromolecules e.g. formation of polyelectrolyte complexes or polyelectrolyte surfactant complexes spray drying and spray congealing electro spray air suspension coating pan and spray coating freeze drying air drying vacuum drying fluidized bed drying precipitation e.g. nanoprecipitation microprecipitation critical fluid extraction and lithographic approaches e.g. soft lithography step and flash imprint lithography interference lithography and photolithography . Combinations of the methods described herein are also possible. In some embodiments a core of a pharmaceutical agent is first formed by precipitation and then the size of the core is reduced by a milling process optionally a coating is form on the core by the milling process.

Following the formation of the core of the particles including a pharmaceutical agent the core may be optionally exposed to a solution comprising a second surface altering agent that may associate with and or coat the core. In embodiments in which the pharmaceutical agent already includes a coating of a first surface altering agent all or part of the first surface altering agent may be exchanged with a second surface altering agent. In some embodiments the second surface altering agent renders the particle mucus penetrating more than the first surface altering agent does. In some embodiments a particle having a coating including multiple surface altering agents is formed e.g. in a single layer or in multiple layers . In some embodiments a particle having multiple coatings e.g. each coating optionally comprising different surface altering agents may be formed. In some embodiments the coating is in the form of a monolayer of a surface altering agent. Other configurations are also possible.

In any of the methods described herein a coating comprising a surface altering agent may be formed on a core of the particles of the invention by incubating the core in a solution including the surface altering agent for a period of at least about 1 minute at least about 3 minutes at least about 10 minutes at least about 20 minutes at least about 30 minutes at least about 60 minutes or more. In some cases incubation may take place for a period of less than about 10 hours less than about 3 hours or less than about 60 minutes. Combinations of the above referenced ranges are also possible e.g. an incubation period of less than 60 minutes and at least about 1 minute .

A range of diseases may result when the body of a subject loses control over angiogenesis i.e. new blood vessels grow abnormally i.e. excessively or insufficiently or grow as a result of a tumor. Excessive angiogenesis is often observed in subjects with diseases such as proliferative diseases e.g. cancers benign neoplasms inflammatory diseases autoimmune diseases and ocular diseases especially with cancer diabetic retinopathy macular degeneration rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. In these diseases new blood vessels feed abnormal tissues and or destroy normal tissues. Excessive angiogenesis may occur when there are abnormal amounts of angiogenic growth factors present overwhelming the effects of natural angiogenesis inhibitors. Therefore inhibiting new blood vessel growth may be useful to treat diseases associated with excessive angiogenesis. Insufficient angiogenesis is typically observed in subjects with a disease such as coronary artery disease stroke or chronic wounds. In these diseases blood vessel growth is inadequate and circulation is not properly restored which may lead to tissue death.

VEGFs have been found to play a major role in angiogenesis for example by increasing the number of capillaries in a given network. In vitro studies have demonstrated that bovine capillary endothelial cells proliferated and showed signs of tube structures upon stimulation with VEGF. Upregulation of VEGF is a major component of the physiological response to exercise and its role in angiogenesis is suspected to be a possible treatment in vascular injuries. In vitro studies have showed that VEGFs are a potent stimulator of angiogenesis because among other things in the presence of this growth factor plated endothelial cells will proliferate and migrate eventually forming tube structures resembling capillaries. VEGFs may cause a massive signaling cascade in endothelial cells. Binding to VEGF receptor 2 starts a tyrosine kinase signaling cascade that stimulates the production of factors that variously stimulate vessel permeability proliferation survival migration and finally differentiation into mature blood vessels. Mechanically VEGF is upregulated with muscle contractions as a result of increased blood flow to affected areas. The increased flow also causes a large increase in the mRNA production of VEGF receptors 1 and 2. The increase in receptor production indicates that muscle contractions could cause upregulation of the signaling cascade relating to angiogenesis.

Compound 3 was formulated as mucus penetrating particles MPP . Specifically Compound 3 from Example 2 was milled in the presence of PLURONIC F127 F127 to determine whether F127 1 aids particle size reduction to several hundreds of nanometers and 2 physically non covalently coats the surface of generated nanoparticles with a mucoinert coating that would minimize particle interactions with mucus constituents and prevent mucus adhesion.

A milling procedure was employed in which an aqueous dispersion containing coarse drug particles and PLURONIC F127 F127 was milled with grinding medium until particle size was reduced to approximately 270 nm z averaged as measured by dynamic light scattering. These particles were found to have a polydispersity index a measure of the width of the particle size distribution of 0.142. In this example suspensions were buffered using DPBS Dulbecco s Phosphate Buffered Saline which yields a suspension that is both isotonic and has a physiologically relevant pH.

In order to determine whether the generated particles have reduced interactions with mucins and are therefore able to move within mucus without becoming trapped particles were incubated with human cervicovaginal mucus CVM and observed via dark field microscopy. 1 L or less of the nanoparticle suspension was added to 20 L of CVM. Observations were made in a minimum of three distinct and randomly selected areas of the CVM sample. Control particles with known behavior were used to qualify the CVM sample as appropriate for the assay. Mobility in mucus was observed and therefore the nanoparticles were deemed to be effective MPP.

The crystalline forms of Compound 3 were prepared and then analyzed by XRPD Differential Scanning calorimetry DSC analysis and Thermogravimetric Analysis TGA .

For XRPD patterns were obtained using a Rigaku MiniFlex 600 benchtop x ray diffractometer equipped with a Cu X ray tube Cu K 1.54059 a six position sample changer and a D teX Ultra detector.

As described below for the preparation of Crystalline Form A by milling particles were isolated from bulk formulation by centrifugation at 55 000 rpm over 15 minutes and deposited thinly and evenly onto a flat zero background XRPD sample holder Rigaku 906165 Flush Si510 . The sample was allowed to dry under gentle air stream usually for up to 3 minutes until it was visually dry.

As described below for the preparation of neat Crystalline Form B by crystallization milligram amounts of solid sample were firmly packed in the 5 mm 0.2 mm depression of a zero background sample holder Rigaku 906166 5 mm 0.2 mm Well Si510 .

XRPD patterns were acquired from 3 40 two theta at 0.02 step size and 5 min scan speed using the following instrument settings 40 kV 15 mA X ray generator 2.5 Soller Slit 10 mm HIS 0.625 Divergence Slit 8 mm Scatter Slit with K filter and an open Receiving Slit. Diffraction patterns were viewed and analyzed using PDXL analysis software provided by the instrument manufacturer. Using the sample preparation procedures described above a reference standard silicon powder NIST Standard Reference Material 640d generated a peak at 28.44 and 28.38 two theta using Procedure A and Procedure B respectively.

For DSC about 2 mg of sample was weighed into a standard aluminum sample pan. The sample pan was loaded into the apparatus Q1000 Differential Scanning calorimeter TA Instruments which was equipped with an autosampler. A thermogram was obtained by individually heating the sample at a rate of 10 C. min from room temperature to approximately 250 300 C. using an empty standard aluminum pan as a reference. Dry nitrogen was used as a sample purge gas and was set to flow at 50 mL min. Thermal transitions were viewed and analyzed using the analysis software provided with the instrument.

For TGA about 6 mg of the sample was transferred into an aluminum sample pan. The pan was placed in the loading platform and was then automatically loaded into the apparatus Q500 Thermogravimetric Analyzer TA Instruments using the control software. Thermograms were obtained by individually heating the sample at 10 C. min from room temperature to 300 C. under flowing dry nitrogen with a sample purge flow rate of 25 mL min and a balance purge flow rate of 10 mL min. Thermal transitions e.g. weight changes were viewed and analyzed using the analysis software provided with the instrument.

In accordance to Example 3 mucus penetrating particles comprising of Crystalline Form A was prepared by wet milling amorphous Compound 3 produced in Example 2. A slurry containing 5 amorphous Compound 3 and 5 F127 in PBS 0.0067 M PO pH 7.1 was added to an equal bulk volume of 1 mm ceria stabilized zirconium oxide beads in a glass vial e.g. 2 mL of slurry per 2 mL of beads . A magnetic stir bar was used to agitate the beads stirring at approximately 500 rpm. The sample was milled for 2 days. Nanoparticles which were approximately 200 nm z averaged in diameter as measured by dynamic light scattering DLS were generated. During the milling process Compound 3 converted from amorphous to crystalline Form A as confirmed by XRPD.

An XRPD analysis of the resulting crystalline Form A of Compound 3 was performed. The XRPD pattern of crystalline Form A is illustrated in and the reflections comprised in its XRPD pattern are listed in Table 1.

Crystalline Form B of Compound 3 was prepared by thermal crystallization of the amorphous form of Compound 3 in a binary mixture of acetone and water. Specifically Compound 3 80 mg from Example 2 was added to an 8 mL scintillation vial containing a 7 2 mm stir bar followed by addition of a hot mixture of 4 1 acetone water 4 mL total . The vial was heated on a hot plate while stirring to completely dissolve Compound 3. Upon spontaneous cooling to ambient temperature Form B crystallized slowly from solution. After allowing crystallization to continue overnight solvent was discarded and the solid crystals that remained in the vial were collected and allowed to dry overnight under vacuum. As discussed below XRPD analysis generated unique reflections indicating the formation of a new crystalline form.

An XRPD analysis of the resulting crystalline Form B of Compound 3 was performed. The XRPD pattern of crystalline Form B is illustrated in and the reflections comprised in its XRPD pattern are listed in Table 2.

DSC and TGA were also conducted on crystalline Form B of Compound 3. shows that the DSC thermogram measured from 25 C. to 250 C. ramped at 10 C. min was found to exhibit a broad dehydration endothermic event at 117 C. followed by crystallization then the melting of the presumed anhydrous form at 188 C. shows that the TGA thermogram measured from 25 C. to 300 C. ramped at 10 C. min was found to exhibit a mass loss of 6 from 25 C. up to 120 C. Presumably the mass loss corresponds to two water molecules theoretical weight loss of dihydrate 6.6 thus making crystalline form B a dihydrate.

In accordance to Example 3 mucus penetrating particles comprising of Crystalline Form B was prepared by wet milling neat Crystalline Form B. A slurry containing 5 neat crystalline From B of Compound 3 and 5 F127 in DPBS Dulbecco s Phosphate Buffered Saline was added to an equal bulk volume of 1 mm ceria stabilized zirconium oxide beads in a glass vial e.g. 0.5 mL of slurry for 0.5 mL of beads . A magnetic stir bar was used to agitate the beads stifling at approximately 500 rpm. The sample was milled for 2 days. Nanoparticles which were approximately 200 nm in diameter z averaged as measured by DLS were generated. After milling XRPD analysis not shown confirmed that the crystal form was unchanged which indicates that crystalline Form B remained stable during milling.

To characterize the stability of the resulting crystalline forms of Compound 3 changes in XRPD profiles following long term storage were determined. An MPP suspension comprising of crystalline Form A was stored at room temperature for 7 weeks while a second MPP suspension also comprising of crystalline Form A was stored at room temperature for 7 weeks followed by an additional 1.5 weeks of agitation. Following these periods XRPD analyses revealed that the compounds still possessed the XRPD profile of crystalline Form A indicating that the material is shelf stable in solution for at least 7 weeks. To further test the potential for longer term storage two additional MPP samples comprising of Form A which were formulated at pH 5.8 and pH 7.4 by incorporating different buffers in the milling slurry were stored at room temperature for 8 months and then analyzed by XRPD. Again the XRPD analysis not shown revealed that the crystals still possessed the XRPD profile of crystalline Form A indicating that the materials are shelf stable as suspensions for at least 8 months.

To confirm long term stability an MPP suspension of crystalline Form B was stored for 7 weeks at room temperature and then was characterized by XRPD. The results of that analysis are shown in which provides the XRPD pattern of the original crystalline Form B material in the bottom trace and the XRPD pattern of the material after seven weeks of storage in the top trace. The material remained as crystalline Form B which demonstrates that crystalline Form B is physically stable during storage.

In the absence of crystalline material the amorphous material from Example 2 becomes crystalline Form A during milling as described above. As such the inventors wished to determine whether the presence of crystalline Form B during milling would seed the formation of crystalline Form B from amorphous Compound 3 during milling. A mixture of crystalline Form B and amorphous material was milled as follows milling media specifically 1 mm ceria stabilized zirconium oxide beads was added to a glass scintillation vial. Separately a milling slurry was generated containing 2.5 crystalline Form B of Compound 3 2.5 amorphous Compound 3 and 5 F127 in DPBS Dulbecco s Phosphate Buffered Saline . The milling slurry was then added to the glass vial at an equal bulk volume to the beads e.g. 0.5 mL of slurry for 0.5 mL of beads . A magnetic stir bar was used to agitate the beads stirring at approximately 500 rpm. The sample was milled for 3 days. Nanoparticles which were approximately 150 nm z averaged in diameter as measured by DLS were generated. After milling XRPD analysis was performed the results of which are shown in which provides the XRPD pattern of crystalline Form B of Compound 3 in the bottom trace and the XRPD pattern of the milling mixture of amorphous and crystalline Form B of Compound 3 in the top trace. This analysis confirmed that when some crystalline Form B was present during the milling process the amorphous material converted to crystalline Form B as opposed to crystalline Form A during milling.

In order to assign one form as more stable or more preferred under the current formulation conditions a competition experiment was performed. A suspension of nanoparticles of crystalline Form A was generated as described via wet milling the amorphous material. A suspension of nanoparticles of Form B was generated via wet milling of neat Form B crystals as described. The two suspensions were mixed in 1 1 ratio and incubated at room temperature. After 11 days an XRPD analysis was performed which estimated that the ratio of Forms A and B was unchanged in the mixture not shown . A fraction of the mixture was then stirred using a magnetic stir bar to provide an increased energy input in order to accelerate the outcome of the competition experiment. After 5 weeks of stifling the Compound 3 in the stirred formulation converted to crystalline Form B whereas the crystals in the unstirred formulation remained a mixture as shown in . This result indicate that crystalline Form B is more stable under the current formulation conditions.

A pharmacokinetic PK study of the crystalline Form A of Compound 3 formulated as MPP in accordance with Example 4 was performed in order to demonstrate that topical instillation of MPP formulations of these compounds results in drug exposure at the back of the eye. The study design is shown in Table 3.

Female Gottingen mini pigs were used in these studies. Animals received a single topical ocular dose in the right eye twice daily approximately 12 hours apart 1 hour for 4 consecutive days on the fifth day animals received a single topical ocular dose in the a.m. only for a total of 9 doses over the study duration.

All animals were euthanized with sodium pentobarbital and blood collected via cardiac puncture into tubes containing KEDTA and centrifuged to obtain plasma. Then both eyes were enucleated flash frozen and stored at 70 C. for at least 2 hours. Within approximately 2 days the frozen matrices were collected as right and left eye for choroid and retina.

The resulting drug exposures in plasma and in the back of the eye are shown in . These results demonstrate that topical instillation of crystalline Form A of Compound 3 as MPP results in drug exposure in the retina and choroid in vivo.
