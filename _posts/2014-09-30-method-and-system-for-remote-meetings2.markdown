As the world becomes interconnected and flatter more and more people are collaborating across the world whether for business or other reasons. One consequence of this is that meetings are typically moving from being face to face meetings to virtual meetings. That is to say participants are attending more meetings on line. Since more and more people have smart phones and other hand held devices many people are now using those devices which have relatively small screens in order to attend these meetings.

When attending an on line meeting an attendee using a device with a small screen might want to zoom in on slides text or other displays. Such items might however be difficult to view when not zoomed in on a small screen.

A method system and apparatus for a client device for remote meetings are described. A client device determines that a client device display screen is displaying a video image as enlarged compares received regions of a received video image with regions of the displayed video image determines that the compared regions of the received video image are different from the regions of the displayed video image and stores received video frames comprising the received video image in a cache memory. Related systems apparatus and methods are also described.

Reference is now made to which is a simplified pictorial illustration of a situation where a meeting host of an on line meeting is changing from a first slide to a second slide . An attendee of the meeting viewing the meeting on a mobile device is zoomed in on the first slide . When attending the on line meeting the attendee may zoom in with the small screen mobile device in order to enlarge slides text or other displays which might be difficult to see on a small display screen when not zoomed in. In an embodiment described herein if the attendee zooms in the display screen of the mobile device at the moment when the meeting host changes from the first slide to the second slide the display screen of the mobile device continues to display the zoomed in first slide as though the display is paused and not updating.

Reference is now made to which is a simplified pictorial illustration of a situation where the meeting host of an on line meeting is progressing in some manner with a presentation and the attendee of the meeting viewing the meeting on a mobile device is not zoomed in on the content by contrast to but does wish to pause the content of the presentation . In the meeting host is depicted as sharing a presentation over a cloud network . The display of meeting host indicates that elapsed time for the present slide is 00 29 seconds on the mobile device of the meeting host . However because the attendee has effectively paused the presentation the display screen of the mobile device indicates that the elapsed time is only 00 20 seconds since the attendee has paused the display no received updates are displayed on the display screen .

Reference is now made to which are respectively simplified pictorial illustration of the mobile device of of the attendee in various states. depicts a notification appearing on the display screen of the mobile device . The notification notifies the attendee that the meeting host has changed the content which the meeting host is sharing with the attendee as well as any other attendees who might be viewing the meeting.

It is appreciated that the sequence of events depicted in may be applicable to either of the situations depicted in .

It is appreciated that double clicking the display screen of the mobile device is mentioned herein by way of example and any appropriate manner of interfacing with or actuating the mobile device may be used to input the user interaction with the mobile device . For example and without limiting the generality of the foregoing a single click on the display screen of the mobile device may be used actuating a button on the mobile device may be used or other appropriate user actions known in the art may be taken in order to input the user s interaction.

Reference is now made to which is a block diagram drawing of the mobile device of for use in an embodiment of the present invention. Typical implementations of the mobile device include but are not limited to a tablet device smartphone Internet enabled television media center PC or any other suitable device such as is known in the art. Although the terms mobile device and small screen are used herein the device may in fact be of any appropriate size weight or form factor. The terms mobile device and small screen are used solely for ease of depiction and description and are not intended to be limiting.

The mobile device comprises at least one processor a user interface typically a graphical user interface GUI such as the display screen . The GUI may display a single application two applications which interact with each other a Web browser or other appropriate application.

As mentioned above the mobile device may comprise more than one processor one processor of which may be a special purpose processor operative to perform the method of the present invention described herein. In addition the mobile device comprises non transitory computer readable storage media i.e. memory . The memory may store instructions which at least one of the processors may execute in order to perform the method of the present invention as described herein. The mobile device also comprises typical and standard hardware and software components as are known in the art.

The mobile device comprises a communications bus or other appropriate hardware software or a combination of hardware and software as is known in the art in order to facilitate communications between the various components described above comprising the mobile device .

The mobile device also comprises a storage device not depicted which may be used for caching data such as a video cache.

Reference is now made to which is a depiction of an embodiment as described with reference to of . In the embodiment depicted in an application programming interface API which is available for use by a client application such as but not limited to an on line meeting application located in the mobile device is utilized by hardware or software implementing embodiments of the present invention in order to indicate if the display screen is displaying an enlarged version of the display.

Such APIs are well known in the art. The API may have an object or method enabling the client application to determine zoom density. If there is no appropriate API based method for determining if the display screen is displaying an enlarged version of the display or not i.e. zoom density the client application can use techniques known in the art in order to detect if the displayed content is zoomed in on by comparing display screen data with data from the original i.e. the non zoomed video data such as the first slide and the presentation .

For Android devices for example a WebSettings.ZoomDensity object would be used to detect if the display screen is displaying an enlarged version of the display. Apple devices use the uses zoomScale property to indicate zoom level.

A video image such as the video image which is to be displayed on the display screen is logically dividable into a plurality of small blocks . Of particular interest for the sake of this example are two of the plurality of small blocks a first one of the plurality of small blocks denoted block T and a second one of the plurality of small blocks denoted block T. The two blocks T and T are received as part of the video image to be displayed on the display screen in updated video data received by the mobile device from the cloud .

The mobile device as noted above comprises the client application . The client application comprises a video cache the utilization of which is described below and the video display . The GUI may be implemented in the video display . As depicted in each of the plurality of small blocks is compared by the video client application to the display screen of the mobile device . For example the received block T is compared using conventional methods to the display on the display screen of the mobile device . In the present example as a result of the comparing block T is found not to match the corresponding portion of the display on the display screen of the mobile device . Received block T is also compared to the display on the display screen of the mobile device . If for example as a result of the comparing block T is found not to match the display on the display screen of the mobile device in that no block of the plurality of small blocks is found to match the video displayed on the display screen of the mobile device a notice such as Sharing Content Has Changed then is made by the client application to appear on the display screen of the mobile device .

However if the display screen of the mobile device is found to match one of the plurality of small blocks such as one of block T or block T then the client application takes no action note that this scenario is not depicted .

Reference is now additionally made to which a depiction of the embodiment depicted in where video is being paused . As was noted above once the attendee of the mobile device has zoomed in on or enlarged video appearing on the display screen and an update is received i.e. the method described immediately above determines that a slide in a video presentation has been changed the received video is cached in the video cache until the attendee releases the paused display by actuating the video display for example by double clicking the display as depicted in .

Alternatively a still video frame of the newly received video content can be saved as a photo in a folder such as a Picture folder in the mobile device . When the attendee is ready to update the screen the still photo of the latest shared content is then retrieved from the folder and displayed on the display screen .

It is appreciated that in addition to zooming in to view slides in a presentation the zoom feature may also be of use in other common on line meeting situations. Examples where this is the case are provided in . is a pictorial illustration of the mobile device of displaying a document displayed by a presenter e.g. meeting host . Because the presenter typically displays the document on a device with a larger display screen for instance on a desktop or laptop computer than is available on the device the document appears fuzzy or out of focus on the display screen . Thus the user of device e.g. mobile attendee might zoom in in order to have a clearer view of the document .

Reference is now made to which is a graphical presentation of the top 14 screen resolutions used in the mobile device of as of January 2013. is brought by way of support for the discussion inter alia of . These statistics can be found at gs.statcounter.com mobile resolution ww monthly 201301 201301 bar.

As was noted above with reference to even when the attendee is not pausing the video stream the attendee s video is delayed in the example of by 9 seconds. The inventors of the present invention have noticed delay times between 3 10 seconds when performing tests on a Cisco internal WiFi network. The term delay time refers to the amount of time it takes the video image to go from the meeting host s device to a meeting server see below with reference to and then to the mobile attendee s device. It is also believed by the inventors of the present invention that the Cisco internal WiFi network is typically a better network than most 3G networks. The following table shows six different delay times from various test presentations.

Reference is now additionally made to which is a block diagram of a client server architecture for on line meetings attended using mobile device of . A meeting server manages the connection between a meeting host and the meeting attendees devices corresponding to device of attendee . The meeting host comprises a meeting client . Similarly the meeting attendees devices also comprise meeting clients . Meeting clients and correspond to client application . In order to stress that the attendee s device may be using either a mobile device comprising the meeting client or a desktop device comprising the meeting client both are depicted in . As was noted above references to the mobile device emphasis added of the attendee are by way of example and not meant to be limiting. Furthermore it is appreciated that even if the devices and are both mobile devices devices and would not necessarily have the same operating system or the same network environment.

The inventors of the present invention believe that at least in part the lag between the host and the attendees device is caused by video data size and the capability of the meeting server and network . As is known in the art at present video meeting technology only transfers regions of the video image which change. So when the host changes a presentation from a first slide to a second slide as is depicted in only then will the changed regions be sent to the attendee devices . It is appreciated that sending only video image regions which change is standard in video protocols whether those protocols are members of the MPEG suites of protocols or they are proprietary protocols. Accordingly when a large portion of the second slide is changed relative to the first slide the delay time for the arrival of the video packets at the attendees device are expected to be correspondingly large i.e. closer to or even exceeding the 10 second delay noted above in the table . When the changes between the two slides are minor the delay will correspondingly be small i.e. closer to the 3 second delay noted in the table . This supports the contention that delay time is at least in part related to video data size. I.e. the more video packets and associated data which needs to be transferred to the devices the more time the meeting server requires to collect package compress transfer and cache the data. This leads to correspondingly larger delay times.

As the meeting host is progressing to the next slide while the meeting server is processing the video packets and associated data i.e. collecting packaging compressing transferring and caching the video packets and associated data the meeting client comprised in the meeting host can additionally bypass these steps and send a notification flag to the meeting client comprised in meeting attendee s devices . The notification flag may be as small as a single byte and there is no need for the meeting client comprised in the meeting host to perform the steps of collecting packaging compressing transferring and caching data in order to send the notification flag to the meeting clients comprised in the attendees devices . As such the notification flag should arrive at the attendees devices faster than the actual video data arrives.

The arrival of the notification flag at the attendees devices will enable the meeting client comprised in attendees devices to receive a notification that a change of the video content is imminent see for example item in and item in . The arrival of the notification flag will enable the attendees i.e. attendee of the meeting to interact with the GUI and either pause the video or advance to the new slide when the update video packets arrive at the meeting client . This process is described below in greater detail.

Reference is now additionally made to which is a depiction of an embodiment of the present invention described with reference to . A meeting attendee s device is depicted in which corresponds in a non limiting fashion to mobile device of . After the mobile device receives the notification flag the display of the mobile device shows a notification that a change of the video content is imminent. For example and without limiting the generality of the foregoing the display shows the notification CONTENT IS CHANGING LONG SCREEN PRESS CAN HOLD CURRENT CONTENT .

As depicted in the lower portion of when the user performs a long press on the display screen of the device the video content on the display e.g. the slide show of can be paused. Once the long press is ended the video content stored in the cache can then be displayed.

It is appreciated that the video is paused only on the display of the device where the user is performing the long press. The displays of other users and the presentation of the meeting host are unaffected. In both this and in other embodiments of the present invention described herein it is appreciated that in some embodiments the presenter corresponding to meeting host may receive a notification that the attendee and are either pausing or zooming the displayed video. Providing this notification to the presenter corresponding to meeting host enables the presenter corresponding to meeting host to tailor the speed and zoom of the presentation to satisfy a majority or large plurality of attendees and . Providing this notification also can enhance collaboration between the presenter meeting host and and the attendees and . Additionally enabling the presenter meeting host and to increase the responsiveness of the viewing practices of the attendees and will improve the user experience of the attendees and .

It is also appreciated that the use of long press as a way for the user to interact with the GUI is provided by way of example and other appropriate interactions or actuations for instance double clicking which are well known in the art may be used as well in an actual implementation of the present invention e.g. for pausing and un pausing the display. In some embodiments where the device supports such implementations a voice command may be used to pause the video. Additionally where supported facial or eye motion may also be used to pause the video.

Reference is now additionally made to which is a simplified flowchart of the method described above with reference to . In step the presenter who may be the meeting host advances a slide show to the next slide. In step the meeting client determines if video regions displayed in the new slide are changing or not. One method for performing this determination is provided above with reference to . If it is determined that there are no changes in video regions displayed then the method ends until the next time the presenter advances to the next slide and then the method returns to step . If the meeting client determines that the video regions are changing in the new slide step then two parallel processes are triggered.

In one of the two triggered parallel processes the notification flag is sent to devices of users i.e. attendees step such as the device and mobile device . For the reasons explained above the device of the user gets the notification flag before any video data packets are received step . In step the user is prompted to execute a long press of the display of the device in order to pause the video from progressing.

In the second of the two parallel processes the meeting server packages compresses etc. the video packets step . The packaged compressed etc. video packets from step are then sent by the meeting server to the cloud for distribution to the meeting attendees remote devices step . The method then returns to step and the user is prompted to execute a long press of the display of the device in order to pause the video from progressing.

In step the device evaluates if the user is continuing the long press. While the long press is maintained by the user the device continues to loop to step enabling the user to continue the long press. However once the user stops the long press then in step video data appearing on the display screen is refreshed by displaying the currently cached video data on the display screen step .

Reference is now made to which is a simplified flowchart of a method of implementation of an embodiment of the present invention. In step the client device such as device determines whether or not the client device display screen such as the display screen is displaying a video image as enlarged or not enlarged. In step the method forks and proceeds to step if the client device display screen such as the display screen is not displaying the video image as enlarged. In that case the client device such as device takes no action. If however the client device display screen such as the display screen is displaying the video image as enlarged the method proceeds to step and compares received regions of a received video image with regions of the displayed video image. In step it is determined that the regions of a received video image are the same as the compared regions of the displayed video image then the method proceed to step and the client device such as device takes no action. However if it is determined that the regions of a received video image are not the same as the compared regions of the displayed video image then the method proceed to step and received video frames comprising the received video image are stored in a cache memory.
