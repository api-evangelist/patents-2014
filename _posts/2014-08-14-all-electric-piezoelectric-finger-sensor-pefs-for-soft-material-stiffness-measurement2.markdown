title: All electric piezoelectric finger sensor (PEFS) for soft material stiffness measurement
abstract: A PEFS (Piezoelectric Finger Sensor) acts as an “electronic finger” capable of accurately and non-destructively measuring both the Young's compression modulus and shear modulus of tissues with gentle touches to the surface. The PEFS measures both the Young's compression modulus and shear modulus variations in tissue generating a less than one-millimeter spatial resolution up to a depth of several centimeters. This offers great potential for in-vivo early detection of diseases. A portable hand-held device is also disclosed. The PEF offers superior sensitivity.

This invention was reduced to practice with Government support under Grant No. R01 EB00720 01 awarded by NIH the Government is therefore entitled to certain rights to this invention.

A typical soft material tissue mechanical property tester requires an external force displacement applicator and an external displacement force gauge.The external force displacement generator may be hydraulic or piezoelectric and the external displacement gauge force gauge may be optical or piezoelectric. Regardless of the mechanism of force displacement generation and displacement force detection typical tissue soft material mechanical testing is destructive and it requires specimens cut to a disc shape to fit in the tester. In addition a compressive elastic modulus tester e.g. an Instron is also different from a shear modulus tester e.g. a rheometer.Currently no single instrument measures both the compressive Young s modulus and the shear modulus.

Over the past decades many techniques have been developed to image tissue structures.Computer Tomography CT takes 360 degree X ray pictures and reconstructs 3D tissue structures using computer software. Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI uses powerful magnetic fields and radio waves to create tissue images for diagnosis. Ultrasound US transmits high frequency waves through tissue and captures the echoes to image tissue structures. T scan TS measures low level bioelectric currents to produce real time images of electrical impedance properties of tissues. Ultrasound elastography UE evaluates the echo time through tissues under a constant mechanical stress and compares it to that of the same tissue when unstressed. A tissue strain map is then obtained from which an image of 2D elastic modulus distribution is created by inversion techniques. Tactile imaging tools using array pressure sensors probe spatial tissue stiffness variations. However none of these techniques have the ability to probe tumor interface properties.

The detection of abnormal tissue as cancerous growth requires improvements in screening technologies. The key to successful treatment lies in early detection. Imaging techniques such as mammography in breast cancer screening detect abnormal tissue by tissue density contrast. Mammography is the only FDA approved breast cancer screening technique which has a typical sensitivity of 85 that decreases to 65 in radiodense breasts.However in these screening processes there is a high incidence of false positives. In fact only about 15 30 of breast biopsies yield a diagnosis of malignancy. Changes in tissue stiffness have increasingly become an important characteristic in disease diagnosis. It is known that breast cancers are calcified tissues that are more than seven times stiffer than normal breast tissues.Thus contrasting levels of stiffness within the breast may indicate cancerous tissue. Similarly plaque lined blood vessels are also stiffer than normal healthy blood vessels.

The examining physician may detect abnormal tissue stiffness by palpation by taking advantage of the fact that cancerous tissues are stiffer than surrounding normal tissues under compression. Thus palpation has been a useful tool for experienced physicians to diagnose breast and prostate cancer. However palpation is not quantitative and depends solely on the experience of the individual physician. So there remains a critical need to improve cancer screening technology to reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies.

In a first aspect the invention relates to a sensor for measuring a compression modulus and a shear modulus that has a first layer made of piezoelectric material a second layer made of a non piezoelectric material a first electrode placed on top of the first layer for sensing a displacement of the first layer and a second electrode placed on top of the first layer for providing a force to the first layer.

In a second aspect of the invention a sensor for measuring a compression modulus and a shear modulus is provided having a first layer made of piezoelectric material for providing a force a second layer made of non piezoelectric material and a third layer made of piezoelectric material for sensing a displacement.

In a third aspect of the invention a method for measuring a compression modulus and a shear modulus is provided. The method has the steps of providing a plurality of sensors made of a piezoelectric material and a non piezoelectric material at a target applying a force with at least one of the plurality of sensors detecting a displacement with at least one of the plurality of sensors and providing a measurement of a compression modulus and a shear modulus of said target.

A PEFS includes a piezoelectric layer bonded to a non piezoelectric layer to form a cantilever. shows a schematic of a lead zirconate titanate PZT stainless steel cantilever with both the driving and sensing electrodes on the top side. shows a PZT stainless steel cantilever with a bottom PZT sensing layer. In these schematics the PZT represents the piezoelectric layer and the stainless steel represents the non piezoelectric layer.

In a first aspect of the invention the PEFS is capable of simultaneously applying a force and detecting the corresponding displacement. The application of a voltage at the driving electrode generates the force and the corresponding displacement is measured by detecting the induced piezoelectric voltage within the sensing electrode. The PEFS can measure both the compressive Young s modulus and the shear modulus of a soft material through the cantilevered tip. Thus in an aspect of the current invention the PEFS measures both the compressive Young s modulus and shear modulus using one single device while at the same time increasing the sensitivity and accuracy of the measurements relative to some commercially available devices used for this purpose. Comparisons between the shear and compressive measurements using one single device provide clear and accurate information about the interfaces between hard inclusions tumors and the surrounding tissue that otherwise could likely not be obtained.

In another aspect of the invention several PEFS can form an array to measure lateral and in depth stiffness variations in soft materials and tissues both under compression and under shear. This ability to self excite via the driving voltage and self detect via the sensing electrode allows a PEFS to measure the elastic and shear properties of specimens having complex shapes.

In another aspect of the invention the PEFS may apply forces and measure displacements at the same time allowing the device to function using completely electrical means for tissue stiffness imaging cancer and disease detection. Thus the PEFS may be powered with a DC power source allowing the PEFS to take electrical measurements in the DC mode. In this aspect of the invention the PEFS may be part of a portable hand held device for measuring tissue. This simple all electrical measurement makes the PEFS look and work like a finger which may allow for in vivo measurements in tight spaces.

While the sensitivity of the PEFS has been improved by the increased sensitivity of the compression tests with the addition of the shear test to the PEFS the reduction of the probe size as compared to the bulkiness of current tactile cancer imaging devices provides increased versatility as well. In particular the finger like shape of the PEFS is now suitable for for example prostate cancer detection.

In another aspect of the invention the PEFS can analyze measurements of various widths allowing the direct experimental determination of a stiffness variation in the thickness direction. Current tumor imaging techniques are incapable of directly measuring a tumor size or position. Instead these techniques measure the surface mechanical response. The tumor information is generated numerically by the inversion technique and used to reconstruct the tumor size and position.

In another aspect of the invention the PEFS can assess vertical stiffness variations of soft materials tissues up to several centimeters in depth with increased resolution by use of an array of PEFS s of varying probe widths ranging from less than 1 mm to several cm. Detection of tissue stiffness both under shear and under compression will allow comparison of the stiffness of a hard inclusion such as a tumor with the stiffness of surrounding normal tissue not only under compression but also under shear. Such comparisons will permit a determination of the interfacial properties between the hard inclusion and surrounding tissue which has the potential to greatly enhance the ability to assess tumor malignancy.

The PEFS is capable of detecting soft material stiffness variations in both the shear and the compression modes while under DC power. This allows a portable hand held device to detect soft material tissue stiffness. Additional advantages result from the ultra small strains employed for detection smaller than 1 and the minimal discomfort that such strains will cause to the patient.

In another aspect of the invention the PEFS may be fabricated in a variety of shapes including L shaped U L shaped U shaped square shaped O shaped tapered etc. as well as in various lengths and widths. When the PEFS has an L shaped tip the PEFS is capable of accurately measuring the shear modulus of soft tissues and materials at very small strain 

In addition to detection and mapping of a tumor the PEFS may also be employed as a tissue soft material mechanical tester for breast cancer detection for prostate cancer detection for monitoring skin cancer and skin elasticity testing or for cellular elasticity plasticity measurements using a miniaturized PEFS. Of course the PEFS is capable of use in conventional methods for making compression and shear measurements on pliable materials of any kind and its use need not be limited to tissue measurements.

When a voltage is applied to the top PZT layer of a PEFS as shown in it causes the PEFS to bend due to the converse piezoelectric effect which generates a force and therefore a displacement at the cantilever tip. The bending of the cantilever generates an induced piezoelectric voltage in the bottom sensing PZT layer which is in proportion to the displacement at the cantilever tip. By carefully monitoring the displacement at the cantilever tip during a given test an accurate determination of both the force and displacement exerted on the sample surface can be ascertained which in turn yields an accurate determination of the elastic modulus of the sample. Moreover by placing a sensing PZT layer in the device as shown the maximum of the induced voltage transient of the sensing PZT can be used to accurately determine the cantilever tip displacement.

The ability of the PEFS to electrically apply a force and electronically measure the displacement makes it ideal for electronic palpation like an electronic finger. The PEFS measures the tissue compressive shear stiffness by touching rubbing the tissue surface. The force generation and displacement sensing are all within the finger. The PEFS may be used for in vivo tissue imaging particularly for breast cancer and prostate cancer detection.

The PEFS can measure elastic stiffness and shear modulus of soft materials with or without a sensing electrode. In case a sensing electrode is not used other means such a laser or piezoelectric displacement meter can be provided for displacement determination.

In the peak induced piezoelectric voltage captured at the sensing electrode open squares and the displacement measured by a laser displacement meter full circles versus applied voltage is shown. As can be seen the peak induced voltage and the displacement are proportional to each other validating that the displacement at the tip of the cantilever can be quantified using the peak induced voltage measured at the bottom sensing PZT layer.

A flat punch indentation compression test is a test whereby the cantilever tip is pressed on the sample surface and the cantilever contact area is much smaller than the sample surface area. This test simulates an in vivo measurement.

A regular compression test describes a condition where a cantilever is pressed on the sample surface and the contact area is the same as the sample surface area. A schematic of a regular compression test is shown in where the contact area is the same as the surface area. is a schematic of the deformation of a sample in a regular compression test under an applied voltage V. In a regular compression test the elastic modulus is obtained by using

Having demonstrated that piezoelectric cantilevers are capable of determining the elastic stiffness of soft materials using the flat punch indentation test and that the test can be done with a driving electrode for force generation and a sensing electrode for displacement force detection using all electrical measurements here it is demonstrated that tissue elastic stiffness profiling can be done using flat punch indentation. A simulated tissue sample with a hard inclusion was made from gelatin and candle wax. A 7 mm diameter 5 mm tall cylinder of wax was embedded in an 8 mm thick gelatin matrix. Indentation tests were conducted at 2 mm increments over the entire surface surrounding the inclusion. The elastic modulus at each location was calculated using Eq. 2 . The 2 D plot in reflects the higher modulus values in the center plainly evident in the corresponding contour plot . The image was enhanced in through a data smoothing operation and is seen in comparison with to depict the approximate size and shape of the wax.

Because the indentation test only needs to press a small part of the sample surface it is a natural configuration for in vivo application. However because the probe size is smaller than the sample size in an indentation test only the volume immediately beneath the indenting device is affected by the indentation test. It is thus conceivable that the detection sensitivity depends on the depth of the hard inclusion. To demonstrate this point the effect of the probe size on the depth limit for detection using cantilevers of 3 mm width and 5 mm width was examined. Both cantilevers are 2 cm in length. The 3 mm wide cantilever had a contact area of 3 mm the width 2 mm and the 5 mm wide cantilever had a contact area of 5 mm the width 2 mm. With the 3 mm wide cantilever six wax inclusions of 7 mm diameters at varying depths beneath the top surface were embedded in a gelatin sample of 7 mm in height. For the 5 mm wide cantilever five wax inclusions 15 mm in diameter were embedded in a gelatin sample of 18 mm in height. Cantilever indentation tests were conducted across the central axis of each sample at 1 mm increments. Elastic modulus was calculated at each location using the indentation formula Equation 2 . The result of elastic profiles of wax inclusions 7 mm in diameter embedded at different depths measured using the 3 mm wide cantilever are plotted in . Clearly the 3 mm wide cantilever could detect the variation in the elastic modulus for depths less than 2 3 mm. When the wax inclusion was at a depth larger than 3 mm there was no difference in the elastic modulus measured by the cantilever.

For comparison the result of elastic profiles of wax inclusions 15 mm in diameter embedded at different depths were measured using the 5 mm wide cantilever and plotted in . With a 5 mm wide cantilever the elastic modulus variation due to the wax inclusion could be detected at a larger depth. From it can be seen that depth limit on the detection by a 5 mm long cantilever was about 8 mm. Comparing the elastic modulus profile results measured from the 3 mm and 5 mm cantilevers it is clear that a wider cantilever or wider probe allowed detection of elastic modulus variation at a greater depth. The effect of the cantilever width on the detection depth limit is shown in .

The above results indicate that one can probe the elastic stiffness to different depths by using cantilevers having different probe sizes. Furthermore by carefully analyzing measurements with different probe sizes it is possible to obtain not only the stiffness variation in the lateral direction but also in the thickness direction to thereby allow construction of 3 D tissue stiffness maps.

Shear tests can be accomplished using L shaped cantilevers. A schematic of a regular shear test is shown in . When a voltage was applied across the PZT which is shown as the shaded layer in it caused the cantilever to bend which created lateral movement of the L shaped tip and sheared the tissue sample underneath. The shear modulus can be determined using the equation 

A schematic of an indentation shear test is shown in . This is the most relevant condition for potential tissue shear stiffness measurement. When a voltage was applied across the PZT it caused the cantilever to bend which created lateral movement of the L shaped tip and sheared the tissue sample underneath. The shear modulus can be determined using the equation 

For comparison of all four measurements regular compression indentation compression regular shear and indentation shear a cantilever that has a U shaped stainless steel tip as shown in was used. The advantages of such U shaped tips include 1 precise control of the contact area in all measurement geometry and 2 the ability to allow the cantilever to be protected during measurements in tight spaces as illustrated by e . The cantilever had a driving PZT layer 23 mm long and a sensing PZT layer 10 mm long. The cantilever is 4 mm wide.

Both the driving and sensing PZT layers are 127 m thick and the stainless steel layer is 50 m thick. The measurements were done on rubber samples with a Young s modulus of 400 500 kPa.

The results of the regular compression indentation compression regular shear and indentation shear measurements on rubber samples that had a Young s modulus of 400 500 kPa using the U shaped cantilever as shown in are summarized in . The Young s modulus obtained from regular compression with Eq. 3 and the shear modulus obtained from regular shear measurements with Eq. 4 were 460 kPa and 148 kPa respectively giving a Poisson ratio of 0.5 consistent with what was expected of rubber samples. Using a Poisson ratio of 0.5 the Young s modulus and shear modulus obtained from indentation measurements with Eqs. 2 and 5 were 452 kPa and 141 kPa respectively in close agreement with the values obtained from the regular compression and regular shear measurements. The results shown in validate the measurement of the Young s modulus using either the regular compression test or the indentation compression test and validate the measurements of the shear modulus using either the regular shear test or indentation shear test.

Two tumor models one with a smooth face and the other with a rough face were made of play dough and were the same size and embedded at the same depth in the model tissue gelatin as shown in . Both the smooth surfaced tumor and the rough surfaced tumor were 2 mm beneath the gelatin surface. Indentation compression and indentation shear tests were carried out on the plain gelatin surface point A and on the gelatin surface above the center of the smooth surfaced tumor point B and above the center of the rough surfaced tumor point C . shows the Young s modulus and shear modulus measured on plain gelatin point A the smooth surfaced model tumor B and the rough surfaced tumor C using the indentation compression and the indentation shear tests.

While both the smooth surfaced and rough surfaced model tumors were much stiffer than the surrounding gelatin under compression only the rough surfaced tumor displayed a stiffer shear. This indicates that the rough surfaced tumor model was less mobile than the smooth surfaced tumor model under shear. Thus the indentation shear measurement with a piezoelectric finger was effective in probing tumor interfacial properties and tumor mobility. Combining both the compression and shear tests offers the potential of not only measuring the stiffness but also determining the mobility of a tumor which has great potential for tumor malignancy detection.

The use of the PEFS in excised breast tumors has been evaluated in the laboratory. The lumpectomy specimen was from a 60 year old woman with breast cancer. The known malignancy was 1.4 cm in the largest dimension. After surgical excision the specimen was oriented with silk sutures scanned with ultrasound and images were stored. The PEFS scan was performed in the same orientation to allow later correlation with the ultrasound image. The specimen was sectioned in the same orientation to allow histological confirmation of the PEFS findings as well. Using the PEFS preliminary elastic modulus measurements were performed on breast lumpectomy samples using an 8 mm wide PEFS with a rectangular tip. shows lateral elastic modulus profile of a lumpectomy sample measured by an 8 mm wide PEFS at a along y 0 which exhibited two tumors a larger one at x 17 25 mm and a smaller one at x 5 10 and at b along y 4 mm which only exhibited the larger tumor at x 17 25. The dotted rectangles are meant to guide the eye. The PEFS could distinguish the cancers from the surrounding tissues.

Of note the PEFS scan identified the known 15 13 12 mm invasive ductal carcinoma at x 15 25 mm and identified a smaller 6 5 3 mm satellite invasive ductal carcinoma at x 5 10 mm. This smaller lesion was not detected by mammogram ultrasound or the physician s preoperative palpation.

With the second lumpectomy sample not shown the elastic modulus E and shear modulus G profiles have been performed. The tumor was 12 10 mm in size and 5 mm below the surface. The tissue was examined with an 8 mm wide PEFS. shows a Young s modulus E and shear modulus G profiles and b G E profile on breast tissue with cancer. The resultant elastic modulus and shear modulus profiles are shown in . Clearly both the elastic modulus and the shear modulus were much higher in the region with the tumor than in the surrounding tissue. The G E profile is plotted in . The G E ratio was much higher approaching 0.6 0.7 in the tumor region than that of the surrounding tissues around 0.3 0.4 . The G E ratio of 0.3 in the normal tissue region was expected of an isotropic material with a Poisson s ratio of 0.5.A much higher G E ratio in the cancer region indicated that the tumor was harder to move under shear than under compression as compared to the surrounding normal tissue. The pathological session result confirmed the malignancy.

In parts a and b are shown the lateral elastic modulus profiles of a 15 mm diameter model clay tumor in gelatin with 2.4 mm part a and 5.4 mm part b depths as respectively measured by a 4 mm wide the open squares and an 8 mm wide PEFS the open squares . The lateral location of the clay was marked by the gray shaded rectangle. Comparing the profiles obtained with 8 mm wide PEFS and those obtained by the 4 mm wide PEFS one can see that far away from the inclusion the values of the elastic modulus of the gelatin obtained by both PEFS s were essentially the same indicating no inclusion underneath. Proximate to the inclusion the values of the measured elastic moduli differed between the two PEFS as they had different probe depths.

A separate experiment not shown has determined that the probe depth of a PEFS is twice the PEFS s width. With Eobtained from locations far away from the inclusion one can then use the two profiles measured with the two PEFS to solve the following two equations for the two unknowns Eand d 

In this model study a model smooth tumor the shaded inclusion in the back of and a model rough malignant tumor the white rough ball in the front of were prepared. Direct tumor mobility measurement was carried out with one PEFS pushing on the side of the tumor and the other PEFS determining the movement of the tumor on the other side. With the driving PEFS pushing down 50 m a movement of 2 mm from the smooth inclusion and no movement from the rough inclusion were measured. This illustrated the sensitivity of the PEFS to directly measure tumor mobility for potential malignancy screening.

Preliminary measurement on breast tissues after surgery have indicated that a PEFS can detect cancerous tumors as small as 3 mm in size that were missed by mammography ultrasound and physician s palpation offering great potential for early breast cancer detection. Furthermore it was demonstrated that by using two or more PEFS s of different widths one can simultaneously determine both the tumor elastic shear modulus and its depth. In addition it has also been demonstrated that tumor mobility can be assessed by measuring the ratio of the shear modulus to the elastic modulus of a tumor or by sensitive direct tumor mobility measurement using two PEFS s one for pushing and one for measuring the movement. The tumor mobility measurement offers the potential for non invasive breast cancer malignancy screening.

It is to be understood however that even though numerous characteristics and advantages of the present invention have been set forth in the foregoing description together with details of the structure and function of the invention the disclosure is illustrative only and changes may be made in detail especially in matters of shape size and arrangement of parts within the principles of the invention to the full extent indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms in which the appended claims are expressed.
