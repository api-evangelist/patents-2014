The bus may be a circuit for connecting the above mentioned structural elements to one another and transferring communication e.g. a control message between the above mentioned structural elements.

The controller for example may receive an instruction through the bus from the above structural elements e.g. the memory the input output interface the display the communication interface and the like decode the received instruction and execute a calculation or a data processing according to the decoded instruction.

The controller may identify values obtained by measuring states of the structural elements according to the various embodiment of the present disclosure. The values obtained by measuring the states of the structural elements may include a temperature with relation to each internal structural element e.g. the controller the memory the input output interface the display the communication interface the sensor unit and or the like of the electronic device . According to the various embodiments of the present disclosure the state values of the structural elements may include a battery temperature T BAT obtained by measuring a temperature of a battery not shown a controller temperature T CPU obtained by measuring a temperature of a controller e.g. a Central Processing Unit CPU a communication interface temperature T RF obtained by measuring a temperature of a communication interface and a sensor temperature T SENSOR obtained by measuring a temperature of a sensor .

The controller may determine an operation state of the electronic device according to the values obtained by measuring the states of the structural elements and identified.

The controller can calculate a difference of a state value e.g. T CPU of a specific unit among the state values of the structural elements and an environmental measurement value T RAW measured by a temperature humidity sensor for measuring an external environmental temperature of the electronic device . The controller determines the state of the specific unit as a first state if an absolute value of the difference is smaller than or equal to a second critical value C and as a second state if the absolute value of the difference is larger than a second critical value C.

The controller may compare the environmental measurement value T RAW measured by the temperature humidity sensor for measuring the external environment temperature of the electronic device with a first predetermined critical value R according to various embodiments of the present disclosure. As a result when the measured environmental value is smaller than or equal to the first critical value R calculating a difference between the state value of the specific unit and the measured environmental value is possible. The controller determines the state of the specific unit as a first state if the absolute value of the difference is smaller than or equal to the first critical value R and as the second state if the absolute value of the difference is larger than the first critical value R.

According to the various embodiments of the present disclosure the first state may include a standby state in which an application is not executed in the electronic device or a low load state of the controller e.g. CPU . According to various embodiments of the present disclosure the second state may include a high load state of the controller.

Referring to the graph illustrates that an environmental value e.g. an external environmental temperature T RAW measured in the electronic device increases as a temperature T BAT of a battery of the electronic device rises. Further according to the state of the electronic device there is a difference between an increment of the battery temperature T BAT and an increment of the external environmental temperature T RAW. The difference between an increment in the battery temperature T BAT and the increment of the external environmental temperature T RAW may vary according to a state of the electronic device .

For example according to the example illustrated in the graph of if the controller has no load in an idling state in which an application is not executed the increment Delta T BAT of the battery temperature T BAT and the increment Delta T RAW of the external environment temperature T RAW are substantially identical.

As another example according to the example illustrated in the graph of if an application for reproducing music with a low load of the controller is executed a difference between the increment Delta T BAT of the battery temperature T BAT and the increment Delta T RAW of the external environment temperature T RAW is 0.2.

As another example according to the example illustrated in the graph of if a high load application increasing a load of the controller is executed a difference between the increment Delta T BAT of the battery temperature T BAT and the increment Delta T RAW of the external environment temperature T RAW is 1.1.

Referring to in the standby state of the electronic device it is understood that a deviation of the battery temperature T BAT and a measured environment value T RAW is stably maintained when a deviation of the battery temperature T BAT and an external environment value T REF e.g. an actual external environment value is maintained.

Further even if the electronic device is in the state in which the controller has a low load it is understood that the deviation of the battery temperature T BAT and the measured environment value T RAW is stably maintained even if the deviation of the battery temperature T BAT and the measured environment value T RAW increases.

According to the various embodiments of the present disclosure therefore the controller detects an environmental value e.g. an external environment temperature approximated by applying a first compensating algorithm if the electronic device is in a first state e.g. a standby state or a low load state of the controller . According to the various embodiments of the present disclosure the first compensating algorithm may be calculated by using Equation 1 .   2 Equation 1 

Herein T COMP corresponds to the approximated environmental value T RAW corresponds to the measured environmental value and C2 corresponds to a predetermined value.

The C2 is the predetermined value for compensating a temperature value which constantly increases in the first state of the electronic device e.g. the standby state or the low load state of the controller .

According to various embodiments of the present disclosure furthermore the controller detects an environmental value e.g. an external environment temperature approximated by applying a second compensating algorithm if the electronic device is in a second state e.g. a standby state or a high load state of the controller . According to the various embodiments of the present disclosure the second compensating algorithm may be calculated by using Equation 2 .   1    2 Equation 2 

Herein T COMP corresponds to the approximated environmental value T RAW corresponds to the measured environmental value T STATE corresponds to a state value of a specific unit and C1 and C2 are predetermined values. The state value of the specific unit T STATE comprises a battery temperature T BAT a controller temperature T CPU a communication interface temperature T RF and a sensor temperature T SENSOR.

Hereinafter according to various embodiments of the present invention the state value of the specific unit T STATE will be described by referring to as an example of the battery temperature T BAT.

Referring to if the environmental value T RAW increases in the state of a high load controller as the battery temperature T BAT increases it is possible to detect an actual external temperature and an approximated environmental value an external temperature by applying the second compensating algorithm.

Hereinafter various embodiments of the present disclosure will be described with reference to as follows.

At operation the controller may determine that the electronic device is in a first state e.g. a standby state or a low load state of the controller if the controller determines that the absolute value T CPU T RAW of the difference is smaller than or equal to the second critical value C. If the controller determines that the electronic device is in the first state e.g. if the controller determines that the electronic device is not in the high load state then the controller may proceed to operation .

At operation the controller may detect an external temperature and an environment value T COMP approximated to the external temperature from the measured environment value T RAW by applying Equation 1 of the first compensating algorithm.

Alternatively at operation the controller may determine that the electronic device as a second state e.g. a high load state of the controller if the controller determines that the absolute value T CPU T RAW of the difference is larger than the second critical value C.

Hereinafter various embodiments of the present disclosure will be described with reference to as follows.

Referring to at operation the controller may receive an external temperature value T RAW which is an environmental value measured by the temperature humidity sensor included in the sensor unit of the electronic device . According to various embodiments of the present disclosure the controller may operatively detect the external temperature value T RAW using for example the sensor unit .

According to various embodiments of the present disclosure the controller may operatively detect the temperature T CPU of the controller and the temperature T BAT of the battery using for example the sensor unit .

Because accuracy of the first compensating algorithm may be lowered under sudden variation environment of temperature comparing the measured environment value T RAW and a first critical value R the controller may determine whether the measured environment value T RAW is measured under a sudden variation environment of temperature.

Therefore at operation the controller may compare the measured environment value T RAW with a first critical value R. According to various embodiments of the present disclosure the controller may determine whether the measured environment value is within a range of the first critical value R e.g. the controller may determine whether T RAW

If the controller determines that the measured environment value T RAW is larger than the first critical value R at operation the controller determines that the measured environment value T RAW is measured under a sudden variation environment of temperature and then the controller may proceed to operation at which the controller may detect an environment value T COMP approximated to the external temperature from the measured environment value T RAW by applying Equation 2 of the second compensating algorithm.

In contrast if the controller determines that the measured environment value T RAW is smaller than or equal to the first critical value R at operation then the controller may proceed to operation at which the controller may calculate a difference between the temperature T CPU of the controller and the measured environment value and compare the absolute value T CPU T RAW of the difference with the second critical value C. For example at operation the controller may determine whether the electronic device e.g. the controller is in a high load state.

At operation the controller may determine that the electronic device is in a first state e.g. a standby state or a low load state of the controller if the controller determines that the absolute value T CPU T RAW of the difference is smaller than or equal to the second critical value C.

If the controller determines that the electronic device is in the second state e.g. if the controller determines that the electronic device is in the high load state then the controller may proceed to operation .

At operation the controller may detect an environment value T COMP approximated to the external temperature from the measured environment value T RAW by applying Equation 2 of the second compensating algorithm.

According to various embodiments of the present disclosure the controller can monitor the absolute value T CPU T RAW of the difference. As the result of monitoring the absolute value T CPU T RAW if the controller determines that the absolute value of the difference in the first state of the electronic device is larger than the second critical value C then the controller may change the state of the electronic device from the first state to the second state.

As the result of monitoring the absolute value T CPU T RAW if the controller determines that the absolute value of the difference in the second state of the electronic device is smaller than or equal to the second critical value C then the controller may change the state of the electronic device from the second state to the first state.

In contrast the controller determines that a variation of the temperature is high when the temperature T BAT of the battery is larger than the predetermined critical value and may detect an environment value T COMP approximated to the external temperature from the measured environment value T RAW by applying the second compensating algorithm.

Alternatively the controller determines that a variation of the temperature is low when the measured environment value T RAW is smaller than or equal to the first critical value R which is predetermined and may detect the environment value T COMP approximated to the external temperature from the measured environment value T RAW by applying the first compensating algorithm. Alternatively the controller determines that a variation of the temperature is high when the measured environment value T RAW is larger than the first critical value R which is predetermined and may detect the environment value T COMP approximated to the external temperature from the measured environment value T RAW by applying the second compensating algorithm.
