The present application claims priority to Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 838 864 filed Jun. 24 2013 entitled Presence Of Passenger Time Cell Phone Presence Ignition Interlock Device which is incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

This invention relates to a compliance device for a motor vehicle and more particularly to a presence of passenger and time ignition interlock device PITD and monitoring system having one or more sensors that monitor the presence of the vehicle operator passengers inside the vehicle compartment and other operational compliance parameters established for the vehicle.

While vehicle ignition lock systems have existed in the prior art typically they are wired devices that are difficult time consuming and costly to install and operate. Conventional sobriety interlock systems have been specifically developed for the restricting a driver s ability to start the vehicle or for their driving privilege e.g. a driving restriction for sobriety or restriction for no mobile phone use during operation.

Ignition interlock devices are known to insure sobriety of the operator of a machine. For example U.S. Pat. No. 6 853 956 issued Jun. 4 2013 to Ballard for Sobriety testing apparatus having OBD II connection capability describes a sobriety interlock system having an alcohol detection device a computing device electrically connected to the alcohol detection device capable of determining a blood alcohol concentration of an operator based and an electronic circuit for obtaining machine operating parameters is disposed between an on board diagnostic port on the machine and the computing device. U.S. Pat. No. 7 451 852 issued Nov. 18 2008 to Stewart et al. for Vehicle Sobriety Interlock System With Personal Identification Element describes an interlock system for measuring the sobriety of a potential motorized apparatus operator is coupled to the starting mechanism of said motorized apparatus that includes a microprocessor controlled handset base unit and photographic device that facilitates the identification process of the person taking the test by taking at least two consecutive pictures one before and one during the test. Both of these devices are sobriety interlock systems having an alcohol detection device electronically connected to a computing device that let a machine start only if the BAC blood alcohol content of the operator is less than programmed on the computing device. Although these devices have interlock systems to prevent dangerous and illegal operation of machinery they do not prevent an operator from carrying unlawful passengers not seat belts busting curfew and other operating restrictions that are predetermined for certain persons.

There are also a few devices that restrict cell phone usage. A U.S. Pat. No 20120214408 to Chronister describes an ignition lock that prevents cell phone use by the user of equipment that includes a cellular device dock with integrated lock connected to an ignition of the equipment configured to prevent use of a cellular device by the user of equipment unless the cellular device is inserted into the cellular device dock. If no cellular device is inserted and or if the cellular device is not identified by using a matching RFID chip and a RFID reader the equipment will not start due to an incomplete starter circuit. The cellular device dock with integrated lock describes a way to ensure that vehicle operators do not hold cell phones while driving.

While ignition interlock systems have been used for sobriety and cell phone none have been developed to insure parental and legal control of the number of passengers a restricted driver can carry and at what hours the operator can operate the machine. For example conventional vehicle ignition lock systems may not monitor compliance with driving licensure restrictions and other State Graduated Driver Licensing GDL Laws that restrict a driver s privilege in the operation of the vehicle. Restricting a driver s privilege in the operation of the vehicle heretofore has been personally monitored by a supervisor such as a boss parent court or agent. Moreover other driving licensure restrictions can include time of day passengers use of corrective lenses and the like. For example time of day restriction from the State licensing authority may relate to eyesight where a driver with eye disease congenital malformations and or deformations of eyes eyesight may have a statutory driving restriction placed on the license e.g. for a medical condition such as glaucoma myopia partial blindness or the elderly. For example if a driver has an eyesight licensure restriction known conventional ignition lock and monitoring systems would not function to monitor compliance of the restriction by the operator of the vehicle. As a result vehicle ignition lock systems for drunk driving do not function to measure compliance with driving licensure restrictions and or State GDL Laws.

Other licensure restrictions may apply to the licensure of new driver Learner s Permit teen drivers below the age of 18 public transportation transportation of children in a School Bus and the like. For example new drivers under the age of 18 years old in the State of Connecticut have licensure restriction as follows With your restricted driver s license you must adhere to the following driving restrictions For the first 6 months 

As a result the sobriety ignition lock and monitoring systems do not function to measure compliance with driving licensure restrictions and or State GDL Laws such as licensure restrictions on the operation of the vehicle for work time of day and in the carrying of passengers.

Therefore a need exists for a monitoring system that provides compliance in the operation of the vehicle with operator permission and operational parameters in the vehicle operator s system and monitor the presence of the vehicle operator and passengers inside the vehicle.

It is an object of the present invention to provide a system for monitoring the compliance of a user of a machine. The system has a system controller operably connected to the machine one or more input devices integrated with the system controller and configured to provide inputs to the system to configure one or more predetermined restrictions for the user in a storage of the system in order to operate the machine and measure the user s compliance with the predetermined restrictions. a display device integrated in the system controller and configured to display input status and operation of the system at least one sensor configured to communicate sensor information to the system controller concerning compliance with the predetermined restrictions an energy source or battery configured to provide power to at least the system controller and an output signal configured to restrict operation of the machine when the sensor information is not in compliance with the predetermined restrictions. The sensors can be presence infrared sensors to detect the presence of front and rear passengers in the machine.

The front passenger sensor assembly also can include a light sensor for providing information about tampering fail safe and time of day e.g. day and night information.

The restriction and compliance monitoring device system and method can be implemented on the computing device by one or more steps in software so as to control the receiver and computing device using a stand alone keypad and display an existing a keypad and display of the machine also shown in the center console of the vehicle in . Additionally the software can be configured so that a remote computer cellular telephone or smart phone tablet and the like can connect to the computing device via a wireless connection to the receiver such as blue tooth or over the Internet to configure operate and monitor the restriction and compliance monitoring system . Similarly the rear passenger sensor assembly can be configured to sense the presence of one or more passenger s and in the rear seat so as to communicate with the receiver and the computing device via a direct line which lines can be installed for example above in the headliner of the vehicle to or alternatively via a wireless connection to communicate with the receiver the presence of a passenger s and or in the rear seat. The rear passenger sensor assembly can be mounted in a location adjacent the passenger s and or seat of the machine such as for example above the rear seat in the vehicle headliner. The rear passenger sensor assembly can include a fail safe switch formed from an opening and a button such as for example when the fail safe switch is normally closed and if the rear passenger sensor assembly is removed from its mounting the button disengages to an open position causing the switch to break whereby the rear passenger sensor assembly indicates tampering of the sensing module . The rear passenger sensor assembly according to an embodiment of the present invention can be configured with a PIR electronic sensor that measures infrared IR light or heat trace radiating from radiating from passenger s and or in each PIR electronic sensor in the respective field of view. The rear passenger sensor assembly also can include one or more light sensor s for each PIR sensor whereby each light sensor provides fail safe information about tampering i.e. if the sensing module is purposely covered and time of day e.g. day and night information for licensure restrictions.

Referring to the receiver and computing device of the compliance monitoring device system and method is described with reference to a PTID System Controller . The system controller is used for computational and compliance determinations. The system controller can display its status on a display such as an LCD display of the machine display of the smart phone tablet remote computer or separately provided display as illustrated in . A status of the device and system can be displayed using LED s 1 ON Green 0 OFF Red Front Seat FS Sensor signal from ON OFF Pink Passenger Rear Seat PS Sensor signal s from ON OFF Pink . The system controller of the computing device includes a real time clock and time and date information useful for determining and calculating dawn dusk hours of operation curfew speed and other time based calculations.

Additionally inputs from input devices of restrictions parameters information and other settings in the setup and operation of the device and system . For example input from the receiver including any wireless transceiver the keypad and wireless informational input from the App on a device smart phone or tablet through a Wi Fi or Bluetooth wireless interface and transmission.

The system controller may be formed to generate a variety of outputs from information received from sensors and input devices regarding the status setup and operation of the device and system . For example input information on restrictions parameters information and other settings can be stored data residing on storage a card reader or hard drive as well as the information can be stored and accessed via wireless connection on a remote computer and accessed in the cloud.

The system controller is useful in energizing and de energizing certain switches and or relays so as to control the operation of machine thought compliance with the predetermined information and sensors of the device and system . For example the operating the machine can be controlled by energizing and de energizing the ignition relay . In certain situations when the machine is already in operation and the user breaks a preset restriction the system controller can be configured to not shut off of the machine i.e. automobile as this could create a safety problem. In such instances a warning is contemplated to be issued to the user such as in Steps and . The device and system also can be configured to turn off the radio by de energizing a radio relay engage the hazard lights by energizing the hazard light relay and or sound the horn if this option is selected by energizing the horn relay as well as to send a notification to the supervisor reporting the specific non conforming action.

Referring to a flowchart of the method of operating the device and system of to establish restrictions and compliance monitoring setup according to an embodiment of the present invention. The method can be implemented in the hardware circuit and software of the computing device by way of firmware and software as well as being notifying including a remote computer a mobile application for use with the smart phone and tablet . The software application may control the operation of the system and data port to the hardware installed on the machine . The software application will have several modes. One mode will be for set up and updating restrictions used by the supervisor parents and the like . Another mode will be for use by the user e.g. the drivers of the automobile of the machine to initiate the operation thereof whereby the software application can be activated to connect to the hardware in the car to then start the car.

As is illustrated in an exemplary method of the present invention can be software or other computer implemented process for an initial set up of the system. Step starts the setup of the system by the user initiating the software program for example after tapping an icon for the application or App will open and display three options Log In Connect and Register. Step the login process by the supervisor or parent. For example the supervisor logs in to view the user i.e. user s driving activities by profile . After logging in the supervisor can also adjust the specifications and accessed online via a regular website. Step the Connect Step establishes what the User will see and select when he she enters the machine before being authorized to operate the machine i.e. automobile . After making this selection the App will pair to the device to the machine and request the supervisor set up a User access code keypad appears for a particular user.

Step a Register and initial Set Up of the device requires a supervisor to enter the supervisor s access code or individual identification number ID . The supervisors ID is stored in the stored data . The device also can be set up by a technician and any technicians ID will be cross referenced with a list of authorized registered installers and locations in order to prevent tampering. Once the correct ID is inputted a screen will display and request a user and device registration. The supervisor will create a login ID and password and that is stored data which can be stored on the device in the cloud at a remote computer or paired to the supervisor s computer smart phone or tablet each of the later can access the account on the computing device via the receiver such as for example by a Bluetooth wireless connection. The pairing of the supervisor technician and user s accounts to the device and system ensures that only authorized supervisor technician and user s accounts installed will be able to enable the machine in the appropriate way. It is contemplated that the registration process can include an insurance disclaimer and agreement on liability that the supervisor will electronically sign. At this point the supervisor can finish the registration installation process.

Referring to Steps through the supervisor can adjust the restrictions and items of compliance monitoring for the particular user and ID. For example in Step the supervisor is requested to enter data of overall passenger monitoring e.g. HOW MANY PASSENGER S ALLOWED And a particular number ENTER NUMBER 0 1 2 3 4 i.e. as will correspond to sensors determining the presence of passengers of based on the authorized restriction level of the user . The input will be stored as stored data for the particular user ID . In Step the supervisor is requested to enter data of front seat passenger monitoring e.g. IS PASSENGER ALLOWED IN FRONT SEAT YES NO and such input will be stored as stored data for the particular user ID . In Step the supervisor is requested to enter data of time of day hours of operation and curfew restriction and monitoring e.g. WHAT TIME CAN THE CAR BE OPERATED INPUT AM PM DAWN DUSK and such input will be stored as stored data for the particular user ID . In another Step the supervisor has the option to enter data of seat belt usage and monitoring e.g. SEAT BELT MONITORING YES NO and if YES Step starts a corresponding PROCESS for information to set up seat belt monitoring and notifications e.g. 1 NOTIFICATION ADDRESS and such input will be stored as stored data for the particular user ID . In another Step the supervisor has the option to enter data of speed monitoring e.g. SPEED MONITORING YES NO and if YES Step starts a corresponding PROCESS for information to set up speed monitoring and notifications e.g. 1 MAXIMUM SPEED 2 NOTIFICATION ADDRESS and such input will be stored as stored data for the particular user ID . In Step the supervisor has the option to enter data of phone usage restriction and monitoring e.g. PHONE USAGE MONITORING YES NO and if YES Step starts a corresponding PROCESS for information to set up phone usage and notifications e.g. 1 NOTIFICATION ADDRESS and such input will be stored as stored data for the particular user ID . In Step the supervisor has the option to enter data of sobriety restrictions by breathalyzer monitoring e.g. BREATHALIZER MONITORING YES NO and if YES Step starts a corresponding PROCESS for information to set up breathalyzer testing using the user s phone with appropriate breathalyzer device attached to test and issue results and notifications e.g. 1 RESULTS 2 NOTIFICATION ADDRESS and such input will be stored as stored data for the particular user ID . In Step the supervisor has the option to enter data of GPS location and travel restrictions and monitoring e.g. GEOGRAPHIC TRACKING RESTRICTION YES NO and if YES Step starts a corresponding PROCESS for information to set up breathalyzer testing using the user s phone with appropriate breathalyzer device attached to test and issue results and notifications e.g. DRAW POLYGON ON MAP OF PREDEFINED RANGE and such input will be stored as stored data for the particular user ID . The above listed restrictions are exemplary and other restrictions and monitoring of the user s activities and operation of the machine are contemplated and can be implemented in a similar manner. Once all of the set up processes and information is collected and stored in Step initial set up of the device and system and or a particular user is completed.

Referring to a flowchart of the operation of the system and method according to an embodiment of the present invention. Step initiates the operation of the device and system by the user e.g. driver initiating the software program for example after tapping an icon for the application or App will open and display a Login screen. Step the login process requests the user s ID name and or access code. Step Entering a User s ID name and or access code will start a process of verification cross referencing stored data on a computing device which also can be in the cloud or stored on a remote computer or server and retrieval of previously set restrictions and monitoring that supervisor or parent created in the process . Step a process occurs to compare stored data for the specific user to identify the user any restrictions for the user as the User s access code will have to match up with the specific device Serial installed on the particular device and system associated with the machine . After the User inputs his her ID name and or access code Steps through implement information and process checks for whether or not any of the restrictions are broken or alternatively the compliance of the restrictions and modifications in Steps as set by the supervisor for the particular user . For example in Step the device and system performs compliance and monitoring by checking the front and rear seat passenger sensors e.g. CHECK SENSORS FOR HOW MANY PASSENGER S COMPARE TO THOSE ALLOWED. In Step the device and system performs compliance and monitoring of the time allowed by checking the internal clock the light sensor s or date and time comparing to almanac information in stored data e.g. CHECK TIME ALLOWED HOURS OF OPERATION COMPARE TO TIME.

In Step the device and system performs compliance and monitoring of the use of seat belts by checking the seat belt sensor s in the car e.g. HECK SEAT BELT SENSOR S IN USE COMPLIANCE YES NO. In Step the device and system performs compliance and monitoring of the speed s the user is operating the machine by checking GPS location information speedometer output information to the operating limitations set by process e.g. CHECK SPEED WITHIN LIMIT PROVIDE WARNING. In Step the device and system performs compliance and monitoring of the use of a mobile telephone during the user s operation of the machine e.g. CHECK PHONE USAGE HANDS FREE YES NO PROVIDE WARNING. In Step the device and system performs compliance and monitoring of the user s sobriety prior to the operation of the machine e.g. CHECK BREATHALIZER TAKE DATA. For example a breathalyzer used to determine the BAC for this App can be the Breathometer https www.breathometer.com . In Step the device and system performs compliance and monitoring of the geographic location of the user to determine if within the operating range permitted for the machine by checking GPS location information and other operating limitations set by process e.g. CHECK GEOGRAPHIC TRACKING TAKE DATA PROVIDE WARNING. If in compliance of the check of Steps the user will be allowed to operate the machine . For example device and system determines if in compliance Step IN COMPLIANCE YES NO if YES then none of the restrictions are broken and a PROCESS to log and send any notifications will be initiated by Step and the machine will be allowed to start in Step by turning off the ignition lock. Step if any of the restrictions are broken if NO the machine will not be allowed to start in Step as the ignition lock will remain ON and a PROCESS to log and send any notifications will be initiated by Step to the supervisor if they required it .

It is to be appreciated that if the user is operating the machine and breaks a preset restriction the ignition lock of the machine i.e. automobile will not shut off by de energizing the ignition relay as this could create a safety problem. A warning is contemplated to be issued to the user such as in Steps and . The device and system also can be configured to turn off the radio by de energizing a radio relay engage the hazard lights by energizing the hazard light relay and or sound the horn if this option is selected by energizing the horn relay as well as to send a notification to the supervisor reporting the specific non conforming action.

Referring to the front passenger sensor assembly is configured and may be formed with a base and a cover configured to fit over the base . The cover has a recess located distal from the base and is adapted to receive a lens in the recess . The recess further is configured with an IR hole for receiving infra red light and a hole for receiving visible light. As shown in and the front passenger sensor assembly can be supplied with power ground and data signals along line to the assembly. Alternatively the front passenger sensor assembly can be self contained using a wireless transceiver and battery to transmit sensor signals via wireless transmission to the computing device .

The base and cover enclose a PIR sensor light guide and circuitry to provide detection and to protect from environmental conditions and tampering. The base may be formed with an opening configured to hold a button disposed therein configured to be affixed for example by adhesive to windows ceilings and the like whereby the button release from the opening staying with the adhesive as a fail safe to prevent tampering. For example as a fail safe the button inserted in the opening to close a switch so that the machine can be operated if all required inputs allow e.g. sensor inputs and if removed from its mounting the button disengages to an open position causing a break in the switch output whereby the front passenger sensor assembly indicates tampering of the device and operation of the machine is not allowed The button switch can receive power from the battery or alternatively line power and ground . On one side the PIR sensor is supported upon the base by one or more stanchions and on the other side is positioned at the larger end of a cone configured to collect and condense IR signals through the IR hole to the PIR sensor for detection by the control circuitry . As shown in the stanchion may be formed of a generally cylindrical post and made from suitable materials such as metals and plastics to support and maintain the PIR sensor in place.

As shown in the lens can have optics e.g. Fresnel lens for focusing and directing predetermined wavelengths to the control circuitry and PIR sensor. The light sensor assembly of the front passenger sensor assembly includes a light guide disposed adjacent the hole allowing visible light therethrough. As shown in a light guide for the front passenger sensor assembly may be formed by a tube and optical fiber so as to receive visible light from hole and convey the light to the control circuitry i.e. circuitry to control signal operation of the PIR sensor light sensor wireless transceiver power and the like for detection as shown in and A. As shown in a light guide for the rear passenger sensor assembly may be formed by a tube and optical fiber so as to receive visible light from hole and convey the light to the control circuitry for detection as shown in B and C. The light guides and alternatively can be formed from conventional flexible fiber optic cable.

In another embodiment in order to prevent tampering by a user covering the light sensor with tape or any other disruptive object the time of day may be computed by a comparison of the real time clock time and date information with almanac data GPS time zone data and daylight savings time data to compute curfew dusk dawn and other time of day licensure restrictions. Moreover prior to initiation providing light from the machine to the light sensor at night or another light such as such as an LED can be added so that positive light sensing by the light sensor can be afforded prior to operation to ensure that there is no covering of the PIR sensor with tape or other ways to defeat the passenger restriction.

Referring to similarly the rear passenger sensor assembly is configured and may be formed with a base and a cover configured to fit over the base . The cover has a recess located distal from the base adapted to receive a lens in the recess . The recess further is configured with one or more IR holes for receiving infra red light and one or more holes for receiving visible light. The base and cover enclose a PIR sensor light guide and circuitry to provide detection and to protect from environmental conditions and tampering. As shown in and the rear passenger sensor assembly can be supplied with power ground and data signals along line to the computing device . Alternatively the rear passenger sensor assembly can be self contained using a wireless transceiver and battery to transmit sensor signals via wireless transmission to the computing device .

The base may be formed with an opening configured to can include a fail safe switch formed from an opening and a button such as for example when the push button is normally closed the fail safe switch is closed so that the machine can be operated if all required inputs allow e.g. sensor inputs and if removed from its mounting the push button disengages to an open position causing a break in the switch output whereby the rear passenger sensor assembly indicates tampering of the machine and operation of the machine is not allowed. Similar to the base the base can be affixed to the windshield ceiling or corner utilizing adhesives that interacts and secures to button so that tampering removes button from opening and opens the fail safe switch. On one side one or more PIR sensors are supported upon the base by a sensor mounting plate and on the other side are positioned at the larger end of one or more cones configured to collect and condense IR signals through each of the IR holes to each of the PIR sensors for detection by the control circuitry i.e. circuitry to control signal operation of the PIR sensor light sensor wireless transceiver power and the like . The lens can have optics e.g. Fresnel lens curvature and the like for focusing and directing predetermined wavelengths to the control circuitry and PR sensors . The light sensor assembly of the rear passenger sensor assembly includes a light guide disposed adjacent the hole allowing visible light therethrough. Similarly as described herein the light guide may be formed by a tube and optical fiber so as to receive visible light from hole and convey the light to the control circuitry for detection as shown in B and C.

Referring to a presence infra red electronic PIR sensor is an electronic sensor that measures infrared IR light radiating from objects in its field of view. As shown in a typical assembly includes the lens for condensing the IR light to parallel numerous Fresnel lenses or mirror segments has an effective range of about ten meters thirty feet and a field of view less than 180 degrees. The PIR sensor is configured in the front passenger sensor assembly and one or more PIR sensors are used in the rear passenger sensor assembly and are typically mounted on a printed circuit board containing the necessary electronics required to interpret the signals from the PIR sensor itself. The lens can be made from plastic to create a window through which the infrared energy can enter and despite often being only translucent to visible light infrared energy is able to reach the sensor through the window because the plastic used is transparent to infrared radiation. For example lens may be formed circular to fit in the recess of base with optics such as for example a convex shape with a Fresnel lens pattern as is illustrated in . Similarly as is shown in lens can be configured to wrap around the cover and fit in the recess . The plastic lens further reduces the chance of foreign objects dust insects etc. from obscuring the PIR sensors field of view damaging the mechanism and or causing false alarms. The window may be used as a filter to limit the wavelengths to 8 14 micrometers which is closest to the infrared radiation emitted by humans and serve as a focusing mechanism.

As shown in and the sensor mounting plate may be used to mount one or more PIR sensors in a predetermined orientation so as to determine the presence of multiple passengers in the rear seat from the passenger s IR signal e.g. passengers and as the sensor s position is angularly directed to the particular seating positions as is illustrated in . Similarly as is shown in and A B and C the light guides can be formed from suitable materials having an optical fiber or fiber disposed within a tube . The light guides with angular curves to fit within a particular cover design for example light guide is designed to the shape of the cover of the front passenger sensor assembly as shown in and light guide can be designed for the cover of the rear passenger sensor assembly as shown in .

As is illustrated in the base can be formed from suitable materials in a circular shape so as to be received in the cover . The base may be formed with control circuitry such as for example power for a wireless transmitter for the PR sensor optical light circuitry for the optical sensor and light guides and the like. The base may be formed with an opening for receiving a magnet use of a fastener and passing lines to the control circuitry if directly connected by lines to the computer device .

As is illustrated in the base can be formed from suitable materials in a rectangular shape so as to be received in the cover . The base may be formed with control circuitry such as for example power for a wireless transmitter for the PIR sensors optical light circuitry for the optical sensor and light guides and the like. The base may be formed with an opening for receiving a magnet use of a fastener and passing lines to the control circuitry if directly connected by lines to the computer device .

Alternate embodiments of the present invention the restriction and compliance monitoring device system and method may be incorporated by a vehicle manufacturer at the factory in order to integrate the present invention seamlessly into the dashboard of a vehicle. In this manner lines may be run behind the headliner or with other wiring to the appropriate areas and the receiver computing device can be securely located so as to prevent tampering. The input or keypad and display also shown in the center console of the vehicle in functionality can be integrated in the existing vehicle control module could so as to utilize any display and input in the dash of the vehicle in order to accept the setup information and input of the user. Subsequently incorporation in this way within the dash of the vehicle makes it very hard to tamper with. Bluetooth technology conventionally equipped in vehicles from the factory may be employed in this embodiment of the present invention to utilize a cellular device smart phone or other device with an application running thereon to setup and control any input with the device.

The device system and method can provide speed monitoring. For example sending a notification to the supervisor if the machine goes over a certain speed by monitoring the signals from the machine and in the case of an automobile if the car goes over 80 MPH then send notification and store details such as average difference between the speed limit and speed of vehicle.

The device system and method can provide location monitoring. If GPS feature is enabled by the supervisor to track the machine it will consistently be tracked using GPS and storing the data for a certain length of time e.g. the past 2 weeks of travel . In the set up of the device system and method the supervisor can utilize graphics such as for example to draw a polygon on a map that shows the areas where the user can operate. The system can determine if the user exits this range of GPS coordinates and the supervisor will get a notification. Moreover there can be data stored 208 and displayed on a map showing the locations were the machine has travelled with differentiation for different users i.e. different colors for different drivers . The method of operation can use a maps platform 

The device system and method can provide Cell Phone Use restriction. The system may be configured with a charger for the cell mobile or smart phone that the user can plug into. In an automobile operation in order to start the machine the user s smart phone communicates the user s ID with the receiver computing device via wireless i.e. Bluetooth and the to communicate with the server or storage for restriction cross referencing. Once the machine is started and is in operation the smart phone and application stays open on the smart phone to lock out texting phone calls and other restricted distracting features other than permitted features warnings communications from supervisor GPS location directions music and the like. After the user enters his her pass code and or ID the lock out feature on the phone automatically responds to incoming text messages with a response as well as phone calls with voice mail or the like i.e. the smart phone doesn t shut off while the App is on during operation of the machine while the ignition relay is on.

The device system and method can provide a breathalyzer feature and restriction. If breathalyzer feature is enabled by the supervisor to track the machine the supervisor can establish requirements for all driving or certain periods of time i.e. teens may not statistically drink Monday Thursday but usually between Friday evening and Sunday morning . The system can use the smart phone to connect to a breathalyzer used to determine the BAC such as for example available Breathometer https www.breathometer.com .

The method can use an App for example Is your User name required to supply a breath sample before driving If Yes the App will ask at what times The supervisor can then input the interval for example Friday 4 PM Sunday 8 AM. When the user inputs the user s ID during this time interval the App will ask for a breath sample the user will plug the small breathalyzer into their smart phone and provide the sample. If the sample is less than the maximum BAC the vehicle or machine will be allowed to start. If the sample is greater than or equal to the maximum BAC the vehicle or machine will not be allowed to start and the supervisor will receive a notification. If while driving the device asks for an additional sample and the driver does not pull over within X minutes a notification will be sent to the supervisor and one of the following can occur the radio will turn off the horn sounds the hazard lights will go off to warn other drivers of a potential drunk driver.
