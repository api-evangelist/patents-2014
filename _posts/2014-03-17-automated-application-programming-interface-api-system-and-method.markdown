This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 791 816 filed on Mar. 15 2013 which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth.

Many companies purchase software as a service SaaS platform as a service PaaS Infrastructure as a Service IaaS or something similar. SaaS is essentially on demand software supplied by software vendors where software and associated data are centrally hosted on the cloud. SaaS software can be accessed by customers using a thin client via a web browser. Similarly IaaS is a model wherein a company outsources the equipment for operation such as storage hardware servers and networking components. PaaS is a model allowing customers to rent hardware operating systems storage and network capacity over the Internet. However many companies and non profit organizations do not like being tied to a monthly fee. Also the flexibility to customize to a particular business s needs may be limited based on the rules of the SaaS PaaS and IaaS provides.

Methods and apparatus are desired allowing companies the flexibility to enable e commerce transactions.

The application programming interface API disclosed herein allows third parties to request two click payment buttons for inclusion in HTML formatted electronic communications. The methods and apparatus disclosed herein allow the process to be automated and scaled. It also allows access control for button generation at a per account basis.

A method for leveraging email to complete an online transaction from a third party vendor the method comprising storing customer information the customer information including a customer name customer email address customer shipping address and customer billing information. The method further comprises receiving an authorization request from an application programming interface associated with a third party vendor requesting access to a portion of the customer information and receiving confirmation from a customer to allow the third party vendor to access the portion of the customer information. The method further comprising transmitting an access code to the third party vendor and receiving a request message from the third party vendor wherein the request message comprises the access code and wherein the request message requests an authorization token. The method may further comprise confirming the received access code and transmitting an authorization token to the third party vendor.

When used herein the term token may refer to a sequence of byte data or a string or a file used to authenticate a transaction. A token may be one or multiple encrypted strings files passwords cyphers or other data which may contain information used to perform or authenticate a transaction when sent to payment servers. These tokens may be encrypted using a public private key encryption system. The vendor or a party with knowledge of the vendor s private key may generate an encrypted token. Alternatively a payment system or e commerce site may generate this token on behalf of the vendor.

Disclosed herein are processor executable methods computing systems and related technologies for an automated application programming interface API . The system and method may use an email server account to complete an e commerce transaction e.g. for items services events donations for a transfer of funds from a customer to a vendor e.g. retail site charity political organization or other vendor. While the technologies described herein are discussed using e mail as an example they may also be applicable to similar communication mediums such as SMS and MMS communication channels.

The customer device may be for example a cellular phone a smartphone a desktop computer a laptop computer a tablet computer or any other appropriate computing device. The customer device includes a processor memory a communications unit a display unit and web browser unit which may communicate data to from the web server module s in the vendor server and payment server . The web browser unit may include and or communicate with one or more sub modules that perform functionality such as rendering HTML including but not limited to HTML5 rendering raster and or vector graphics executing JAVASCRIPT and or rendering multimedia content.

Alternatively or additionally the web browser unit may implement Rich Internet Application RIA and or multimedia technologies such as ADOBE FLASH and or other technologies compatible with Internet based communications. The web browser unit may implement RIA and or multimedia technologies using one or web browser plug in modules e.g. ADOBE FLASH and or using one or more sub modules within the web browser unit itself. The web browser unit may display data on one or more display devices not depicted that are included in or connected to the customer device such as a liquid crystal display LCD display or monitor. The customer device may receive input from the user of the customer device from input devices not depicted that are included in or connected to the customer device such as a keyboard a mouse a microphone or a touch screen and provide data that indicates the input to the web browser unit .

The vendor server may include an HTTP server module a token generator a button generator a processor memory a payment gateway and a communications unit .

The HTTP server module provides a website that may be accessed by a customer device . The HTTP server module may implement the HTTP protocol and may communicate Hypertext Markup Language HTML pages and related data from the website to from the customer device using HTTP. The vendor server may be connected to one or more private or public networks such as the Internet via which the HTTP server module communicates with devices such as the customer device . The HTTP server module may generate one or more web pages and may communicate the web pages to the customer device and may receive responsive information from the customer device .

The HTTP server module may be for example an NGINX server APACHE HTTP server a SUN ONE Web Server a MICROSOFT INTERNET Information Services IIS server and or may be based on any other appropriate HTTP server technology. The vendor server may also include one or more additional components or modules not depicted such as one or more load balancers firewall devices routers switches and devices that handle power backup and data redundancy.

The payment gateway may be a proprietary service that directly connects with the payment processors such as banking server to handle the credit card data and authorize credit card payments.

The token generator may generate tokens for use in e commerce transactions. Tokens may be encrypted sequence of data which contain information to perform a transaction when sent to the payment server s . Additionally or alternatively a token may be one or multiple encrypted strings files passwords cyphers or other data which may contain information used to perform or authenticate a transaction. A token may include one or more of the following parameters or other parameters not listed below 

To confirm an e commerce transaction via email the customer sends an email embedded with a token to the payment server s address. The system is designed to allow the vendor flexibility to offer deals for a limited time or number or responsive to available inventory. For example the token may be configured to expire by default after two weeks or any predetermined time or never expire. The vendor server may be configured to extend or shorten the expiration time of a particular offer associated with a token without resending an email or generating a new token. Also the vendor server may send email updates for an offer associated with a token. This may be predetermined or may be later set depending upon demand by customers. Additionally the vendor server may generate groups of token values that may automatically invalidate members of the group when one token is processed. This is useful when sending out multiple tokens via email to a single customer or when sending out tokens to multiple customers but when the vendor wants only one or a predetermined number of tokens to be processed. Therefore when these predetermined number of tokens are used the other tokens are invalidated effectively rescinding the offered deal. The vendor server may further be configured to send email notifications that the previously submitted token is now invalid.

The button generator may create cross client and cross browser compatible buttons for e commerce transactions. In one embodiment the button generator may include the token generator to automatically generate an associated token for each button that is created. As discussed in greater below the token generator and button generator may be configured to access an API that is stored in memory and controlled by processor .

The vendor server using the API as disclosed herein may communicate with the payment server to provide information to the button generator and the token generator . A button and an associated token generated by the button generator and or the token generator may be embedded on a web page created by the HTTP server module .

The memory may be configured to store information associated with e commerce transactions. This may include inventory information information used to generate web pages customer information and other e commerce data.

The payment server may include an HTTP server module a token generator a processor memory payment gateway and a communications unit . While only one vendor server is shown communicating with the payment server this is shown as only an example but there may be many payment servers . Payment server may communicate with multiple vendor servers . A customer wishing to use the services of the payment server may register his her email address and payment information with the payment server . Similarly vendors may register with the payment server . The payment server may provide the vendor server with a public key and private key to be used in token transaction in accordance with the methods described herein. When a transaction is attempted the payment server decodes the token authenticates the sender of the email and may process the transaction. While the payment server is depicted as a separate entity in this is shown as an example only. The payment server may be controlled and or co located with the vendor server the banking server .

The banking server may be controlled by a third party system bank. The payment server may communicate with the banking server to verify that the customer has adequate funds or credit for the requested purchase. For example the banking server may be a controlled by VISA AMERICAN EXPRESS MASTERCARD or any other bank or banking or financial network that a customer may use for online payment. The banking server may be a server for virtual currencies such as BITCOIN etc.

Also shown in the API also permits the vendor server to securely generate two click payment buttons for a customer that has granted permission from a list of recipient email addresses. The vendor server transmits an account information request to the payment server for an account associated with a customer. The payment server responds by providing the vendor server with a customer s account information such as email username first name last name and an avatar URL. The vendor server may request a button and the API provides information for the inclusion of payment buttons in content not being generated directly by payment server .

The API enables an exchange of information between any business entity and payment server extending a business application s capabilities with two click payment technology.

The API may perform an entire transaction invoicing system and may be applied to any similar email payment technologies. In addition the API may be used within other companies email marketing systems for the creation of different workflows.

With authentication there may be a secure workflow but the email may not be encrypted. In an alternative embodiment the email may use DomainKeys Identified Mail DKIM and or Sender Policy Framework SPF technology. DKIM provides a method for validating a domain name identity that is associated with a message through cryptographic authentication. SPM is an email validation system designed to prevent email spam by detecting email spoofing. If DKIM and or SPF are used for authentication then tokens unique to each user may be unnecessary.

The API provides an OAuth 2.0 authentication system and a number of endpoints that enable its users to extend an application s capabilities with for example a two click transaction. The system may comprise an API developer dashboard that provides access to client configurations as well as statistical information allowing a user to have access to API performance and status on a real time basis. For example the API Dashboard may comprise a user interface to manage API information. Clients may be able to reset security keys add OAuth client and update Postback URL.

The web browser window may include a control area that includes a back button forward button refresh button home button and address field . The control area may also include one or more additional control elements such as bookmark page etc. The user of the customer device may select the control elements in the control area . The selection may be performed for example by clicking a mouse or providing input via keyboard touch screen and or other type of input device. When one of the control elements is selected the web browser unit may perform an action that corresponds to the selected element. For example when the refresh button is selected the web browser unit may refresh the page currently viewed in the web browser window.

To perform a transaction such as the transaction showed in an application may generate a client record for each of its environments. The vendor server copies keys for each client and securely stores them for later use in application development.

Once the vendor server has created a client customers operating customer devices connect their accounts to a vendor server s application e.g. via OAuth 2.0. This may allow the payment server to make basic account information such as the information entered in input fields and to be available to the vendor server .

This basic information may be available to the vendor server by transmitting a request. This request may be e.g. GET api account show . To prevent unauthorized requests the request may require an access token.

Referring back to input buttons and are examples of payment buttons. The payment button is the nucleus of Pay s technology. When included in an outgoing email to a member it packages the two click transaction and enables seamless email checkout from within the customer s email client. When included in an outgoing email to a non member it provides the ability to quickly sign up with the payment server and process a transaction with a vendor server through the web interface. The API enables the vendor server to generate payment buttons for inclusion in outgoing emails. The API allows the vendor server to create HTML Payment Buttons. This endpoint requires the buttons scope. To create a button the API associated with the vendor server may generate a request from the payment server . A request may include the following parameters access token amount and email.

An example scenario is shown below. In this scenario bob test.com has an account with the payment server while tim test.net does not.

The difference between a key button and a link button is the interpolation of url in the Button Template. A key button url is replaced with a mailto link while a link button puts a regular link in the url spot.

The API at the vendor server may generate mailto links for any email address associated with a customer account with the payment server . Any address that is not identified by the payment server generates a link which may be used to make a purchase but the customer is directed to the payment server website to complete the purchase and sign up.

As discussed above the API may include an authorization procedure. For example the API may use OAuth2 for authorization and authentication to all available endpoints.

The vendor server may include an application to create a client record on the payment server granting it API access and identifying it with a pair of cryptographic signatures. The vendor server may create multiple client records for each environment in the application.

A customer using a customer device may access the vendor server via a website. The customer connects their account with the vendor server s application granting the vendor server the ability to take action on behalf of the customer part over resources stored at the payment server . This action may be similar to the Log in with options provided by services such as GOOGLE FACEBOOK and GITHUB. The vendor server s application begins this authentication process by redirecting to the authorization endpoint with information about the client record identification and predetermined redirect URLs. The vendor server s authorization client library e.g. OAuth 2.0 may perform the generation of this authorization URL.

If the customer is a registered with the payment server but not logged in they will be prompted to do so. After successfully authenticating customer credentials the customer may be redirected to another page on the payment server s website where the customer will be prompted to enter an input to either Accept or Deny an application access to the scopes the vendor server requested. After selecting an option customer is redirected back to the vendor server and the vendor server may request an authorization token with the code sent by the payment server in the redirect. This token is used in subsequent requests by the vendor server application to access the payment server s API endpoints.

The life of the token may not be related to the session state of the customer. The customer may log in or out of the payment server or the vendor server application and not affect the usability of the token itself. This allows the vendor server to perform requests with this token in scheduled tasks and background processes.

The payment server API may be configured to allow a vendor server to refresh a token when it expires and handle invalid token requests with authorization on part of the customer.

An API core controlled by the processor may generate a security key that may be as a mailto link. The key is validated based on whether it matches the email that it came from and is tied to no transaction or workflow. Its validation is just a validation and is not related to a transaction it may provide the ability to process a two click e commerce transaction. The key may be linked to autopilot or built into one or more applications.
