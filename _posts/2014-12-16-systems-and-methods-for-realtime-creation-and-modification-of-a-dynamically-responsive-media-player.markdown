This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 14 052 670 filed Oct. 11 2013 which issued as U.S. Pat. No. 9 152 392 on Oct. 6 2015 which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 469 650 filed on May 20 2009 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 054 794 filed May 20 2008 U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 055 058 filed May 21 2008 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 090 192 filed Aug. 19 2008. This application is related to U.S. application Ser. No. 14 572 099 filed Dec. 16 2014 which issued as U.S. Pat. No. 9 459 845 on Oct. 4 2016. All of the foregoing applications are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety as if fully set forth herein.

Portions of one or more embodiments of the invention s described herein were made with Government support under contract GSVO6PD00165 awarded by the General Services Administration. The Government has certain rights in certain embodiments of some of these invention s .

A media player typically describes computer software used for playing back various audio and video multimedia files on both stand alone computing devices and on computing devices connected to a network such as the Internet. Designers of these media players attempt to tailor the user interface and functionality of their software applications according to various design preferences specified by their customers who are either the hosts or users of these customized media players.

Today many media players are designed to be embedded in various data displays such as web pages electronic programming guides and other mobile software applications creating graphical compositions. The data display platforms associated with these embedded media players can include specialized scripting which calls for a media player application resident on a host or client side for dynamically embedding the player in a particular data display. Adobe AIR platforms such as Flash previously Shockwave Flash SWF and Flash Lite are examples of commonly used platforms for embedding multimedia content such as streaming video and audio into web pages. These Adobe platforms utilize the ActionScript scripting language to create embedded content that is capable of playing SWF .swf and Flash Video .flv data formats. Other platforms that facilitate embedding media applications in various web based data displays include Adobe FIex Microsoft Silverlight and Sun Microsystems JavaFX and open source GNU Linux platforms such as Moonlight .

Whether a media player is designed as a stand alone software application to be independently executed on a local computing device or whether a media player is designed to be dynamically embedded in a web based data display the goal of the software designer remains the same to custom tailor a media player to best meet a given customer s needs and preferences. Unfortunately at present a media player customer who desires specialized characteristics and functionality in their media player either at the time of creation or as a subsequent modification has to submit these custom specifications to a software designer for reprogramming recompiling and redistribution of a static media player application. This redesign process is inefficient time intensive and unnecessarily expensive for most media player customers and applications.

To remedy the above inefficiencies it would be advantageous to facilitate easy real time creation and modification of custom designed media players.

Embodiments of the present invention are directed to systems and methods for real time creation and modification of specialized media players to be used as stand alone applications or as embedded data display applications. In various embodiments of the present invention these applications can include both host and client side applications. Example programming platforms that can be used to realize software applications associated with the systems and methods of the present invention include but are not limited to various Sun Microsystems JAVA platforms and various Adobe AIR platforms. In an embodiment of the present invention a system facilitating these objectives may include one or more of at least the following components a Player Builder a Designer an Asset Manager a File System and a Compiler. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention the Player Builder application is in communication with the Designer application the Asset Manager application the Compiler application and the File System. Further each of the Designer Asset Manager and Compiler applications are in communication with the File System See . The functionality and significance of these components and their communications are discussed further herein.

The Player Builder application provides an interface for a user to access and create various media player files using a personal computing device such as desktop computer a laptop computer or any other portable computing device. In certain embodiments of the present invention this computing device could be an isolated computing device running the Player Builder application from a local directory. In other embodiments the computing device could be a networked device running the Player Builder application from a networked directory location.

The Designer application preferably interfaces with the Player Builder application to permit a user to actively modify a selected player file utilizing a variety of design interface tools that are available to a user in a design mode. The Asset Manager can be an application which interfaces with the Player Builder and the Designer applications to allow a user to associate certain preconfigured assets or media to a select player during a design mode. The File System facilitates logical storage and retrieval of all data associated with the systems of the present invention such as media files parameter assets asset components player files etc. The Compiler can be an application that imports and or accesses a user created player data file e.g. an XML script various assets and other associated data that may be generated by or referenced with the Player Builder and or Designer applications and then compiles all of this combined data into one executable custom media player application.

In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention a user with access to the Player Builder application may log into the Player Builder by using a user name and or password associated with an approved customer account See . Once in the Player Builder application a user is capable of selecting a players feature for viewing a listing of existing custom media players associated with player templates stored in the File System See . The media player listing displayed to a user further provides a user with the ability to redesign remove preview and export a listed player. A template player listing See provides a user with the ability to select and create a specialized template media player with preconfigured assets and or attributes that meet a user s design preferences. These template media players provide a relatively quick and easy way for a user to create a customized media player. In an embodiment of the present invention selection of a template player invokes the Designer application so that a preconfigured template player can be dynamically modified with various design tools in a design mode.

A logged in user can also utilize the Player Builder application to create a new media player by selecting the create new player feature in the Player Builder interface. Selection of the create new player feature invokes the Designer application which can be run synchronously with the Player Builder application. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention a user can create a new player without using templates or previously designed media players as a starting point. These new players can be constructed from scratch utilizing design tools and preconfigured player component blocks available to a user in a design mode. These component block assets can be associated with a new player under design utilizing the Asset Manager application. In an embodiment of the present invention the Asset Manger links a player identification to selected block component identifications in the File System for later retrieval by the Compiler application.

Various design interfaces associated with the Designer application include but are not limited to the following interfaces General Size Style Content and Freeform See . The General design interface See includes a graphical depiction of a media player under design e.g. a player based on a previously designed media player in the player listing See or based on a selected player template See and multiple user input areas where a user is capable of entering a player name and a brief description of a player type. In an embodiment of the present invention the player description is intended to designate a compatibility standard.

The Size design interface See allows a user to independently size various component block assets associated with a particular player. Component blocks can comprise various preconfigured script assets e.g. interactive command buttons slide bars dials checkboxes etc. and various static parameter assets e.g. color schemes aspect ratios video and sound specifications etc. . An example embodiment of the Size design interface includes multiple sizing handles associated with individual component blocks including a player window block a media window block and a player controls block. In accordance with this embodiment a user can select e.g. by use of a single click and drag the handles associated with a select component block to a desired size and position in a design window to resize the select component block. The component block assets e.g. buttons slide bars etc. dynamically resize to correspond to the size and position associated with the resized component block. Alternatively a user can manually enter height width and positional values directly into a user input sizing window of the Size design interface thereby dynamically resizing a component block and its asset components.

The Style design interface See allows a user to apply various themes to a media player under design and to various asset groups associated with component blocks of that media player. In some embodiments the themes apply to purely aesthetic characteristics and in other embodiments the themes can alter functionality associated with player component block assets. The Content design interface See allows a user to associate select multimedia files e.g. video and audio files in a File System with a particular media player. In an embodiment the Content design interface includes various user input areas associated with a media ID a media protocol a host media server a URL associated with a media location and an auto play preference. Other input areas of the Content design interface can include various background and video characteristics that a user can associate with a media player.

With the Freeform design interface See a user can select various parameters associated with a player window block the media window block and the player controls block of a media player. In an embodiment of the present invention these parameters include component sizing parameters background colors parameters component fill color parameters and component opacity parameters. The Asset Manager associates these asset parameters with block components stored in the File System. After selecting various media player design preferences in each of the General Size Style Content and Freeform design interfaces a user can save their associated media player design selections to the File System by selecting a save feature.

The Asset Manager application runs synchronously with the Player Builder and Designer applications See . In some embodiments of the present invention the Asset Manager creates a logical directory of data associated with a player file in the File System. This data can include static player parameter assets e.g. color schemes aspect ratios video and sound specifications etc. and active player component assets e.g. interactive command buttons slide bars dials checkboxes etc. . In an embodiment a logical directory of player asset identifications is linked to a corresponding player identification in the File System. This asset to player linking facilitates dynamic retrieval of all data related to a player file at the time the Compiler compiles a specific user created player file.

The Player Builder application s player listing interface allows a user to view a listing of existing media players in the File System See . The media player listing further provides a user with the ability to modify preview remove and export a listed player. In an embodiment when a user selects the modify option the Player Builder invokes the Designer application interface wherein a user can modify and associate various assets with the component blocks of a select player See . In a further embodiment when a user selects the preview option the Player Builder invokes the Compiler to compile a player file and associated assets to create a preview related to the executable media player See . In some embodiments the compiled preview player is displayed to a user as a scaled up image representation of what the player s user interface looks like and in other embodiments the compiled preview is a full executable version of the listed media player. When a user selects the remove feature a selected media player is removed from the listing and in some embodiments the File System as well. In an embodiment when a user selects the exportfeature a user is prompted to designate a local or remote directory location where to export an executable version of the listed media player.

When invoked the Compiler application See imports and or accesses source code from a designated player file as well as static and active player asset scripts corresponding to various attribute and component block assets associated with the player file. In at least one embodiment of the present invention some of these assets are stored in a temporary storage area of the File System. The player file compiles the player file and assets creating an executable media player application. In an alternate embodiment the Compiler is utilized to create an embedded web based media player application. In this embodiment the Compiler e.g. a JAVA based compiler See imports and or accesses a player file e.g. an XML player file and generates a custom script wrapper and a web based platform compatible player file used by a cross platform compiler e.g. an Adobe Flash based compiler to call player assets and script components and then compile the combined information into a web based embedded player application See .

In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention an example media player file includes both built in and externally input parameter asset files a parameter cache and various component assets See . After initialization of the media player all parameters are stored in a parameter cache area of the player. Component assets communicate with each other indirectly e.g. as class objects when parameter changes are detected in the player.

In 1998 Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act to require Federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology accessible to people with disabilities. Inaccessible technology interferes with an individual s ability to obtain and use information quickly and easily. Section 508 was enacted to eliminate barriers in information technology to make available new opportunities for people with disabilities and to encourage development of technologies that will help achieve these goals. The law applies to all Federal agencies when they develop procure maintain or use electronic and information technology. Under Section 508 29 U.S.C. 794d agencies must give disabled employees and members of the public access to information that is comparable to the access available to others.

Therefore methods and systems for a disabled user compliant video player for an end to end streaming web video solution affording accessibility for disabled users including blind users and those with partial or poor vision colorblind users deaf users and those limited to only keyboard voice input is also disclosed herein. The Video Player advantageously addresses the individual needs of all of these users and in some embodiments is compliant with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act as amended in 1998 and in embodiments is compatible Level of Triple A for the W3C s Web Content Accessibility 1.0 Guidelines.

The video player preferably contains but is not limited to three main components an Access Bar an Access Map and an Access Player. An Access Bar is generally a persistent link that is placed at the top of a client s Library page it can also be placed elsewhere on the client s web site and links to the client s Access Map. An Access Map is preferably an Representation of the client s library that is advantageously presented in a fully compliant manner and provides navigation between channels of client specific content and for each video provides a summary thumbnail which can include alt text and links to transcript files and the Access Player. A fully accessible Help menu and RSS links are available from the Access Map as well. An Access Player is the video player itself and can allow for the presentation of video with synchronous controls can offer full screen viewing mode can offer the ability to e mail links to specific videos and can reveal embed codes for including the Access Player on blogs or other web sites. All of this is advantageously accomplished while maintaining the highest level of accessibility to the broadest range of users.

In one embodiment the digital player includes a feature that ensures non text elements have a text equivalent so that for example a blind user could use screen reading technology to inform him of what is on the screen. This would include alt text for every image for example the Access Map may have a StoryTile image for every story and a ClientLogo image in the header at a minimum . The text used as alt text for these images would differ from the text used for e.g. the headline of Subheadline this story on American Reading Habits might have a Headline Read Any Good Books Lately with a picture of a man on a park bench reading a book and the alt text would be man reading book on park bench . Additionally preferably every window could have a tag that is descriptive. Additionally every story may have a link to a formatted transcript. The player may also include a Flash Player that is preferably capable of displaying synchronous captions.

In one embodiment the system and method will include versioning.
