This invention relates to novel inhibitors of serine threonine protein kinases e.g. AKT and related kinases pharmaceutical compositions containing the inhibitors and methods for preparing these inhibitors. The inhibitors are useful for example for the treatment of hyperproliferative diseases such as cancer and inflammation in mammals.

Protein kinases PK are enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of hydroxy groups on tyrosine serine and threonine residues of proteins by transfer of the terminal gamma phosphate from ATP. Through signal transduction pathways these enzymes modulate cell growth differentiation and proliferation i.e. virtually all aspects of cell life in one way or another depend on PK activity Hardie G. and Hanks S. 1995 Academic Press San Diego Calif. . Furthermore abnormal PK activity has been related to a host of disorders ranging from relatively non life threatening diseases such as psoriasis to extremely virulent diseases such as glioblastoma brain cancer . Protein kinases are an important target class for therapeutic modulation Cohen P. 2002 Nature Rev. Drug Discovery 1 309 .

Significantly atypical protein phosphorylation and or expression is often reported to be one of the causative effects of abnormal cellular proliferation metastasis and cell survival in cancer. The abnormal regulation and or expression of various kinases including Akt VEGF ILK ROCK p70S6K Bcl PKA PKC Raf Src PDK1 ErbB2 MEK IKK Cdk EGFR BAD CHK1 CHK2 and GSK3 amongst numerous others has been specifically implicated in cancer.

Protein kinases include two classes protein tyrosine kinases PTK and serine threonine kinases STK . The Protein Kinase B Akt enzymes are a group of serine threonine kinases that are overexpressed in a variety of human tumors. One of the best characterized targets of the PI3K lipid products is the 57 KD serine threonine protein kinase Akt downstream of PI3K in the signal transduction pathway Hemmings B. A. 1997 Science 275 628 Hay N. 2005 Cancer Cell 8 179 183 . Akt is the human homologue of the protooncogene v akt of the acutely transforming retrovirus AKT8. Due to its high sequence homology to protein kinases A and C Akt is also called Protein Kinase B PKB and Related to A and C RAC . Three isoforms of Akt are known to exist namely Akt1 Akt2 and Akt3 which exhibit an overall homology of 80 Staal S. P. 1987 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 84 5034 Nakatani K. 1999 Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 257 906 Li et al 2002 Current Topics in Med. Chem. 2 939 971 WO 2005 113762 . The Akt isoforms share a common domain organization that consists of a pleckstrin homology domain at the N terminus a kinase catalytic domain and a short regulatory region at the C terminus. In addition both Akt2 and Akt3 exhibit splice variants. Upon recruitment to the cell membrane by PtdInd 3 4 5 P Akt is phosphorylated activated by PDK1 at T308 T309 and T305 for isoforms Akt1 PKB Akt2 PKB and Akt3 PKB respectively and at S473 S474 and S472 for isoforms Akt1 Akt2 and Akt3 respectively. Such phosphorylation occurs by an as yet unknown kinase putatively named PDK2 although PDK1 Balendran A. 1999 Curr. Biol. 9 393 autophosphorylation Toker A. 2000 J. Biol. Chem. 275 8271 and integrin linked kinase ILK Delcommenne M. 1998 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95 11211 have been implicated in this process. Akt activation requires its phosphorylation on residue Ser 473 in the C terminal hydrophobic motif Brodbeck et al 1999 J. Biol. Chem. 274 9133 9136 Coffer et al 1991 Eur. J. Biochem. 201 475 481 Alessi et al 1997 Curr. Biol. 7 261 269 . Although monophosphorylation of Akt activates the kinase bis phosphorylation is required for maximal kinase activity.

Akt is believed to assert its effect on cancer by suppressing apoptosis and enhancing both angiogenesis and proliferation Toker et al. 2006 Cancer Res. 66 8 3963 3966 . Akt is overexpressed in many forms of human cancer including but not limited to colon Zinda et al 2001 Clin. Cancer Res. 7 2475 ovarian Cheng et al 1992 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 9267 brain Haas Kogan et al 1998 Curr. Biol. 8 1195 lung Brognard et al 2001 Cancer Res. 61 3986 pancreatic Bellacosa et al 1995 Int. J. Cancer 64 280 285 Cheng et al 1996 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 93 3636 3641 prostate Graff et al 2000 J. Biol. Chem. 275 24500 and gastric carcinomas Staal et al 1987 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84 5034 5037 .

The development of kinase inhibitors that target abnormally regulated pathways and ultimately result in disease is of enormous ethical and commercial interest to the medical and pharmaceutical community. A compound that inhibits 1 recruitment of Akt to the cell membrane 2 activation by PDK1 or PDK2 3 substrate phosphorylation or 4 one of the downstream targets of Akt could be a valuable anticancer agent either as a stand alone therapy or in conjunction with other accepted procedures.

The inventive compounds of Formula I are useful for inhibiting AKT protein kinases. Such compounds have utility as therapeutic agents for diseases that can be treated by the inhibition of the AKT protein kinase signaling pathway and tyrosine and serine threonine kinase receptor pathways.

In particular certain compounds of Formula I wherein ORis OH were found to be at least 50 fold more selective for AKT versus protein kinase A PKA . For example at least 100 fold and as a further example at least 150 fold more selective for AKT versus PKA. Selectivity over PKA is desirable since PKA is involved in many cellular processes important for the normal function and physiology of many cell types. Additionally inhibition of PKA is not believed to contribute to the anti proliferative and pro apoptotic effects of AKT inhibition. Thus inhibition of PKA could lead to adverse events not associated with AKT inhibition without contributing to the disease modifying benefits of AKT inhibition.

The compounds of Formula I may also be useful as inhibitors of tyrosine kinases as well as serine and threonine kinases in addition to AKT.

The compounds of this invention may possess one or more asymmetric centers such compounds can therefore be produced as individual R or S stereoisomers or as mixtures thereof. Unless indicated otherwise the description or naming of a particular compound in the specification and claims is intended to include both individual enantiomers and diastereomers and mixtures racemic or otherwise thereof. Accordingly this invention also includes all such isomers including diastereomeric mixtures pure diastereomers and pure enantiomers of the compounds of this invention. The term enantiomer refers to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non superimposable mirror images of one another. The term diastereomer refers to a pair of optical isomers which are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have different physical properties e.g. melting points boiling points spectral properties and reactivities.

The compounds of the present invention may also exist in different tautomeric forms and all such forms are embraced within the scope of the invention. The term tautomer or tautomeric form refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example proton tautomers also known as prototropic tautomers include interconversions via migration of a proton such as keto enol and imine enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons.

In the structures shown herein where the stereochemistry of any particular chiral atom is not specified then all stereoisomers are contemplated and included as the compounds of the invention. Where stereochemistry is specified by a solid wedge or dashed line representing a particular configuration then that stereoisomer is so specified and defined.

The compounds of Formula I include solvates pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs and salts including pharmaceutically acceptable salts of such compounds.

The phrase pharmaceutically acceptable indicates that the substance or composition is compatible chemically and or toxicologically with the other ingredients comprising a formulation and or the mammal being treated therewith.

A solvate refers to an association or complex of one or more solvent molecules and a compound of the invention. Examples of solvents that form solvates include but are not limited to water isopropanol ethanol methanol DMSO ethyl acetate acetic acid and ethanolamine. The term hydrate can also be used to refer to a complex wherein the solvent molecule is water.

A prodrug is a compound that may be converted under physiological conditions or by solvolysis to the specified compound or to a salt of such compound. Prodrugs include compounds wherein an amino acid residue or a polypeptide chain of two or more e.g. two three or four amino acid residues is covalently joined through an amide or ester bond to a free amino hydroxy or carboxylic acid group of a compound of the present invention. The amino acid residues include but are not limited to the 20 naturally occurring amino acids commonly designated by three letter symbols and also includes phosphoserine phosphothreonine phosphotyrosine 4 hydroxyproline hydroxylysine demosine isodemosine gamma carboxyglutamate hippuric acid octahydroindole 2 carboxylic acid statine 1 2 3 4 tetrahydroisoquinoline 3 carboxylic acid penicillamine ornithine 3 methylhistidine norvaline beta alanine gamma aminobutyric acid cirtulline homocysteine homoserine methyl alanine para benzoylphenylalanine phenylglycine propargylglycine sarcosine methionine sulfone and tert butylglycine.

Additional types of prodrugs are also encompassed. For instance a free carboxyl group of a compound of Formula I can be derivatized as an amide or alkyl ester. As another example compounds of this invention comprising free hydroxy groups may be derivatized as prodrugs by converting the hydroxy group into a group such as but not limited to a phosphate ester hemisuccinate dimethylaminoacetate or phosphoryloxymethyloxycarbonyl group as outlined in 1996 19 115. Carbamate prodrugs of hydroxy and amino groups are also included as are carbonate prodrugs sulfonate esters and sulfate esters of hydroxy groups. Derivatization of hydroxy groups as acyloxy methyl and acyloxy ethyl ethers wherein the acyl group may be an alkyl ester optionally substituted with groups including but not limited to ether amine and carboxylic acid functionalities or where the acyl group is an amino acid ester as described above are also encompassed. Prodrugs of this type are described in 1996 39 10. More specific examples include replacement of the hydrogen atom of the alcohol group with a group such as C C alkanoyloxymethyl 1 C C alkanoyloxy ethyl 1 methyl 1 C C alkanoyloxy ethyl C C alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl N C C alkoxy carbonylaminomethyl succinoyl C C alkanoyl amino C C alkanoyl arylacyl and aminoacyl or aminoacyl aminoacyl where each aminoacyl group is independently selected from the naturally occurring L amino acids P O OH P O O C C alkyl or glycosyl the radical resulting from the removal of a hydroxyl group of the hemiacetal form of a carbohydrate .

Free amines of compounds of Formula I can also be derivatized as amides sulfonamides or phosphonamides. All of these moieties may incorporate groups including but not limited to ether amine and carboxylic acid functionalities. For example a prodrug can be formed by the replacement of a hydrogen atom in the amine group with a group such as R carbonyl RO carbonyl NRR carbonyl wherein R and R are each independently C C alkyl C C cycloalkyl or benzyl or R carbonyl is a natural aminoacyl or natural aminoacyl natural aminoacyl C OH C O OY wherein Y is H C C alkyl or benzyl C OY Ywherein Yis C C alkyl and Yis C C alkyl carboxy C C alkyl amino C C alkyl or mono N or di N N C C alkylaminoalkyl or C Y Ywherein Yis H or methyl and Yis mono N or di N N C C alkylamino morpholino piperidin 1 yl or pyrrolidin 1 yl.

Alternatively or additionally compound of the invention may possess a sufficiently acidic group a sufficiently basic group or both functional groups and accordingly react with any of a number of inorganic or organic bases or acids to form a salt. Examples of salts include those salts prepared by reaction of the compounds of the present invention with a mineral or organic acid or an inorganic base such salts including but not limited to sulfates pyrosulfates bisulfates sulfites bisulfites phosphates monohydrogenphosphates dihydrogenphosphates metaphosphates pyrophosphates chlorides bromides iodides acetates propionates decanoates caprylates acrylates formates isobutyrates caproates heptanoates propiolates oxalates malonates succinates suberates sebacates fumarates maleates butyn 1 4 dioates hexyne 1 6 dioates benzoates chlorobenzoates methylbenzoates dinitrobenzoates hydroxybenzoates methoxybenzoates phthalates sulfonates xylenesulfonates phenylacetates phenylpropionates phenylbutyrates citrates lactates hydroxybutyrates glycollates tartrates methanesulfonates propanesulfonates naphthalene 1 sulfonates naphthalene 2 sulfonates and mandelates. Since a single compound of the present invention may include more than one acidic or basic moiety the compounds of the present invention may include mono di or tri salts in a single compound.

If the inventive compound is a base the desired salt may be prepared by any suitable method available in the art for example by treatment of the free base with an acidic compound for example an inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid hydrobromic acid sulfuric acid nitric acid phosphoric acid and the like or with an organic acid such as acetic acid maleic acid succinic acid mandelic acid fumaric acid malonic acid pyruvic acid oxalic acid glycolic acid salicylic acid a pyranosidyl acid such as glucuronic acid or galacturonic acid an alpha hydroxy acid such as citric acid or tartaric acid an amino acid such as aspartic acid or glutamic acid an aromatic acid such as benzoic acid or cinnamic acid a sulfonic acid such as p toluenesulfonic acid or ethanesulfonic acid or the like.

If the inventive compound is an acid the desired salt may be prepared by any suitable method for example by treatment of the free acid with an inorganic or organic base. Examples of suitable inorganic salts include those formed with alkali and alkaline earth metals such as lithium sodium potassium barium and calcium. Examples of suitable organic base salts include for example ammonium dibenzylammonium benzylammonium 2 hydroxyethylammonium bis 2 hydroxyethyl ammonium phenylethylbenzylamine dibenzylethylenediamine and the like salts. Other salts of acidic moieties may include for example those salts formed with procaine quinine and N methylglucosamine plus salts formed with basic amino acids such as glycine ornithine histidine phenylglycine lysine and arginine.

In certain embodiments the salt is a pharmaceutically acceptable salt which unless otherwise indicated includes salts that retain the biological effectiveness of the corresponding free acid or base of the specified compound and are not biologically or otherwise undesirable.

The compounds of Formula I also include other salts of such compounds which are not necessarily pharmaceutically acceptable salts and which may be useful as intermediates for preparing and or purifying compounds of Formula I and or for separating enantiomers of compounds of Formula I.

The present invention also embraces isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention which are identical to those recited herein but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. All isotopes of any particular atom or element as specified are contemplated within the scope of the compounds of the invention and their uses. Exemplary isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen carbon nitrogen oxygen phosphorus sulfur fluorine chlorine and iodine such as H H C C C N N O O O P P S F Cl I and I. Certain isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention e.g. those labeled with H and C are useful in compound and or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated i.e. H and carbon 14 i.e. C isotopes are useful for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium i.e. H may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability e.g. increased in vivo half life or reduced dosage requirements and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Positron emitting isotopes such as O N C and F are useful for positron emission tomography PET studies to examine substrate receptor occupancy. Isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Schemes and or in the Examples herein below by substituting an isotopically labeled reagent for a non isotopically labeled reagent.

Also falling within the scope of this invention are the in vivo metabolic products of compounds of Formula I described herein. A metabolite is a pharmacologically active product produced through metabolism in the body of a specified compound or salt thereof. Such products may result for example from the oxidation reduction hydrolysis amidation deamidation esterification deesterification enzymatic cleavage and the like of the administered compound. Accordingly the invention includes metabolites of compounds of Formula I including compounds produced by a process comprising contacting a compound of this invention with a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product thereof.

Metabolites are identified for example by preparing a radiolabelled e.g. C or H isotope of a compound of the invention administering it parenterally in a detectable dose e.g. greater than about 0.5 mg kg to an animal such as rat mouse guinea pig monkey or to a human allowing sufficient time for metabolism to occur typically about 30 seconds to 30 hours and isolating its conversion products from the urine blood or other biological samples. These products are easily isolated since they are labeled others are isolated by the use of antibodies capable of binding epitopes surviving in the metabolite . The metabolite structures are determined in conventional fashion e.g. by MS LC MS or NMR analysis. In general analysis of metabolites is done in the same way as conventional drug metabolism studies well known to those skilled in the art. The metabolites so long as they are not otherwise found in vivo are useful in diagnostic assays for therapeutic dosing of the compounds of the invention.

Compounds of this invention may be synthesized by synthetic routes that include processes analogous to those well known in the chemical arts particularly in light of the description contained herein. The starting materials are generally available from commercial sources such as Aldrich Chemicals Milwaukee Wis. or are readily prepared using methods well known to those skilled in the art e.g. prepared by methods generally described in Louis F. Fieser and Mary Fieser v. 1 19 Wiley N.Y. 1967 1999 ed. or 4 Aufl. ed. Springer Verlag Berlin including supplements .

Compounds of Formula I may be prepared singly or as compound libraries comprising at least 2 for example 5 to 1 000 compounds or 10 to 100 compounds. Libraries of compounds of Formula I may be prepared by a combinatorial split and mix approach or by multiple parallel syntheses using either solution phase or solid phase chemistry by procedures known to those skilled in the art. Thus according to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a compound library comprising at least 2 compounds of Formula I or salts thereof.

For illustrative purposes Schemes 1 4 and Schemes A J shows a general method for preparing the compounds of the present invention as well as key intermediates. For a more detailed description of the individual reaction steps see the Examples section below. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other synthetic routes may be used to synthesize the inventive compounds. Although specific starting materials and reagents are depicted in the Schemes and discussed below other starting materials and reagents can be easily substituted to provide a variety of derivatives and or reaction conditions. In addition many of the compounds prepared by the methods described below can be further modified in light of this disclosure using conventional chemistry well known to those skilled in the art.

Scheme 1 shows a method of preparing compound 10 of Formula I wherein Ris H Ris OH and Ris H. Formation of pyrimidine 2 can be accomplished by the reaction of the keto ester 1 with thiourea in the presence of a base such as KOH in an appropriate solvent such as ethanol. After reduction of the mercapto group of compound 2 under standard reducing conditions e.g. Raney Nand NHOH to provide compound 3 the hydroxypyrimidine 3 can be chlorinated under standard conditions e.g. POClin DIEA DCE to provide compound 4. Compound 4 is then oxidized under standard conditions e.g. MCPBA in an appropriate solvent such as CHCl to give the pyrimidine oxide 5. Treatment of the pyrimidine oxide with acetic anhydride gives the rearrangement product 6. Compound 7 is obtained by reacting compound 6 with an appropriately substituted piperidine under standard SAr reaction conditions to provide compound 7. Compound 7 is hydrolyzed to provide compound 8 which is then deprotected to yield the intermediate 9. Acylation of the piperazinyl cyclopenta d pyrimidine 9 with an appropriated amino acid in the presence of a coupling reagent such as HBTU followed by deprotection if necessary gives compound 10 of Formula I.

Scheme 2 shows a method of preparing compounds 22 25 and 27 of Formula I wherein R Rand Rare methyl. According to Scheme 2 bromination of pulegone 11 with bromine gives the dibromide 12. The treatment of the dibromide 12 with a base such as sodium ethoxide provides the pulegenate 13. Ozonolysis of the pulegenate 13 gives the ketoester 14. Treatment of the keto ester 14 with thiourea in the presence of a base such as KOH in ethanol followed by reduction of the mercapto group under standard conditions e.g. Raney Ni catalyst in ammonia affords the hydroxypyrimidine 16. Chlorination of the hydroxypyrimidine 16 under standard conditions e.g. POCl provides the 4 chloropyrimidine 17. The oxidation of the 4 chloropyrimidine 17 with an oxidizing agent such as MCPBA or hydrogen peroxide provides the N oxide 18. Rearrangement of the N oxide 18 with acetic anhydride yields the intermediate 19. Compound 19 is reacted with the desired piperazine according to the procedure described in Scheme 1 to provide compound 20 where Ris H and 23 where Ris Me. Compounds 20 and 23 are subjected to chiral separation using HPLC with chiral stationary and then hydrolyzed upon treatment with a base such as lithium hydroxide to provide compounds 21 and 24 respectively. After deprotection compounds 21 and 24 are then reacted with the appropriate amino acid to provide compounds 22 and 25 respectively.

Alternatively the 7 hydroxy group of compound 24 may be alkylated with alkylation reagent such as alkyl halide in the presence of a base such as NaH or KOH to provide compound 26 where Ris Me. After deprotection compound 26 is then reacted with the appropriate amino acid to provide compound 27.

Scheme 3 shows an alternative method of preparing compounds 73 and 74. According to Scheme 3 amination of 14 using an ammonia synthon gives 63. Pyrimidine formation using for example ammonium formate in the presence of formamide at 50 C. 250 C. and or at high pressure gives the bicyclic unit 64. Activation of 64 using for example POClor SOClgives the activated pyrimidine 65. Displacement of this leaving group using a suitable protected substituted piperidine at 0 C. to 150 C. gives the piperidine 66. Oxidation using for example m chloroperoxybenzoic acid MCPBA or m CPBA or Oxone at 20 C. to 50 C. gives the N oxide 67. Treatment with an acylating agent eg. acetic anhydride followed by heating 40 C. to 200 C. causes rearrangement to give 68. Hydrolysis using for example LiOH or NaOH at 0 C. to 50 C. gives the alcohol 69. Oxidation using for example Swern conditions MnOor pyridine SOcomplex at appropriate temperatures gives the ketone 70. Asymmetric reduction using for example a catalytic chiral catalyst in the presence of hydrogen the CBS catalyst or a borohydride reducing agent in the presence of a chiral ligand gives rise to either the R or the S stereochemistry at the alcohol 71 or 72. Alternatively a non chiral reducing agent could be used eg. H Pd C allowing the methyl group on the cyclopentane unit to provide facial selectivity and ultimately diastereoselectivity. If the reduction gives a lower diastereoselctivity the diastereomers could be separated by for example chromatography crystallization or derivitization. Finally deprotection of the Boc group using for example acid at 0 C. to 50 C. acylation using an appropriately functionalized amino acid and final functionalization of the amine of this amino acid eg. removal of any protecting group alkylation reductive amination or acylation to introduce new substituents gives rise to the final compounds 73 and 74.

Introduction of a chiral auxiliary e.g. Evans oxazolidinone etc. to compound 1 may be accomplished by standard acylation procedures to give the conjugate 2. For example treatment of the acid with an activating agent e.g. COCl or mixed anhydride formation e.g. 2 2 dimethylpropanoyl chloride in the presence of an amine base at 20 C. to 100 C. followed by treatment with the appropriate chiral auxiliary X gives compound 2. The stereochemistry and choice of the chiral auxiliary may determine the stereochemistry of the newly created chiral center and the diastereoselectivity. Treatment of compound 2 with a Lewis acid eg. TiCl at low temperature e.g. 20 C. to 100 C. and an amine base e.g. Hunig s base followed by the use of an appropriately substituted imminium ion precursor 3 at low temperature then gives rise to compound 4. The temperature Lewis acid and chiral auxiliary may all be expected to influence the diastereoselectivity of the addition adduct. Finally saponification under mild conditions e.g. LiOH HO at 10 C. to 30 C. gives rise to the desired acid 5.

According another aspect of this invention provides a method of preparing a compound of Formula I comprising 

The amino acids used in the synthesis of compounds of Formula I as illustrated in Schemes 1 4 and in the Examples are either commercially available or may be prepared according to the methods disclosed herein. For example in certain embodiments the amino acids used to prepare compounds of Formula I include phenylglycine amino acids having the Formula 1A phenylglycine amino acids having the Formula 2A phenylalanine amino acids having the Formula 3A and phenylalanine amino acids having the Formula 4A.

Scheme A illustrates a method of preparing optionally substituted phenylglycine amino acids 25 and 26 of the Formula 1A wherein Ris H and R and Rand are as defined herein t is 0 to 4 and Ris H or an amine protecting group. According to Scheme A the acid 20 is converted to an ester 21 wherein R is alkyl using standard conditions such as treatment with an appropriate alcohol e.g. MeOH in the presence of a catalytic amount of an acid such as concentrated HSOor a coupling agent such as DCC DMAP or alternatively by treatment with an appropriate electrophile e.g. MeI EtBr BnBr in the presence of a base such as NEt DMAP at an appropriate temperature e.g. 20 C. to 100 C. . The appropriate choice of ester is determined by the conditions required to reform the acid at the end of the synthesis with many appropriate examples and conditions being listed in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis by Greene and Wuts Wiley Interscience third edition Chapter 5. Introduction of the hydroxymethyl group to provide compound 22 may be performed by treatment with an appropriate aldehyde e.g. formaldehyde in the presence of base such as NaOEt at an appropriate temperature e.g. 20 C. to room temperature . Activation of the alcohol group of compound 22 to form a leaving group e.g. a mesylate tosylate halide may be accomplished by treatment with for example methanesulphonyl chloride in the presence of excess base such as NEt DIPEA or DBU at an appropriate temperature e.g. 20 C. to room temperature . In many cases the olefin 24 can be isolated directly from this procedure in other cases warming 30 C. to 100 C. or additional base e.g. DBU in the case of halide may be required to complete the elimination to provide compound 24. The activated olefin 24 may be treated with the desired primary amine e.g. ethylamine in a suitable solvent such as THF at an appropriate temperature e.g. 20 C. to reflux to generate the amino ester intermediate. In the case wherein compound 24 has an electron rich aromatic ring or electron poor bulky primary amine heating e.g. 30 240 C. in a sealed tube or microwave chemistry may be required. Protection of the amine group for example as Boc group may be accomplished using BocO under standard conditions to provide compound 23 wherein Pg is a protecting group. Alternative protecting groups may be used and many appropriate examples are listed in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis by Greene and Wuts Wiley Interscience third edition Chapter 7. Saponification of the ester 23 to form the protected amino acid 25 may be accomplished using conditions appropriate for the ester e.g. aqueous LiOH for methyl esters hydrogenation for benzyl esters acid for t butyl esters .

Alternatively the activated olefin 24 may be treated with a secondary amine e.g. diethylamine in a suitable solvent such as THF at an appropriate temperature e.g. 20 C. to reflux to generate the aminoester intermediate not shown . In the case wherein compound 24 has an electron rich aromatic ring or electron poor bulky secondary amine heating e.g. 30 240 C. in a sealed tube or microwave chemistry may be required. Saponification of the ester to form the amino acid 26 may be accomplished using conditions appropriate for the ester e.g. aqueous LiOH for methyl esters hydrogenation for benzyl esters acid for t butyl esters etc. .

Scheme A1 shows an alternative to Scheme 1 wherein the activated olefin 24 is reacted to form the amino acid 26A.

Scheme B shows a method of preparing optionally substituted phenylglycine amino acids 30 and 31 of Formula 1A wherein Ris OH and R and Rare as defined herein t is 0 to 4 and Ris as defined herein or an amine protecting group. Oxidation of the unsaturated ester 24 prepared according to Scheme A wherein t is 0 4 and R is alkyl using a standard oxidizing agent such as MCPBA at an appropriate temperature room temperature to reflux provides the epoxide intermediate 28. Intermediate 28 may be treated with an appropriate amine typically at high temperature e.g. 50 300 C. and high pressure e.g. in a sealed tube or a bomb to give the amino alcohol 29 or 30. If a secondary amine is used such as in the preparation of compound 30 then deprotection of the ester using conditions listed in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis by Greene and Wuts Wiley Interscience third edition Chapter 5 may be used e.g. LiOH for a methyl ester hydrogenation for a benzyl ester etc . When a primary amine is used such as in the preparation of compound 29 protection of the amine e.g. as a Boc group using Boc anhydride followed by deprotection of the ester using the above conditions provide the hydroxylated amino acid 31.

Scheme C shows a method of preparing optionally substituted phenylglycine amino acids 36 of the Formula 1A wherein Ris methyl Ris H Ris an amine protecting group t is 0 to 4 and Ris as defined herein. The ester 32 wherein R is alkyl can be treated with a base e.g. NaOtBu at an appropriate temperature e.g. 0 C. to reflux to form the anion followed by addition of an electrophile e.g. tert butyl 2 bromoacetate at an appropriate temperature e.g 78 C. to room temperature to give the homologated ester 33. Saponification of the t butyl ester of compound 33 using an appropriate acid such as TFA or HCl at an appropriate temperature e.g 0 C. to reflux provides compound 34. A Curtius rearrangement of compound 34 using for example DPPA in the presence of mild base such as NEtat an appropriate temperature e.g. 0 C. to reflux followed by treatment of the reactive intermediate with an alcohol e.g. t BuOH optionally in the presence of a Lewis acid e.g. SnCl at higher temperature e.g. 40 200 C. provides compound 35 wherein Pg is an amine protecting group. The choice of alcohol used to prepare compound 35 determines the amine protecting group e.g. t BuOH provides the Boc amine . Deprotection of the ester group of compound 35 using standard conditions e.g. with LiOH when the protecting group is a methyl ester hydrogenation for a benzyl ester etc. gives the acid compound 36.

Scheme D shows a method of preparing optionally substituted phenylglycine amino acids 40 of Formula 2A wherein R R and Rare as defined herein t is 0 to 4 Ris H and Ris an amine protecting group such as Boc. The starting unsaturated ester 24 prepared according to Scheme A can be treated with a substituted nitromethane derivative e.g. nitroethane in the presence of a base such as DBU at an appropriate temperature e.g. 0 C. to room temperature to give the homologated adduct 37. The nitro group of compound 37 can be reduced using standard conditions e.g. hydrogenation Zn acid etc. at an appropriate temperature e.g. room temperature to reflux and the resulting intermediate can be cyclized to give the lactam intermediate 38. Protection of the amine for example with a Boc group to provide compound 39 may be accomplished using BocO under standard conditions. Alternative protecting groups may be used and many appropriate examples are listed in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis by Greene and Wuts Wiley Interscience third edition Chapter 7. Treatment of compound 39 with an aqueous base such as LiOH or KOH at an appropriate temperature e.g. 0 to 100 C. effects ring opening of the lactam to give the appropriately substituted protected amino acid compound 40.

Scheme D1 shows representative methods of forming the single enantionmers of the gamma amino acids 40d and 40e wherein R R and Rare as defined herein t is 0 to 4 Ris H and Ris an amine protecting group such as Boc. In one possible method the racemic amino acid is subject to chiral chromatographic separation using a chiral stationary phase. Alternatively a diastereomeric mixture may be prepared which could be separated by conventional chromatographic techniques. For example activation of compound 40 e.g. COCl base and introduction of a chiral auxiliary e.g. an Evans oxazolidinone in the presence of a basic amine e.g. Hunig s base at 20 C. to 50 C. gives the diastereomeric mixture of compounds 40b and 40c. This mixture may be separated using standard conditions e.g. column chromatography HPLC SFC etc. to give the individual diastereomers. These may be converted to the desired acids by cleavage of the chiral auxiliary in the case of an Evans auxiliary by using for example LiOH HOOH at 15 C. to room temperature to give the compounds 40d and 40e. The temperature may need to be kept low so as to prevent racemisation of the newly separated chiral center.

Scheme E shows a method of making optionally substituted phenylglycine amino acids 44 of Formula 2A wherein Ris methyl Ris H Ris an amine protecting group t is 0 to 4 and Ris as defined herein. The ester 32 wherein R is alkyl and t is 0 4 can be treated with a suitable base such as KOtBu at an appropriate temperature e.g. 0 C. to reflux to form the anion followed by addition of an acrylate unit e.g. t butylacrylate at a temperature ranging from 78 C. to room temperature to give the homologated ester 41. Saponification of the t butyl ester of compound 41 by treatment with a suitable acid such as TFA or HCl at an appropriate temperature e.g 0 C. to reflux provides compound 42. A Curtius rearrangement of compound 42 using for example DPPA in the presence of mild base such as NEtat an appropriate temperature e.g. 0 C. to reflux followed by treatment of the reactive intermediate with an appropriate alcohol e.g. tBuOH optionally in the presence of a Lewis acid e.g. SnCl at elevated temperatures e.g. 40 200 C. provides compound 43. The choice of alcohol determines the amine protecting group of compound 43 e.g. tBuOH provides the Boc amine . Deprotection of the ester of compound 43 under standard conditions e.g. LiOH for a methyl ester hydrogenation for a benzyl ester etc. gives the acid 44.

Scheme F shows a method of preparing optionally substituted 3 phenylalanine amino acids 48 49 and 50 of Formula 3A wherein Ris H Ris an amine protecting group t is 0 to 4 and Ris as defined herein. An appropriately substituted aldehyde 45 can be treated with a cyanoacetate of the formula CN CHCOR wherein R is alkyl e.g. ethyl 2 cyanoacetate in the presence of a suitable base such as piperidine at an appropriate temperature e.g. room temperature to reflux to give the unsaturated ester 46. Reduction of the olefin and the nitrile groups of compound 46 to provide compound 47 may be accomplished in a number of ways. For example the olefin may be reduced with any agent known to effect 1 4 reductions such as NaBH. The nitrile may be reduced using agents such as LiAlHor NaBHin the presence of a Lewis acid such as BFOEtor TFA. A number of alternative reducing agents may be used such as those listed in Reductions in Organic Chemistry by Hudlicky ACS monograph 2edition Chapter 18. If desired the primary amine 47 can be monoalkylated or bisalkylated at this stage using standard conditions e.g. reductive amination using an appropriate aldehyde Lewis acid and reducing agent to provide intermediates not shown en route to compounds 48 and 49. To prepare primary and secondary amines protection may be accomplished using any number of protecting groups e.g. Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis by Greene and Wuts Wiley Interscience third edition Chapter 7 for example as a Boc group using Boc anhydride at 0 C. to room temperature. Cleavage of the ester group to form the amino acid 48 49 or 50 may be accomplished using an aqueous bases such as LiOH or KOH or any of the alternative reagents listed in the aforementioned Protecting Groups text e.g. hydrogenation for a benzyl ester .

Scheme G shows a method of preparing optionally substituted phenylalanine amino acids 54 of Formula 4A wherein Ris H Ris an amine protecting group t is 0 to 4 and Ris as defined herein. An appropriately substituted acid 51 may be reduced to the benzyl alcohol 52 using for example LiAlHat a temperature ranging from room temperature to reflux. The alcohol group of compound 52 can be activated as a leaving group e.g. halide mesylate etc. using for example PBr MsCl NEt etc. Displacement of this leaving group using a protected glycine derivative such as ethyl 2 diphenylmethyleneamino acetate in the presence of strong base such as LDA nBuLi provides the amino ester intermediate 53 wherein Ris alkyl and Pg is a protecting group. Appropriate protecting groups are listed in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis by Greene and Wuts Wiley Interscience . The amine protecting group may be changed at this stage for example to introduce a Boc group. Subsequent deprotection of the ester 53 e.g. using 3N HCl LiOH hydrogenation for a benzyl ester etc. at an appropriate temperature e.g. 0 C. to reflux provides the desired N protected amino acid 54.

In one alternative to Scheme G Pg may be substituted with Rin compound 54 after the deprotection of compound 53.

Scheme H shows a method of preparing optionally substituted phenylglycine amino acids 56 of Formula 2A wherein Rand Rtogether with the atoms to which they are attached form a spirocyclic heterocyclic ring Ris an amine protecting group t is 0 to 4 and Ris as defined herein. According to Scheme H the unsaturated ester 24 can be treated with a suitably protected glycine derivative e.g. benzylglycine and formaldehyde under dry conditions e.g. with addition of molecular sieves at an appropriate temperature e.g. room temperature to reflux to generate compound 55. Cleavage of the benzyl group using standard conditions e.g. via hydrogenation 1 chloroethylformate etc. followed by addition of an amine protecting group such as a Boc group and cleavage of the ester under standard conditions e.g. LiOH for a methyl ester acid for a t butyl ester etc. at 0 C. to reflux provides the N protected amino acid 56.

Scheme I shows a method of preparing optionally substituted phenylalanine amino acids 61 and 62 of Formula 3A wherein Rand Rtogether with the atoms to which they are attached form a heterocyclic ring and Rand Rare as defined herein and t is 0 to 4. The acid 57 is converted to an ester 58 using standard conditions such as treatment with an appropriate alcohol e.g. MeOH in the presence of either catalytic acid e.g. concentrated HSOor TMSCl or a coupling agent e.g. DCC DMAP or alternatively by treatment with an appropriate electrophile e.g. MeI EtBr BnBr in the presence of a suitable base such as NEt DMAP at appropriate temperatures e.g. 20 C. to 100 C. . The appropriate choice of ester is determined by the conditions required to reform the acid at the end of the synthesis such as described in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis by Greene and Wuts Wiley Interscience third edition Chapter 5. Cyclization of compound 58 to provide compound 59 may be achieved using for example N methoxymethyl phenyl N trimethylsilyl methyl methanamine in the presence of TFA. This particular set of reagents generates the benzylamine which can be cleaved to provide compound 60 under standard conditions such as such as hydrogenation at 20 C. to 50 C. or any other standard conditions such as those listed in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis by Greene and Wuts Wiley Interscience third edition Chapter 7. Protection of the free amine of compound 60 with an alternative protecting group e.g. Boc using reagents listed in the aforementioned text such as Boc anhydride followed by cleavage of the ester using standard conditions appropriate for the ester e.g. aqueous LiOH for methyl esters hydrogenation for benzyl esters acid for t butyl esters provides the acid compound 61. Alternatively the free amine can be functionalized further e.g. using alkylation reductive amination or acylation conditions followed by ester cleavage to generate the tertiary amino acid compound 62.

Either enantiomer of the b amino acids may be prepared using a procedure such as that shown in Scheme J. A 2 phenylacetate coupled with an appropriate chiral auxillary R for example an Evans auxiliary or a Sultam with the appropriate stereochemistry to generate the desired chemistry at the b position of the amino acid may be treated with an imine or iminium ion synthon e.g. prepared in situ by the presence of a Lewis acid eg. TiCl and an appropriately substituted alkoxymethanamine or N alkoxymethyl amide carbamate at 100 C. to 50 C. . The asymmetric addition may require the presence of Lewis acids eg. TiCl amine bases eg. Hunig s base and lower temperatures e.g. 100 C. to 0 C. to generate the best levels of stereochemical induction. If the de is lower than required the separate diastereomers may be separated at this stage by for example chromatography or crystallization. Cleavage of the chiral auxillary using methods known to cleave the chosen auxiliary e.g. LiOH HOat 50 C. to 50 C. for the Evans auxiliary then leads to the desired N protected b amino acid with the desired stereochemistry at the b position. Additionally if Ris also a protecting group e.g. 2 4 dimethoxybenzyl it may be removed in the presence of the Boc group e.g. hydrogenation or DDQ etc. to give the Boc amino acid which upon removal of the Boc group would provide the primary amine which may be further functionalized by alkylation acylation or reductive amination either prior to or after coupling with the pyrimidine piperazine unit .

In preparing compounds of Formula I protection of remote functionalities e.g. primary or secondary amines etc. of intermediates may be necessary. The need for such protection will vary depending on the nature of the remote functionality and the conditions of the preparation methods. Suitable amino protecting groups NH Pg include acetyl trifluoroacetyl t butoxycarbonyl BOC benzyloxycarbonyl CBz and 9 fluorenylmethyleneoxycarbonyl Fmoc . The need for such protection is readily determined by one skilled in the art. For a general description of protecting groups and their use see T. W. Greene Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis John Wiley Sons New York 1991.

In any of the synthetic methods for preparing compounds of Formula I it may be advantageous to separate reaction products from one another and or from starting materials. The desired products of each step or series of steps is separated and or purified to the desired degree of homogeneity by the techniques common in the art. Typically such separations involve multiphase extraction crystallization from a solvent or solvent mixture distillation sublimation or chromatography. Chromatography can involve any number of methods including for example reverse phase and normal phase size exclusion ion exchange high medium and low pressure liquid chromatography methods and apparatus small scale analytical simulated moving bed SMB and preparative thin or thick layer chromatography as well as techniques of small scale thin layer and flash chromatography.

Another class of separation methods involves treatment of a reaction mixture with a reagent selected to bind to or render otherwise separable a desired product unreacted starting material reaction by product or the like. Such reagents include adsorbents or absorbents such as activated carbon molecular sieves ion exchange media or the like. Alternatively the reagents can be acids in the case of a basic material bases in the case of an acidic material binding reagents such as antibodies binding proteins selective chelators such as crown ethers liquid liquid ion extraction reagents LIX or the like.

Selection of appropriate methods of separation depends on the nature of the materials involved. For example boiling point and molecular weight in distillation and sublimation presence or absence of polar functional groups in chromatography stability of materials in acidic and basic media in multiphase extraction and the like. One skilled in the art will apply techniques most likely to achieve the desired separation.

Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art such as by chromatography and or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound e.g. chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher s acid chloride separating the diastereomers and converting e.g. hydrolyzing the individual diastereoisomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Also some of the compounds of the present invention may be atropisomers e.g. substituted biaryls and are considered as part of this invention. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of a chiral HPLC column.

A single stereoisomer e.g. an enantiomer substantially free of its stereoisomer may be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixture using a method such as formation of diastereomers using optically active resolving agents Eliel E. and Wilen S. Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds John Wiley Sons Inc. New York 1994 Lochmuller C. H. . 1975 113 3 283 302 . Racemic mixtures of chiral compounds of the invention can be separated and isolated by any suitable method including 1 formation of ionic diastereomeric salts with chiral compounds and separation by fractional crystallization or other methods 2 formation of diastereomeric compounds with chiral derivatizing reagents separation of the diastereomers and conversion to the pure stereoisomers and 3 separation of the substantially pure or enriched stereoisomers directly under chiral conditions. See Drug Stereochemistry Analytical Methods and Pharmacology Irving W. Wainer Ed. Marcel Dekker Inc. New York 1993 .

Under method 1 diastereomeric salts can be formed by reaction of enantiomerically pure chiral bases such as brucine quinine ephedrine strychnine methyl phenylethylamine amphetamine and the like with asymmetric compounds bearing acidic functionality such as carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid. The diastereomeric salts may be induced to separate by fractional crystallization or ionic chromatography. For separation of the optical isomers of amino compounds addition of chiral carboxylic or sulfonic acids such as camphorsulfonic acid tartaric acid mandelic acid or lactic acid can result in formation of the diastereomeric salts.

Alternatively by method 2 the substrate to be resolved is reacted with one enantiomer of a chiral compound to form a diastereomeric pair E. and Wilen S. Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds John Wiley Sons Inc. 1994 p. 322 . Diastereomeric compounds can be formed by reacting asymmetric compounds with enantiomerically pure chiral derivatizing reagents such as menthyl derivatives followed by separation of the diastereomers and hydrolysis to yield the pure or enriched enantiomer. A method of determining optical purity involves making chiral esters such as a menthyl ester e.g. menthyl chloroformate in the presence of base or Mosher ester methoxy trifluoromethyl phenyl acetate Jacob III. . 1982 47 4165 of the racemic mixture and analyzing the H NMR spectrum for the presence of the two atropisomeric enantiomers or diastereomers. Stable diastereomers of atropisomeric compounds can be separated and isolated by normal and reverse phase chromatography following methods for separation of atropisomeric naphthyl isoquinolines WO 96 15111 . By method 3 a racemic mixture of two enantiomers can be separated by chromatography using a chiral stationary phase Chiral Liquid Chromatography 1989 W. J. Lough Ed. Chapman and Hall New York Okamoto . 1990 513 375 378 . Enriched or purified enantiomers can be distinguished by methods used to distinguish other chiral molecules with asymmetric carbon atoms such as optical rotation and circular dichroism.

Accordingly another aspect of this invention provides a method of treating diseases or medical conditions in a mammal mediated by AKT protein kinases comprising administering to said mammal one or more compounds of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof in an amount effective to treat or prevent said disorder.

The phrase effective amount means an amount of compound that when administered to a mammal in need of such treatment is sufficient to i treat or prevent a particular disease condition or disorder mediated by the activity of one or more AKT protein kinases tyrosine kinases additional serine threonine kinases and or dual specificity kinases ii attenuate ameliorate or eliminate one or more symptoms of the particular disease condition or disorder or iii prevent or delay the onset of one or more symptoms of the particular disease condition or disorder described herein. In the case of cancer an effective amount of the drug may reduce the number of cancer cells reduce the tumor size inhibit i.e. slow to some extent and preferably stop cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs inhibit i.e. slow to some extent and preferably stop tumor metastasis inhibit to some extent tumor growth and or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To the extent the drug may prevent growth and or kill existing cancer cells it may be cytostatic and or cytotoxic. For cancer therapy efficacy can be measured for example by assessing the time to disease progression TTP and or determining the response rate RR .

The amount of a compound of Formula I that will correspond to such an amount will vary depending upon factors such as the particular compound disease condition and its severity the identity e.g. weight of the mammal in need of treatment but can nevertheless be routinely determined by one skilled in the art.

 Treating is intended to mean at least the mitigation of a disease condition in a mammal such as a human that is affected at least in part by the activity of one or more AKT protein kinases tyrosine kinases additional serine threonine kinases and or dual specificity kinases. The terms treat and treatment refer to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures wherein the object is to prevent or slow down lessen an undesired physiological change or disorder. For purposes of this invention beneficial or desired clinical results include but are not limited to alleviation of symptoms diminishment of extent of disease stabilized i.e. not worsening state of disease delay or slowing of disease progression amelioration or palliation of the disease state and remission whether partial or total whether detectable or undetectable. Treatment can also mean prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment. Those in need of treatment include those already with the condition or disorder as well as those found to be predisposed to having the disease condition but have not yet been diagnosed as having it modulating and or inhibiting the disease condition. The terms treating treat or treatment embrace both preventative i.e. prophylactic and palliative treatment.

As used herein the term mammal refers to a warm blooded animal that has or is at risk of developing a disease described herein and includes but is not limited to guinea pigs dogs cats rats mice hamsters and primates including humans.

This invention also provides compounds of Formula I for use in the treatment of AKT protein kinase mediated conditions.

An additional aspect of the invention is the use of a compound of Formula I in the preparation of a medicament for therapy such as for the treatment or prevention of AKT protein kinase mediated conditions.

The compounds of the present invention can be used in combination with one or more additional drugs such as described below. The dose of the second drug can be appropriately selected based on a clinically employed dose. The proportion of the compound of the present invention and the second drug can be appropriately determined according to the administration subject the administration route the target disease the clinical condition the combination and other factors. In cases where the administration subject is a human for instance the second drug may be used in an amount of 0.01 to 100 parts by weight per part by weight of the compound of the present invention.

The second compound of the pharmaceutical combination formulation or dosing regimen preferably has complementary activities to the compound of this invention such that they do not adversely affect each other. Such drugs are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended. Accordingly another aspect of the present invention provides a composition comprising a compound of this invention in combination with a second drug such as described herein.

A compound of this invention and the additional pharmaceutically active drug s may be administered together in a unitary pharmaceutical composition or separately and when administered separately this may occur simultaneously or sequentially in any order. Such sequential administration may be close in time or remote in time. The amounts of the compound of this invention and the second drug s and the relative timings of administration will be selected in order to achieve the desired combined therapeutic effect.

The combination therapy may provide synergy and prove synergistic i.e. the effect achieved when the active ingredients used together is greater than the sum of the effects that results from using the compounds separately. A synergistic effect may be attained when the active ingredients are 1 co formulated and administered or delivered simultaneously in a combined unit dosage formulation 2 delivered by alternation or in parallel as separate formulations or 3 by some other regimen. When delivered in alternation therapy a synergistic effect may be attained when the compounds are administered or delivered sequentially e.g. by different injections in separate syringes. In general during alternation therapy an effective dosage of each active ingredient is administered sequentially i.e. serially whereas in combination therapy effective dosages of two or more active ingredients are administered together.
