title: Systems and methods for bridging a WAN accelerator with a security gateway
abstract: The solution described herein provides systems and methods for the interoperability of network processing programs that process network packets at different levels of the network stack. This solution bridges the communications of a network packet between a first network processing program operating at a first level of a network stack in an intermediary and a second network processing program operating at a second level of the network stack of the intermediary. The first network processing program may modify an incoming network packet so that the packet may traverse the network stack to an upper level of the stack to the second network processing program. After processing the network packet at the upper layers of the stack or by the second network processing program, the first network processing program modifies the network pack in order to transmit the packet to the intended destination while traversing the intermediary.

This present application claims priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 851 934 entitled Systems And Methods For Bridging A WAN Accelerator With A Security Gateway filed Sep. 7 2007 which is incorporated herein by reference.

The present application generally relates to data communication networks. In particular the present application relates to systems and methods for processing network packets between a network accelerator program and a security gateway program.

In some network environments an intermediary device may be deployed between a client and a server such as inline to network traffic communicated between the client and the server. The intermediary device may perform functionality on network packets traversing the device as they are transmitted between the client and the server. The intermediary device may include one or more applications programs or drivers to process network packets and to provide some form of value or improvement to the network communications such as traffic management firewall functionality or acceleration.

These network packet processing devices may operate at different levels of the network stack depending on the provided functionality. One type of such a device may intercept network communications at one layer of the network stack such as the data link layer in a TCP IP network stack. For example a WAN acceleration device may transparently intercept process and forward network communications between a client and a server at layer 2 of the network stack. Another type of device may intercept network communications at another layer of the network stack such as the network layer or IP layer in a TCP IP network stack. For example a security gateway device may intercept network packets at layer 3 of the network stack and apply one or more policies to the network packet. The functionality of these devices operating at different layers of the network may not be interoperable.

The solution described herein provides systems and methods for the interoperability of network processing programs processing programs that process network packets at different levels of the network stack. This solution bridges the communications of a network packet between a first network processing program operating at a first level of a network stack in an intermediary and a second network processing program operating at a second level of the network stack of the intermediary. The first network processing program may modify an incoming network packet so that the packet may traverse the network stack to an upper level of the stack to the second network processing program. After processing the network packet at the upper layers of the stack or by the second network processing program the first network processing program modifies the network pack in order to transmit the packet to the intended destination while traversing the intermediary.

By way of example a first network processing program may include a WAN acceleration program that typically provides a transparent Layer 2 bridge or otherwise intercepts process and forwards network packets at the data link layer without passing the network packets up the network stack. A second network processing program may include an edge security gateway program such as ISA server from the Microsoft Corporation. The ISA server may typically receive and process network packets at the network or IP layer Layer 3 of the network stack to apply policies to the network packet. The first network processing program operating at Layer 2 and the second network processing program operating at Layer 3 may not be interoperable as the network packet processed by the first network processing program may not traverse the network stack to be received and processed by the second network processing program.

Using the systems and methods described herein the example of the WAN acceleration program and the ISA server may operate in parallel or in conjunction with each other in the same intermediary device while operating at different levels of the network stack. The techniques described herein allow the first network processing program such as the WAN accelerator to modify an incoming packet traversing the intermediary to be processed by upper layers of the network such as by the second network processing program and to modify an outgoing packet from the intermediary to be transmitted to the intended destination. In this manner the intermediary although now processing packets at multiple levels of the network stacks remains transparent to the source and destination while acting as an inline intermediary.

In one aspect the present invention is related to a method of an intermediary for interfacing a network optimization engine accelerating network communications at a first network layer of a network stack with a security gateway applying policies at a second network layer above the first network layer. The intermediary may include a client agent or an appliance deployed between a source and a destination. The method includes the step of receiving by a network optimization engine operating at a first network layer of a network stack of an intermediary a network packet from a source. For example the network optimization engine may operate at layer 2 or the data link layer of a TCP IP stack. The network packet had a media access control address identifying a destination for the network packet. The network optimization engine determines that a source media access control address of the network packet identifies a network interface card and stores the source and destination media access control addresses of the network packet to a storage. In response to the determination the network optimization engine modifies the destination media access control address of the network packet to identify an available or visible network interface of the intermediary and communicates the network packet via the local network stack.

The method further includes receiving by a security gateway operating at a second network layer of the intermediary the network packet communicated by the network optimization engine. The second network layer includes a layer of the network stack above the first network layer. For example the security gateway may operate at layer 3 or the network IP layer of a TCP IP stack. The security gateway applies one or more policies to the network packet and communicates the packet via the local network stack. The network optimization engine receives the network packet communicated by the security gateway and modifies the destination media access control address of the network packet to identify the media access control address of the destination. As such the network packet has the destination media access control addresses as originally received by the intermediary. The network optimization engine transmits the network packet to the destination via a second network interface card.

In some embodiments the method further includes storing the media access control address of the destination and or the source from the received network packet to a storage element. When receiving the network packet communicated from the security gateway the network optimization engine may also modify a source media access control address of this network packet to include the media access control address of the source from the originally received network packet as stored to the storage element. Additionally the network optimization engine may retrieve the media access control address of the destination from the originally received network packet from the storage element.

In other embodiments the method includes the step of determining by the network optimization engine that the first network interface card communicates network packets on a Local Area Network and in response to the determination does not apply a WAN network optimization. In another embodiment the network optimization engine determines that the second network interface card communicates network packets on a Wide Area Network and in response to the determination applies a WAN network optimization to transmission of the network packet.

In another aspect the present invention is related to an intermediary such as an appliance or a client for accelerating and applying security policies between a source and a destination. The intermediary provides an interface between a network optimization engine that accelerates network communications at a first network layer of a network stack with a security gateway applying policies at a second network layer above the first network layer The intermediary includes a first network interface card a network optimization engine and a security gateway The first network interface card receives a network packet from a source. The network packet has a media access control address of the destination. The network optimization engine operates at a first network layer of a network stack to obtain the network packet received by the first network interface card. The network optimization engine determines that a source media control access address of the network packet identifies a network interface card and in response to the determination modifies a destination media access control address of the network packet to identify a network interface of the intermediary such as any visible interface or interface visible via the local network stack. The network optimization engine communicates the network packet via the network stack. The security gateway operates at a second network layer of the network stack above the first network layer and receives the network packet communicated via the network stack. The security gateway applies one or more policies to the network packet and communicates the network packet via the network stack. The network optimization engine receives the network packet communicated by the security gateway modifies the destination media access control address of the network packet to identify the media access control address of the destination and transmits the network packet to the destination via a second network interface card.

In some embodiments the network optimization engine of the intermediary stores the media access control address of the destination received by the first network interface card to a storage element. The network optimization engine may also store the media access control address of the source received by the first network interface card to a storage element. In some cases the network optimization engine modifies the network packet communicated from the security gateway to include the media access control address of the source. The network optimization engine may retrieve the media access control address of the destination and or source from the storage element.

In another embodiment the network optimization engine determines that the first network interface card communicates network packets on a Local Area Network and in response to the determination does not apply a WAN network optimization. In other embodiments the network optimization engine determines that the second network interface card communicates network packets on a Wide Area Network and in response to the determination applies a WAN network optimization to transmission of the network packet. The intermediary may be a client agent or an appliance deployed between the source and the destination. The network optimization engine may operated at layer 2 or a data link layer of a TCP IP network stack and the security gateway may operates above layer 2 of a TCP IP network stack such as the network or IP layer.

The cache manager may include software hardware or any combination of software and hardware to store data information and objects to a cache in memory or storage provide cache access and control and manage the cache. The data objects or content processed and stored by the cache manager may include data in any format such as a markup language or any type of data communicated via any protocol. In some embodiments the cache manager duplicates original data stored elsewhere or data previously computed generated or transmitted in which the original data may require longer access time to fetch compute or otherwise obtain relative to reading a cache memory or storage element. Once the data is stored in the cache future use can be made by accessing the cached copy rather than refetching or recomputing the original data thereby reducing the access time.

In one embodiment the compression engine applies context insensitive compression which is compression applied to data without knowledge of the type of data. In another embodiment the compression engine applies context sensitive compression. In this embodiment the compression engine utilizes knowledge of the data type to select a specific compression algorithm from a suite of suitable algorithms. In some embodiments knowledge of the specific protocol is used to perform context sensitive compression. In one embodiment the appliance or compression engine can use port numbers e.g. well known ports as well as data from the connection itself to determine the appropriate compression algorithm to use. Some protocols use only a single type of data requiring only a single compression algorithm that can be selected when the connection is established. Other protocols contain different types of data at different times. For example POP IMAP SMTP and HTTP all move files of arbitrary types interspersed with other protocol data.

The compression engine may first use the cache based data to determine one or more data matches for compression and then may check the memory based data to determine one or more data matches for compression. In another case the compression engine may check disk storage for data matches for compression after checking either the cache based and or memory based data history.

In one embodiment multi protocol compression engine compresses bi directionally between clients and servers any TCP IP based protocol including Messaging Application Programming Interface MAPI email File Transfer Protocol FTP HyperText Transfer Protocol HTTP Common Internet File System CIFS protocol file transfer Independent Computing Architecture ICA protocol Remote Desktop Protocol RDP Wireless Application Protocol WAP Mobile IP protocol and Voice Over IP VoIP protocol. In other embodiments multi protocol compression engine provides compression of HyperText Markup Language HTML based protocols and in some embodiments provides compression of any markup languages such as the Extensible Markup Language XML .

In some embodiments the multi protocol compression engine by integrating with packet processing engine accessing the network stack is able to compress any of the protocols carried by a transport layer protocol such as any application layer protocol.

The LAN WAN detector includes any logic business rules function or operations for automatically detecting a slow side connection e.g. a wide area network WAN connection such as an Intranet and associated port and a fast side connection e.g. a local area network LAN connection and an associated port . In some embodiments the LAN WAN detector monitors network traffic on the network ports of the appliance to detect a synchronization packet sometimes referred to as a tagged network packet. The synchronization packet identifies a type or speed of the network traffic. In one embodiment the synchronization packet identifies a WAN speed or WAN type connection. The LAN WAN detector also identifies receipt of an acknowledgement packet to a tagged synchronization packet and on which port it is received. The appliance then configures itself to operate the identified port on which the tagged synchronization packet arrived so that the speed on that port is set to be the speed associated with the network connected to that port. The other port is then set to the speed associated with the network connected to that port.

For ease of discussion herein reference to fast side will be made with respect to connection with a wide area network WAN e.g. the Internet and operating at a network speed of the WAN. Likewise reference to slow side will be made with respect to connection with a local area network LAN and operating at a network speed the LAN. However it is noted that fast and slow sides in a network can change on a per connection basis and are relative terms to the speed of the network connections or to the type of network topology. Such configurations are useful in complex network topologies where a network is fast or slow only when compared to adjacent networks and not in any absolute sense.

In one embodiment the LAN WAN detector may be used to allow for auto discovery by an appliance of a network to which it connects. In another embodiment the LAN WAN detector may be used to detect the existence or presence of a second appliance deployed in the network . For example an auto discovery mechanism in operation in accordance with functions as follows appliance and are placed in line with the connection linking client and server . The appliances and are at the ends of a low speed link e.g. Internet connecting two LANs. In one example embodiment appliances and each include two ports one to connect with the lower speed link and the other to connect with a higher speed link e.g. a LAN. Any packet arriving at one port is copied to the other port. Thus appliance and are each configured to function as a bridge between the two networks .

When an end node such as the client opens a new TCP connection with another end node such as the server the client sends a TCP packet with a synchronization SYN header bit set or a SYN packet to the server . In the present example client opens a transport layer connection to server . When the SYN packet passes through appliance the appliance inserts attaches or otherwise provides a characteristic TCP header option to the packet which announces its presence. If the packet passes through a second appliance in this example appliance the second appliance notes the header option on the SYN packet. The server responds to the SYN packet with a synchronization acknowledgment SYN ACK packet. When the SYN ACK packet passes through appliance a TCP header option is tagged e.g. attached inserted or added to the SYN ACK packet to announce appliance presence to appliance . When appliance receives this packet both appliances are now aware of each other and the connection can be appropriately accelerated.

Further to the operations of the LAN WAN detector a method or process for detecting fast and slow sides of a network using a SYN packet is described. During a transport layer connection establishment between a client and a server the appliance via the LAN WAN detector determines whether the SYN packet is tagged with an acknowledgement ACK . If it is tagged the appliance identifies or configures the port receiving the tagged SYN packet SYN ACK as the slow side. In one embodiment the appliance optionally removes the ACK tag from the packet before copying the packet to the other port. If the LAN WAN detector determines that the packet is not tagged the appliance identifies or configure the port receiving the untagged packet as the fast side. The appliance then tags the SYN packet with an ACK and copies the packet to the other port.

In another embodiment the LAN WAN detector detects fast and slow sides of a network using a SYN ACK packet. The appliance via the LAN WAN detector determines whether the SYN ACK packet is tagged with an acknowledgement ACK . If it is tagged the appliance identifies or configures the port receiving the tagged SYN packet SYN ACK as the slow side. In one embodiment the appliance optionally removes the ACK tag from the packet before copying the packet to the other port. If the LAN WAN detector determines that the packet is not tagged the appliance identifies or configures the port receiving the untagged packet as the fast side. The LAN WAN detector determines whether the SYN packet was tagged. If the SYN packet was not tagged the appliance copied the packet to the other port. If the SYN packet was tagged the appliance tags the SYN ACK packet before copying it to the other port.

The appliance may add insert modify attach or otherwise provide any information or data in the TCP option header to provide any information data or characteristics about the network connection network traffic flow or the configuration or operation of the appliance . In this manner not only does an appliance announce its presence to another appliance or tag a higher or lower speed connection the appliance provides additional information and data via the TCP option headers about the appliance or the connection. The TCP option header information may be useful to or used by an appliance in controlling managing optimizing acceleration or improving the network traffic flow traversing the appliance or to otherwise configure itself or operation of a network port.

Although generally described in conjunction with detecting speeds of network connections or the presence of appliances the LAN WAN detector can be used for applying any type of function logic or operation of the appliance to a port connection or flow of network traffic. In particular automated assignment of ports can occur whenever a device performs different functions on different ports where the assignment of a port to a task can be made during the unit s operation and or the nature of the network segment on each port is discoverable by the appliance .

The flow controller includes any logic business rules function or operations for optimizing accelerating or otherwise improving the performance operation or quality of service of transport layer communications of network packets or the delivery of packets at the transport layer. A flow controller also sometimes referred to as a flow control module regulates manages and controls data transfer rates. In some embodiments the flow controller is deployed at or connected at a bandwidth bottleneck in the network . In one embodiment the flow controller effectively regulates manages and controls bandwidth usage or utilization. In other embodiments the flow control modules may also be deployed at points on the network of latency transitions low latency to high latency and on links with media losses such as wireless or satellite links .

In some embodiments a flow controller may include a receiver side flow control module for controlling the rate of receipt of network transmissions and a sender side flow control module for the controlling the rate of transmissions of network packets. In other embodiments a first flow controller includes a receiver side flow control module and a second flow controller includes a sender side flow control module. In some embodiments a first flow controller is deployed on a first appliance and a second flow controller is deployed on a second appliance . As such in some embodiments a first appliance controls the flow of data on the receiver side and a second appliance controls the data flow from the sender side. In yet another embodiment a single appliance includes flow control for both the receiver side and sender side of network communications traversing the appliance .

In one embodiment a flow control module is configured to allow bandwidth at the bottleneck to be more fully utilized and in some embodiments not overutilized. In some embodiments the flow control module transparently buffers or rebuffers data already buffered by for example the sender network sessions that pass between nodes having associated flow control modules . When a session passes through two or more flow control modules one or more of the flow control modules controls a rate of the session s .

In one embodiment the flow control module is configured with predetermined data relating to bottleneck bandwidth. In another embodiment the flow control module may be configured to detect the bottleneck bandwidth or data associated therewith. Unlike conventional network protocols such as TCP a receiver side flow control module controls the data transmission rate. The receiver side flow control module controls the sender side flow control module e.g. data transmission rate by forwarding transmission rate limits to the sender side flow control module . In one embodiment the receiver side flow control module piggybacks these transmission rate limits on acknowledgement ACK packets or signals sent to the sender e.g. client by the receiver e.g. server . The receiver side flow control module does this in response to rate control requests that are sent by the sender side flow control module . The requests from the sender side flow control module may be piggybacked on data packets sent by the sender .

In some embodiments the flow controller manipulates adjusts simulates changes improves or otherwise adapts the behavior of the transport layer protocol to provide improved performance or operations of delivery data rates and or bandwidth utilization of the transport layer.

Although a sender may be generally described herein as a client and a receiver as a server a sender may be any end point such as a server or any computing device on the network . Likewise a receiver may be a client or any other computing device on the network .

In brief overview of a pre acknowledgement flow control technique the flow controller in some embodiments handles the acknowledgements and retransmits for a sender effectively terminating the sender s connection with the downstream portion of a network connection. In reference to one possible deployment of an appliance into a network architecture to implement this feature is depicted. In this example environment a sending computer or client transmits data on network for example via a switch which determines that the data is destined for VPN appliance . Because of the chosen network topology all data destined for VPN appliance traverses appliance so the appliance can apply any necessary algorithms to this data.

Continuing further with the example the client transmits a packet which is received by the appliance . When the appliance receives the packet which is transmitted from the client to a recipient via the VPN appliance the appliance retains a copy of the packet and forwards the packet downstream to the VPN appliance . The appliance then generates an acknowledgement packet ACK and sends the ACK packet back to the client or sending endpoint. This ACK a pre acknowledgment causes the sender to believe that the packet has been delivered successfully freeing the sender s resources for subsequent processing. The appliance retains the copy of the packet data in the event that a retransmission of the packet is required so that the sender does not have to handle retransmissions of the data. This early generation of acknowledgements may be called preacking. 

If a retransmission of the packet is required the appliance retransmits the packet to the sender. The appliance may determine whether retransmission is required as a sender would in a traditional system for example determining that a packet is lost if an acknowledgement has not been received for the packet after a predetermined amount of time. To this end the appliance monitors acknowledgements generated by the receiving endpoint e.g. server or any other downstream network entity so that it can determine whether the packet has been successfully delivered or needs to be retransmitted. If the appliance determines that the packet has been successfully delivered the appliance is free to discard the saved packet data. The appliance may also inhibit forwarding acknowledgements for packets that have already been received by the sending endpoint.

In the embodiment described above the appliance via the flow controller controls the sender through the delivery of pre acknowledgements also referred to as preacks as though the appliance was a receiving endpoint itself. Since the appliance is not an endpoint and does not actually consume the data the appliance includes a mechanism for providing overflow control to the sending endpoint. Without overflow control the appliance could run out of memory because the appliance stores packets that have been preacked to the sending endpoint but not yet acknowledged as received by the receiving endpoint. Therefore in a situation in which the sender transmits packets to the appliance faster than the appliance can forward the packets downstream the memory available in the appliance to store unacknowledged packet data can quickly fill. A mechanism for overflow control allows the appliance to control transmission of the packets from the sender to avoid this problem.

In one embodiment the appliance or flow controller includes an inherent self clocking overflow control mechanism. This self clocking is due to the order in which the appliance may be designed to transmit packets downstream and send ACKs to the sender or . In some embodiments the appliance does not preack the packet until after it transmits the packet downstream. In this way the sender will receive the ACKs at the rate at which the appliance is able to transmit packets rather than the rate at which the appliance receives packets from the sender . This helps to regulate the transmission of packets from a sender .

Another overflow control mechanism that the appliance may implement is to use the TCP window size parameter which tells a sender how much buffer the receiver is permitting the sender to fill up. A nonzero window size e.g. a size of at least one Maximum Segment Size MSS in a preack permits the sending endpoint to continue to deliver data to the appliance whereas a zero window size inhibits further data transmission. Accordingly the appliance may regulate the flow of packets from the sender for example when the appliance s buffer is becoming full by appropriately setting the TCP window size in each preack.

Another technique to reduce this additional overhead is to apply hysteresis. When the appliance delivers data to the slower side the overflow control mechanism in the appliance can require that a minimum amount of space be available before sending a nonzero window advertisement to the sender. In one embodiment the appliance waits until there is a minimum of a predetermined number of packets such as four packets of space available before sending a nonzero window packet such as a window size of four packet . This reduces the overhead by approximately a factor four since only two ACK packets are sent for each group of four data packets instead of eight ACK packets for four data packets.

Another technique the appliance or flow controller may use for overflow control is the TCP delayed ACK mechanism which skips ACKs to reduce network traffic. The TCP delayed ACKs automatically delay the sending of an ACK either until two packets are received or until a fixed timeout has occurred. This mechanism alone can result in cutting the overhead in half moreover by increasing the numbers of packets above two additional overhead reduction is realized. But merely delaying the ACK itself may be insufficient to control overflow and the appliance may also use the advertised window mechanism on the ACKs to control the sender. When doing this the appliance in one embodiment avoids triggering the timeout mechanism of the sender by delaying the ACK too long.

In one embodiment the flow controller does not preack the last packet of a group of packets. By not preacking the last packet or at least one of the packets in the group the appliance avoids a false acknowledgement for a group of packets. For example if the appliance were to send a preack for a last packet and the packet were subsequently lost the sender would have been tricked into thinking that the packet is delivered when it was not. Thinking that the packet had been delivered the sender could discard that data. If the appliance also lost the packet there would be no way to retransmit the packet to the recipient. By not preacking the last packet of a group of packets the sender will not discard the packet until it has been delivered.

In another embodiment the flow controller may use a window virtualization technique to control the rate of flow or bandwidth utilization of a network connection. Though it may not immediately be apparent from examining conventional literature such as RFC 1323 there is effectively a send window for transport layer protocols such as TCP. The send window is similar to the receive window in that it consumes buffer space though on the sender . The sender s send window consists of all data sent by the application that has not been acknowledged by the receiver. This data must be retained in memory in case retransmission is required. Since memory is a shared resource some TCP stack implementations limit the size of this data. When the send window is full an attempt by an application program to send more data results in blocking the application program until space is available. Subsequent reception of acknowledgements will free send window memory and unblock the application program. In some embodiments this window size is known as the socket buffer size in some TCP implementations.

In one embodiment the flow control module is configured to provide access to increased window or buffer sizes. This configuration may also be referenced to as window virtualization. In the embodiment of TCP as the transport layer protocol the TCP header includes a bit string corresponding to a window scale. In one embodiment window may be referenced in a context of send receive or both.

One embodiment of window virtualization is to insert a preacking appliance into a TCP session. In reference to any of the environments of or B initiation of a data communication session between a source node e.g. client for ease of discussion now referenced as source node and a destination node e.g. server for ease of discussion now referenced as destination node is established. For TCP communications the source node initially transmits a synchronization signal SYN through its local area network to first flow control module . The first flow control module inserts a configuration identifier into the TCP header options area. The configuration identifier identifies this point in the data path as a flow control module.

The appliances via a flow control module provide window or buffer to allow increasing data buffering capabilities within a session despite having end nodes with small buffer sizes e.g. typically 16 k bytes. However RFC 1323 requires window scaling for any buffer sizes greater than 64 k bytes which must be set at the time of session initialization SYN SYN ACK signals . Moreover the window scaling corresponds to the lowest common denominator in the data path often an end node with small buffer size. This window scale often is a scale of 0 or 1 which corresponds to a buffer size of up to 64 k or 128 k bytes. Note that because the window size is defined as the window field in each packet shifted over by the window scale the window scale establishes an upper limit for the buffer but does not guarantee the buffer is actually that large. Each packet indicates the current available buffer space at the receiver in the window field.

In one embodiment of scaling using the window virtualization technique during connection establishment i.e. initialization of a session when the first flow control module receives from the source node the SYN signal or packet the flow control module stores the windows scale of the source node which is the previous node or stores a 0 for window scale if the scale of the previous node is missing. The first flow control module also modifies the scale e.g. increases the scale to 4 from 0 or 1 in the SYN FCM signal. When the second flow control module receives the SYN signal it stores the increased scale from the first flow control signal and resets the scale in the SYN signal back to the source node scale value for transmission to the destination node . When the second flow controller receives the SYN ACK signal from the destination node it stores the scale from the destination node scale e.g. 0 or 1 and modifies it to an increased scale that is sent with the SYN ACK FCM signal. The first flow control node receives and notes the received window scale and revises the windows scale sent back to the source node back down to the original scale e.g. 0 or 1. Based on the above window shift conversation during connection establishment the window field in every subsequent packet e.g. TCP packet of the session must be shifted according to the window shift conversion.

The window scale as described above expresses buffer sizes of over 64 k and may not be required for window virtualization. Thus shifts for window scale may be used to express increased buffer capacity in each flow control module . This increase in buffer capacity in may be referenced as window or buffer virtualization. The increase in buffer size allows greater packet through put from and to the respective end nodes and . Note that buffer sizes in TCP are typically expressed in terms of bytes but for ease of discussion packets may be used in the description herein as it relates to virtualization.

By way of example a window or buffer virtualization performed by the flow controller is described. In this example the source node and the destination node are configured similar to conventional end nodes having a limited buffer capacity of 16 k bytes which equals approximately 10 packets of data. Typically an end node must wait until the packet is transmitted and confirmation is received before a next group of packets can be transmitted. In one embodiment using increased buffer capacity in the flow control modules when the source node transmits its data packets the first flow control module receives the packets stores it in its larger capacity buffer e.g. packet capacity and immediately sends back an acknowledgement signal indicating receipt of the packets REC ACK back to the source node . The source node can then flush its current buffer load it with 10 new data packets and transmit those onto the first flow control module . Again the first flow control module transmits a REC ACK signal back to the source node and the source node flushes its buffer and loads it with 10 more new packets for transmission.

As the first flow control module receives the data packets from the source nodes it loads up its buffer accordingly. When it is ready the first flow control module can begin transmitting the data packets to the second flow control module which also has an increased buffer size for example to receive 512 packets. The second flow control module receives the data packets and begins to transmit 10 packets at a time to the destination node . Each REC ACK received at the second flow control node from the destination node results in 10 more packets being transmitted to the destination node until all the data packets are transferred. Hence the present invention is able to increase data transmission throughput between the source node sender and the destination node receiver by taking advantage of the larger buffer in the flow control modules between the devices.

It is noted that by preacking the transmission of data as described previously a sender or source node is allowed to transmit more data than is possible without the preacks thus affecting a larger window size. For example in one embodiment this technique is effective when the flow control module is located near a node e.g. source node or destination node that lacks large windows.

Another technique or algorithm of the flow controller is referred to as recongestion. The standard TCP congestion avoidance algorithms are known to perform poorly in the face of certain network conditions including large RTTs round trip times high packet loss rates and others. When the appliance detects a congestion condition such as long round trip times or high packet loss the appliance intervenes substituting an alternate congestion avoidance algorithm that better suits the particular network condition. In one embodiment the recongestion algorithm uses preacks to effectively terminate the connection between the sender and the receiver. The appliance then resends the packets from itself to the receiver using a different congestion avoidance algorithm. Recongestion algorithms may be dependent on the characteristics of the TCP connection. The appliance monitors each TCP connection characterizing it with respect to the different dimensions selecting a recongestion algorithm that is appropriate for the current characterization.

In one embodiment upon detecting a TCP connection that is limited by round trip times RTT a recongestion algorithm is applied which behaves as multiple TCP connections. Each TCP connection operates within its own performance limit but the aggregate bandwidth achieves a higher performance level. One parameter in this mechanism is the number of parallel connections that are applied N . Too large a value of N and the connection bundle achieves more than its fair share of bandwidth. Too small a value of N and the connection bundle achieves less than its fair share of bandwidth. One method of establishing N relies on the appliance monitoring the packet loss rate RTT and packet size of the actual connection. These numbers are plugged into a TCP response curve formula to provide an upper limit on the performance of a single TCP connection in the present configuration. If each connection within the connection bundle is achieving substantially the same performance as that computed to be the upper limit then additional parallel connections are applied. If the current bundle is achieving less performance than the upper limit the number of parallel connections is reduced. In this manner the overall fairness of the system is maintained since individual connection bundles contain no more parallelism than is required to eliminate the restrictions imposed by the protocol itself. Furthermore each individual connection retains TCP compliance.

Another method of establishing N is to utilize a parallel flow control algorithm such as the TCP Vegas algorithm or its improved version Stabilized Vegas. In this method the network information associated with the connections in the connection bundle e.g. RTT loss rate average packet size etc. is aggregated and applied to the alternate flow control algorithm. The results of this algorithm are in turn distributed among the connections of the bundle controlling their number i.e. N . Optionally each connection within the bundle continues using the standard TCP congestion avoidance algorithm.

In another embodiment the individual connections within a parallel bundle are virtualized i.e. actual individual TCP connections are not established. Instead the congestion avoidance algorithm is modified to behave as though there were N parallel connections. This method has the advantage of appearing to transiting network nodes as a single connection. Thus the QOS security and other monitoring methods of these nodes are unaffected by the recongestion algorithm. In yet another embodiment the individual connections within a parallel bundle are real i.e. a separate. TCP connection is established for each of the parallel connections within a bundle. The congestion avoidance algorithm for each TCP connection need not be modified.

In some embodiments the flow controller may apply a local retransmission technique. One reason for implementing preacks is to prepare to transit a high loss link e.g. wireless . In these embodiments the preacking appliance or flow control module is located most beneficially before the wireless link. This allows retransmissions to be performed closer to the high loss link removing the retransmission burden from the remainder of the network. The appliance may provide local retransmission in which case packets dropped due to failures of the link are retransmitted directly by the appliance . This is advantageous because it eliminates the retransmission burden upon an end node such as server and infrastructure of any of the networks . With appliance providing local retransmissions the dropped packet can be retransmitted across the high loss link without necessitating a retransmit by an end node and a corresponding decrease in the rate of data transmission from the end node.

Another reason for implementing preacks is to avoid a receive time out RTO penalty. In standard TCP there are many situations that result in an RTO even though a large percentage of the packets in flight were successfully received. With standard TCP algorithms dropping more than one packet within an RTT window would likely result in a timeout. Additionally most TCP connections experience a timeout if a retransmitted packet is dropped. In a network with a high bandwidth delay product even a relatively small packet loss rate will cause frequent Retransmission timeouts RTOs . In one embodiment the appliance uses a retransmit and timeout algorithm is avoid premature RTOs. The appliance or flow controller maintains a count of retransmissions is maintained on a per packet basis. Each time that a packet is retransmitted the count is incremented by one and the appliance continues to transmit packets. In some embodiments only if a packet has been retransmitted a predetermined number of times is an RTO declared.

In some embodiments the appliance or flow controller uses wavefront detection and disambiguation techniques in managing and controlling flow of network traffic. In this technique the flow controller uses transmit identifiers or numbers to determine whether particular data packets need to be retransmitted. By way of example a sender transmits data packets over a network where each instance of a transmitted data packet is associated with a transmit number. It can be appreciated that the transmit number for a packet is not the same as the packet s sequence number since a sequence number references the data in the packet while the transmit number references an instance of a transmission of that data. The transmit number can be any information usable for this purpose including a timestamp associated with a packet or simply an increasing number similar to a sequence number or a packet number . Because a data segment may be retransmitted different transmit numbers may be associated with a particular sequence number.

As the sender transmits data packets the sender maintains a data structure of acknowledged instances of data packet transmissions. Each instance of a data packet transmission is referenced by its sequence number and transmit number. By maintaining a transmit number for each packet the sender retains the ordering of the transmission of data packets. When the sender receives an ACK or a SACK the sender determines the highest transmit number associated with packets that the receiver indicated has arrived in the received acknowledgement . Any outstanding unacknowledged packets with lower transmit numbers are presumed lost.

In some embodiments the sender is presented with an ambiguous situation when the arriving packet has been retransmitted a standard ACK SACK does not contain enough information to allow the sender to determine which transmission of the arriving packet has triggered the acknowledgement. After receiving an ambiguous acknowledgement therefore the sender disambiguates the acknowledgement to associate it with a transmit number. In various embodiments one or a combination of several techniques may be used to resolve this ambiguity.

In one embodiment the sender includes an identifier with a transmitted data packet and the receiver returns that identifier or a function thereof with the acknowledgement. The identifier may be a timestamp e.g. a TCP timestamp as described in RFC 1323 a sequential number or any other information that can be used to resolve between two or more instances of a packet s transmission. In an embodiment in which the TCP timestamp option is used to disambiguate the acknowledgement each packet is tagged with up to 32 bits of unique information. Upon receipt of the data packet the receiver echoes this unique information back to the sender with the acknowledgement. The sender ensures that the originally sent packet and its retransmitted version or versions contain different values for the timestamp option allowing it to unambiguously eliminate the ACK ambiguity. The sender may maintain this unique information for example in the data structure in which it stores the status of sent data packets. This technique is advantageous because it complies with industry standards and is thus likely to encounter little or no interoperability issues. However this technique may require ten bytes of TCP header space in some implementations reducing the effective throughput rate on the network and reducing space available for other TCP options.

In another embodiment another field in the packet such as the IP ID field is used to disambiguate in a way similar to the TCP timestamp option described above. The sender arranges for the ID field values of the original and the retransmitted version or versions of the packet to have different ID fields in the IP header. Upon reception of the data packet at the receiver or a proxy device thereof the receiver sets the ID field of the ACK packet to a function of the ID field of the packet that triggers the ACK. This method is advantageous as it requires no additional data to be sent preserving the efficiency of the network and TCP header space. The function chosen should provide a high degree of likelihood of providing disambiguation. In a preferred embodiment the sender selects IP ID values with the most significant bit set to 0. When the receiver responds the IP ID value is set to the same IP ID value with the most significant bit set to a one.

In another embodiment the transmit numbers associated with non ambiguous acknowledgements are used to disambiguate an ambiguous acknowledgement. This technique is based on the principle that acknowledgements for two packets will tend to be received closer in time as the packets are transmitted closer in time. Packets that are not retransmitted will not result in ambiguity as the acknowledgements received for such packets can be readily associated with a transmit number. Therefore these known transmit numbers are compared to the possible transmit numbers for an ambiguous acknowledgement received near in time to the known acknowledgement. The sender compares the transmit numbers of the ambiguous acknowledgement against the last known received transmit number selecting the one closest to the known received transmit number. For example if an acknowledgement for data packet 1 is received and the last received acknowledgement was for data packet 5 the sender resolves the ambiguity by assuming that the third instance of data packet 1 caused the acknowledgement.

Another technique of the appliance or flow controller is to implement an embodiment of transport control protocol selective acknowledgements or TCP SACK to determine what packets have or have not been received. This technique allows the sender to determine unambiguously a list of packets that have been received by the receiver as well as an accurate list of packets not received. This functionality may be implemented by modifying the sender and or receiver or by inserting sender and receiver side flow control modules in the network path between the sender and receiver. In reference to or a sender e.g. client is configured to transmit data packets to the receiver e.g. server over the network . In response the receiver returns a TCP Selective Acknowledgment option referred to as SACK packet to the sender. In one embodiment the communication is bi directional although only one direction of communication is discussed here for simplicity. The receiver maintains a list or other suitable data structure that contains a group of ranges of sequence numbers for data packets that the receiver has actually received. In some embodiments the list is sorted by sequence number in an ascending or descending order. The receiver also maintains a left off pointer which comprises a reference into the list and indicates the left off point from the previously generated SACK packet.

Upon reception of a data packet the receiver generates and transmits a SACK packet back to the sender. In some embodiments the SACK packet includes a number of fields each of which can hold a range of sequence numbers to indicate a set of received data packets. The receiver fills this first field of the SACK packet with a range of sequence numbers that includes the landing packet that triggered the SACK packet. The remaining available SACK fields are filled with ranges of sequence numbers from the list of received packets. As there are more ranges in the list than can be loaded into the SACK packet the receiver uses the left off pointer to determine which ranges are loaded into the SACK packet. The receiver inserts the SACK ranges consecutively from the sorted list starting from the range referenced by the pointer and continuing down the list until the available SACK range space in the TCP header of the SACK packet is consumed. The receiver wraps around to the start of the list if it reaches the end. In some embodiments two or three additional SACK ranges can be added to the SACK range information.

Once the receiver generates the SACK packet the receiver sends the acknowledgement back to the sender. The receiver then advances the left off pointer by one or more SACK range entries in the list. If the receiver inserts four SACK ranges for example the left off pointer may be advanced two SACK ranges in the list. When the advanced left off pointer reaches at the end of the list the pointer is reset to the start of the list effectively wrapping around the list of known received ranges. Wrapping around the list enables the system to perform well even in the presence of large losses of SACK packets since the SACK information that is not communicated due to a lost SACK packet will eventually be communicated once the list is wrapped around.

It can be appreciated therefore that a SACK packet may communicate several details about the condition of the receiver. First the SACK packet indicates that upon generation of the SACK packet the receiver had just received a data packet that is within the first field of the SACK information. Secondly the second and subsequent fields of the SACK information indicate that the receiver has received the data packets within those ranges. The SACK information also implies that the receiver had not at the time of the SACK packet s generation received any of the data packets that fall between the second and subsequent fields of the SACK information. In essence the ranges between the second and subsequent ranges in the SACK information are holes in the received data the data therein known not to have been delivered. Using this method therefore when a SACK packet has sufficient space to include more than two SACK ranges the receiver may indicate to the sender a range of data packets that have not yet been received by the receiver.

In another embodiment the sender uses the SACK packet described above in combination with the retransmit technique described above to make assumptions about which data packets have been delivered to the receiver. For example when the retransmit algorithm using the transmit numbers declares a packet lost the sender considers the packet to be only conditionally lost as it is possible that the SACK packet identifying the reception of this packet was lost rather than the data packet itself. The sender thus adds this packet to a list of potentially lost packets called the presumed lost list. Each time a SACK packet arrives the known missing ranges of data from the SACK packet are compared to the packets in the presumed lost list. Packets that contain data known to be missing are declared actually lost and are subsequently retransmitted. In this way the two schemes are combined to give the sender better information about which packets have been lost and need to be retransmitted.

In some embodiments the appliance or flow controller applies a technique referred to as transaction boundary detection. In one embodiment the technique pertains to ping pong behaved connections. At the TCP layer ping pong behavior is when one communicant a sender sends data and then waits for a response from the other communicant the receiver. Examples of ping pong behavior include remote procedure call HTTP and others. The algorithms described above use retransmission timeout RTO to recover from the dropping of the last packet or packets associated with the transaction. Since the TCP RTO mechanism is extremely coarse in some embodiments for example requiring a minimum one second value in all cases poor application behavior may be seen in these situations.

In one embodiment the sender of data or a flow control module coupled to the sender detects a transaction boundary in the data being sent. Upon detecting a transaction boundary the sender or a flow control module sends additional packets whose reception generates additional ACK or SACK responses from the receiver. Insertion of the additional packets is preferably limited to balance between improved application response time and network capacity utilization. The number of additional packets that is inserted may be selected according to the current loss rate associated with that connection with more packets selected for connections having a higher loss rate.

One method of detecting a transaction boundary is time based. If the sender has been sending data and ceases then after a period of time the sender or flow control module declares a transaction boundary. This may be combined with other techniques. For example the setting of the PSH TCP Push bit by the sender in the TCP header may indicate a transaction boundary. Accordingly combining the time based approach with these additional heuristics can provide for more accurate detection of a transaction boundary. In another technique if the sender or flow control module understands the application protocol it can parse the protocol data stream and directly determine transaction boundaries. In some embodiment this last behavior can be used independent of any time based mechanism.

Responsive to detecting a transaction boundary the sender or flow control module transmits additional data packets to the receiver to cause acknowledgements therefrom. The additional data packets should therefore be such that the receiver will at least generate an ACK or SACK in response to receiving the data packet. In one embodiment the last packet or packets of the transaction are simply retransmitted. This has the added benefit of retransmitting needed data if the last packet or packets had been dropped as compared to merely sending dummy data packets. In another embodiment fractions of the last packet or packets are sent allowing the sender to disambiguate the arrival of these packets from their original packets. This allows the receiver to avoid falsely confusing any reordering adaptation algorithms. In another embodiment any of a number of well known forward error correction techniques can be used to generate additional data for the inserted packets allowing for the reconstruction of dropped or otherwise missing data at the receiver.

In some embodiments the boundary detection technique described herein helps to avoid a timeout when the acknowledgements for the last data packets in a transaction are dropped. When the sender or flow control module receives the acknowledgements for these additional data packets the sender can determine from these additional acknowledgements whether the last data packets have been received or need to be retransmitted thus avoiding a timeout. In one embodiment if the last packets have been received but their acknowledgements were dropped a flow control module generates an acknowledgement for the data packets and sends the acknowledgement to the sender thus communicating to the sender that the data packets have been delivered. In another embodiment if the last packets have not been received a flow control module sends a packet to the sender to cause the sender to retransmit the dropped data packets.

In yet another embodiment the appliance or flow controller applies a repacketization technique for improving the flow of transport layer network traffic. In some embodiments performance of TCP is proportional to packet size. Thus increasing packet sizes improves performance unless it causes substantially increased packet loss rates or other nonlinear effects like IP fragmentation. In general wired media such as copper or fibre optics have extremely low bit error rates low enough that these can be ignored. For these media it is advantageous for the packet size to be the maximum possible before fragmentation occurs the maximum packet size is limited by the protocols of the underlying transmission media . Whereas for transmission media with higher loss rates e.g. wireless technologies such as WiFi etc. or high loss environments such as power line networking etc. increasing the packet size may lead to lower transmission rates as media induced errors cause an entire packet to be dropped i.e. media induced errors beyond the capability of the standard error correcting code for that media increasing the packet loss rate. A sufficiently large increase in the packet loss rate will actually negate any performance benefit of increasing packet size. In some cases it may be difficult for a TCP endpoint to choose an optimal packet size. For example the optimal packet size may vary across the transmission path depending on the nature of each link.

By inserting an appliance or flow control module into the transmission path the flow controller monitors characteristics of the link and repacketizes according to determined link characteristics. In one embodiment an appliance or flow controller repacketizes packets with sequential data into a smaller number of larger packets. In another embodiment an appliance or flow controller repacketizes packets by breaking part a sequence of large packets into a larger number of smaller packets. In other embodiments an appliance or flow controller monitors the link characteristics and adjusts the packet sizes through recombination to improve throughput.

Still referring to the flow controller in some embodiments may include a QoS Engine also referred to as a QoS controller. In another embodiment the appliance and or network optimization engine includes the QoS engine for example separately but in communication with the flow controller . The QoS Engine includes any logic business rules function or operations for performing one or more Quality of Service QoS techniques improving the performance operation or quality of service of any of the network connections. In some embodiments the QoS engine includes network traffic control and management mechanisms that provide different priorities to different users applications data flows or connections. In other embodiments the QoS engine controls maintains or assures a certain level of performance to a user application data flow or connection. In one embodiment the QoS engine controls maintains or assures a certain portion of bandwidth or network capacity for a user application data flow or connection. In some embodiments the QoS engine monitors the achieved level of performance or the quality of service corresponding to a user application data flow or connection for example the data rate and delay. In response to monitoring the QoS engine dynamically controls or adjusts scheduling priorities of network packets to achieve the desired level of performance or quality of service.

In some embodiments the QoS engine prioritizes schedules and transmits network packets according to one or more classes or levels of services. In some embodiments the class or level service may include 1 best efforts 2 controlled load 3 guaranteed or 4 qualitative. For a best efforts class of service the appliance makes reasonable effort to deliver packets a standard service level . For a controlled load class of service the appliance or QoS engine approximates the standard packet error loss of the transmission medium or approximates the behavior of best effort service in lightly loaded network conditions. For a guaranteed class of service the appliance or QoS engine guarantees the ability to transmit data at a determined rate for the duration of the connection. For a qualitative class of service the appliance or QoS engine the qualitative service class is used for applications users data flows or connection that require or desire prioritized traffic but cannot quantify resource needs or level of service. In these cases the appliance or QoS engine determines the class of service or priortization based on any logic or configuration of the QoS engine or based on business rules or policies. For example in one embodiment the QoS engine prioritizes schedules and transmits network packets according to one or more policies as specified by the policy engine .

In other embodiments an appliance may be deployed inline between a client and server to receive network packets communicated between the client and the server. In yet another embodiment the server may include an agent such as the network optimization engine to intercept network packets communicated to the destination of the server as the packet traverses the server s network stack. In one embodiment a first NIC of the intermediary may receive the network packet. In another embodiment a second NIC of the intermediary may receive the network packet.

At step the network optimization engine stores source and destination MAC address information for those network packets originating from a source adapter which is a NIC. The network optimization engine and or filter may identify inspect analyze or determine from the source MAC address of the network packet whether or not the source of the network packet is a NIC. In some embodiments the network optimization engine and or filter determines from the first or left most digits such as the 6 first left digits that the source MAC address identifies the source adapter as a NIC. In other embodiments the network optimization engine and or filter determines from the last or right most digits that the source MAC address identifies a serial number of a NIC. In yet another embodiment the network optimization engine and or filter determines the source MAC address is not a broadcast or multicast address and therefore should be a NIC address or vice versa determines that the source MAC address is a broadcast or multicast address and therefore the source address is not a NIC. The network optimization engine and or filter may determine from any portion of the network packet such as any field header option or payload whether or not the source adapter is a NIC.

If the source adapter is a NIC the network optimization engine and or filter stores the source MAC address and or the destination MAC address in the table .

The techniques described herein may be used to communicate network packets between the first client agent and the second client agent in order for each to receive and process packets in accordance with their respective functions. As such in some embodiments the methods of and described above may apply to and be used between any type and form of executable instructions operating at different layers of a network stack.

Referring now to multiple example scenarios of the systems and methods of the integrated network optimization engine and security gateway using the techniques described herein are depicted The following table shows different scenarios of processing incoming and outgoing packets by the network optimization engine and higher layers and the identified Figures depict the packet flow corresponding to each scenario 

In brief overview the above table identifies a corresponding packet flow diagram for processing packets between the network optimization engine and the security way for accelerated and non accelerated connections traversing the intermediary deployed in inline mode. depict packet flows for an established connection going to and coming from a WAN network in which the established connection originated from the WAN. depicts packets flow diagrams for new connections coming outside from the WAN in which the connection requests may be either tagged with TCP Options or not. As discussed in conjunction with the network optimization engine includes a LAN WAN detector that may use TCP options to identify and tag slow side and fast side connections or the LAN and WAN ports used by the intermediary. depicts the packet flow for a connection establishment generated locally. depicts an embodiment of the network optimization engine of but is not limited to this embodiment. In the following examples the network optimization engine may be operating at layer 2 of the network stack while the security gateway may be operating at layer 3 or above in the network stack.

Referring now to an embodiment of a packet flow using the techniques described herein for an established connection and an outgoing packet to a WAN is depicted. At step a the intermediary receives an incoming pack on the inbound NIC interfacing to the LAN network. The packet has a destination MAC address M1 and originates from a source adapter identifying a NIC. The DNE Plug in gets this packet and at step b provides the packet to the filter . The DNE Plug in may operate at the data link layer such as in the embodiment of a NDIS driver. The connection corresponding to this network packet or MAC address should be present in endpoint connection table . At step c since the source adapter is a NIC the filter saves the original source and destination MAC addresses of the packet in the corresponding record in the table. The filter also changes the destination MAC address in the packet M1 to the MAC address of the bridge interface M2 or a NIC of the intermediary. If the inbound NIC is on the LAN side the filter passes the packet through to the local stack and does not apply WAN optimization. The DNE Plug in receives the modified packet. Since the destination MAC address M2 belongs to this device the packet traverses the local network stack and reaches TCP IP layers and above Layer 3 and above .

At step d the security gateway applies one or more policies in response to the network packet or otherwise to the network packet. For example in the embodiment of an ISA server as the security gateway the ISA Server may apply one or more policies to the network packet. The security gateway may operate and or process packets at the network layer or layer 3 of the network stack. The security gateway may transmit the network packet. The network packet is sent out via layer 3 or above. At step e the DNE plug in receives the network packet and provides the packet to the filter . The connection corresponding to this outgoing network packet should be present in the endpoint table . At step f the filter replaces the source and destination MAC address in the outgoing packet with the source and destination MAC addresses saved above by the filter at step c for the incoming packet. If the outbound NIC is on the WAN side the filter applies WAN acceleration to the packet. At step g the DNE Plug in receives the outgoing packet and transmits the packet to the destination via the outbound NIC.

Referring now to an embodiment of an embodiment of a packet flow using the techniques described herein for an established connection and an incoming packet from a WAN is depicted. At step a the intermediary receives an incoming packet from the WAN via the inbound NIC. The destination MAC address of the incoming packet is M1. The DNE plug in gets this packet such as by interception at layer 2 of the network stack and at step b delivers this packet to the filter . The connection for this incoming packet should be present in the connection table . At step c since the source adapter originating the network packet is a NIC the filter stores the original source and destination MAC addresses in the table . The filter may store the original MAC addresses in association with or as part of the records or entries for the connection in the table . The filter changes the destination MAC address of the packet M1 to the MAC address of the intermediary M2 . If the inbound NIC is on the WAN side the filter may apply WAN acceleration to the network packet. At step d the DNE plug in obtains this modifies packet. Since the destination MAC address M2 belongs to this device the packet traverses the upper layer of the local network stack such as layer 3 and above.

At step e the security gateway such as ISA software receives the network packet at Layer 3 or above of the network stack and applies one or more policies to the packet. In some cases the security gateway may drop or reject the packet. In other cases the security gateway may modify or change the network packet. After process of the network packet at Layer 2 and above the network packet is transmitted as an outgoing packet. At step f . the DNE plug in receives this packet and provides the packet to the filter . At step g the filter queries the connection table for information on the connection corresponding to the network packet. At step g the filter changes the source and destination MAC addresses of the outgoing packet to correspond to the source and destination MAC addresses for the connection obtained from the table . If the outbound NIC is on the LAN side the filter passes the network packet through the network stack and may not apply WAN acceleration to the packet. At step h the DNE plug in receives the packet and transmits the packet to the destination via the outbound NIC.

Referring now to an embodiment of a packet flow using the techniques described herein for a new connection such as TCP connection request via an incoming packet from a LAN is depicted. At step a the intermediary receives incoming network packet via an inbound NIC on a LAN. The network packet has a destination MAC address M1 and may include a SYN packet to request a TCP connection with the destination. The DNE plug in gets this packet for example by interception at the data link layer of the stack and at step b delivers the packet to the filter . The filter should not find this connection in the endpoint table as the network packet is for a new connection. At step c the filter creates an entry or record in the endpoint table . If the source adapter originating the network packet is a NIC the filter stores the original source and destination MAC addresses in the corresponding entry or record in the table . The filter changes the destination MAC address in the packet M1 to the MAC address of the bridge interface M2 or intermediary. The filter passes this network packet up through the network stack to upper layers such as Layer 3 and above of the network stack.

At step d the security gateway intercepts or otherwise receives the network packet at layer 3 or above in the network stack. The security gateway applies one or more policies to the network packet such as any security firewall or gateway policies. The processed network packet is communicated via the network stack as an outgoing packet. At step e the DNE plug in gets this packet and provides the packet to the filter . The connection for this packet should be in the endpoint table via the created entry of step c . At step d the filter obtains the source and destination MAC address for this connection via table and replaces the source and MAC address of the outgoing packet with the retrieved MAC addresses e.g. original MAC addresses as received by the intermediary . The network optimization engine and or filter may apply one or more WAN accelerations techniques to the network packet such as a SYN packet for a TCP connection request. For example in some cases the network optimization engine tags the SYN packet with TCP options and or changes the window scale for the SYN packet as previously discussed herein. At step g the DNE plug in obtains the packet and transmits the packet to the destination via the outgoing NIC.

Referring to an embodiment of a packet flow using the techniques described herein for a new connection such as a TCP connection request via an incoming packet from a WAN is depicted. At step a the intermediary receives an incoming packet from the inbound NIC on a WAN. The DNE plug in obtains this packet at a first network layer such as the data link layer of or layer 2 and below of the network stack. The packet may have a destination MAC address of M1. At step b the DNE plug in provides this packet to the filter . At step c the filter should not find this packet in the endpoint table . Responsive to not finding this new connection in the table the filter creates an entry or record in table for the connection and stores the source and destination MAC address of the packet in table in association with the connection. If the inbound NIC is on the WAN side the packet may have TCP options and window scale added. The Network optimization engine performs any WAN optimization techniques to this tagged packet. The filter changes the destination MAC address of the packet to the MAC address M2 of the intermediary and passes the modified packet through the local stack . At step d the DNE plug in gets this network packet. Since the MAC address M2 identifies the intermediary or this machine the network packet traverses the upper layers of the network stack such as Layer 3 and above.

At step e the network packet is processed at the upper layers of the network stack such as by the security gateway operating at an IP layer in one embodiment. The security gateway may perform one or more actions on the packet such as dropping the packets changing the packet s payload or modifying any protocol headers fields or options of the packet. The security gateway may transmit the network packet onto a network such as an outgoing packet from the intermediary. At step f the DNE plug in obtains this outgoing packet and provides the packet to the filter . The connection for this packer should exist in the endpoint table as the connection entry was created at step c above. At step g the filter replaces or changes the source and destination MAC address in the outgoing packet with the source and destination MAC address saved by the filter at step c . If the outbound NIC is on the WAN side the filter passes the network packet through the local stack. The filter may not perform any WAN acceleration to the packet. At step h the DNE plug in obtains the outgoing network packet and transmits the network packet via the outgoing NIC.

Referring to an embodiment of a packet flow using the techniques described herein for a new connection such as a TCP connection request originating locally is depicted. At step a the DNE plug in intercepts or otherwise receives a network packet originating locally such as via an application on the intermediary. At step b the DNE plug in provides the packet to the filter . At step c the filter creates an entry in the connection table for the new connection. For example as the packet represents a new connection request such as a SYN packet for a TCP connection the connection should not exist in the connect table . The filter may mark or identify the connection in the table as a locally originated connection. The filter copies or stores the source and destination MAC address from the packet in the table such as with the records of the corresponding connection. The network optimization engine processes the network packet for WAN acceleration such as attaching TCP options and changing the window scale. At step d the DNE plug in obtains the packet and transmits the packet out to the WAN via the NIC.

Although depict multiple instances of either the DNE plug in or filter the diagrams illustrate the flow of the network packet through the DNE plug in or filter and not meant to indicate multiple instances of either the plugin or filter although in some embodiments multiple instances may be used. The techniques described herein may be performed by either the same or a single instance of the DNE plug in or filter. In some embodiments a single network optimization engine in the network stack performs the functionality of the DNE plug in and or filter. The DNE plugin and or filter understands the multiple passing of the network packet through the stack. In other embodiments a first network optimization engine or a first set of a DNE plug in and filter may perform processing on an incoming network packet while a second network optimization engine or a second set of a DNE plug in and filter performs processing on the outgoing packet. In these embodiments the multiple engines may store and query MAC address information for connections via a shared set of one or more tables .
