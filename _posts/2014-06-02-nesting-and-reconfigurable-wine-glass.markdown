The present application claims priority under 35 USC 119 e to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 829 362 entitled NESTING AND RECONFIGURABLE WINE GLASS filed May 31 2013 the contents of which are incorporated herein by its entirety.

The present inventive concepts relate to the field of beverage containers and more particularly to the field of wine glasses.

Different types of disposable drinking cups exist such as paper plastic and Styrofoam coffee cups or all purpose drinking cups. These types of drinking cups tend to be sold in relatively large quantities to a consumer or business that sells beverages in such types of cups. As examples such drinking cups can be sold 50 or more cups per pack or 300 cups or more per case or in other large quantities.

A major consideration in the sale of such quantities of cups is the cost to ship because that affects the cost to sell such goods. The goal is to be as compact and efficient as possible in packaging large numbers of these drinking cups. This has been done by making the cups so that one cup fits inside another in a stack. Using this approach such quantities can be shipped and stored in a reasonable volume to make it economical. This has been relatively easy with the truncated cone shape widely used for such drinking cups which naturally fit one inside the other.

In accordance with aspects of the inventive concepts provided is a drinking cup comprising a top portion having an open top and an open bottom the open bottom defined by a bottom rim and a bottom portion having an open top and a closed bottom the open top defined by a top rim. The bottom rim and the top rim mate to form the drinking cup having a leak proof closure.

In various embodiments the bottom rim of the top portion can include a laterally extending foot and the top rim of the bottom portion can include a well having a J hook shaped curled edge configured to receive and retain the laterally extending foot to form the leak proof seal.

In various embodiments a top rim of the top portion ca have a smaller circumference then the bottom rim of the top portion.

In various embodiments a circumference of the drinking cup can be greatest between the open top of the top portion and the closed bottom of the bottom portion.

In accordance with another aspect of the inventive concept provided is a wine cup having a two piece bowl comprising a top bowl portion having an open top and an open bottom the open bottom defined by a bottom rim and a bottom bowl portion having an open top and a closed bottom the open top defined by a top rim. A circumference of the bowl is greatest between the open top of the top portion and the closed bottom of the bottom portion and the bottom rim and the top rim mate to form a leak proof closure at an intermediate location of the bowl.

In various embodiments the bottom rim of the top portion can include a laterally extending foot and the top rim of the bottom portion can include a well having a J hook shaped curled edge configured to receive and retain the laterally extending foot to form the leak proof seal.

In various embodiments a top rim of the top portion can have a smaller circumference then the bottom rim of the top portion.

In accordance with another aspect of the inventive concept provided is a plurality of stackable two piece wine cups comprising a plurality of nestable top bowl portions and a plurality of nestable bottom bowl portions. Each top bowl portion has an open top and an open bottom the open bottom defined by a bottom rim. Each bottom bowl portion has an open top and a closed bottom the open top defined by a top rim. A circumference of the bowl is greatest between the open top of the top portion and the closed bottom of the bottom portion and the bottom rim and the top rim mate to form a leak proof closure at an intermediate location of the bowl.

In various embodiments the bottom rim of the top portion can include a laterally extending foot and the top rim of the bottom portion can include a well having a J hook shaped curled edge configured to receive and retain the laterally extending foot to form the leak proof seal.

In various embodiments the closure can have a tongue and groove closure a threaded screw type closure or a press fit closure.

Various exemplary embodiments will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings in which some exemplary embodiments are shown. The present inventive concept may however be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the exemplary embodiments set forth herein.

It will be understood that although the terms first second etc. may be used herein to describe various elements these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are used to distinguish one element from another but not to imply a required sequence of elements. For example a first element can be termed a second element and similarly a second element can be termed a first element without departing from the scope of the present invention. As used herein the term and or includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.

It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being on or connected or coupled to another element it can be directly on or connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements can be present. In contrast when an element is referred to as being directly on or directly connected or directly coupled to another element there are no intervening elements present. Other words used to describe the relationship between elements should be interpreted in a like fashion e.g. between versus directly between adjacent versus directly adjacent etc. .

The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used herein the singular forms a an and the are intended to include the plural forms as well unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms comprises comprising includes and or including when used herein specify the presence of stated features steps operations elements and or components but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features steps operations elements components and or groups thereof.

Spatially relative terms such as beneath below lower above upper and the like may be used to describe an element and or feature s relationship to another element s and or feature s as for example illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use and or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example if the device in the figures is turned over elements described as below and or beneath other elements or features would then be oriented above the other elements or features. The device may be otherwise oriented e.g. rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.

With respect to various drawings dimensions may be shown described or implied but only as examples. The present inventive concepts are not limited to such dimensions or ratios of dimensions unless otherwise indicated.

In accordance with one aspect of the present disclosure provided is a nestable and reconfigurable drinking cup having at least two portions that can be put into a nested arrangement when not in use and then combined to form a drinking cup for use.

In various embodiments the drinking cup preferably takes the form of a wine cup or glass i.e. a drinking vessel made for drinking a beverage such as wine e.g. red or white port sherry brandy or the like and does not have the truncated cone shape of typical disposable paper plastic or Styrofoam all purpose or coffee cups. For example the multiple parts can form the bowl of a wine cup which has an intermediate diameter greater than top and bottom diameters of the bowl. As used herein the word glass in the term wine glass does not necessitate that a drinking cup is made from a glass material. Rather the term wine glass indicates the type of drinking cup i.e. having the shape of a traditional wine glass regardless of whether the drinking cup is made of paper plastic glass metal or some other material or materials.

Different wine glasses have different shapes which are designed for specific types of wine or similar beverages and can enhance the experience of drinking the intended wine. Therefore as a wine glass or cup the drinking cup can take a specific wine glass shape e.g. for red wine white wine flute etc. Unlike truncated cone cups a width or diameter of a wine glass can be smaller at a drinking rim than it is at an intermediate portion. Therefore a width of the wine glass at the drinking rim can be smaller than a width of the wine glass at an intermediate location i.e. between the drinking rim and a bottom of the wine glass. Collectively such a drinking cup can be referred to as a wine glass or wine cup. 

In various embodiments the wine cup can have a bowl that is made of at least two portions which can be referred to as a top portion and a bottom portion. The wine cup can be configured such that in assembled form the top and bottom portions mate together to form a wine cup bowl having a leak proof seal and closure. When separated or unassembled the top portion can be configured to nest inside the bottom portion or vice versa e.g. for economical storage packaging and shipping. Additionally or alternative a plurality of the tops can be made to nest together and a plurality of the bottoms can be made to nest together.

In various embodiments the wine glass can be disposable biodegradable degradable and or compostable or the like. And in various embodiments the wine glass can be reusable.

In various embodiments the top portion can define an open drinking rim and the bottom portion can define a closed wine glass bottom. That is the bottom portion can have a closed bottom end and a top rim opposite the closed bottom. Also the top portion can include a bottom rim opposite the drinking rim of the top portion. The top rim of the bottom portion is configured to mate with the bottom rim of the top portion to form a closure. The closure is preferably a leak proof closure that prevents liquid inside of the wine cup from leaking or seeping out of the closure. In various embodiments the closure can be a tongue and groove closure a threaded screw type closure a snap type closure or press fit closure.

In various embodiments the wine glass may further include a stem. The stem may be a separate piece configured to mate with the wine glass bottom. In various embodiments the present invention may be directed to a wine glass kit comprising the top and bottom portions described herein and optionally the stem.

In various embodiments the present invention may be directed to a method of making a nesting reconfigurable wine glass including forming the top and bottom portions as described herein and optionally a stem.
