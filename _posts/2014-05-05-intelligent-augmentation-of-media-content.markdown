This application claims the benefit of and priority to and is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 032 434 which claims the benefit of and priority to and is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 940 461 which claims the benefit of and priority to and is a continuation of granted U.S. Pat. No. 7 853 558 which claims the benefit of a U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60 986 965 entitled Intelligent Augmentation of Media Content by Richard Brindley filed on Nov. 9 2007 all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes.

The disclosure generally relates to the field of data augmentation in particular to augmenting non textual content in documents.

As the cost associated with network storage reduces and the number of users having high speed network access grows more and more content providers place rich visual content e.g. still images videos in their web pages. In addition content providers often place advertisements in their web pages to generate advertising revenue. However advertisements usually occupy prominent spaces in web pages. In addition advertisements tend to interrupt content arrangement in the web pages and distract viewers.

Thus the art lacks a system and method for augmenting visual content in web pages and providing augmented data based on the visual content.

Embodiments of the present disclosure include methods and corresponding systems and computer program products that augment visual elements in documents with rich media content and provide the rich media content based on user interaction with the augmented visual elements in the documents.

The disclosed embodiments analyze a document for qualified visual elements. The disclosed embodiments determine keywords associated with the visual element generate an association of the visual element and the keywords and embed the association in a corresponding augmented document. When a user reviews the augmented document in a client system and moves a pointer over the augmented visual element a piece of rich media content related to the keywords is transmitted to the client system. The related rich media content can be displayed as an overlay in close proximity to the visual element where the mouse over occurred.

Advantages of the disclosed embodiments include providing content providers with additional channels for delivering relevant advertisements and other augmented data to viewers. The disclosed embodiments also enhance viewers web browsing experience by providing rich media overlays without the need to leave their current web page. In addition the disclosed embodiments provide additional rich media content on a web page without requiring a media player at a fixed location on the web page.

The features and advantages described in the specification are not all inclusive and in particular many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the drawings specification and claims. Moreover it should be noted that the language used in the specification has been principally selected for readability and instructional purposes and may not have been selected to delineate or circumscribe the disclosed subject matter.

The disclosed embodiments describe examples of a method and corresponding system and computer program product for augmenting visual elements in documents with rich media content and delivering the rich media content based on user interaction with the augmented visual elements in the documents. The visual elements include images videos and other graphical display e.g. animations such as Flash . The documents include any form of documents such as web pages. The rich media content includes services e.g. convenient Internet search service hyperlinks graphical displays video playbacks and advertisements. For purposes of illustration the method and corresponding system and computer program product is described in terms of augmenting images in web pages with advertisements and delivering the advertisements based on user interactions with the augmented images even though the disclosed embodiments applies to all other types of visual elements documents and rich media content as defined above.

The figures and the following description relate to preferred embodiments by way of illustration only. Reference will now be made in detail to several embodiments examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying figures. It is noted that wherever practicable similar or like reference numbers may be used in the figures and may indicate similar or like functionality. The figures depict embodiments of the disclosed system or method for purposes of illustration only. It should be noted that from the following discussion alternate embodiments of the structures and methods disclosed herein will be readily recognized by one skilled in the art as viable alternatives that may be employed without departing from the principles described herein.

The augmentation server is configured to augment images and other types of visual elements in web pages and other types of documents with advertisements and other types of rich media content and deliver the advertisements based on user interaction with the augmented images. The augmentation server retrieves web pages from the content providers and augments the web pages. The augmentation server augments a web page by analyzing it for qualified images and their one or more related contexts and subjects associating or tagging the images with one or more related contexts and subjects and storing the associations in a database. When a user views an augmented web page in a client computer and moves a pointer over one of the tagged or augmented images hereinafter the active image the augmentation server provides an advertisement related to the context and or subject of the active image for display in the client computer as an overlay of the active image. An example architecture of the augmentation server is described in detail below with respect to .

The content providers are entities that provide or generate host publish control or otherwise have rights over a collection of web pages or other types of documents . In one embodiment the content providers are web servers hosting web pages for viewers to access. The content providers may provide web pages to the augmentation server for augmentation. Alternatively the content providers may either instruct or give permission to the augmentation server to retrieve all or parts of their web pages for augmentation.

The client computers are client devices for users to browse web pages or other types of documents . In one embodiment a client computer includes a pointer device e.g. a mouse a trackball a roller a touchpad or the like a conventional web browser e.g. Microsoft Internet Explorer Mozilla Firefox or Apple Safari and can retrieve and display web pages from the content providers in a conventional manner e.g. using the HyperText Transfer Protocol . In one embodiment the client computer displays an augmented web page in a manner identical or substantially similar to the corresponding original web page. When a user moves a pointer e.g. mouse pointer over an augmented image in the augmented web page the client computer or the utilized web browser generates a request and transmits the request to the augmentation server for a relevant advertisement. The client computer or the utilized web browser displays the retrieved advertisement as an overlay proximate to the active image.

The network is configured to communicatively connect the augmentation server the content providers and the client computers . The network may be a wired or wireless network. Examples of the network include the Internet an intranet a WiFi network a WiMAX network a mobile telephone network or a combination thereof.

In one embodiment the augmentation server the content providers and or the client computers are structured to include a processor memory storage network interfaces and applicable operating system and other functional software e.g. network drivers communication protocols .

Referring next to a block diagram illustrating an example architecture of the augmentation server shown in . As illustrated the augmentation server includes an input output module an image augmentation module an advertisement delivery module and an augmentation and tracking database . The modules through may include a software or firmware instruction that can be stored within a tangible computer readable medium e.g. magnetic disk drive flash memory or random access memory and executed by a processor or equivalent electrical circuits microcode or the like.

The input output module is configured to communicate with external devices or entities such as the content providers and the client computers through communication channels such as the network . In one embodiment the input output module receives web pages or other types of documents from the content providers or retrieves or crawls websites for web pages. The input output module transmits to the content providers augmented web pages or information enabling the content providers to augment the web pages. The input output module also receives requests or signals from client computers indicating user interactions with the augmented web pages and transmits to the client computers related advertisements for display.

The image augmentation module is configured to augment images and other types of visual elements in web pages and other types of documents with advertisements and other types of rich media content . As illustrated the image augmentation module includes an image detection sub module and a context discovery sub module or knowledge engineering module . The image detection sub module is configured to detect qualified images in the web pages. One embodiment of a detailed operation for the image detection sub module to detect qualified images is described in detail below with respect to .

The context discovery sub module is configured to identify contexts and or subject keywords related to the qualified images in the web pages. A context of a web page or an image is a circumstance relevant to the content of the web page or the subject of the image . A subject of an image is a subject matter of the content of the image. An image may have one or more contexts and or subjects. A context and or a subject can be defined or described using one or more keywords. As used herein both context keywords and subject keywords are collectively called keywords for ease of discussion. The context discovery sub module may process information associated with the image to identify related keywords. Alternatively or in addition the context discovery sub module may receive context information from the content providers . One embodiment of a detailed operation for the context discovery sub module to identify keywords is described in detail below with respect to .

The image augmentation module is configured to generate intelligent tags for the qualified images and augment the qualified images with the intelligent tags. In one embodiment an intelligent tag uniquely identifies its associated image and optionally the associated web page . An intelligent tag may also include some or all of the identified keywords identified for the associated image. The image augmentation module may integrate the intelligent tags into the web pages or provide them to the content providers for integration. Web pages with the integrated intelligent tags are called augmented web pages. Images with the integrated intelligent tags are called augmented images. The image augmentation module also stores the identified keywords together with identifiers of the associated images in the augmentation and tracking database for later references.

The advertisement delivery module is configured to provide related advertisements or other types of rich media content based on user interaction with augmented images in augmented web pages. The advertisement delivery module receives an intelligent tag request indicating a user interaction with an augmented image e.g. moving a mouse pointer over the augmented image from a client computer through the input output module . The advertisement delivery module retrieves keywords associated with the active image and determines one or more relevant advertisements matching the keywords in an advertising database not shown . The advertisement delivery module provides the relevant advertisements to the requesting client computer for display. Alternatively the advertisement delivery module transmits addresses e.g. Universal Resource Locator URL of the relevant advertisements to the requesting client computer for retrieval.

The augmentation and tracking database hereinafter the database is configured to store identifiers of the augmented images e.g. URL and the associated keywords. In one embodiment the database also serves as the advertising database and hosts a table of advisement identifiers their addresses format information and associated keywords.

The components of the augmentation server can reside on a single computer system or several computer systems located close by or remotely from each other. For example the image augmentation module and the advertisement delivery module may reside on separate web servers and the database may be located in a dedicated database server. In addition any of the components or sub components may be executed in one or multiple computer systems.

Referring next to flowcharts collectively illustrate an example method or process for augmenting images in web pages with advertisements and delivering the advertisements based on user interactions with the augmented images.

In one embodiment the illustrated method or any of the sub methods and is implemented in a computing environment such as the computing environment . One or more portions of the method may be implemented in embodiments of hardware and or software or combinations thereof. By way of example the illustrated method may be embodied through instructions for performing the actions described herein and such instrumentations can be stored within a tangible computer readable medium and are executable by a processor. Alternatively or additionally the illustrated method may be implemented in modules like those in the augmentation server described above with respect to and or other entities such as the content providers and or the client computers . Furthermore those of skill in the art will recognize that other embodiments can perform the steps of the illustrated method in different order. Moreover other embodiments can include different and or additional steps than the ones described here.

As illustrated in initially the augmentation server retrieves web pages from the content providers e.g. through the input output module . The content providers may provide web pages for augmentation to the augmentation server e.g. by transmitting the web pages to the augmentation server . Alternatively the augmentation server may crawl websites to retrieve web pages. For example the content providers may either instruct or give permission to the augmentation server to retrieve all or parts of their web pages for augmentation. Accordingly the augmentation server retrieves the web pages as identified by the content providers .

The augmentation server analyzes the retrieved web pages for qualified images within the web pages e.g. through the image detection sub module . In one embodiment the augmentation server enumerates through all images in the web pages for those that meet predefined criteria. The predefined criteria for qualified images include limitations such as a minimum width and a minimum height. Small or flat or narrow images tend not to be images of viewer s interest e.g. border line patterns . Only images equal to or exceed the minimum width and height are potentially qualified images. The predefined criteria may also disqualify certain types of images e.g. advertising images background images clickable images or images that are otherwise associated with certain tags . The predefined criteria are customizable and the augmentation server may apply different sets of predefined criteria for different content providers based on customer requests and or needs.

The augmentation server contextualizes the qualified images in the web pages e.g. through the context discovery sub module . In one embodiment the augmentation server determines or identifies context keywords and or subject keywords for each qualified image in the web pages. The contextualization step is further described with respect to .

Referring now to a flowchart illustrating an example method for the augmentation server to contextualize a qualified image in a web page. As illustrated the augmentation server determines whether contexts for the web page or the qualified image are available. As defined above with respect to the context discovery sub module in a context of a web page or image is a circumstance relevant to the content of the web page or the subject of the image . A web page or image can have zero one or more contexts. A context can be defined or described using one or more keywords. For example a web page about the life of the world renowned author Ernest Hemingway may have a context of literature. The augmentation server may determine whether contexts of the web page or the qualified image are available from its content provider . If the augmentation server determines that the contexts are available it retrieves the available contexts and proceeds to determine whether subjects for the qualified image are available as described in detail below.

If the augmentation server determines that the contexts are not available it identifies contexts for the web page or the qualified image by analyzing content of the web page. In one embodiment the augmentation server uses natural language processing technologies to process textual content of the web page to determine contexts of the web page or the qualified image . For example if the web page contains content about works and life of Ernest Hemingway the augmentation server identifies a literature context for the web page and or the enclosed qualified image. Alternatively or in addition the augmentation server can analyze related web pages e.g. web pages linking to from the web page or web pages from the same web site to identify a particular context or contexts.

The augmentation server determines whether subjects of the qualified image are available. As defined above with respect to the context discovery sub module in an image may have one or more subjects described by one or more keywords. For example a photograph of Ernest Hemingway may have a subject keyword of Ernest Hemingway author or both. The augmentation server may determine whether subjects of the qualified image are available from its content provider . If the augmentation server determines that the subjects are available it retrieves the available subjects and proceeds to validate the contexts and or the subjects as described in detail below.

If the augmentation server determines that the subjects are not available it analyzes tags associated with the qualified image. In one embodiment the augmentation server extracts ALT tags associated with the qualified image for the subjects. An ALT tag is a HTML tag that provides alternative text for non textual elements typically images in an HTML document e.g. a web page . ALT tags are often used to provide descriptive information of the associated images. If the qualified image has associated ALT tags available the augmentation server analyzes their contents to extract relevant subject keywords.

The augmentation server determines whether the subjects for the qualified image are available from the associated ALT tags. If the augmentation server extracts subjects by analyzing ALT tags associated with the qualified image it proceeds to validate the contexts and or the subjects as described in detail below.

If the qualified image has no associated ALT tags or the augmentation server fails to extract any subject keywords from the ALT tags e.g. the associated ALT tags contain no relevant keywords the augmentation server analyzes contents of text nodes physically close to the qualified image on the web page for relevant subjects. For example the augmentation server may analyze the associated caption descriptive text hyperlink references or anchor texts . For example in a web page about Ernest Hemingway a photograph of the famous writer has a caption of Photograph of Ernest Hemingway aboard his yacht and is the destination of a hyperlink with anchor text Ernest Hemingway in his 50 s. The augmentation server may use the caption and or the anchor text to determine subjects for the photograph. In one embodiment the augmentation server may be configured to restrict the number of paragraphs to be analyzed for subjects in a web page to prevent identifying too many subjects. In one embodiment the augmentation server uses hyperlinks e.g. other hyperlinks to the image from other pages to determine subjects for the qualified image.

The augmentation server determines whether the subjects of the qualified image are available from the nearby text nodes. If the augmentation server identifies subjects by analyzing nearby text nodes it proceeds to validate the contexts and or the subjects as described in detail below.

If the augmentation server fails to identify subjects of the qualified image by analyzing nearby text nodes the augmentation server analyzes areas of interest in the web page for the subjects. An area of interest is a field e.g. a markup field such as a heading or a title of the web page containing information relevant to the qualified image. The area of interest may be provided by the content provider or identified by the augmentation server e.g. by analyzing web pages from the same web site . The augmentation server analyzes the areas of interest in the web page to identify subjects for the qualified image.

The augmentation server validates the identified or determined contexts and or the subjects. In one embodiment the augmentation server verifies the integrity and quality of the contexts and the subjects. For example the augmentation server may determine whether the subjects e.g. Ernest Hemingway and the contexts e.g. literature are relevant. If they are not relevant the augmentation server may determine that the subjects and or the contexts are considered not valid and may repeat the process . In one embodiment the augmentation server may determine a relevance of the context keywords and or the subject keywords with the qualified image in view of the analyzed text and sort them by relevance.

It is noted that in one embodiment the contexts and or the subjects are determined even if they are provided by the content provider. In one embodiment two or more steps of determining subjects are executed even if subjects are determined available or identified by one or more of the steps . In one embodiment if contexts and or subjects are determined to be not valid the augmentation server proceeds with one or more of the following steps ignoring or removing the not valid keywords repeating the process or disqualifying the web page and or the qualified image.

Referring back to the augmentation server augments the web pages with intelligent tags e.g. through the image augmentation module . The augmentation server generates intelligent tags for the qualified images based on their identified keywords and tags the qualified images with the generated intelligent tags. The intelligent tags contain information about the associated qualified images such as subject keywords context keywords and image identifiers. The intelligent tags may contain multiple sections hereinafter called IntelliImage sections for additional information. For example the intelligent tags may contain requirement or preference information about rich media content to be associated with the image such as types of advertisements or rich media content and whether the qualified image is clickable.

In one embodiment the augmentation server integrates the intelligent tags into the web pages as image tags associated with the qualified images. For example for an image of an Apple iPhone the augmentation server may place an intelligent tag with subject keywords Apple iPhone in an ALT tag in the accompanying IMG tag as illustrated below.

Alternatively the augmentation server may add the intelligent tag in a different section or tag associated with the qualified image. In one embodiment the augmentation server transmits the intelligent tags or their contents to the content provider for integration. In one embodiment the intelligent tags do not affect the display of the augmented web pages.

In one embodiment the augmentation server or the content providers also augments the web pages by including computer code hereinafter called client code to monitor and report viewers interactions with the augmented images. The computer code can be in any computer language such as JavaScript. Additional functions of the client code are described in detail below with respect to .

The augmentation server stores information about the augmentation in the database for future reference. The stored information includes information about the augmented web pages e.g. their URL and included augmented images the augmented images e.g. their size type resolution image identifier whether clickable or identified context and subject keywords and the related advertisements e.g. types of the advertisements .

The augmentation server delivers relevant advertisements responding to user interaction with augmented images. The delivery step is described in detail below with respect to .

Referring now to a flowchart illustrating an example method for the augmentation server to deliver a relevant advertisement responding to a user interaction with an augmented image in an augmented web page. As illustrated a content provider or a related entity such as a web hosting provider transmits an augmented web page to a client computer . For example a user of the client computer may enter the URL of an augmented web page or the corresponding original web page in the address bar of a conventional web browser e.g. Microsoft Internet Explorer Mozilla Firefox or Apple Safari . The web browser of the client computer hereinafter called the client web browser consequently transmits a request for the web page to a corresponding content provider . Responding to the request the content provider transmits the augmented web page to the client web browser for display. In one embodiment the client web browser displays augmented images in the web pages in a manner identical to or closely resembles corresponding original images. In other embodiment the augmented image may be highlighted in the augmented web page as displayed in the client web browser.

The augmentation server receives an intelligent tag request from the client computer . As described above with respect to the augmented web page contains client code that monitors user interactions with augmented images. In one embodiment if the user moves a pointer e.g. mouse pointer or touchpad over an augmented image the active image the client code or the web browser generates an intelligent tag request and transmits the request to the augmentation server . The request indicates the mouse over user activity to the augmentation server . The request may contain information that uniquely identifies the active image e.g. an image identifier such as an URL and or other information such as associated advertisement types.

The augmentation server determines an advertisement relevant to the active image for the received request based on keywords associated with the active image. The augmentation server extracts the image identifier from the request and retrieves corresponding keywords and or other information e.g. image size or advertisement type for the active image from the database . The augmentation server determines an advertisement related to the retrieved keywords by searching for the advertisement in an advertisement database using retrieved keywords. In one embodiment the augmentation server identifies the advertisement that matches the best e.g. matching the most number of keywords or matching the most important keywords as the relevant advertisement. In one embodiment the augmentation server only searches for advertisements that match the advertisement type and or other requirements associated with the active image e.g. image size .

In one embodiment the augmentation server generates computer code hereinafter called the advertisement code to facilitate user interaction with the advertisement. Similar to the client code the advertisement code can be in any computer language such as JavaScript. For example the advertisement code may overlay the active image with an advertisement banner and displays the advertisement in a popup box when the user moves a pointer over the banner. The advertisement code may also make the advertisement clickable through to the advertiser s destination page. In addition if the advertisement contains video the advertisement code may overlay the active image with a video player with video controls e.g. forward rewind play pause volume etc. .

The augmentation server transmits the relevant advertisement to the client computer for display. In one embodiment the augmentation server retrieves the advertisement from a database hosting the advertisement e.g. the advertising database and transmits it to the client web browser or the client computer for display. Alternatively the augmentation server may transmits a reference of the advertisement e.g. its URL to the client web browser for retrieval. The augmentation server also transmits the generated advertisement code to the client web browser.

In one embodiment the client web browser displays the relevant advertisement proximate to the active image as an in image overlay. As noted above the augmentation server may augment images or other visual elements with rich media content. Examples of the rich media content include search mechanisms videos and interactive advertisements. In one embodiment the client web browser overlays a banner on the active image with information about the accompanying rich media content. The banner may include a hook icon that relates to the type of rich media content being shown. For example the hook icon for search mechanisms is a magnifying glass the hook icon for video displays is a video control such as a play button and the hook icon for shopping advertisements is a shopping cart icon and the hook icon for all other types of rich media content can be an arrow icon. When a user moves a mouse over the hook icon a popup box will be displayed proximate to the position where the mouse over is occurring. The rich media content e.g. the relevant advertisement is displayed in the popup box. The popup box may integrate controls to the users. For example if rich media such as video is served the JavaScript code may integrate in rich media controls e.g. forward rewind play pause volume etc. . It is noted that in alternate embodiments the rich media can be immediately played in response to mouse over within close proximity to the banner and or the popup box. The overlaid banner and popup box may be generated or otherwise controlled by the advertisement code or the client code.

In one embodiment the displayed rich media content is a search mechanism with a search box for users to enter query terms. For user s convenience the search mechanism may pre enter relevant search terms in the search box. The pre entered search terms may include keywords identified for the active image keywords extracted from tags of the active image or areas of interest. In one embodiment the search mechanism may provide a set of rules hereinafter called display modifiers for extracting search terms from tags and areas of interest. For example where the image e.g. ALT tag of the active image contains a subject of the image plus review the display modifier may remove the term review before placing content of the image tag in the search box.

The augmentation server tracks the received requests and or the advertisement displays. These activities may be logged in the database or reported to another device or person e.g. via email .

The methods described above with respect to are illustrated below in an example together with accompanying through .

Initially the augmentation server retrieves a web page for augmenting embedded media content. The web page may contain media content of any subject such as a photo of a new car e.g. BMW an image of a landscape oil painting. As shown in the web page is retrieved from website people.com and contains information about popular culture singer Vanessa Hudgens.

The augmentation server analyzes the web page for qualified images. As shown in there are several images in the web page such as images through . The augmentation server determines that images through do not have the required minimum width and or height and therefore are not qualified images. The augmentation server further determines that image is an advertisement and therefore not qualified. The augmentation server identifies the image a photo of Vanessa Hudgens as a qualified image.

The augmentation server contextualizes the qualified image . The augmentation server examines tags and text associated with the image and determines that the subject of the image is Vanessa Hudgens. For example the augmentation server may analyze the descriptive content titled Fan Club that is to the right of the image to determine that the image is about Vanessa Hudgens.

The augmentation server augments the web page by generating an intelligent tag that uniquely identifies the image and integrating the intelligent tag in the web page . For purposes of clarity the augmented web page is referred to as web page as illustrated in through . The augmentation server also includes in the augmented web page JavaScript code that captures user interaction with the image .

After the web page is augmented a web browser running on a client computer can now retrieve the augmented web page and display it to a user e.g. responding to the user entering www.people.com in the address bar of the web browser . illustrates a screenshot of the augmented web page as displayed on an Internet Explorer web browser after it is retrieved by the browser. It is noted that the augmented web page is displayed in the same manner as the original web page would be displayed in the web browser.

Subsequently a user may move a pointer e.g. controlled by a mouse stylus or touchpad over the image . This user action is also referred to as a mouse over. Detecting the mouse over the embedded JavaScript code in the augmented web page or the web browser generates an intelligent tag request uniquely identifying the image and transmits the request to the augmentation server . The augmentation server receives the request and retrieves stored context and subject information e.g. Vanessa Hudgens of the image and searches in an advertising database for related advertisements or rich media content. The augmentation server transmits the related advertisement s and or rich media content s back to the web browser for display.

The web browser displays the received advertisement s or rich media content as an overlay in proximity to the image . As illustrated in the user has moved a mouse pointer to the right lower corner of the image . The web browser receives an interactive banner that reads Related information to Vanessa Hudgens and overlays it on the bottom of the image proximate to the pointer. Also displayed on the banner is a tool tip icon the arrow icon through which the user can launch a toolbox or popup box for additional rich media content.

As illustrated in when the user moves the mouse pointer over or clicks the tool tip icon the web browser overlays a toolbox above the banner displaying an interactive advertisement for a movie stared by Vanessa Hudgens High School Musical 2. As indicated in the advertisement the user may interact with the advertisement by a mouse over the image of the High School Musical 2.

As described above the augmentation server may transmit other types of rich media content to be overlaid on the image . For example the rich media content may be retail or shopping related rich content. As illustrated in the augmentation server may transmits a banner with shopping related information for the web browser to overlay on the image . The banner reads Shop for Entertainment Center and has a tool tip icon in the shape of a shopping cart. A subsequent mouse over to the shopping cart or the banner generates an overlay for a retail site where an entertainment center may be purchased as illustrated in .

Similarly the augmentation server may augment the image with video or animation . As illustrated in the augmentation server may transmit a banner that reads Find more videos related to Jason Bourne for overlay. Thereafter on a mouse over user action the web browser may overlay a video player playing a Jason Bourne s video as illustrated in . As shown the overlaid video player includes video controls such as forward rewind play pause and or volume for the user to exercise control over the video being played.

The augmentation server may also integrate functional resources such as web searches in still images as illustrated in and . In the augmentation server transmits a toolbar that reads Search the web for info related to David Beckham for overlay. Upon a mouse over the web browser launches a search tool overlaying the image as illustrated in . It is noted that the toolbar and the search tool includes the phrase David Beckham. In one embodiment the included phrase is related to the context and or subject of the image .

In one embodiment the augmentation server delivers rich media content without augmenting web pages ahead of time. The augmentation server or other entities may install a plug in module in the client web browser. The plug in module monitors the client s browsing activity and transmits related information e.g. the URL of the displayed web page to the augmentation server in real time or on the fly . The augmentation server may retrieve the web page and analyze it for qualified images and related keywords. The augmentation server may transmit the information e.g. identity of the qualified images or the related keywords to the client web browser. If the user mouse over one of the qualified images the active image the plug in module sends a signal to the augmentation server identifying the active image. The augmentation server may determine and transmit a relevant advertisement to the client web browser for display in a manner similar to the one described above with respect to .

In one embodiment the web pages can be augmented on the client side e.g. via plug in modules in the client web browser in a manner similar to the one described above with respect to .

One of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that the described system and method are not limited to augmenting still images in web pages with advertisements and can be applied to augment any types of visual elements in any types of documents with any types of rich media content. Examples and detailed descriptions of an approach to augment keywords on web pages with relevant additional information are provided in U.S. Pat. No. 7 257 585 the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Advantages of the disclosed embodiments include providing content providers with additional channels for delivering relevant advertisements and other augmented data to viewers. Because the augmented data is displayed as an overlay of the current web page the disclosed embodiments in essence establish a third dimension to present information the first and second dimensions being the length and width of the web page enabling viewers to access additional rich media content without leaving the current web page. This feature is especially useful for devices with limited screen space such as mobile computing devices e.g. handheld computers . The disclosed embodiments also enhance viewers web browsing experience by providing rich media overlays without the need to leave their current web page. In addition the disclosed embodiments provide additional rich media content on a web page without requiring a media player at a fixed location on the web page.
