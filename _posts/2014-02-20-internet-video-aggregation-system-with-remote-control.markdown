No. 13 717 597 is a continuation in part of application Ser. No. 13 469 717 which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 460 305 filed Apr. 30 2012 which is a continuation of PCT US2012 35854 filed Apr. 30 2012 and a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 296 183 filed Nov. 14 2011 which is related by priority to Australian Application No. 2011202182 and PCT US2011 034653 and all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

This application relates in general to creation of and presentation of selective digital service feeds and but not by way of limitation to creation of and presentation of selective digital service feeds comprising primarily or exclusively video and video related content.

There are many services available to users through the use of the Internet including websites other Internet sites publishing services media services data services information services electronic commerce services electronic transaction services payment services software and content download services communications services other remotely accessed sites and services and other digital sites centers destinations or systems whether shared or dedicated public or private institutional or personal fixed or mobile wired or wireless and whether accessed through a browser mini browser embedded browser application other software program or other interface. Examples of popular Internet services in widespread use today include but are not limited to content websites that may include primarily video or audio content primarily text and graphics including photographs content or a mixture of several content and media types including websites such as CNN.com Politico.com HuffingtonPost.com NYTimes.com and others video publishing websites such as YouTube DailyMotion Metacafe and others entertainment content services such as Netflix Pandora Hulu Zynga social networking sites such as Facebook Twitter and MySpace and many others.

Digital content provided by Internet services can include any of all of or any combination of proprietary content exclusively or non exclusively licensed content syndicated content member provided content user provided content system generated content messages or emails from one or more users to one or more other users social content comments ratings embedded links to other digital content tags maps locations time and date content user identifiers source identifiers and other related or unrelated content. The hyperlinked structure of the World Wide Web and the Hypertext Transfer Protocol the advanced capabilities of modern web browsers the ability built into an increasing range of modern user devices to execute programs the flexibility inherent in application software developed and delivered to user devices the rise of common platforms that support both broadly deployed and more narrowly focused functionality across many discrete Internet services and the ability to stream data and content from to and among users and Internet services in realtime or near realtime individually and collectively have increasingly allowed Internet services to create content and data feeds that are simple complex or compound and include as many or as few diverse components as is desired.

A user may use more than one Internet service sequentially concurrently or simultaneously may use different Internet services with different degrees of interest intensity frequency sophistication depth of knowledge of the service and or skill and may vary her selection and mix of services from time to time or over time according to tasks and interests because of the Internet service choices of others according to her choice of device at the moment or over time or for other reasons.

Users increasingly use devices other than or in addition to browser equipped personal computers to access Internet services including SMS capable and other mobile phones web equipped mobile phones smartphones Internet ready television sets digital set top boxes DVD and Blu Ray players digital video recorders videogame consoles tablets such as the iPad and other devices. These devices exhibit a wide array of form factors memory storage displays output interfaces user input interfaces and devices and other peripherals and components. Users may have preferences and habits that influence or determine the choice of a device for a given purpose for a given time and place or for a given mode of use because of or regardless of such device aspects.

There are numerous standards available for use in browsers browser equipped personal computers and the numerous other devices used by users to access Internet services. These standards are sometimes deployed in mass production products before being finally determined at different times for different products in heterogeneous technical implementations and with varying degrees of completeness they often evolve over time at times discontinuously and they fluctuate in popularity. As a result devices are not always technically uniform and not all such standards are supported by all device and component providers. For example some browsers support HTML5 and some browsers do not different HTML5 ready browsers support different media standards e.g. when rendering content identified with the tag some support H.264 whereas others support WebM or another video codec some devices support Adobe Flash while some devices do not e.g. Apple iPhone and iPad do not or one set top box may support MPEG2 video but not H.264 video whereas another may support both and a third may support just H.264. In addition there are diverse content security schemes deployed across devices including proprietary encryption schemes consortia based encryption schemes and other encryption schemes and there are diverse rights management and user authentication schemes including consortia based schemes such as Ultraviolet and vendor proprietary schemes such as Disney Keychest and Apple iTunes .

As the variety and capability of devices available to users have increased and as user behavior has evolved in response to new devices and capabilities content company strategies have also evolved. Aspects of evolving content company strategies include blocking some or all devices from accessing some or all content modifying or customizing technical versions of content available on some or all devices modifying or customizing editorial versions of content available on some or all devices modifying or customizing advertising sponsorships or other promotional aspects presented in conjunction with content accessed via some or all devices making content available on different devices with different access prices terms user rights and privileges and other conditions and many other strategy variations. Content company strategies and aspects of strategies commonly vary from device to device from content company to content company on a given device and from one geography to another. For example in the United States ABC Disney makes most ABC network television shows available on broadcast television with commercials online with commercials and online for download via Apple iTunes without commercials but at a charge per episode but blocks the availability of these shows on GoogleTV while at the same time it makes most Disney network television shows available on broadcast television without commercials online with commercials and online for download via iTunes without commercials but at a charge per episode and blocks the availability of these shows on GoogleTV .

Most Internet services operate legitimately. Legitimate Internet services may properly obtain rights to content through licensing syndication fair use government permission or other legitimate methods or may produce content of their own or may pursue a combination of these and other methods. Some Internet services however are less concerned about obtaining proper rights to content and may rely on their users to have obtained rights may rely on actual or alleged legal safe harbor provisions or may pay little or no attention to rights questions. The problem of intellectual property piracy has increased as user Internet use has increased.

In one embodiment methods and systems for presentation of content through an interface to provide personalized video feeds to a user are disclosed. A user s interaction with Internet services automatically generates services preferences indicating a media entity. That media entity is correlated to one or more feed items or feeds.

Referring first to a primary embodiment is shown that includes an Internet system that aggregates two or more Internet service feeds . shows a block diagram of the Internet system without showing the Internet or other network that couples the various blocks together. shows a functional diagram of various feeds and filters that operate to convert service feeds into selective feeds . Only a single selective feed and a single user is shown but it is to be understood that there are many different selective feeds for many different users supported by the Internet system . An aggregation system selectively and optionally narrows the aggregate of the service feeds into one or more selective feeds and presents the selective feed s to a user viewing with a rendering system device agent at a user location . In this disclosure the singular and plural terms selective feed and selective feeds are used interchangeably for convenience clarity and readability to mean one or more selective feeds and should be interpreted accordingly. In the primary embodiment a selective feed is created from the aggregate of service feeds by including only items from the aggregate of service feeds which are contain refer to or otherwise indicate video content. This creates a condensed and video specific selective feed from the aggregate of service feeds . The Internet services are generally operated by third parties e.g. websites Facebook YouTube Twitter .

In other embodiments a selective feed is created by selecting meaning to include and or exclude items which are contain refer to or otherwise indicate one or more media types other than video or in addition to video is created from a single Internet service feed by selecting items which are contain refer to or otherwise indicate video content is created from a single Internet service feed by selecting items which are contain refer to or otherwise indicate one or more media types other than video or in addition to video is created from a single Internet service feed or from an aggregate of more than one Internet service feed by selectively narrowing the single service feed or aggregate of service feeds i.e. an aggregate feed by selecting items which are contain refer to or otherwise indicate video content and based on one or more other criteria including user Internet service user within Internet service source user within source user ratings or rankings user comments keywords tags user tags topic category language other content indicators length format and or codec fidelity such as standard definition 720 p 1080 p time and or date device or location is created from a single service feed or from an aggregate feed by selectively narrowing the single feed or aggregate feed by selecting items which are contain refer to or otherwise indicate one or more media types other than video or in addition to video and based on one or more other criteria including user Internet service user within Internet service source user within source user ratings or rankings user comments keywords tags user tags topic category language other content indicators length format and or codec fidelity such as standard definition 720 p 1080 p time and or date device or location respectively optionally through use of a first stage filter and or a second stage filter or is created from a single service feed or from an aggregate feed by selectively narrowing the single service feed or aggregate feed by selecting items based on other similar or dissimilar criteria respectively optionally through use of a first stage filter and or a second stage filter .

In the primary embodiment the user configures which service feeds will be aggregated as the basis for her selective feed s and supplies whatever credentials are required in order to enable the aggregation system to collect the configured service feeds . The selective feed is produced from one or more service feeds with optional first stage filtering that are collected into an aggregate feed that may have an optional second stage filter . Some feeds may be specific to her for example her Twitter service feed which although it may comprise the Twitter messages tweets of many Twitter users will contain only those of the feeds that she follows or her email service feed inbound email messages in many such cases the ability of the aggregation system to access these service feeds will depend on the user supplying her credentials typically her username and password for the aggregation system to use. In the primary embodiment a user can provide access credentials for other Internet services either permanently allowing the aggregation system to store the credentials or temporarily the aggregation system uses the credentials for the current session but does not store them or stores them temporarily and can revoke access in effect disconnecting a given service feed from the aggregation system . Other service feeds may be freely available service feeds such as published service feeds for example a YouTube channel or the RSS feed of a website service feeds such as these often will not require any credentials. In the primary embodiment these service feeds can be configured or de configured even though there may be no access credentials required to access or to revoke these service feeds . Other service feeds may be created by or made available to the aggregation system by querying one or more websites or other publicly available or privately available Internet content sources or services .

In the primary embodiment a user creates a username and password or uses other credentials she has created such as her Facebook username and password via Facebook Connect or that are available to her such as her employer assigned username password or other credentials or such as system created credentials including credentials that precisely loosely approximately or otherwise identify her or associate her with one or more services or resources to access and control her selective feed configure and reconfigure the service feeds that will be aggregated to create her selective feed connect and configure rendering systems and perform other control and configuration functions . In other embodiments a user can use other access credentials or methods or is required to use no access credentials or methods to access or to control some or all aspects of her selective feed through the aggregation system .

As described previously in the primary embodiment some service feeds which will be included in the aggregation of feeds as the basis for a user s selective feed such as Twitter service feeds or service feeds from email accounts may consist in part or entirely of items that can be identified to particular users or other sub entities within the overall service feed for example a Twitter service feed comprises messages that can normally be identified with one or more particular Twitter users Twitter accounts and or Twitter lists. In addition feed items from a service feed which will be included in the aggregate feed as the basis for a user s selective feed may have other optional or mandatory attributes for example messages in an email service feed may have a priority flag a spam flag or one or more other attributes. In an optional aspect of the preferred embodiment a user can further configure a specific service feed which will be aggregated as the basis for a user s selective feed to include or exclude feed items from aggregation into the basis for the user s selective feed based on the user account list entity or other attribute or characteristic of items in the Internet service feed .

In the primary embodiment the aggregation system is implemented as an Internet service and supports two or more users. Accordingly in the primary embodiment the aggregation system collects service feeds as configured for each one of the multiple users of the aggregation system and selectively narrows the aggregate feeds and or video sharing feeds into one or more selective feeds for each user . In other embodiments the system is implemented as an Internet aggregation system that supports only one user is implemented as software deployed on one or more user devices or rendering systems and supporting one or more users of those devices is implemented as software deployed in an Internet network supporting one or more users or is implemented as a feature of another Internet service .

With reference to another embodiment of a diagram showing creation of a selective feed . In this embodiment the selective feed is a function of a video sharing feed formulated by another user and an aggregate feed designed by the user . A second stage filter takes the aggregate feed and may select in or filter out certain parts of the aggregate feed based upon a criteria specified by the user. The selective feed could include any number of video sharing feeds for optionally combining with an aggregate feed . The user could avoid specifying an aggregate feed in other examples solely relying upon one or more video sharing feeds to create her selective feed .

In the primary embodiment some service feeds configured for aggregation may overlap e.g. if a popular celebrity is followed on Twitter by more than one user of the system in this case the service feed configured for aggregation is only obtained once and can be simultaneously synchronously asynchronously or discontinuously used or re used as the basis for the other users who also have configured that feed for aggregation. In this fashion the aggregation system of the primary embodiment is efficient in its use of resources and avoids duplicate or repetitive processing. Reuse may even be used where credentials are used by one user for a service feed that will be used for another user.

In other embodiments some or all of any overlapping service feeds configured for aggregation are obtained separately for some or all users that have configured that service feed for inclusion in their aggregate feeds . Where credentials are required service feeds could be kept separate and retrieved in duplicate from the Internet service . Separation could be done in some embodiments regardless of whether credentials are required.

In the primary embodiment optionally some service feeds that a user configures for aggregation can be provided by the Internet service individually for that user so that some or all users who have configured that service feed for inclusion in their aggregate feed receive personalized partially personalized unique partially unique or potentially unique selective feeds that are specific to them or that are created expressly for them. In the primary embodiment the user is identified via a user ID associated with the aggregate feed that she provides to the aggregation system and that the aggregation system passes to the Internet service of the service feed to be aggregated enabling that Internet service to configure and return or otherwise send a service feed customized for or attributable in whole or in part to that specific user . In this optional aspect of the primary embodiment the user also provides a password so that the user can be authenticated to the Internet service . In another embodiment a password is not required.

In other embodiments the user is identified by any of all of or any combination of a user ID with or without a password association with a specific device device identifier MAC address or other attribute or data element associated with a device association with a network address network identifier telephone number or other attribute or data element associated with a network association with content a set of content a pattern of content viewed a content access characteristic a set of content access characteristics or a pattern of content access characteristics association with a stored identifier such as an Internet browser cookie a Flash local shared object or a similar file association with a derived identifier such as a device fingerprint comprising one or more aspects of the user s device and or device software association with biometric information association with a usage pattern or characteristics or association through another method of identifying a user or a user s association with a feed provider.

In the primary embodiment while most service feeds configured for aggregation are service feeds additional feeds can optionally be configured for aggregation that provide data sound music or other information rather than video content to the aggregation system . This data or other information can be used by the aggregation system in the optional creation of algorithmically created filtered or alternatively sequenced feeds for example a data feed of a user s fantasy sports league rosters could be configured for aggregation and the aggregation system could then use the information it receives about the user s fantasy sports roster as a basis for identifying items for filtering items contained within in or alternatively sequencing the items in the user s selective feed in this optional embodiment if and as the provided data or other information changed the content of filtering of or sequencing of the items contained in the selective feed would change accordingly.

Referring next to a block diagram of an embodiment of an aggregation system is shown. There are various stores of information that may be in a database file system and or memory data structure specifically service feed items aggregate feed items selective feed items service credentials and feed filters . The information in the various stores can be combined into a single store or divided between a number of stores at a number of locations. The aggregation system includes application software running on one or more hardware servers in one or more locations.

The aggregation engine manages processing of information within the aggregation system. Service interfaces periodically check the various Internet services for new service feed items . Service credentials are stored when and if the service credentials are provided by users and used by the service interfaces where required by the Internet services . Service feed items are processed and stored. In some cases Service feed items can be pushed to the aggregation engine without the need to query for service feed items by the Internet services .

In another embodiment one or more Internet services send transmit or otherwise provide service feed items to the aggregation system accessing an Application Programming Interface API or other interface mechanism to provide feed items associated content metadata extracts or highlights and any other information related to the service feed or to individual service feed items in the service feed .

There can be first stage filters and second stage filters stored as feed filters . The feed processor performs standard filtering to find appropriate feed items but can also apply the first stage filters and second stage filters as specified by the users . The service feed items are organized by their source Internet service category sub category subject topic or topics tag or tags genre content rating reviewer rating popularity and or other factors. The aggregate feed items are an aggregation from multiple service feeds specified by a user after any feed filter is applied by the feed processor . The selective feed items are further filtered by the feed processor using any second stage filters .

Filters including first stage filters and second stage filters or other filters can be absolute or can be indicative of proportion or relative weight or degree or can combine both. Thus a filter applied to the aggregate or video sharing feeds of one user could completely block or always include inclusion in the selective feed or a subset of the selective feed those feed items matching the specified criteria whereas the filter applied to the feed of a second user could operate to reduce the number of such feed items but not completely block such feed items or operate to increase the proportion of such feed items but not always include such feed items in the selective feed or a subset of the selective feed of that second user and whereas the filter applied to the feed of a third user could operate to change the position or sequence of feed items matching the specified criteria in the selective feed or a subset of the selective feed of that third user. For example in a user interface such filters could be visually presented to a user as a slider bar where the far left position means always include the far right position means always exclude and positions between the far left and far right mean graduated degrees of inclusion importance or priority.

Once a service interface has found a Service feed item it is processed to determine included video or content link feed service source description of the video or content any reviews or rankings user comments related article s etc. In the various stages of processing all the information that comprises the service feed item need not be replicated. The aggregate feed can be a list of identifiers that specify which service feed items to include. Similarly the selective feed can be a list of the service feed items that have not been filtered out and are specified for inclusion for one or more users .

The user interacts with a user interface to configure the aggregation system . An account is created through the user interface where service feeds are specified filtering credentials etc. Additionally the user can authenticate herself with the aggregation system for example with a user name and password or with other credentials. Content pages are supplied through the user interface to display the selective feed items . The selective feed items can be organized by oldest items newest items most highly reviewed popularity unviewed items or any other criteria or combination of criteria. The user interface may be supplied by the aggregation system implemented in an application applet or app on the rendering system or divided in implementation between the aggregation system and rendering system in various embodiments.

With reference to a block diagram of an embodiment of an aggregation system is shown. This embodiment adds functionality over the embodiment of by adding capability to automatically determine and or configure service feeds that are based upon activities of users with Internet services . During normal use of Internet services users will view content like or thumbs up certain content persons channels products and other entities or may otherwise rank them for example with stars on a 5 star scale which are herein referred to as service preferences. A preference engine accesses service credentials previously entered by each of the users for the various Internet services that they use. These Internet services may or may not have feed items but can provide a source for one or more particular service preferences of a user .

Service preferences are gathered by the preference engine for analysis to determine one or more service feeds . Some embodiments might collect the service feeds into an aggregate feed . Optionally the preference engine maps a preference to service feed using a feed correlation index . Various policies are formulated with one or more records in the feed correlation index . For example liking a video about Oprah Winfrey could be mapped to a service feed based upon her tweets. In some cases the feed correlation index could map a service preference to an aggregate feed for example a preference toward Oprah Winfrey would be mapped to an aggregate feed formed from her tweets her web site and her network. Subsequent activity such as a thumbs down bad review or un liking could remove a service feed that was previously automatically added.

Certain presumptions are automatically made from the service preferences. In some cases there is not a service feed that exactly corresponds with a service preference. For example Rachel Maddow s Facebook page could be liked and a service feed MSNBC could be automatically subscribed to. Where there is little web accessible video available for a service preference a related service feed could be chosen. For example where a user views several videos on Richard Nixon a service feed for the Republican political party could be selected.

Algorithms can be used to determine if a service preference should result in a service feed being made into a channel or aggregated with other service feeds into an aggregate feed . Similar service feeds could automatically be grouped together according to a category stored in the feed correlation index . For example liking political videos from several candidates could automatically be grouped into an aggregate feed . The user can manually separate the service feeds or combine the service feeds in any way that the user likes.

Some embodiments use crowd sourcing to refine and formulate the feed correlation index . Where a service preference is determined several presumably related service feeds could be suggested. As users select those service feeds to add the feed correlation index could be updated to capture mapping that wasn t initially contemplated. As more and more users select related service feeds for a service preference the mapping will evolve over time to increase accuracy. For example views of the Bob Newhart Show may initially map to the CBS service feed but users could select a different service feed relating to drinking games. The alternative option could become the initial mapping or just an alternative selection presented to users .

The service preferences can be gathered from interactions at the aggregation system itself rather than Internet services . A user may interact with one or more videos that have a mapping in the feed correlation index . That interaction can cause a new service feed to automatically be added. For example an existing channel with feed items from a number of sources could have three videos liked that have in common a particular actor. The service feed for that actor or media entity could automatically be added if not already subscribed to.

This embodiment also includes an audit function coupled to the user interface . The audit function records all manual interaction between the user and the aggregation system . The audit function also records the service preferences gathered by the preference engine in interacting with the Internet services . Each audit record is time stamped to allow later reconstruction of an interaction time line.

In addition or alternatively in this embodiment service preferences could be used by the preference engine to populate order filter or otherwise influence the presentation of the aggregate feed or other feeds presented to the user . For example Liking a particular actor or comedian s Facebook page could promote feed items that feature that actor or comedian to a higher position within a selective feed to include only talk show appearances similarly indicating thumbs down on a particular product or manufacturer could filter feed items about that manufacturer from a feed filtered to include only product reviews.

In this embodiment expressed interests likes and dislikes specific to a particular user can be utilized by the aggregation system in selecting feeds that will be presented to the user and or in selecting ordering or otherwise presenting the items within feeds presented to the user .

A notification management system NMS is included in this embodiment. A particular user could have any number of rendering systems or devices that are used with the aggregation system . The user s account on the aggregation system can have messaging that is specific to a particular device or can be sent simultaneously to multiple devices associated with the user s account. Once a message is read on one device it can be marked as read or deleted on other devices through synchronization managed by the NMS . From the perspective of the user interaction with the messaging of the aggregation system is unified and consistent regardless of which device is used at a particular time.

A user index is included in this embodiment. The user index contains data about the users user interfaces and or devices . The user index is used to map a user to one or more devices and or one or more user interfaces . The user index contains information such as user IDs user interface specific identifiers device specific identifiers network addresses and or platforms used on devices . The aggregation engine queries the user index and passes information from the user index to the NMS so the NMS can transmit notifications to the user interfaces and or devices .

A reporting interface is also included in this embodiment. The aggregation system collects data about users individually and collectively. The reporting interface allows the aggregation system to report out the data about users to other systems such as search engines.

Referring next to a diagram of an embodiment illustrating the logical flow of feeds is shown. In this embodiment there are x service feeds y aggregate feeds and z selective feeds. The arrows show how service feeds are typically logically combined into aggregate feeds and optionally logically combined into selective feeds . For example a first service feed is the sole contributor to a first aggregate feed . The first third and fifth aggregate feeds are identified by the user to be combined into the first selective feed . In another example the third and fifth service feeds combine into the fourth aggregate feed before being the sole contributor to the fifth selective feed .

With reference to a diagram of an embodiment illustrating the flow of feeds is shown. This embodiment adds user defined filtering through first stage filters and second stage filters . These filters are in addition to standard filters that screen for feed items that are of a particular type for example video feed items are screened to exclude items that have no video. In one example the fifth service feed is provided to fourth and fifth aggregate feeds . A first stage filter on prior to the fifth aggregate feed may select for or screen out any Service feed items relating to a particular subject or with a particular characteristic for example HD video or with a keyword or tag of Charlie Sheen . In another example the second aggregate feed is provided to both the first and second selective feeds with only the second selective feed filtering the input aggregate feed items .

Referring next to a process for gathering feed items is shown for the primary embodiment. The depicted portion of the process begins in block where the service interfaces gather Service feed items . Any needed service credentials are used to get access to the service feeds . In block the service feeds chosen by the various users are gathered by the service interfaces . Each service feed could be checked periodically for new Service feed items . Processing is performed on the Service feed items in block .

Various users have subscribed to the various service feeds . In block the processed Service feed items are routed to the subscribed aggregate feeds . Any first stage filter specified by the user is performed on the Service feed items before they become part of the aggregate feed in block . The aggregate feed items are routed to selective feeds that have subscribed in block . Any second stage filter is applied on the selective feed items in block . The user periodically will access the aggregation system to view the selective feed through the user interface or the device .

With reference to a process that fixes the service feed is shown. The aggregation system determines whether an aggregate feed item from an aggregate feed is itself or references or includes within it video content and if the aggregate feed item is or does processes the aggregate feed item by any of some of or all of the following blocks depending on the requirements presented by the aggregate feed item from the service feed and executed in any order as determined by the requirements presented by the aggregate feed item . The depicted portion of the process begins in block where the aggregation engine identifies and categorizes the Service feed item and extracts available characteristics of the Service feed item e.g. any available identifying classifying temporal or system related characteristics of the Service feed item .

In block the aggregation engine determines whether the Service feed item has been previously processed and if it has how recently and in what context. Next it is determined whether a Service feed item is itself a video resource. The aggregation engine determines whether a Service feed item that is not a video resource is a web page RSS feed XML file or other data type that potentially contains within it URLs that are video resources or that iteratively require further processing in block . Embedded executable code contained within the resource is executed in block such as Javascript contained with a web page to obtain content that is normally activated within that resource by a browser or other software client s execution of such embedded executable code and further processes the content thereby obtained. In block it is determined whether a video resource URL or other resource URL is content or is a URL for an advertisement either video or non video and if it is a URL for an advertisement ignores it.

Optionally a module or function of the aggregation engine or a separate system or module associated with the aggregation engine may repetitively access execute download or otherwise activate all of or part of a service feed item web page web page element URL tag other tag embed code other content container or other content indicator identifying itself as a different user agent device type media player type or other component type and or within same identifying itself as having different functions capabilities connectivity characteristics or capacities at each such access execution download or activation in order to receive multiple alternative responses indicating alternative formats protocols structures policies or other characteristics that may be available. Where multiple such alternative responses are available the module or function of the aggregation engine or separate system or module associated with the aggregation engine may store some or all of the alternative responses and optionally some or all of the options associated with some or all of the accesses executions downloads or activations associated with the responses.

A URL in a Service feed item can be redirected and or rewritten when activated. In block it is determined whether a URL is a shortened URL and if it is issues an HTTP or other appropriately formatted request for that URL to obtain the actual base reference URL for further processing. It is determined whether the base reference URL has previously been processed in block and if it has determines whether a modification creation or expiration date parameter is associated with the base reference URL and if one is available determines whether it indicates that the resource identified by the base reference URL has been changed or has not been changed since the base reference URL was previously processed. Where the base reference URL was not previously processed the aggregation engine parses the surrounding resource to obtain metadata such as dates times proper names and other metadata that is potentially relevant to associated with or descriptive of the video resource in block . The aggregation engine optionally parses the surrounding resource to obtain user comments likes ratings and other user feedback or other content. The aggregation engine optionally associates data obtained from the surrounding resource with the base reference URL or base video object in order to aggregate data obtained from multiple surrounding resources in which a particular base reference URL or base video object appears.

Where a base reference URL is available for the URL such as may be the case for syndicated content the aggregation engine identifies whether a base reference video object is available for a video resource identified by a URL. In block a syndicated video resource that has not been previously stored is stored. Optionally one or more short highlights of the video object are extracted and stored in the current implementation of the primary embodiment a single 15 second highlighted is extracted and stored. Optionally the video resource the extracted highlight s or both all are transcoded or otherwise processed into one or more other formats codecs bitrates containers or forms. The aggregation engine stores and associates the data and objects obtained via this process keyed at least by the item processed and by the video resource as a service feed item in block .

In the primary embodiment the aggregation system optionally eliminates duplicate video items i.e. items that appear in more than one of the service feeds aggregated for one or more users while preserving the selective feed item s presence in any of the selective feeds or any of the filtered or narrowed views of any of the selective feeds . In the primary embodiment the user can also add a resource or item to the aggregation system so that the video will be included in the user s aggregate feeds and processed to derive the user s selective feed by providing the resource s URL embed code or other identifier to the aggregation system that item is processed as if it were an item obtained from a service feed .

In an optional aspect of the primary embodiment some Internet services are blocked by the aggregation system so that a user cannot configure such Internet service for aggregation cannot add an Internet item associated with that Internet service to the aggregation system or otherwise designate content from that Internet service for incorporation into the aggregation system this optional aspect of the primary embodiment can be configured to prevent the aggregation system from accessing and or incorporating content associated with or obtained from Internet services that have been identified as being Internet services that consist partially predominately or entirely of content that is undesirable prohibited illegal pirated unlicensed copied or otherwise objectionable. In another embodiment of this optional aspect some Internet services are blocked by the aggregation system for some users based on criteria associated with users or rendering devices or other criteria. In another embodiment of this optional aspect some or all Internet services are configured for content review and each feed item including related or associated content is inspected for a digital watermark digital fingerprint audio content match or other content match to determine whether the specific feed item and its related or associated content is permitted or blocked.

Referring next to an embodiment of a user interface to the aggregation system is shown. In the primary embodiment the user interface for a full screen as opposed to mini browser based user who is recognized by the aggregation system comprises a content navigation pane with navigational and other controls across the top of the screen a presentation of the user s selective feed running in a feed pane beneath the content navigation pane and down the left side of the screen an active item pane for video playback underneath the overall controls on the right side of the user interface an information display showing information i.e. title source and description about the video underneath the video window and a comment entry field and sharing controls beneath the information display.

In an optional aspect of the primary embodiment a user interface for a full screen browser based user is a video playback window embedded in a web page published by a party other than the primary embodiment aggregation system . The embedded user interface could also include a feed pane and or a content navigation pane . Other embodiments could include a feed pane that is overlaid or replaced by a video playback window when one selective feed item is chosen.

In another optional aspect of the primary embodiment one or more data elements or types related to each selective feed item is presented from some or all of the Internet services associated with the service feeds in which the selective feed item was found for example ratings comments likes shares or other such information about a selective feed item . In yet another optional aspect of the primary embodiment one or more data elements or types related to each selective feed item is consolidated from some or all of the Internet services associated with the service feeds in which the selective feed item was found for example likes or shares of a feed item are aggregated from multiple Internet services or ratings of a feed item are averaged or otherwise mathematically consolidated from multiple Internet services .

In another optional aspect of the primary embodiment the user interface and controls are adapted to the display characteristics and data input output capabilities of an Internet connected television with the video playing in the full screen or nearly the full screen of the television display with translucent information related to the video displayed over the video as the video playback window starts and then fading out after several seconds to provide unimpeded visual access to the video controls such as skip to the next video or bring up the selective feed are executed via pressing keys on the television remote. In some cases a playback manipulation control would overlay the video playback window translucently when temporal manipulation of playback is performed and fade away after manipulation.

In another optional aspect of the primary embodiment the user interface and controls are adapted to the display characteristics and data input output capabilities of an Internet connected smartphone or tablet with the video playback window playing in the full albeit in at least some cases physically small screen or nearly the full screen of the smartphone or tablet with information related to the video displayed over the video as the video starts and then fading out after several seconds to provide unimpeded visual access to the video controls such as skip to the next video or bring up the selective feed are executed via gestures made by touching the screen or by pressing keys on a soft keyboard invoked to appear on the screen or by pressing physical keys on the smartphone or tablet.

In another optional aspect of the primary embodiment the user interface is split between two display screens implemented as either two display screens embedded in a single device or as two separate devices. A first display screen could be a television with the video playback window being supplied by internal circuitry or a set top box. A second display screen would be used to provide the feedback pane content navigation pane content information playback manipulation control comment entry field sharing controls and or embedded link control . The second display screen could be an intelligent remote control a smart phone a PDA a personal computer a tablet computer etc. Communication could be directly from the second display screen to the first display screen or through an intermediary such as a set top box or through the aggregation system .

In another embodiment the interface comprises multiple columns of selective feed items all of which may be sorted according to the same criteria or some or all of which may be sorted according to separate criteria implemented as multiple feed panes or as multiple columns of information in a single feed pane . In this embodiment one or more feed panes would compress dissolve or fade shift to another position or otherwise visually give way to the active item pane when a selective feed item is selected for playback.

In the primary embodiment the selective feed is presented to the user in reverse chronological timeline sequence that is with the most recent item first e.g. at the top of a list of items as shown in . In other embodiments the selective feed is presented to the user in chronological timeline sequence in modified reverse chronological timeline sequence where selective feed items are grouped together the selective feed items within groups are presented in chronological timeline sequence and the groups are presented in reverse chronological timeline sequence in modified chronological timeline sequence where selective feed items are grouped together the selective feed items within groups are presented in reverse chronological timeline sequence and the groups are presented in chronological timeline sequence or in a sequence determined without regard to time order. Optionally the selective feed may also be presented in one or more filtered or alternative sequences for example any of all of or any combination of 

In the primary embodiment the videos are played sequentially in the order in which they are presented to the user in the selective feed and if the selective feed is presented in a filtered or narrowed ordered then in that filtered or narrowed sequence. Thus in the primary embodiment and on a full screen browser based user interface e.g. a PC the user can see the selective feed on the left in a feed pane which feed item is currently playing which feed item s recently played and which items are coming up for playback with the feed items arranged in the feed pane as a vertically rotating carousel. In the primary embodiment each item in the running selective feed presented on the left hand side feed pane of the screen portraying the user interface contains descriptive information about the item such as the title description source number of likes and shares optionally other rating information and optionally other information this enables the user to see such information about feed items not currently playing in the video playback window of the active item pane . The user can manually select feed items within the selective feed as presented typically by pointing and clicking on a feed item at which point the feed item begins playing in the video playback window of the active item pane which allows the user to directly access any feed item on demand and begin playback as the feed items are rotated through a list of the selective feed arranged in a vertical carousel within the feed pane . The user can also select the next sequential video in the list of the selective feed by clicking on a button or slider control that advances playback to the next feed item which stops playback of the current feed item and begins playback of the next feed item in sequence. At the conclusion of any feed item s playback when playback of that feed item reaches the end the next feed item in sequence automatically begins playback in one embodiment. Other embodiments could use a Play control to begin playback of the next feed item after the current feed item is done playing.

In an optional aspect of the primary embodiment automatic sequential playback continues indefinitely until the end of the selective feed is reached in this manner a very long continuous period of video content playback hours days weeks months limited only by the length of the history of the user s selective feed can in principle be offered to the user with as much or as little action and resulting control as the user desires. In another aspect of the primary embodiment automatic sequential playback is paused or stopped by the aggregation system after a predetermined point or range based on a number of videos played a total time amount of video played a time interval that has elapsed since the last user initiated action the age of an item in the user s selective feed or other criteria automatic sequential playback may then be resumed upon user initiation or if the user responds to a prompt or system request or dialogue.

In an optional aspect of the primary embodiment the user can perform one or more of the following actions for some or all of the feed items in her selective feed 

In an optional aspect of the primary embodiment the sequence of feed items upcoming in the user s selective feed shown in the feed pane is dynamically influenced changed or rearranged based on the user s actions as the aggregation system progresses through the selective feed as originally sequenced for the user in the vertical carousel. For example as previously described in the primary embodiment the sequence of the feed items in the selective feed is reverse chronological timeline sequence which in this optional aspect may be considered the original sequence of feed items as the aggregation system proceeds through the playback process and the user watches skips likes saves or shares items in the selective feed in this optional aspect of the primary embodiment the aggregation system dynamically adjusts the sequence of upcoming feed items in the user s selective feed to reflect these actions so that the user sees more items that share various characteristics with the feed items she has liked or shared or saved for later viewing or fewer items that share various characteristics with the feed items she has skipped or deleted or otherwise re sequences the upcoming feed items in the selective feed based on her actions. This process can be iteratively repeated based on the user s actions as the aggregation system progresses through the adjusted selective feed further adjusting the sequence of feed items then upcoming similarly based on the user s actions this process can be cancelled or reversed and the user s upcoming selective feed items reverted to the original sequence.

Referring next to the user interface in another embodiment comprises multiple columns rows or arrays of selective feed items Internet feed items keyword feed items aggregate feed items and or other feed items along with an array or multiple arrays of icons in the navigation pane typically displayed above the multiple columns rows or arrays of selective Internet service keyword aggregate and or other feed items hereinafter Feed Items alternatively displayed to the left of the multiple columns rows or arrays of Feed Items or alternatively displayed in another location. Each icon identifies one or more groups of Feed Items such as the selective feed items associated with one or more user accounts on one or more social networking services including the user s own account or another user or group of users or the selective feed items or Internet service feed items associated with one or more particular Internet services for example a news site such as CNN.com or a group of news sites selected by the user or the selective feed items associated with a particular keyword subject or topic such as a sports team or player or the selective feed items collected in an aggregate feed such as recommended items. In the depicted embodiment there are four feed panes that each display a column of selective feed items which is sometimes referred to as a channel or a smart channel herein.

Behind the user interface is a view carousel with three different views as shown in related in a hierarchical manner. The first view is not currently visible to the user through the user interface that displays a window of the view carousel corresponds to the highest level in the hierarchy and allows selecting from multiple selective feeds or other feeds some of which can be an aggregation of two or more selective feeds or other feeds into a smart channel. The first view is detailed in . The second view shows a particular selective feed or other feed in one feed pane with one video playing back in the active item pane . The second view is the part of the view carousel currently viewable through the user interface . The third view shows a full screen version of the video playing back. In this embodiment touch screen gestures move the view carousel for example a two finger touch will rotate the carousel. A single finger touch will move within the current view and not rotate the view carousel .

In this embodiment an icon in the content navigation pane corresponds to one or more columns rows or arrays of Feed Items and the icons are arranged in the same sequence as the columns rows or arrays of Feed Items optionally with more or less icons displayed at any time than columns rows or arrays of Feed Items displayed. The depicted embodiment arranges the selective feed items in a column of a feed pane as shown in . The sequence of icons rotatable about a channel carousel can be moved scrolled advanced retrieved or otherwise manipulated by gesture mouse action cursor control keyboard control voice command or other user interface control. Where all the icons can fit in the content navigation pane the channel carousel may or may not rotate for example in this embodiment the channel carousel only rotates when there are more icons than will fit in the content navigation pane . In a tablet computer embodiment a single touch gesture rotates the channel carousel . In an optional aspect of this embodiment an icon may be linked to a sub array of icons such that at some times when the icon appears the linked sub array of icons also appears e.g. in a drop down or slider tray and as the icon is moved to the edge of the view area of the channel carousel the sub array fades away or otherwise no longer appears.

When the sequence of icons on the channel carousel is moved scrolled advanced retrieved or otherwise manipulated the columns rows or arrays of Feed Items that are visible moves scrolls advances dissolves fades in or out is retrieved or is otherwise manipulated synchronously. Since the width of a feed pane may be different than that of an icon the channel carousel may spin faster or slower than the column carousel such that there may be a gearing ratio other than 1 to 1 between the two carousels . This aspect of the user interface enables a user to for example move the feed pane columns by moving the icon sequence for example by dragging and dropping and when more icons are displayed than columns are displayed gives the user broader visibility into more or all columns of selective feed items Feed Items that are available combined with detailed visibility into the selective feed items that are available in the displayed columns of Feed Items. A scroll control shows with a featured bar which icons have their corresponding feed panes displayed. The icon and feed pane that would be used if the view carousel is rotated is accentuated with a radio dial but other embodiments could highlight the feed pane or icon with bolding enhanced color animation or any other mechanism to inform the viewer the current focus if the view carousel is rotated. The elements may move synchronously such that moving a first element or array of elements causes a second element or array of elements to move while moving the second element or array of elements also causes the first element or array of elements to move or the elements may move asynchronously such that moving a first element or array of elements causes a second element or array of elements to move while moving the second element or array of elements does not cause the first element or array of elements to move or a combination of synchronous movement and asynchronous movement may be implemented.

Both the icons and feed panes are in a synchronized order and each rotate synchronously about carousels although the diameter of a column carousel is larger than the icon carousel . When the user rotates one carousel the other will rotate in a synchronized manner at a predetermined ratio of movement given the differing diameters between the two carousels . This aspect of the user interface also enables a user to rapidly move through all the columns of selective feed items Feed Items that are available for example to quickly and directly navigate to a specific desired column of selective feed items . The feature bar informs the user which feed panes are shown below and also what in the column carousel is visible. In the example of the first four icons are denoted by the feature bar to signal that the corresponding first through fourth selective feeds pane columns . The icon appears both in the content navigation pane and the corresponding feed panes in this embodiment.

Optionally in this embodiment an icon can be deleted from the icon carousel which optionally in turn causes the corresponding feed pane to be removed from view. Optionally in this embodiment the icons in the icon carousel can be reorganized reordered or resequenced by either or both the user or the aggregation system which optionally in turn causes the feed panes in the column carousel to be reorganized reordered or resequenced synchronously with the icon carousel .

Optionally in this embodiment icons in the icon carousel can be combined which optionally in turn causes the corresponding feed panes to be combined or an icon can be separated into multiple constituent parts through filtering which optionally in turn causes the corresponding columns of selective feed items Feed Items to be separated or both. Mixing and separation of icons causes corresponding rearranging of selective feed items Feed Items. Where two or more icons are combined a combined icon may be subdivided into panels that display the icons that are combined. For example the sixth icon combines two icons and the seventh icon combines four icons as shown in . shows the feed pane for sixth icon with selective feed items from both icons.

Alternatively in various embodiments the visual interface can comprise multiple columns rows or other arrays of selective feed items Feed Items along with an array comprising any of all of or any combination of buttons tabs badges keys labels numbers or other graphical elements in addition to or instead of icons any or all of which could be organized in one or more rows columns alignments or other arrays.

With reference to another embodiment of the first view is shown. In this embodiment the selective feed items Feed Items are arranged horizontally in a feed pane . The selective feed items Feed Items can be a list with beginning and end arranged chronologically or in some other manner. In other embodiments the selective feed items Feed Items can be arranged in a circular list as a carousel or in any other arrangement. In another optional aspect of this and other embodiments icons in the tiled icon may correlate to non feed items functions or aspects. The icon carousel is arranged vertically in this embodiment. The feed panes are arranged in a vertical feed carousel that rotates in synchronization with the icon carousel and the scroll control .

In this optional aspect of the primary embodiment this adjusted sequence can be presented continuously with or as part of or as the next part of the user s selective feed or can be presented as a separately labeled and separately selectable sequence of the user s selective feed . Adjustments to the user s upcoming sequence can be provided in real time or near real time as the user advances through or as automatic playback advances through the user s selective feed can be effected between sessions can be effected after a specified amount or type of amount of one or more types of user action has occurred can be effected after two or more user actions have occurred in sequence consecutively within a specified time period within a specified number of user actions in a particular order or in no particular order or otherwise have occurred or can be effected after a specified level of confidence in the applicability of the adjustment s is reached.

In another embodiment a first icon array set of feed items group of interface panes and or other collection of interface elements is presented in conjunction with a second coordinated icon array set of feed items group of interface panes and or other collection of interface elements and one or both of the first and or second array set group and or collection is logically and visually stacked. One potential benefit of stacking some or all of the interface elements is to effectively use limited display space for example on a smaller device such as a smartphone while still enabling easy access to all or most of the functions available on a device that has a larger display. In one embodiment of a stacked or partly stacked interface a first array of icons representing service feeds is arranged at the top of the presentation space in a horizontal array coupled with a stacked feed view beneath the icon array wherein a feed view is a vertically arranged set of images and text each of which correlates to a feed item and further wherein the feed view changes as the icon array is moved left and right or as a particular icon is selected and further wherein if an individual feed item is selected then the playback pane is stacked on top of the feed view and a video begins to play if the video is terminated the playback pane then slides down to reveal the feed view beneath it and if the user further slides the feed view down via an appropriate gesture or by dragging a toggle then the prior feed view is revealed beneath the current feed view or alternatively a directory of feeds for selection. In this embodiment the first icon array is scrollable left and right and that when there are more icons than will fit in the dimensions of the visible space individual icons can scroll off the visual field thus creating a usable space for the first icon array that is larger than the physical space available according to the dimensions of the display and similarly as feed views and playback panes are stacked one atop the other or atop a feed directory in this stacked fashion each such feed view playback pane feed directory pane or other interface element can utilize all of the space available beneath the first icon array and yet via the stacking of views and panes in coordination with the first icon array a large amount of usable information is maintained in a state readily accessible by the user including as the user manipulates the first icon array.

In an optional aspect of the primary and other embodiments an icon may be logically subdivided into areas each of which may control activate or indicate a subset of the Feed Items correlated to the icon . Areas can be reserved or prioritized for association with a particular Internet service can be rearranged once associated with a set of Internet services and can be labeled unlabeled or conditionally labeled for example the labels appear if the user zooms the view magnification or appear if the user taps the icon with three fingers. User actions can be associated with different combinations of areas of the icon for example tapping an area of the icon filters the Feed Items to just those associated with the correlated Feed Items. As an example icons on a smartphone might be large and might therefore contain several areas a particular icon might be the social icon which is correlated to the selective feeds and service feeds of Internet social networking services connected by the user the upper right corner or region of the tiled icon might be reserved for Facebook the lower right corner for Twitter and the other corners available for other social networking services if the user taps the word social in the user interface the selective feed of selective feed items from all connected social networking services appears along with a corresponding tiled icon that would be an aggregation of the selective feeds where as if the user taps a corner or region of the tiled icon the selective feed items of the associated social networking service appear. The tiled icon may optionally be configured programmatically by accessing a programming interface available on the device provided by a device related service provided by the aggregation system or a control system related to the aggregation system or provided by another service to connect to social networking services already connected by the user to the device device related service the aggregation system or a control system related to the aggregation system or another service.

In an optional aspect of the primary and other embodiments the contents and characteristics of an icon a tiled icon and or one or more correlated or uncorrelated Feed Items associated with a user are synchronized across one or more devices or interfaces used by or associated with the user . In this optional aspect of the primary embodiment when the user using one device or interface or the aggregation system changes adds or deletes feed to or from a tiled icon or changes adds or deletes a tiled icons that change addition or deletion is reflected subject to any further over riding rules or policies on the other devices or interfaces used by the user subject to any particular presentation which may be different in some or all respects of icons tiled icons which may apply on that device similarly when the user using one device or interface or the aggregation system reorganizes a tiled icon for example changing the sequence grouping or other characteristics of the feeds in the tiled icon that reorganization is reflected subject to any further over riding rules or policies on the other devices or interfaces used by the user subject to any particular presentation which may be different in some or all respects of icons and tiled icons which may apply on each other device . Synchronization of the icons and tiled icons may be complete or partial may apply to all or a subset of the icons and or tiled icons and may apply to all or a subset of the devices or interfaces used by or associated with the user for example a given icon or tiled icon may be designated as specific to a device or interface and therefore is not synchronized to any other device or interface another icon or tiled icon may be designated as specific to device categories e.g. smartphones televisions and therefore is synchronized from one device or interface within the category to all other devices or interfaces within that category but not to devices or interfaces that are not within that category and still other icons and or tiled icons may synchronize across all devices. Synchronization of icons and or tiled icons can be maintained across heterogeneous view carousels so that regardless of the particular view carousel in use on a given device or interface or in a given mode of operation the icons and or tiled icons update appropriately in the context of each view carousel . As the icons and or tiled icons are updated the Feed Items associated with the icons and or tiled icons will typically be similarly updated subject to any further over riding rules or policies on the other devices or interfaces used by the user and subject to any particular presentation which may be different in some or all respects of feed items which may apply on that device. Additionally irrespective of any change to the icons or tiled icons in this optional aspect of the primary embodiment when the user using one device or interface or the system changes the Feed Items for example adds or deletes or marks a Feed Item or changes the sequence or other characteristic s of one or more Feed Items that change is reflected subject to any further over riding rules or policies on the other devices or interfaces used by the user subject to any particular presentation which may apply on each other device. Such synchronized changes may be effected immediately at a point in time after a specified or remaining period of time or without regard to time. Additional rules and or policies may optionally be provided that over ride generally or selectively the automatic synchronization of the icons and or tiled icons for example a user or the system may specify particular icons that appear in any of all of or any combination of on one or more particular devices or interfaces but not on others at all times or at certain times in one viewing mode but not another or determined by other criteria. Synchronization may apply to some but not all aspects properties attributes or features of the contents and characteristics of icons tiled icons and or one or more correlated or uncorrelated Feed Items.

In an optional aspect of this embodiment icons and or tiled icons may appear on a device or in the interface temporarily for example because a user indicated while using an Internet service an interest in adding that service feed to her tiled icon or because an Internet service linked to the tiled icon or as a means of suggesting or recommending a selective feed to the user or for another reason. A temporary icon or tiled icon may expire based on a period of time usage time non usage time or other time based criteria or based on a count or sequence of actions action opportunities based on a count or sequence of actions inactions or events or based on other criteria or may never expire. A temporary icon or tiled icon may appear identical to or may appear different from its non temporary counterpart for example a temporary icon may optionally appear in a different color or size or in a different place or sequence or with a different visual intensity or with different iconography or with an indicator such as a mark or graphical element that conveys that it is temporary. A temporary icon or tiled icon may optionally also contain actionable indicators for example to reject or delete it or to accept or make it permanent or to accept for this device or interface or only. The Feed Items associated with a temporary icon and or tiled icon may be identified in the same manner as those associated with its non temporary counterpart or may be identified in a different manner for example by providing a particular set or a subset of Feed Items may appear conditionally for example based on a user action gesture or other condition or may not appear at all such that only the temporary icon or tiled icon appears.

In another optional aspect of this embodiment one or more icons tiled icons selective feeds Internet service feeds keyword feeds i.e. a feed with screened to include or exclude feed items based upon a topic keyword metadata tag etc. aggregate feeds and or other feeds hereinafter Feeds and or Feed Items associated with a user may conditionally or non conditionally be displayed on the user s device and or within an external interface element available on the user s device such as the operating system web browser another application or home screen other screen sub screen or area on a screen or other device facility. In this optional aspect of this embodiment instead of first installing and or initiating the app applet or application which then presents the icons tiled icons Feeds and or Feed Items associated with the user one of a subset of a composite of or all of the icons tiled icons Feeds and or Feed Items associated with the user are themselves visible on and accessible via the operating system web browser another application or home screen other screen sub screen or area on a screen or other device facility. Icons tiled icons Feeds and or Feed Items may be always be displayed or may be displayed conditionally such as when the user first powers on the device or selects the screen or other device facility in which the icons tiled icons Feeds and or Feed Items are embedded or upon the condition that the user has configured the device to display the icons tiled icons Feeds and or Feed Items in this fashion or upon the condition that there are new unseen items in one or more of the icons tiled icons and or Feeds. As an example in this optional aspect of this embodiment two different users having different tiled icons but otherwise having identically configured devices would each see a different home screen or other screen whereas in another embodiment where only the app applet or application presence is displayed on the home screen two different users having two different tiled icons but otherwise having identically configured devices would initially see the same app presence on their respective home screens or other screens and would only see a difference in their devices i.e. their different tiled icons once they had initiated the app applet or application. In this optional aspect of this embodiment the embedded icons tiled icons Feeds and or Feed Items may also be synchronized with icons tiled icons Feeds and or Feed Items associated with the user across any number of other devices as previously discussed and may include or not include temporary icons and or tiled icons associated with the user across other devices also as previously discussed.

In this optional aspect of this embodiment the integration of the user dependent graphical elements and user controls associated with the icons and or tiled icons can be achieved using any of all of or any combination of a device level programming interface an operating system programming interface an application level programming interface a system level programming interface at the system controlling the device interfaces the system controlling the icons and or tiled icons or both or a system to system programming interface where the system controlling the device communicates programmatically with the system controlling the icons and or tiled icons directly or through one or more intermediate systems. In a further optional aspect of this and other embodiments correlated or uncorrelated Feed Items may conditionally or non conditionally be displayed along with independently of and or without the icons and or tiled icons being displayed.

In an optional aspect of this and other embodiments touching dragging clicking activating or otherwise engaging with one or more of or the group of or a particular one of or subset of the displayed icons tiled icons and or Feed Items further causes the user s device and or an interface element available on the user s device such as the operating system web browser another application or other device facility to display one or more additional icons tiled icons Feed Items or feed item content with or without activating the user interface in its entirety. In this manner the displayed icons tiled icons and or Feed Items can be used to invoke the user interface or to further view content and selections without invoking the full interface. This limited interface could be a user configurable interface widget that could be placed on any of the four edges of the screen. As one example of the interface shown in displayed icons or tiled icons could appear as a single row of icons running along one edge of a smartphone or tablet home screen such that each user of the interface would have a personalized array of icons immediately available by pulling a tab without first invoking the full interface as shown with the tab not pulled in dragging the tab from right to left the displayed icons and tiled icons are shown in a rotating or scrolling column for the interface for a carousel that contains more icons than can be displayed in the area along one edge of the smartphone home screen as shown in further dragging the icons or tab in a direction perpendicular to the length of the column in the interface could reveal the feed item carrousel showing feed items associated with icons as shown in touching a Feed Item in one of the feed panes could invoke playback of the video all accomplished from the smartphone home screen without first invoking the full interface.

Referring next to another embodiment of the smartphone or tablet interface is shown with the channel carousel arranged horizontally to rotate right to left or vice versa. This limited interface could be configured by the user as an interface widget to occupy any horizontal region of the screen giving the option to be higher or lower on the screen. Selecting any icon would display the corresponding feed panes for some or all of the visible icons not shown as a horizontal carousel either above or below the channel carousel . Selection of a Feed Item in a feed pane would activate a video window not shown either above or below the channel carousel . In some embodiments the activation of the video window would fill the entire screen or at least obscure the channel carousel in whole or in part.

In an optional aspect of the primary and other embodiments some or all content objects including but not limited to channels feeds items icons icon arrays and other content objects automatically or upon user action or selection e.g. touching a button or other interface element gesturing pointing with a pointing device speaking a command etc can initiate the display of be transitioned into or cause the overlay by a customizable user interface area that can be controlled by the operator of the aggregation system by a system associated with the aggregation system by an Internet service associated with the content object from which the customizable user interface area was invoked by an Internet service separate from the Internet service associated with the content object from which the customizable user interface area was invoked and or separate from the aggregation system by the operator of the network to which the device is connected or by a service associated with the network to which the device is connected by the manufacturer of distributor of or other party associated with the device by another user or by another party. The customizable user interface area can occupy the entire display area or just one or more portions of it and can be opaque translucent or transparent. Content including text graphics video audio and other content and commands including executable code style sheets or similar formatting instructions and other control commands can be downloaded to the customizable user interface area when it is invoked in advance and stored on the device in response to user actions and interactions as invoked by other commands or as needed. Commands can be executed by the device by the user interface operating on the device or by a subsystem operating on the device such that the party controlling the customizable user interface area can determine the user experience within the customizable user interface area. In this fashion the customizable user interface area can be used by the operator of the aggregation system or other parties to supplement the content of a feed item feed icon array or other content object s . The customizable user interface area can be closed minimized dismissed or sent to the background or the session otherwise ended or terminated automatically at the conclusion of a session or content experience upon user action or selection upon another event under the control of downloaded commands remotely at the determination of the party controlling the customizable user interface area or under the control of the aggregation system or a system associated with the aggregation system .

Aspects of the customizable user interface area the commands that control it the content and other interfaces to it and the video display controls such as the video playback control that effect video playback within it can be normalized across a range of devices that may have substantially different technical requirements programming language and development environments capabilities for downloading executable code security and privacy policies and the like thus providing a single normalized interface across heterogeneous devices for extending the content experience on the device including under the control of various parties as disclosed.

As an example of an implementation of this optional aspect of the primary and other embodiments an Internet service could provide video feed items about sports some feed items could include a button labeled expanded view when the user touches the expanded view button a customizable user interface are could take over most of the visual display with a video playback window occupying the upper left three quarters of the customizable user interface area and the display space within the customizable user interface area to the right of the video playback window could display a vertically scrolling set of real time scores and statistics called from a server operated by the sports Internet service or the area to the right of the display space within the customizable user interface area to the right of the video playback window could display a set of titled thumbnails of related videos called from the sports Internet service or or the area to the right of the display space within the customizable user interface area to the right of the video playback window could display a set of titled thumbnails of related videos called from the operator of the aggregation system .

In an optional aspect of the primary and other embodiments the user can optionally select among multiple genre modes. Each genre mode comprises a combination of icons and or tiled icons and optionally further comprises a combination of correlated or uncorrelated Feed Items. When a genre mode is selected by the user only those icons and or tiled icons and optionally correlated or uncorrelated Feed Items that are associated with the selected genre are displayed by that interface while in the mode. Icons and or tiled icons and optionally correlated or uncorrelated Feed Items can be associated with only one more than one or a specified number of genres and or can have a degree of genre association which can be used to determine which of a user s particular set of icons and or tiled icons and optionally correlated or uncorrelated Feed Items should be associated with that genre for genre mode purposes or other purposes. Optionally a genre may contain or may contain only icons and or tiled icons Service feeds Service feed items and optionally correlated or uncorrelated Feed Items that are not contained in the user s selections e.g. a genre comprising only recommendations for inclusion in the user s selections or a genre containing some current selections and some recommendations for inclusion in the user s selections in either case optionally further limited to a subset of all possibilities in this mode the user can optionally choose if only their previously selected Feed Items are used for the genre filter or if their Feed Items can be supplemented or replaced by feed items that were not previously selected. Optionally the user can control which genres are available to her. Genres may comprise any attribute or basis for sorting filtering or selecting among icons and or tiled icons Service feeds Service feed items and optionally correlated or uncorrelated Feed Items including but not limited to category topic time viewing history length sources keywords content elements ratings popularity actor creator creation time or date and or other attributes. Genres could also comprise users or groups of users of a device . As an example of genre mode a user might have configured her system to offer her a choice of music movies fashion politics and sports as genres available to her in this example when she selects the music genre icons associated with the music genre or that contain feed items associated with the music genre would be displayed as a result her icons for particular musicians music blogs and music services would be displayed each with all associated feed items plus icons for her social networking services would be displayed each with all associated feed items that are also associated with the music genre e.g. her Twitter icon would be displayed along with items from her Twitter feed that are related to music. Continuing the example when she selects the politics genre a different set of icons would be displayed these icons associated with the politics genre or containing feed items associated with the politics genre as a result her icons for particular politicians or political commentators political parties and politics blogs would be displayed each with all associated feed items plus news services with feed items related to politics would be displayed each with all associated feed items that are also associated with the politics genre e.g. her CNN icon would be displayed along with items from her CNN feed that are related to politics plus icons for her social networking services would be displayed each with all associated feed items that are also associated with the politics genre e.g. her Twitter icon would be displayed along with items from her Twitter feed that are related to politics. Further genre modes can be contained within a given genre mode so for example the sports genre mode might further contain a basketball genre mode which might further contain a college basketball genre mode or the sports genre mode might contain both the basketball genre mode and the college basketball genre mode. As another example genre choices available to a user could be standard users and recommended. In this example when she selects standard mode she sees her normal set of icons and Feed Items when she selects users mode she sees a set of icons that all correlate to other users contained within her standard array of icons and service feeds including optionally individual users that do not appear separately in her standard mode and when she selects recommended mode she sees icons and Feed Items that do not appear in her standard mode view but that are recommended for her for inclusion at her option in her personal configuration.

This optional aspect of the primary and other embodiments may be further extended to incorporate one or more genre modes associated with particular contractual terms expected performance or content fidelity content availability on device content storage or other features associated with the device user s services network or network services content services or other aspects of the user s experience. As an example a genre mode could be associated with content services that are available only on a paid subscription basis. As another example a genre mode could be associated with feeds and feed items that are pre delivered to and or stored on the user s device. As another example a genre mode could be associated with feeds feed items data services and or other content services wherein the associated data transmissions are higher quality fidelity or bandwidth and or are not limited to a periodic ceiling or cap and or are not separately chargeable to the user on a metered basis and or are instead charged to the provider and or are accessed using a separate network service or sub service such as a separate billing account as an example such a genre mode might only be available to a user who subscribes to it and or pays a separate charge for it and or provides or agrees to the release of certain personal information as another example such a genre mode might be provided by the device manufacturer bundled with the device and might use a separate network service sub service account or other network facility to distinguish the data traffic for the bundled genre mode from the data traffic for other non bundled genre modes. Multiple such genre modes could be available to a given user each such genre mode associated with a particular configuration of contractual terms expected performance or content fidelity content availability on device content storage or other features associated with the user s device network services content services or other aspects of the user s experience. Within any such genre mode any given feed data service or other content service can be filtered so that it includes only feed items complying with the particular configuration of contractual terms expected performance or content fidelity content availability on device content storage or other features associated with the user s device network services content services or other aspects of the user s experience and noncomplying feed items are filtered out for example a feed from a social networking service that in its unfiltered state contains both complying and noncomplying feed items can be filtered so that only complying feed items are presented when that feed is selected within that genre mode while the unfiltered feed can be presented when the user accesses it outside of the genre mode.

In an alternative implementation of this aspect of the primary and other embodiments a feed feed item digital service or other content service associated with particular contractual terms expected performance or content fidelity content availability on device content storage or other features associated with the user s device network services content services or other aspects of the user s experience is indicated via a visual element associated with the icon representing such feed feed item digital service or other content service or associated with the feed item itself. For example an icon could be highlighted could be presented in outline shadow silhouette or reverse silhouette or could contain a small graphical element such as an exclamation point inside a circle of a particular color that is super imposed over or depicted near the icon for example over one particular corner. Multiple such visual elements could be available for a given icon or feed item each such visual element associated with a particular configuration of contractual terms expected performance or content fidelity content availability on device content storage or other features associated with the user s device network services content services or other aspects of the user s experience. Also note that such association can be accomplished via the absence of such a visual element or that such visual elements can indicate non conformance with or variance from an otherwise applicable configuration of contractual terms expected performance or content fidelity content availability on device content storage or other features associated with the user s device network services content services or other aspects of the user s experience. This alternative implementation could be implemented without along with or in direct or indirect combination with the genre mode implementations described previously. It should further be noted that a given feed feed item digital service or other content service may only be available when associated with may not be available when associated with or may be both available when associated with and separately available when not associated with particular contractual terms expected performance or content fidelity content availability on device content storage or other features associated with the user s device network services content services or other aspects of the user s experience and further that such associations may be consistent for all users devices locations networks and other connectivity and presentation conditions but may also vary from one user device location network or other connectivity or presentation condition to another.

Referring next to a block diagram shows an embodiment of a video content subscription system interfaced with a device and one or more Internet services . The video content subscription system allows a user to contract with a wireless mobile fixed wireless broadband or other network service provider to receive video content available on the Internet contracted video content that does not count against a data plan of the user . Some examples of mobile wireless service providers include AT T T Mobile and Verizon some examples of other data service providers include Clearwire Comcast and CenturyLink . The video content subscription system has one or more wireless and or data service components one or more genre mode proxy engines one or more billing systems and various stores of data that may be in a database file system and or a memory data structure including subscription records data usage records and one or more video content stores . The data in the various stores can be combined into a single store or divided between a number of stores at a number of locations.

A user subscribes to a genre mode or other video content service or plan by contracting with one or more wireless or data service providers an agent or partner of one or more wireless or data service providers or another contracting party and a record is recorded in the subscription records . When the user selects a feed item in a selective feed that includes contracted video content the device connects to the genre mode proxy engine through the wireless or data service or optionally through any other data service that the device is connected to and that is affiliated with or authorized or otherwise entitled by the wireless or data service via a separately resolvable link to the feed item that the aggregation engine or other link modification generation system has generated or modified to cause the request to be directed either directly or indirectly to the genre mode proxy engine . The device may optionally also provides credentials such as a user name device identifier access code or other authorizing data to the genre mode proxy engine the genre mode proxy engine may process the link without attempting to authorize the request or it may attempt to authorize the request by comparing the credentials from the device to the subscription records may evaluate network information such as an IP address or other network data information device information such as a device ID MAC address or other device information application identifying information such as the user agent or an application identifier or other data provided with the request to verify that the device is authorized to receive the contracted video content. Alternatively the link may be encoded by the aggregation engine or other link modification generation system so that it is encrypted or includes a token an expiration time or condition or other authorizing modification or aspect.

The wireless or data service optionally interacts with one or more billing systems . In this optional aspect of the embodiment the wireless or data service tracks data usage of the device that is on a wireless or data service data plan as the wireless or data service downloads and uploads data to and from the device . The billing system s receives data usage information from the wireless or data service . For example a user with a smartphone can contract with Verizon to pay a monthly fee in exchange for Verizon providing the user with the ability to send and receive two gigabytes of data per month using the smartphone. Verizon tracks how much data the user uses in a month and bills the user accordingly. The same user or another user may also contract with Clearwire for home Internet access and such plans may include a cap on the amount of data downloaded per month a rate limit on the speed of data transfer or other service parameter. If the user contracts only with Verizon or with Clearwire for an extended plan only the billing system for that provider needs to be updated with information about the user s referenced video data downloads alternatively if the user contracts with both Verizon and Clearwire for an extended plan or if Verizon and Clearwire honor each other s extended data plans then the user s experience will reflect availability of extended plan content and both Verizon and Clearwire s billing systems will need to be updated with information about the user s referenced video data downloads. Optionally in this optional aspect of the embodiment the billing system s may be supplemented with information about which content items downloads and or uploads are processed by the genre mode proxy engine under the extended plan contracted for by the subscriber.

The genre mode proxy engine has links to the sources of contracted video content available on the internet having received these links from either the aggregation engine the aggregation system or another content provisioning system which may work with the aggregation engine or separately from it or with the aggregation system or separately from it or with both the aggregation engine and the aggregation system . Using the source links to the contracted video content the genre mode proxy engine requests the contracted video content from an Internet service and transmits the contracted video content to the device through the wireless or data service . The source links may alternatively reference a technical optimization system or service such as one that provides properly encoded and or segmented video data files for a particular device as will be seen such technical optimization services can optionally be provided by an operator of the aggregation system by systems associated with the operator of the aggregation system by devices or software operating on devices or by other services. The genre mode proxy engine records an amount of data the genre mode proxy engine transmitted to the device and stores the amount of data the genre mode proxy engine transmitted to the device in the data usage records . The genre mode proxy engine may be located in the wireless or data service operator s infrastructure connected directly to the wireless or data service operator s infrastructure or connected indirectly such as via the Internet to the wireless or data service operator s infrastructure the genre mode proxy engine may be operated by the wireless or data service operator an affiliated wireless or data service operator by the operator of the aggregation system or by another organization also note that this embodiment is not limited to one wireless or data service operator but rather can incorporate two or more.

At a predetermined time or upon request the genre mode proxy engine provides to the billing system the amount of data the genre mode proxy engine transmitted to the device . The billing system can then deduct the amount of data the genre mode proxy engine transmitted to the device from a total amount of data the device used as recorded by the wireless data service or otherwise adjust or credit the data consumption associated with the device . Alternatively a record of the amount of data downloaded to the device that is associated with content subject to such an extended or optional plan can be collected and summarized by the device or by an application operating on the device either independently interfaced to or operating in conjunction with the billing system or by network elements operating within or collecting or processing data from the network infrastructure of the network services provider for example policy management service provisioning flow control and other network data management provisioning and operating systems for example by identifying data downloads originating at the proxy engine or at any of the original Internet services referenced directly or indirectly by links provided by the aggregation system .

When the genre mode proxy engine receives a request for contracted video content the genre mode proxy engine can optionally query the video content store to check whether the contracted video content requested is in the video content store . In this embodiment the video content store contains contracted video content from a third party and is optionally paid by the third party to store and deliver the contracted video content from the third party or alternatively the third party is paid by the operator of the video content store or subscription system for use of the contracted video content or both.

Referring next to an embodiment of a process for providing the contracted video content through a wireless or data service is shown. The depicted portion of the process begins in block when the video content subscription system receives a subscription request from a user for the device of the user to be registered to access the contracted video content the contracted video content being available on the Internet. After a device is registered to access the contracted video content the aggregation system reconfigures separately resolvable links of feed items to point to the genre mode proxy engine or alternatively provides properly configured links for example reconfiguration of links can occur when an Internet service contracts to be a source of content for all devices for specially contracted devices or both or by the aggregation system at a time that the referenced content is identified as actual or potential contracted video content. When a user selects to watch the contracted video content by selecting the feed item the device sends a request for the contracted video content to the genre mode proxy engine instead of directly to the Internet service . In block the genre mode proxy engine receives the request for the contracted video content.

In block the genre mode proxy engine receives links to the contracted video content which it delivers to the device if necessary retrieving the contracted video content from the Internet service one or more technical optimization services and or from the video content store . The genre mode proxy engine can receive distributed full or partial links to the contracted video content and correlations to sources for those links from the aggregation engine and or from the device or can calculate a source link using a predetermined algorithm or convention or an algorithm or convention it receives from the aggregation engine the device the Internet service another Internet service one or more technical optimization services and or from the video content store .

In block the genre mode proxy engine identifies a wireless or data service account associated with the device . Optionally in addition in block the genre mode proxy engine verifies the wireless or data service account is authorized to link to the contracted video content through the genre mode proxy engine .

In block the genre mode proxy engine can optionally check whether the video content store has the contracted video content by querying the video content store . If the video content store does not contain the contracted video content the genre mode proxy engine can determine to store the contracted video content block . For example the genre mode proxy engine can manage the video content store as a cache using a least recently used algorithm or other caching technique including with policies specified per item item type associated Internet service or other criteria to store some or all video items as they are retrieved and delivered and to decide what to delete or over write when the available storage has been used as another example after the genre mode proxy engine has received one hundred requests for a syndicated news video clip the genre mode proxy engine could determine to store the syndicated news video clip in the video content store .

If the contracted video content is not in the video content store then the genre mode proxy engine downloads the contracted video content from an Internet service from a technical optimization service or from another source as configured or determined. Whether the genre mode proxy engine retrieves the contracted video content from the video content store the Internet service a technical optimization service or from another source as configured or determined the genre mode proxy engine transmits the contracted video content to the device through the wireless or data service .

In block the genre mode proxy engine records an amount of data transmitted from the genre mode proxy engine to the device as well as related data such as the IP address and associated network information associated with the request from the device the time of day location information if available and other information. And in block the genre mode proxy engine reports to the billing system the amount of data transmitted from the genre mode proxy engine along with related and other data needed by the billing system .

An example of how the process for providing contracted video content through a wireless or data service could work includes a user that has a wireless or data service data plan that allows the user to use two gigabytes of data a month on a smartphone or other device for 150 per month creating a wireless or other data service account. The user also subscribes to a genre mode that includes a variety of news sources for an additional 10 per month such that when the user watches a video from one of the Internet services that is included in the news genre mode that the user has contracted for the data used in viewing that video does not count against the two gigabytes of data the user has in the wireless or data service data plan.

Continuing with this example the aggregation engine generates separately resolvable links of feed items that are included within the news genre mode so that the links refer to the genre mode proxy engine instead of directly to the related Internet service . If the user wanted to watch a news story about Libya on MSNBC.com the user would select a feed item relating to the news story about Libya and the device would access the link provided to it by the aggregation engine and would request the video from the genre mode proxy engine . The genre mode proxy engine would then request the video content item from a technical optimization service associated with the aggregation system which in turn would obtain the video item from MSNBC.com properly transcode and segment the video item and return a properly formatted video item to the genre mode proxy engine . In this example access to the genre mode proxy engine would be controlled by access to the link that refers to the genre mode proxy engine and no other authentication would be required. As the genre mode proxy engine transmits the news story about Libya to the device the genre mode proxy engine records how much data the genre mode proxy engine sends to the device . The genre mode proxy engine then reports to the billing system of the wireless or data service provider the amount of data the genre mode proxy engine transmitted to the device so that the billing system does not charge for the amount of data the genre mode proxy engine transmitted. This example demonstrates some of the complexities of operating the aggregation system in conjunction with some wireless or data service providers deploying genre mode proxy engines . For example if a first user shares a video item on an Internet service of which a second user is also a user but only one of the two users is a subscriber to a genre mode plan that encompasses that item then the link to the video item received by the user interface used by the first user will be different from the link received by the user interface used by the second user as one link will refer to the video item at its source Internet service while the other link will refer to the video item via the genre mode proxy engine . As more wireless or data service providers deploy genre mode proxy engines the number of disparate links that all refer to the same video item increases the aggregation system or a system associated with the aggregations system keeps track of the video links that reference a video item and is responsible for sending the correct such video link to each user the aggregation system is also responsible for providing a correct version of the link when a user shares the video item to an Internet service plays the video item on a different device that is not included within the genre mode subscription plan of the user for example on a device the user also owns that is serviced by a different wireless or data service provider and in other cases.

Referring next to an embodiment of a process for providing contracted video content through an aggregation system is shown. The depicted portion of the process for providing contracted video content through an aggregation system begins in block where the aggregation system through the user interface receives a subscription for providing contracted video content. In block the aggregation system authenticates the user and in block the aggregation system receives a device specific or premises specific identifier for the device the user is using. The aggregation system associates the device specific or premises specific identifier with a wireless or data service account in block . In block the aggregation system records that the user selected a feed item that linked to contracted video content. In block the aggregation system through the user interface records an amount of data used to provide the contracted video content. And in block the aggregation system reports to a wireless or data service provider the amount of data the device used to view the contracted video content. As previously discussed while a genre mode can optionally be comprised of particular content associated with a content category or other classification a genre mode can also be comprised of content that is associated with particular contractual terms expected performance or content fidelity content availability on device content storage or other features associated with the device user s services network or network services content services or other aspects of the user s experience. Consequently for clarity it should be noted that the genre mode proxy engine video content store billing system and the various stores of data including subscription records and data usage records are also not limited to particular content associated with a content category or other classification but rather may operate in conjunction with content that is associated partly or only with particular contractual terms expected performance or content fidelity content availability on device content storage or other features associated with the device user s services network or network services content services or other aspects of the user s experience.

The functions associated with the genre mode proxy engine the video content store the billing system and the various stores of data including subscription records and data usage records can be technically implemented through any of all of or any combination of execution as part of the user interface as part of software functionality on the device as part of the aggregation system as part of a system associated with the aggregation system as part of an Internet service associated with the aggregation system and or the user as part of or in conjunction with a content management system shared content management system or other system associated with a service feed as a standalone system or programming interface as a standalone Internet service through a programming interface or other digital interface of the device the operating system executing on the device or other software executing on the device through a programming interface or other digital interface available in conjunction with the network connected directly indirectly or through an intermediate network to the user device .

The visual representation of the genre modes available the selected genre mode and other genre mode related characteristics may optionally be implemented as an icon array of icons or sub array of icons as a separate indicator message pull down control keyword control or symbol conditionally indicated to the user or not indicated to the user . When more than one genre mode is available to the user the selected genre mode may be continuously periodically conditionally or partially synchronized or not synchronized from one device used by the user to another device used by the user .

In an optional aspect of the primary and other embodiments a user can optionally conditionally or non conditionally share or prohibit sharing of in real time near real time retrospectively or in aggregate some or all of her icons and or tiled icons other user interface elements components contents messages or characteristics or selection of genre or other mode and or correlated or uncorrelated Feed Items Feeds as well as associated actions user actions and responses to user actions with one or more other users of the aggregation system with one or more other users of another Internet service such as a social networking service or with one or more users of another service enabled by the user s device or by interconnection of the user s device with another system or service. Such sharing can be implemented automatically periodically continuously as a result of an action or selection by the user or another user or on another basis. For example a user could optionally share her tiled icons along with any Feed Item filtering with another user of the aggregation system so that the receiving user could see and at her option adopt some or all of the icons tiled icons icon combinations or icon configurations along with the correlated Feeds of the sharing user. Such sharing could be implemented by allowing the sharing user to send some or all of her icon configuration to the receiving user or by enabling the sharing user to publisher her icon configuration or a portion of it so that any other user can see and optionally adopt some or all of it or by enabling the receiving user to request and the sharing user to allow or not allow access to the sharing user s icon configuration or by any similar process. As another example a user could optionally share in real time or near real time with other users of the aggregation system or with other users of a social networking service each icon selection action that she takes such that other users would be notified of the icons tiled icons and or Feeds selected by the sharing user and optionally of the device the sharing user is using to access the aggregation system from moment to moment as the sharing user uses the aggregation system .

In addition a user can optionally conditionally or non conditionally allow or not allow in real time near real time retrospectively or in aggregate sharing to her of some or all of the icons tiled icons Feeds other user interface elements components contents messages or characteristics or selection of genre or other mode and or correlated or uncorrelated Feed Items as well as associated actions user actions and responses to user actions from one or more other users of the aggregation system from one or more other users of another Internet service such as a social networking service or from one or more users of another service enabled by the user s device or by interconnection of the user s device with another system or service.

In an optional aspect of the primary and other embodiments the operator of a digital service can optionally conditionally or non conditionally permit prohibit limit determine permitted accessing and or sharing devices services locations or modes or otherwise control access to and or sharing of in real time near real time retrospectively or in aggregate some or all of the icons and or tiled icons other user interface elements components contents messages or characteristics or selection of genre or other mode and or correlated or uncorrelated Feed Items Feeds as well as associated actions user actions and responses to user actions available to users of the digital service via the aggregation system and including inclusion of such in a directory of available feeds items or other content. As an example an operator of a digital service could prohibit any sharing of any user action permit sharing of all feed items with other users of its digital service and permit sharing of some feed items by its users with other users who are not users of the digital service while prohibiting such sharing of certain other feed items such controls can permit the operator of a digital service to control sharing alternatives available to its users for its content control the exposure of its users actions when interacting with its content and otherwise maintain a more controlled and or secure environment concerning its users and content within the broader aggregation system . Similarly visibility of and or the availability of a digital service s feeds feed items icons and or tiled icons other user interface elements components contents messages or characteristics or selection of genre or other mode and or correlated or uncorrelated Feed Items Feeds as well as associated actions user actions and responses to user actions or other content or digital service configuration information or indicators can be limited to only those users who have been authenticated to the digital service for example by providing user credentials such as a username and password for the digital service including authentication through a directory service an identification authority or through a similar user identification or registration function to the digital service or to related digital services. Upon authentication the digital service can return to the aggregation system the specific configuration of feeds feed items icons and or tiled icons other user interface elements or other content or digital service configuration information or indicators authorized for the user which can then be effected by the aggregation system subsequent modifications of the user s specific configuration can be communicated to and effected by the aggregation system and any subsequent expiration or revocation of the user s access to the digital service can be communicated to and effected by the aggregation system .

In the primary and other embodiments implementation configuration synchronization coordination management and sharing of icons and or groupings of icons and or tiled icons and or other user interface elements components contents messages or characteristics or genre or other mode and or correlated or uncorrelated Feed Items as well as associated actions user actions and responses to user actions can be implemented through any of all of or any combination of a direct data or programming interface between the user interface the user s device and or an interface element available on the user s device such as the operating system web browser another application or other device facility and the feed presentation interface operating on the device a data or programming interface between the visual user interface the user s device and or an interface element available on the user s device such as the operating system web browser another application or other device facility and the aggregation system or other control system associated with the aggregation system a data or programming interface between an intermediate system communicating directly or indirectly with the visual user interface the user s device and or an interface element available on the user s device such as the operating system web browser another application or other device facility and the feed presentation interface operating on the device a data or programming interface between an intermediate system communicating directly or indirectly with the user interface the user s device and or an interface element available on the user s device such as the operating system web browser another application or other device facility and the aggregation system or other control system associated with the aggregation system a data or programming interface communicating directly or indirectly between the aggregation system and an Internet service or another system or service a data or programming interface communicating directly or indirectly between the aggregation system and an Internet service or another system or service utilizing user access credentials to access the aggregation system the Internet service and or another system or service or another data or programming interface that communicates the contents of or information about the icons tiled icons and or other user interface elements components contents messages or characteristics or genre or other mode and or Feed Items or other information associated with one or more users of the device or user interface .

In an optional aspect of the primary embodiment the user has the option of selecting regular viewing mode which plays each video in the selective feed in full as presented that is plays the first video then plays the next video then plays the next video or can select a quick play viewing mode activated by a quick play control which plays one or more excerpts of each video rather than the full videos in scan sequence. In this optional aspect of the primary embodiment the excerpts may be of a specific length may be of selectable length by the user may be of a length selected by the aggregation system or may be of a length separately selected for each feed item by the aggregation system for each. In this optional aspect of the primary embodiment the user has the option of clicking on a play in full icon which then initiates playback of the full feed item from the beginning upon completion the aggregation system will stay in regular viewing mode of the active viewing pane for the next feed item in the user s selective feed or in another optional aspect of the primary embodiment the aggregation system will return to quick play viewing mode for the next feed item . When the user selects quick play viewing mode or alters the settings length of excerpt etc. of quick play viewing mode the presentation of the user s selective feed is filtered to include only those feed items for which the necessary excerpt s is are available thus presenting the user a selective feed that functions properly in this mode.

In another optional aspect of the primary embodiment content publishers and or Internet services may be offered the option of prohibiting quick play viewing mode or of specifying one or more excerpts to be presented in quick play viewing mode. If a content publisher has elected to prohibit quick play viewing mode when the user selects this viewing mode the presentation of the user s Feed is additionally filtered to include only those Feed Items for which the content publisher has not prohibited quick play viewing mode thus presenting the user a Feed that functions properly in this mode. If a content publisher has elected to specify one or more excerpts to be presented in quick play viewing mode when the user selects this mode the presentation of the user s Feed is additionally filtered to include only those Feed Items for which the specified excerpt matches the quick play viewing mode settings or alternatively the user s settings are overridden and the content publisher s selected excerpt is presented even though it does not meet the user s quick play viewing mode settings.

In another optional aspect of the primary embodiment content publishers may be offered the option of prohibiting quick play viewing mode on specific devices or specifying the excerpt to be used on a particular device in quick play viewing mode. If a content publisher has elected to prohibit quick play viewing mode on specific devices when the user selects quick play viewing the presentation of the user s Feed is additionally filtered to include only those Feed Items for which the content publisher has not prohibited quick play viewing mode on the device the user is using for playback thus presenting the user a Feed that functions properly in this mode. If a content publisher has elected to specify one or more excerpts to be presented in quick play viewing mode on a particular device when the user selects this mode the presentation of the user s Feed is additionally filtered to include only those Feed Items for which the content provider s specified excerpt for the device being used by the user matches the quick play viewing mode settings or alternatively the user s settings are overridden and the content publisher s selected excerpt for the device being used by the user is presented even though it does not meet the user s quick play viewing mode settings.

In the primary embodiment the Feed presented to the user may optionally be modified expanded or narrowed based on the capabilities of the device in use by the user to effectively render the video content that comprises is contained in is referred to by or is otherwise indicated by the Feed Items in the Feed. In the primary embodiment the ability to effectively render the video content is determined in absolute terms that is either the device can render it or the device cannot in another embodiment the ability to effectively render the video content is determined in qualitative terms such as based on how well the device can render the video content based on the relative quality of the video playback in the context of the device s overall capabilities or based on the relative quality of the video playback in the context of the particular user s or a typical user s normal usage of the device . In some embodiments the Internet service can specify a minimum quality of service such that their video is rendered at an adequate quality and if the user device is not capable of the specified minimum quality those Feed Items are removed hidden or disabled from the Feed.

In an optional aspect of the primary and other embodiments the device can notify the aggregation system when it receives a Feed Item that does not reference renderable video or that references video that renders poorly or that references video that is blocked or prohibited from playing or that otherwise does not play properly or with adequate quality of service QoS . The aggregation system can evaluate the notifications received from multiple devices including the number of notifications that have been received including optionally receiving just one notification the frequency with which the notifications are received the changes in velocity of the notifications the geographic network domain subdomain or other locations from which the notifications are received the format encoding bitrate or content attribute the device or devices class of device software or firmware version of the device from which the notifications are received or other factors associated with the notifications received and remove the Feed Item from the Feed of some or all users and optionally remove other related similar or otherwise correlated Feed Items from the Feed of some or all users . For example a Feed Item may stop rendering properly on a set top box device but render appropriately on tablet computers . For Feeds played on set top box devices the Feed Item would be removed or disabled but would remain in a Feed sent to a tablet computer . Where the players report problems that correlate to one of the above factors similarly situated users could have that Feed Item disabled. Additionally support personnel associated with the aggregation system could be notified so that the rendering failure could be corrected for example by contacting the provider of the service feed in which the Feed Item originated by updating or otherwise modifying the user interface by modifying the rendering system so that the affected Feed Item s can be properly viewed or by other corrective action. For example a service feed provider may change its video player software or video encoding techniques such that the Feed Items are no longer playable on the rendering system . Support personnel could correct the interface software that retrieves video from the service feed provider s Internet domain or from the service feed provider s feed to enable the video from the service feed provider to play correctly in the rendering system . Feed Items that were disabled could be re enabled after this correction is made and the previously unrenderable Feed Items were reprocessed and made available to the relevant Feeds.

In an optional aspect of the primary and other embodiments the aggregation system accesses multiple Internet services by accessing a single shared content management system. The aggregation system may use a single system level access technique such as a token sign in sequence shared secret key public key digital signature or other authorization technique to access the shared content management system or may use an individual system level access technique to access the shared content management system for each authorized Internet service associated with the shared content management system or may access the shared content management system without any system level access control. The aggregation system can use common access interface and processing steps and techniques for all Internet services associated with a particular shared content management system while still identifying the separate Internet services associated with the shared content management system and identifying and maintaining the association of Feed Items and other associated information such as metadata with the proper Internet service associated with the shared content management system. The aggregation system may similarly access multiple shared content management systems concurrently or sequentially. If a given Internet service is associated with more than one shared content management system the aggregation system can optionally maintain separation of the Feed Items and other associated information from some or all of the shared content management systems associated with the Internet service or can merge some or all of them into a single Feed of content and or associated information associated with the Internet service . If a given Internet service migrates from one shared content management system to another shared content management system the aggregations system can access the new shared content management system using any new required system level access techniques required and can optionally merge some or all of the Feed Items and other associated information into a single Feed of content and or associated information associated with the Internet service .

In an optional aspect of the primary and other embodiments the operator of the aggregation system or another service provider can provide any of some of all of or any combination of technical optimization digital advertising execution user activity reporting and synchronization with other applications for providers of content Feeds Internet services or other content data or services to the aggregation system .

Technical optimization digital advertising execution user activity reporting and synchronization with other applications can be technically implemented through any of all of or any combination of execution as part of the user interface as part of software functionality on the device as part of the aggregation system as part of a system associated with the aggregation system as part of an Internet service associated with the aggregation system and or the user as part of or in conjunction with a content management system shared content management system or other system associated with a service feed as a standalone system or programming interface as a standalone Internet service through a programming interface or other digital interface of the device the operating system executing on the device or other software executing on the device through a programming interface or other digital interface available in conjunction with the network connected directly indirectly or through an intermediate network to the user device .

In one implementation of this aspect of the primary and other embodiments technical optimization digital advertising execution and user activity reporting are provided by the operator of the aggregation system . In this implementation a service feed provider enables access to an XML feed of video content items as video service feed items are published or otherwise become available enables access to its digital advertising server enables access to an XML feed of its digital advertisements provides a configuration for its content delivery service and provides one or more reporting service URLs or beacons. The operator of the aggregation system receives the XML feed of video content items from the service feed provider encodes and or transcodes the video feed items into one or more suitable encoded file formats each at one or more bitrates preparing the video content for playback on some or all of the devices supported by the aggregation system where supported by the device and or expected delivery conditions segments the encoded files into one or more segment lengths suitable for some or all of the devices supported by the aggregation system and associates one or more Internet URLs or other content identifiers with each encoded file or segment. The operator of the aggregation system also receives the XML feed of advertisements and similarly prepares the advertisements for playback on some or all of the devices associated with the aggregations system . The operator of the aggregation system then provides in the feed sent to user devices appropriate URIs for that device manifests containing appropriate URIs for that device or alternatively intermediate URIs or manifests containing intermediate URIs that will lead through HTTP redirection or other similar techniques to appropriate URIs for that device . In this manner when a content item URI intermediate URI or manifest containing URIs or intermediate URIs is requested by the user it will be requested from the aggregation system or a system associated with the aggregation system rather than directly from the Internet service in addition a content item URI intermediate URI or manifest containing URIs or intermediate URIs can be associated with one or more data services providers or data storage or computing infrastructure providers for delegation of file transmission wherein the data services provider or data storage or computing infrastructure provider is associated with the Internet service feed item provider or related digital service and optionally wherein one or more URIs intermediate URIs or manifests containing URIs or intermediate URIs is configured by the aggregation system to identify the feed provider feed item provider or related digital service or its associated account to the data services provider or data storage or computing infrastructure provider and or to or to configure in advance in whole or in part the facilities to be used by the data services provider or data storage or computing infrastructure provider note also that such delegations can be made by the operator of the aggregation system among multiple data services provider or data storage or computing infrastructure providers associated with the Internet service feed item provider or related digital service and can be conditioned on the user the user s device network connection or location the selected genre mode in use by the user or any other aspect of the user s configuration or use of the user interface . For example the operator of the aggregation system can execute delegation of file transmission for a particular Internet service to one data services provider when the user is in a given genre mode and a different data services provider when the user is in a second genre mode. The operator of the aggregation system can operate systems that encode transcode and or segment files can utilize an outside service that encodes transcodes and or segments files or can utilize an outside service that provides URIs intermediate URIs manifests containing URIs and or manifests containing intermediate URIs that identify the content in a form appropriate for the device .

Continuing with this implementation a URI sent to the device can include or encode parameters associated with digital advertising management options processes or alternatives which can then be passed through to digital advertising servers or services either directly or after combination with other information or parameters. Alternatively the parameters can be retrieved from a file or table can be generated or can otherwise be determined. These parameters can influence or control the selection of advertising servers or services for some or all of the available advertising units the trafficking of advertisements into available advertising units or other aspects of the digital advertising process.

Continuing with this implementation before during after or in conjunctions with content selection or playback by the user the operator of the aggregation system or associated system can then issue a request to the advertising server or service identified by the Internet service receive in response a designation of which advertisement to insert before after or into or display in conjunction with the content during the content playback experience and can insert or display the correct advertisement at the correct position in a properly encoded and segmented form into the playback experience on behalf of the Internet service . The advertisement can be inserted by any of all of or any combination of the user interface the user s device by inserting URLs or intermediate URLs referencing the advertisement into manifests sent to the user s device by inserting manifests containing URLs or intermediate URLs referencing the advertisement into the sequence of manifests sent to the user s device or directly into the content sent to the user s device either at the time the content is requested or in a preparation step before the content is requested. At during after or in conjunction with the playback or display of the advertisement the operator of the aggregation system can then report completion of the advertisement playback or display to one or more advertising servers or services or other reporting servers or services identified by or associated with the Internet service on behalf of the Internet service . The operator of the aggregation system can also report progress through completion of and other analytical characteristics of the content video playback activity of the user to one or more reporting and or measurement servers or services identified by or associated with the Internet service on behalf of the Internet service .

This implementation can support multiple Internet services providing independent XML feeds of content items as they are published or available and XML feeds of advertisements utilizing different data services providers while also supporting multiple Internet services that use the same data services provider by identifying to the data services provider the applicable Internet service configuration or account associated with each file transmission storage encode optimization or other data service employing different advertising servers or services while also supporting multiple Internet services that use the same advertising servers or services by identifying to the advertising measurement server or service the Internet service on whose behalf the operator of the aggregation system is reporting and employing different reporting and or measurement servers or services while also supporting multiple Internet services using the same reporting and or measurement servers or services by identifying to the reporting and or measurement server or service the Internet service on whose behalf the operator of the aggregation system is reporting . This implementation can concurrently support multiple different user interfaces operating on multiple different devices interacting with multiple advertising servers or services and multiple reporting and or measurement servers or services on behalf of multiple Internet services or independently of any individual Internet service . This implementation can concurrently support file transmission and or delegation of file transmission to multiple data storage or computing services providers or data storage or computing infrastructures including transmission of the same file utilizing more than one data storage or computing services provider or data storage or computing infrastructure based on any of or any combination of the user device to which one or more files are transmitted location of said user device location throughput utilization or performance of one or more components of a data storage or computing services provider or data storage or computing infrastructure network or network performance associated with a data storage or computing services provider or data storage or computing infrastructure or associated with one or more components of a data storage or computing services provider or data storage or computing infrastructure the network to which the device is connected or an intermediate network to which said network is connected directly or indirectly throughput data or packet loss or other performance characteristic s associated with said network said intermediate network or the aggregate of some or all networks a Feed selective feed subset of feeds digital service subset of digital services type or characteristic of feed or digital service or genre mode associated with one or more feed items or with one or more files the version or other aspects of the user interface associated with the user device or other criteria associated with the user device or the file.

Other implementations of this aspect of the primary and other embodiments can provide digital advertising execution and user activity reporting through requests made and reports sent by the user interface the user device a component of facility of or other program operating on the user device or a network connected directly or via another network to the user device . In all such implementations the requests and reports can be made either directly to the advertising server s or service s and or reporting and or measurement server s or service s or to an intermediate server or service operated by the operator of the aggregation system or another service operator. The operator of the aggregation system or another service operator can maintain and or provide to the user interface user device or other requesting and reporting servers or services one or more datasets data records data elements or other input information that identifies for each participating service feed provider the advertising server s reporting and or measurement server s request formats reporting protocols and other necessary technical and interface information addresses protocols formats and authentication techniques so that the user interface user device or other requesting and reporting server or service can successfully request and or report to the correct servers and or services on behalf of each service feed provider . In such implementations the operator of the aggregation system or other service operator can provide and periodically update one or more datasets data records data elements or other input information thereby enabling the user interface user device or other requesting and reporting servers or services to make multiple requests by accessing the datasets data records data elements or other inputs multiple times between communications with the operator of the aggregation system or other service operator or the operator of the aggregation system or other service operator can maintain one or more datasets data records data elements or other input information and enable the user interface user device or other requesting and reporting servers or services to access interact with communicate with or otherwise obtain information as needed from the datasets data records data elements or other input information each time such information is needed or the operator of the aggregation system or other service operator can act as a communications hub or point e.g. a clearinghouse enabling the user interface user device or other requesting and reporting servers or services to access interact with communicate with or otherwise obtain information as needed or in advance of as needed from it while it in turn accesses the datasets data records data elements or other input information from service feed providers Internet services shared content management systems or other sources of such information as such information is requested or in advance of such requests. These implementations can concurrently support multiple different user interfaces operating on multiple different devices interacting with multiple advertising servers or services and multiple reporting and or measurement servers or services on behalf of multiple service feed providers or independently of any individual service feed provider .

In another optional aspect of the primary and other embodiments the operator of the aggregation system can signal advertising load characteristics or whether or not to insert an advertisement to multiple service feed providers such that the overall advertising load experienced by a user can be coordinated among multiple service feed providers and so that each service feed provider can receive a share of the total available advertising load. This can help prevent the individual actions of service feed providers in deciding how many advertisements to insert and which video playbacks to insert them into from combining in an uncoordinated way to saturate the user s playback experience with too many advertisements. In one implementation of this aspect of the primary and other embodiments the user interface or user device includes a parameter with each requested service feed item that signals whether or not an advertisement should be inserted into the requested content item. In another implementation of this aspect of the primary and other embodiments the user interface user device aggregation system or other system making requests to an advertising server on behalf of the Internet service includes a parameter with each requested service feed item that signals whether or not an advertisement should be inserted into the requested content item. In another implementation of this aspect of the primary and other embodiments the user interface user device aggregation system or other system making requests to an advertising server on behalf of the Internet service manages the overall advertising load by not making a request to the advertising server which results in a content item without an advertisement inserted into it. In any such implementation the advertising load is managed to an acceptable level for the user while at the same time the available advertising load is distributed among the Internet services according to each service feed provider s share overall load objectives or other objectives. In this manner the user interface user device aggregation system or other system operates to coordinate the advertisement insertions among the participating service feed providers. In other embodiments the Internet services insert advertising avails into the content item or in metadata where the aggregation system can insert advertising.

In another optional aspect of the primary and other embodiments the operator of the aggregation system or a system associated with the aggregation system can aggregate and or correlate user activity data across multiple Feeds across multiple devices over time and in other ways or in any combination. A user s activity can be correlated using one or more available common data elements for example user credentials such as user name and password or other login information for any Internet service user access credentials for the user interface and or aggregation system a device identifier a device supporting service identifier a network address IP address MAC address or similar a user behavior pattern or signature a data file downloaded to or stored on a device or within an application or software on a device or other data element available in common across two or more such correlations. Multiple such correlations can be cross referenced further extending the range of correlations that can be made. As one example user activity information can be correlated across devices for a user who uses social network service credentials e.g. Facebook Connect authentication to sign in to the user interface executing on a smartphone tablet and connected television by correlating the individual user activity records according to a Facebook identifier this correlation can be implemented in a variety of ways for example by associating the Facebook identifier to an underlying user identifier and storing user activity records by the underlying user identifier as they are created or by storing user activity records by the Facebook identifier and then correlating them when reporting is required or by another technique. As another example user activity information can be correlated across devices using a combination of a social network service credentials entered on one device coupled with the Internet services user identifier associated with that device and other devices commonly connected to the Internet service such as extending a user s Facebook connected capability by associating the user interface executing on an Apple iPhone on which she entered her Facebook sign in information with her user interface executing on her Apple iPad by using the iCloud services interface connected to each via her Apple iTunes account ID or other Apple ID thereby identifying her for sign in feed and content presentation customization user reporting and other functions as the same user on both devices . This user and her activity on her user interface executing on a non Apple non iCloud connected television could also then be further associated with her when she signs into that connected television with the her Facebook identifier because her connected television is authorized to her multichannel video programming distributor MVPD account if she later visits her MVPD s website and signs into that website with her MVPD username and password user activity from the MVPD website can now be correlated as well and loading a browser cookie from the MVPD website that can be read as she browses other websites on the Internet and or uses applications on her mobile and connected devices and that contains a user identifier such as a globally unique identifier GUID enables correlation of those of her activities as well including correlation of any other user activities that can be correlated with any of these user identifiers.

In another optional aspect of the primary and other embodiments the operator of the aggregation system or a system associated with the aggregation system may as described correlate and report user activity in many ways for a variety of purposes and to a range of parties and systems both in retrospect and in realtime or near realtime and may project user activity or other information prospectively. In these instances it may be necessary or desirable to identify a user or group of users uniquely to each such party or system to protect the confidentiality of personal business or other information optionally uniquely per device or commonly across some or all devices or a combination. One way this can be accomplished is by associating multiple unique identifiers with a single user or group of users as activity or other information about that user or users is reported or communicated to other parties or systems such that one party or system receives information about that user or user with one associated user identifier and another party or system receives information about that user or users with a second different associated user identifier even though both sets of information refer to the same user or users . For example when a request is sent to an advertising server or service associated with an Internet service it can be advantageous to include a unique user identifier in the request which then enables more advanced ad trafficking and decision making logic by the advertising server or service it will often be advantageous to send for a single user one unique user identifier in the request sent to a first advertising server or service associated with a first Internet service and a second unique user identifier in the request sent to a second advertising server or service such as a remnant advertising network associated with that first Internet service or the request sent to an advertising server or service associated with a second Internet service . It may also be advantageous for a single user to in some cases send a previously associated unique user identifier such as the user s identifier associated with the service to which it is being sent while in other cases send a non associated unique identifier for example if the request is being sent to a Facebook operated advertising server or service the user s Facebook identifier or a unique identifier associated with the user s Facebook identifier may be included in the request whereas when the request is being sent to a non Facebook operated advertising server or service a unique identifier that is not and is not associated with the user s Facebook identifier is sent. For a single user a unique user identifier can be used across devices or a separate unique user identifier can be used for each device this can be implemented consistently for the user or conditionally for the user such that in some cases a unique user identifier is used across all devices and in some cases separate unique user identifiers are used on separate devices for example this could be conditioned upon participation in a business relationship or in conformance to certain privacy standards so that requests sent to participating advertising servers or services are sent with a common unique user identifier across devices used by a given user whereas requests sent to non participating advertising servers or services for the same user are sent with a different unique user identifier for each device used by a given user . This could also be conditioned upon user parameters e.g. user opt in or opt out usage characteristics etc. location parameters device Feeds subscribed or in use or other conditions. In addition unique user identifiers can be maintained or changed over time. Multiple unique user identifiers can similarly be used for a single user or group of users in reporting or providing access to such as through a query or reporting tool analytics system or the like user activity user demographics and analytics and other information about users .

In these implementations the operator of the aggregation system or a system associated with the aggregation system generates and or stores multiple unique user identifiers for each user along with information indicating which services devices information recipients or other entities are associated to have access to or otherwise use each unique user identifier optionally along with other conditional policy parameters or information.

In another optional aspect of the primary and other embodiments activity and or inactivity associated with a user including but not limited to adding deleting interacting with and accessing Feeds or Internet services and or watching repetitively watching sharing saving skipping or deleting feed items can be employed directly or indirectly optionally in combination with data about the Feeds Internet services and feed items optionally in combination with similar or dissimilar activity associated with other users optionally in combination with other data optionally in combination with declared interests of the user and or other users optionally in combination with associations among users on the aggregation system and or other Internet services such as social networking services and optionally in combination with measurements of effectiveness to in conjunction with a unified portal dashboard or guide service provided on or in association with the device a Unified Video Interface or UVI that brings together in a unified visual interface movie television and other video content from one or more services available via the device or applications installed on the device to make suggestions or recommendations about content items channels features or other available content on other services that are not the aggregation system associated with the user associated with a device and or associated with an application Other UVI Services and to configure content Feeds and or feed items for delivery to the user through the aggregation system user interface any other instance of the user interface associated with the user or other application or service associated with the aggregation system or user interface or otherwise to the user . Such a Unified Video Interface could display recommendations derived entirely by in part by or in combination with this optional aspect of the primary and other embodiments and a Feed one or more feed items one or more series of feed items or other content could be provided by the aggregation system to one or more instance of the user interface or otherwise to the user based on content available through Other UVI Services.

As an example of this optional aspect of the primary and other embodiments the activity of a user who watches a series of feed items associated with a particular movie or television show or who repetitively watches a particular feed item associated with a particular movie or television show could be used as the basis of a recommendation of that associated movie or television show communicated to the Unified Video Interface for communication to the user when that movie or television show is available on an Other UVI Service. As another example of this optional aspect of the primary and other embodiments content available through Other UVI Services could be used to filter or configure one or more Feeds such as a Feed explicitly identified as associated with the UVI or not so identified and or to prioritize feed items within other feeds and or to select prioritize configure or otherwise present promotional or other messages content or feed items to the user such as presenting a What s On Tonight feed that includes feed items such as trailers excerpts and behind the scenes and other related content correlated to the movies and television shows available on Other UVI Services.

In one implementation of this optional aspect of the primary and other embodiments the aggregation system user interface or other system or software interacting with the aggregations system or user interface would receive from the Unified Video Interface or a system interacting directly or indirectly with the Unified Video Interface a UVI System a query or other message and in response would return a list of recommendations the query or other message may optionally include candidates such as newly available items in the other services interfacing to the Unified Video Interface along with the Other UVI Service s associated with each candidate and the response returned may optionally include a score or weight associated with some or all of the recommendations and in addition to the response the aggregation system would create filter or deliver a Feed for the user based on the candidates.

The user experience associated with implementation of this optional aspect of the primary and other embodiments would comprise 

Referring next to an embodiment of a process for reporting data derived from a multi feed based system is shown. The depicted portion of the process begins in block where the aggregation system presents a first feed item to a user through a user interface the first feed item linking to video content from a first Internet service . In block the aggregation system records an interaction of the user in reference to the first feed item including activity and or inactivity of the user . In block the aggregation system presents a second feed item linking to video content from a second Internet service . In block the aggregation system records an interaction of the user in reference to the second feed item including activity and or inactivity of the user . The aggregation system then compiles records of interaction of the user in reference to the first feed item with records of the interaction of the user in reference to the second feed item block .

In block the aggregation system receives a query from an outside system. The query from an outside system could be a query from a UVI system. In block the aggregation system processes the query from the outside system. In block the aggregation system returns data conforming to the query from the outside system to the outside system.

In an optional aspect of the primary and other embodiments the aggregation system a system associated with the aggregation system a system associated with the user interface or device a system associated with some or all of the devices on which instances of the user interface execute a system associated with software operating on some or all of the devices on which instances of the user interface execute a system associated with one or more files or other data created by stored on or processed by some or all of the devices on which instances of the user interface execute a system associated with some or all service feed providers a system associated with some or all of the networks connected directly indirectly or through an intermediate network to some or all of the devices on which instances of the user interface execute or another system or service can receive accumulate parse process summarize divide into subsets and otherwise manipulate data elements data records data sets or other information comprising numerical statistical quantitative qualitative descriptive or other information about actions interactions events and other behavior and activities started stopped completed made or taken by users as they engage with the user interface or device other interfaces to the aggregation system or Internet services connected to the aggregation system Feeds Feed Items icons tiled icons controls data entry fields and or other elements of the user interface or device . In addition such accumulated data can but need not necessarily include user authentication method user identity anonymized unique user identifiers such as globally unique identifiers location date time device identifier network identifier connectivity mode operating system and other software component identifiers user input device identifier and other information. The accumulated data can be divided into subsets by and exported to one or more service feed providers manufacturers of devices on which instances of the visual user interface execute developers of other software that executes on devices on which instances of the visual user interface execute providers of networks connected directly indirectly or through an intermediate network to some or all of the devices on which instances of the visual user interface execute providers of Internet services advertising agencies advertising measurement and reporting servers or services audience measurement and reporting servers or services or other measurement and reporting servers or services.

Referring next to an embodiment of a single pane view of the user interface is shown. In this embodiment a channel carousel rotates to select a single icon denoted by a radio dial . The feed pane corresponding to the selected icon is shown. The user can select a Feed Item in the feed pane that is shown in the video window . The video window may be selected to go full screen to occupy the entire single pane view or may automatically do so after playback is begun or after a delay once playback is begun. In this embodiment the single pane view is displayed on a television using a built in player a set top box a DVD or Blu Ray player a video streaming device etc.

In an optional aspect of the primary and other embodiments the aggregation system and or a user interface may be operate in association directly or indirectly with a preference engine that automatically or quasi automatically selects Feeds for one or more users to be incorporated within the set of Feeds provided to the user and or that configures filters orders or otherwise influences some or all of the content items presented in Feeds provided to the user .

In one implementation of this optional aspect of the primary and other embodiments the Feeds provided to associated with or contributing to the selective feed provided to or associated with a given user may be automatically configured as such for the user or initially subsequently or periodically recommended to the user hereinafter each such automatically configured or recommended Feed is referred to as an Auto Feed based on an association of a Feed to a user account entity item Feed Item or other component of another Internet service coupled with an association of that other user account entity item Feed Item or other component of the other Internet service with the user and optionally based on service preferences indicated for example a user s action inaction activity or other behavior. As an example a user who is a follower of a media entity on a social networking Internet service could be automatically provided with the Feed associated with that media entity s own Internet service which is independent of the social networking Internet service such as automatically providing a user who has liked a media entity s Facebook page with that media entity s own service feed . As another example a user who receives a shared video Feed Item on a social networking Internet service and then watches that video Feed item to a specified completion or in its entirety could from that point on or at least from that point until the user cancels or deletes it be automatically provided the Feed associated with the Internet service of the media entity associated with the shared video Feed Item.

In this implementation such associations may be configured as one to one many to one one to many or many to many and can be direct or indirect continuing with the first example a user could also be provided with that media entity s own service feed when the user has followed a personality associated with the media entity on a social networking Internet service independent of the media entity s Internet service . Further the Auto Feed can be a filtered subset of the media entity s service feed for example the Auto Feed could be filtered to include only those Feed Items that feature the media personality.

In one technical execution of this Auto Feed implementation this optional aspect of the primary and other embodiments can be implemented via some of all of or a combination of some of the following components and processes 

In another implementation of this optional aspect of the primary and other embodiments the Auto Feeds for a given user may be based on declared interests of the user activity such as watching sharing or saving feed items associated with the user activity associated with the user combined with or correlated to activity of other users or the response of the user or other users to a given Auto Feed.

Referring next to an embodiment of a process for creation of an Auto Feed is shown. The depicted portion of the process begins in block where the aggregation system records user interactions with various Internet services . These Internet services may have service feeds or may expose by other means the interactions and or service preferences of users . Interactions and preferences potentially including which books music movies products services web pages ads videos stories blogs content topics other users brands organizations causes other entities etc. that the user interacts with rates comments on shares associates with subscribes to or otherwise indicates interest opinion association familiarity affinity or negative affinity with for or to.

Current historical or past interactions are often recorded by Internet services for example reviews preferences and analytics information. This information may be publically accessible from the Internet service or in some embodiments could be obtained through a feed of analytic data from the Internet service . When login is required for access to some or all service preferences the aggregation system logs into the Internet service in block using credentials for the user . These service preferences are optionally combined with others attributed to the user that may be publically accessible by crawling automatically the Internet services in block .

The service preferences serve as way to automatically determine media entities that the user may have an interest in. The feed correlation index is queried using the service preferences and or media entities to determine the Feed s that relate to those subjects. Before creation of an Auto Feed the user could be notified or queried if that is desired in block . Where there are multiple feeds for the service preference and or media entity those can be combined in block to form the Auto Feed. Certain feeds could be filtered automatically for a particular Auto Feed for example there could be a Feed relating to Olympians generally and a filter for a particular athlete could be performed for those interested in the particular athlete.

In addition to automatic filtering and screening of Feeds the user can define filters to remove Feed Items from the Auto Feed in block . The filtering can be by keyword or video type and entered by simple rating controls such as thumbs up or thumbs down and the aggregation system would create the appropriate filter. In block the Auto Feed is presented to the user along with other Feeds. As the user continues to interact with Internet services other service preferences and media entities could be found and corresponding Feeds added to the Auto Feed or additional Auto Feeds created and provided to the user .

Although this embodiment gathers all service preferences and media entity information to find Feeds that are aggregated into a single Auto Feed other embodiments could use the same techniques to create multiple Service Feeds. Each media entity could have its own Auto Feed for example. Media entities could be grouped into category feeds for example the athlete media entities could be grouped into one Auto Feed while musician media entities could be automatically placed into another Auto Feed.

The functions associated with creation and presentation of Auto Feeds can be technically implemented through any of all of or any combination of execution as part of the user interface as part of software functionality on the device as part of the aggregation system as part of a system associated with the aggregation system as part of an Internet service associated with the aggregation system and or the user as part of or in conjunction with a content management system shared content management system or other system associated with a service feed as a standalone system or programming interface as a standalone Internet service through a programming interface or other digital interface of the device the operating system executing on the device or other software executing on the device through a programming interface or other digital interface available in conjunction with the network connected directly indirectly or through an intermediate network to the device .

Referring next to block diagrams shows one embodiment of the NMS interfaced with other portions of the aggregation system and a device . A notifications management system NMS can manage notifications across some or all devices associated with and some or all user interfaces operating on some or all devices associated with users . The NMS has a notification engine that interfaces to the platform level notification center on the device or alternatively to another notifications system available on the device such that a notification is created by entered into sent to or sent through the NMS once or less than the total number of disparate platform level notifications systems indicated and is then distributed to all addressed devices and utilizes and or interfaces to the heterogeneous group of devices addressed and the heterogeneous group of necessary platform level notification systems.

This optional aspect of the primary and other embodiments also optionally includes a local notifications repository operating on or in conjunction with the user interface or another notifications system available on the device separate and apart from the device s native notification repository referred to as a user interface notification center allowing local notifications to be sent to or through the user interface or the other notifications system without using the platform level notifications system and native notifications to be sent to or through the platform level notification center and to or through the device s native notification repository. This optional aspect of the primary and other embodiments can limit the presence of local notifications to the subset of notifications sent to or through the platform level notification center while still enabling a greater number of notifications to be sent to the user through the user interface notification center thereby limiting the potential noise experienced by the user if more than a desirable number of notifications is sent via the platform level notification center thereby also or alternatively enabling total notifications including platform level notifications and local notifications to exceed any limit on platform level notifications set by the operator of the device platform or by the user of the device and or to avoid partially or entirely any cost such as a cost per notification imposed by the operator of the device platform and or to provide a device level configuration capability to the user that allocates and or prioritizes notifications among the platform level notification center and the user interface notification center . Platform level notifications and local notifications may be synchronized for example a platform level notification might be sent to notify the user that there are local notifications waiting for her in the user interface notification center or may not be synchronized or may be synchronized in some cases and not synchronized in other cases.

One technical implementation of the NMS would include some of all of or a combination of some of the following components and processes 

Utilizing the NMS the operator of the aggregation system could easily with a single policy or entry generate and transmit notifications to users across a heterogeneous array of devices with a copy of each notification sent to each user on each device associated with the user using the platform level notification center specific to each such device the operator of an Internet service could if authorized by the operator of the NMS generate and transmit notifications to users associated with the Internet service across a heterogeneous array of devices with a copy of each notification sent to each user associated with the Internet service on each device associated with the user using the platform level notifications system specific to each such device notifications could be sent to the user interface notification center to reduce the number of platform level notifications sent to any given user heterogeneous devices and corresponding platform level notification centers are easily supported in a consistent fashion and via a single interface and more notifications can be sent to more users with more specificity and precision while at the same time the user experience is maintained or improved.

In one embodiment the NMS has various stores of data that may be in a database file system and or a memory data structure which include authorization records a notification correlation index a notification history list and a notification policy index . The data in the various stores can be combined into a single store or divided between a number of stores at a number of locations. The NMS also has a notification interface and a notification engine . Additionally the NMS interfaces with several other components of the aggregation system for example optionally the notification interface interacts with service interfaces and the notification engine interacts with a preference engine an aggregation engine one or more user interfaces and one or more devices .

The notification interface receives notification requests. A notification request contains a first field for a notification the notification being a string of text an icon a graphic and or a hyperlink to be sent to a user and or device and the notification request contains a second field for one or more criteria for the notification engine to apply as the notification engine processes the notification request. The one or more criteria relate to data about users and or devices gathered and or used by the aggregation system . The one or more criteria could specify one some or all users and or one some or all devices to send the notification to. The one or more criteria could specify a type of device and or a type of platform to send the notification to including location fidelity of a rendering system on a device an operating system of a device manufacturer of a device software applications installed on a device and or a model and or style of a device . The criteria could be based on preference s of the user s including user comments user tags user ratings and or user rankings. The criteria could be based on a history of the user s including videos watched types and or genre of videos watched service feeds the user has subscribed to and or other user activity on the Internet including browsing history. The one or more criteria could be based on a type of user including age gender language and or other demographic data.

The notification interface enables Internet services to send notifications to their associated users and or to define policies that will send notifications to their associated users utilizing local notifications platform level notifications or both and optionally utilizing local notifications and synchronized platform level notifications and to send notifications to users across a heterogeneous set of devices using either local notifications or platform level notifications or both and streamlining and simplifying the processes for doing so. The NMS can manage the notifications and distribution to devices .

For example using a generalized scenario illustrating how the notifications function can operate if Adobe wanted to alert users operating Linux on a PC that there was a security update for Flash Player Adobe would generate a notification request through the notification interface . In the first field of the notification request Adobe would specify a string of text stating there is a security update for Flash Player and a hyperlink pointing to an Internet address where a user could download the security update. In the second field of the notification request Adobe would specify criteria that the notification be sent to users that have Flash Player on a PC operating Linux.

In another example a local band could submit a notification request through the notification interface specifying in the first field of the local band s notification request a string of text stating a time and location where the local band is going to perform in an hour and a graphic depicting the local band s trademark. In the second field of the local band s notification request the local band could specify criteria that the notification in the first field of the local band s notification request be sent to a user that has watched a music video from a Feed Item within the last month that is of a similar genre as the band performs and the user has a smartphone where the smartphone location is within a ten mile radius of the local band s performance location.

The notification interface can receive a notification request from a third party directly and or through the service interfaces . For example an Internet service could submit a notification request through the service interfaces . When the third party submits a notification request the third party also provides third party credentials showing that the third party is authorized to submit the notification request. For example the third party credentials showing that the third party is authorized could be a token sign in sequence shared secret key public key and or digital signature. The notification interface verifies the authority of the third party to submit the notification request by matching the third party credentials to data in the authorization records database. After authenticating the notification request made by the third party the notification interface passes the notification request to the notification engine .

The notification engine receives a notification request from the notification interface as described above and or the notification engine can generate a notification request as described later below. The notification engine processes the notification request by using the one or more criteria of the notification request to select users and or devices to transmit the notification to. To process the notification request the notification engine interacts with other components in the NMS and aggregation system described below.

The notification engine receives preference data about users from the preference engine . The preference engine as discussed in the text accompanying the description of gathers tracks and or generates preference data about users . The notification engine receives the preference data from the preference engine when the one or more criteria of the notification request relate to a preference of a user . For example a criterion of the notification request could specify that the notification be sent to users who are likely to be Democrats. The preference engine could generate a list of likely Democrats by querying a database available to the preference engine for users who like or thumbs up Democrat politicians and or thumbs down Republican politicians the list of likely Democrats comprising a list of user specific identifiers. The notification engine would then receive the list of likely Democrats comprising user specific identifiers from the preference engine .

When the notification engine has a list of user specific identifiers to send the notification to the notification engine requests user interface specific identifiers and or device specific identifiers from the aggregation engine . A user interface specific identifier allows the notification engine to map a particular user to a particular user interface . A device specific identifier allows the notification engine to map a particular user to a particular device . Continuing the example in the previous paragraph about the list of likely Democrats after the notification engine receives the list of likely Democrats comprising user specific identifiers the notification engine requests user interface specific identifiers and or device specific identifiers associated with the user specific identifiers from the aggregation engine . The aggregation engine would then query one or more databases available to the aggregation engine for the user interface specific identifiers and or device specific identifiers and return the results to the notification engine . With user interface specific identifiers and or device specific identifiers the notification engine can transmit the notification to the user interface and or device of the user .

Referring to a block diagram shows an embodiment of the notification engine communicating with the user interface though a user interface notification center and with a platform level notification center on a device . The user interface has an application level notification center labeled as the user interface notification center to handle and or store notifications that are sent to the user interface . A notification sent to the user interface notification center is a local notification. The user interface notification center could display the local notification in various ways including under a selectable tab in a panel and or pane as a ticker and or pop up on the bottom top side or middle of a display as an overlay in the video playback window in the active item pane and or in the feed pane . A notification sent to the platform level notification center is a platform level notification. The platform level notification center handles and or stores notifications at a platform level. An example of a platform level notification center is Apple s iPhone swipe down menu that handles and lists notifications from more than one application. In addition to being able to send local notifications and or platform level notifications the notification engine can query the user interface notification center and or the platform level notification center to obtain data about the status of notifications in the user interface notification center and or the platform level notification center . For example the notification engine could query the platform level notification center for the number of notifications received but still marked as unread. Further the user interface notification center and or the platform level notification center could send data to the notification engine . For example the user interface notification center could alert the notification engine when a user views a local notification.

Referring to an embodiment of the user interface that has a notification pane to display notifications from the user interface notification center is shown. The user interface has an active item pane a feed pane site navigation links a content navigation pane and a notification pane . The notification pane in the embodiment shown is located below the active item pane . The notification pane displays notifications from the user interface notification center .

Returning to in one embodiment the notification engine can map the one or more criteria of the notification request to a Feed Item using the notification correlation index . The notification correlation index contains a list of Feed Items and associated words and or phrases such as words and or phrases relating to the Feed Item s source topic and or genre. The notification engine can pull data about a Feed Item from the preference engine the aggregation engine metadata associated with the video content of the Feed Item a user through the user interface manual entry by a system operator of the NMS and or the Internet service providing the Feed Item. Table 1 below is one example of how data may be organized in the notification correlation index . Table 1 shows five columns with column headings Feed Item ID Source Primary Secondary and Genre. Under the column heading Feed Item ID are numbers uniquely identifying different Feed Items. Under the column heading Source entries identify where Feed Items were obtained from. Key words and or phrases are provided under the column heading Primary. The key words and or phrases under the column heading Primary have a very strong correlation to the topic of a corresponding Feed Item. There are key words and or phrases under the column heading Secondary. The key words and or phrases under the column heading Secondary relate to a topic of the Feed Item but may not as strongly correlate to the Feed Item as an entry in the Primary column. Entries under the column heading Genre further categorize a Feed Item.

The notification engine also interacts with the notification history list . The notification history list maintains records of notifications transmitted and or notification requests that did not result in a notification being transmitted. Table 2 below is one example of how data may be organized in the notification history list . Table 2 shows eight columns. Columns one and two provide fields for date and time stamps for an entry. In this example a second entry was made just two minutes after a first entry. Column three is a field for a user specific identifier. In this example all entries are tied to one user . The fourth Column is a field for a unique identification number for each notification request. Column five is a field for a unique identification number for each notification that was or is to be sent to a user . Column six tracts whether the notification was a local notification or a platform level notification. Column seven records whether a notification was actually sent. Column eight provides a field for notes relating to an entry in the notification history list .

The notification policy index contains rules for the notification engine to follow as the notification engine processes a notification request. Rules in the notification policy index can be global such as to apply to all notification requests or the rules can be for a specific user such as set by the user through the user interface . One example of a rule in the notification policy index could be for the notification engine to generate a platform level notification after seven local notifications have been sent and unread by a user . If the notification engine sent seven local notifications and then from a query of the user interface notification center determined that those seven local notifications remained unread by the user then the notification engine would generate a notification request where the notification in the first field in the notification request is text instructing the user to check the user interface notification center for messages and in the second field of the notification request set a criterion that the notification in the first field of the notification request should be sent as a platform level notification. Another example of a rule in the notification policy index could be a rule that limits the frequency of certain notifications sent to a user . For example a rule could limit notifications sent to a user from a single notification request to no more than one notification sent every four hours. If there was a notification request with a criterion that stipulated the notification engine transmit a notification to a user who watches a Feed Item correlated to a genre of sports specifically baseball then without a rule otherwise the notification engine would send three similar notifications in a row to a user who watches three videos in a row related to baseball. This might annoy the user and or cause the user to disregard further notifications. By having the rule that limits the frequency of certain notifications the user would get only one notification related to the notification request instead of three.

Referring next to an embodiment for a process for correlating a criterion in a notification request with a Feed Item is shown. The depicted portion of the process begins in block where the notification interface receives a notification request the notification request containing a first field for a notification and a second field for one or more criteria for the notification engine to apply as the notification engine processes the notification request. In block the notification interface may optionally authenticate the notification request by accessing the authorization records . The notification engine then receives the notification request from the notification interface . In block the notification engine correlates the notification request to a Feed Item by using the notification correlation index to map the one or more criteria in the notification request to a Feed Item establishing a correlated Feed Item.

To determine a user and or device corresponding to the notification request block the notification engine receives data from the aggregation engine and or the user interface when the correlated Feed Item is currently or about to be viewed by a user . The data received from the aggregation engine and or the user interface can include identification data about the user user interface and or device such as user specific identifiers user interface specific identifiers and or device specific identifiers from the user index .

In block the notification engine then transmits the notification in the first field of the notification request in a timed relation to when the user views or may view the correlated Feed Item. For example the notification engine may transmit the notification in the notification request when the user starts viewing the correlated Feed Item. Alternately the notification engine could transmit the notification a number of seconds and or minutes after the user starts viewing the correlated Feed Item and while the user is still viewing the correlated Feed Item. Additionally the notification engine could transmit the notification after the user starts viewing a correlated Feed Item regardless of whether or not the user is still viewing the correlated Feed Item. For example the notification engine could transmit the notification a minute several minutes an hour and or several hours after the user begins viewing a correlated Feed Item and or the notification engine could transmit the notification to the user a next time the user logged on the user interface . If the notification came the next time the user logged on the user interface the user may not be as distracted as when the user is already watching a video.

The notification engine could also transmit the notification before the user begins viewing the correlated Feed Item. Components of the aggregation system such as the user interface and or aggregation engine have data about the selective feed the user is viewing. The aggregation system tracks an order of Feed Items in that selective feed including where the correlated Feed Item falls in the order of Feed Items. The user interface and or the aggregation engine could signal the notification engine when the user is viewing the selective feed and the selective feed is about to display the correlated Feed Item. For example a notification about an availability of discount tickets to a local zoo could be displayed before the user is about to watch a video of a news story about panda bears at the local zoo. That might encourage the user to watch the video of a news story about panda bears at the local zoo.

As an example of how the process for correlating a criterion in a notification request with a Feed Item may work a vendor selling flashlights could submit a notification request through the notification interface . The vendor selling flashlights could stipulate that the notification in the first field of the notification request is a string of text advertising a crank powered flashlight. The vendor selling flashlights could stipulate that the one or more criteria in the notification request include sending the notification advertising a crank powered flashlight to users viewing a video related to a natural disaster and that the notification advertising a crank powered flashlight is to be shown seven seconds after the user starts to view the video related to a natural disaster. In addition to submitting the notification request the vendor selling flashlights could also submit credentials that the vendor selling flashlights is authorized to submit the notification request. The notification interface would compare the credentials of the vendor selling flashlights to the authorization records to verify that the vendor selling flashlights was authorized to submit the notification request. The notification interface would then send the notification request from the vendor selling flashlights to the notification engine . The notification engine could map the one or more criteria of the notification request to a Feed Item in Table 1 corresponding to Feed Item ID 99246859 a Feed Item about a strong hurricane. When the user has a selective feed that includes the Feed Item about a strong hurricane the user interface sends the notification engine a user interface specific identifier and the Feed Item ID relating to the Feed Item about a strong hurricane. The notification engine then transmits the notification the string of text advertising a crank powered flashlight to the user interface notification center with instructions that the string of text advertising a crank powered flashlight is to be shown seven seconds after the user begins viewing the Feed Item about a strong hurricane. The user interface notification center would then display the text advertising a crank powered flashlight seven seconds after the user begins viewing the Feed Item about a strong hurricane. Additionally the vendor selling flashlights could set the one or more criteria of the notification request to transmit the text advertising the crank powered flashlight seven hours after the user watched the Feed Item about a strong hurricane. Transmitting the notification hours after the user watched the Feed Item about a strong hurricane could give the user time to think about and possibly discuss the strong hurricane and how the user might prepare herself for a hurricane.

Referring next to an embodiment of a process for managing notifications is shown. The depicted portion of the process begins in block where the notification engine reads a notification request. The notification engine can receive the notification request from the notification interface and or the notification engine can generate the notification request.

In an embodiment the notification policy index contains notification rules on how the notification engine should handle a notification request. In block the notification engine reads one or more of the notification rules that may apply to the notification request. For example one rule may limit the notification engine to sending no more than one notification that is an advertisement to a user per hour.

For the notification engine to apply the notification rules the notification engine may need to read a list containing a history of notifications and or a history of notification requests block . One source of data the notification engine can pull from is the notification history list which contains a history of notifications and or a history of notification requests. The notification engine may also query the user interface notification center and or the platform level notification center for a list containing a history of notifications such as how many unread notifications remain in the user interface notification center and or the platform level notification center whether a similar notification has been read by a user on another device what notifications from other applications are in the platform level notification center and or a total number of notifications in the user interface notification center and or the platform level notification center .

In block the notification engine determines whether or not to send the notification by applying the notification rules in the notification policy index based on the data from the notification history list and optionally based on the data from the user interface notification center and or the platform level notification center . If the notification engine determines not to send the notification the notification engine does not send the notification block . Conversely if the notification engine does determine to send the notification the notification engine transmits the notification block . For example there may be a rule for sending a user only one notification per day that is an advertisement. The notification engine after receiving a notification request where the notification in the first field of the notification request is an advertisement could select a user to send the notification to and query the notification history list for notifications related to that user that were advertisements. If after discovering the user that day already received an advertisement notification the notification engine would not transmit the notification in the first field of the notification request.

In block whether or not the notification engine transmits the notification a rule in the notification policy index may optionally have the notification engine generate a new notification request. For example the notification policy index could contain a rule that after the notification engine has sent five local notifications which are all unread the notification engine should generate a platform level notification instructing the user to check the user interface notification center . After sending five local notifications and checking that the user interface notification center that the messages are unread the notification engine would generate a new notification request to send a platform level notification to the platform level notification center

In another example the user could generate a notification request that notifications from other applications that appear in the platform level notification center are to be sent to the user interface notification center . For example Delta Airlines has an Apple iPhone application that provides notifications relating to flight information including gate changes flight delays and prompts to check in. The notification engine could query the platform level notification center of the Apple iPhone of the user and pull an unread notification from Delta Airlines that the flight the user was booked for is going to be delayed. The notification engine could then generate a notification request where the first field of the notification request is a copy of the unread notification from Delta Airlines that the flight the user was booked on is going to be delayed and the second field of the notification request is a criterion that the notification in the first field of the notification request be sent as a local notification to the user interface notification center . That way the user would receive the notification from Delta Airlines that the flight the user was booked for is going to be delayed while the user is viewing a selective feed .
