title: Systems and methods for enabling and implementing real-time facsimile over internet protocol
abstract: Systems and methods are provided for real-time communication (e.g., fax, voice, video) via an IP Network even if a firewall or other restriction element is present or encountered. The real-time nature of the communication is ensured by preestablishing a communication session between a transfer client and a transfer server, between which the firewall or other restriction element is located. Following the preestablishment of the communication session, transmission control messages are exchanged between the transfer server and the transfer client via the preestablished communication session. The preestablished communication session prevents the firewall or other restriction element from blocking or delaying traffic (e.g., fax, voice, video traffic). The preestablished communication session establishes a full duplex communication link without restriction of or by the firewall or other communication restriction element. Accordingly, the firewall or restriction element considers traffic originating from outside of the portion of the IP network where the firewall is located to be in response to a request from the inside the IP Network. Thus, the firewall or restriction element will not act to block or delay the traffic from entry.

This application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 781 405 filed May 17 2010 entitled SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR ENABLING AND IMPLEMENTING REAL TIME FACSIMILE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL which claims benefit of the priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 179 482 filed May 19 2009 entitled SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR ENABLING AND IMPLEMENTING REAL TIME FACSIMILE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL.

Fax short for facsimile refers to technology for transferring documents files or images over a communications network. Although fax technology dates back to the 1800 s and its underlying principles today remain similar to those from long ago fax only gained widespread popularity and global market penetration in recent decades with the modernization of communications equipment and networks. Such improvements allowed fax technology to develop and expand to an extent that fax machines became ubiquitous devices used by millions to routinely transmit documents files or images quickly easily and reliably anywhere in the world and in turn led to widespread acceptance of and reliance upon fax technology by both the private and public sectors as a viable and in most cases preferred alternative to the more time consuming and expensive process of sending documents via postal mail. These and other factors caused fax technology to become an extremely important and lucrative worldwide industry.

With the more recent surge in popularity of electronic mail email however there were concerns as to whether fax technology would continue to be relevant let alone profitable. These fears have proven to be unfounded as fax continues to flourish and is predicted to remain a telecommunications fixture for many years to come. Fax technology may adapt however to be implemented with new techniques as new technology becomes available. Most notably as fax technology became widespread faxes were being transmitted on or via the Public Switched Telephone Network PSTN . And although the PSTN is still by far the most widespread telephone network used for fax worldwide and is poised to remain as such for years to come there has been increasing interest in and usage of Internet Protocol IP based networks for fax particularly in the last several years.

There is little doubt that IP based networks hold exciting promise in terms of what they may provide in addition to or above and beyond PSTN networks. However as many have already observed migration from the PSTN to IP based networks likely will not be entirely seamless requiring changes and or adjustments in order to enable legacy PSTN technology such as fax to be used in the same or different ways on IP networks.

To date those who send faxes over IP networks do so by utilizing a call control protocol e.g. SIP or H.323 to negotiate into faxing modes between gateways located on both ends sending receiving of a fax transmission. The fax is transmitted as an audio stream via RTP or as a fax session via T.38 a T.30 based network wrapper over the IP network in both cases the negotiations of these transport layers use non standard IP ports within the so called Dynamic as opposed to so called Well Known or Registered IP port ranges. Problems arise for example due to interactions between different networks with different network security rules which can prevent the usage of these media communication ports and in turn block the establishment of these fax media sessions. One could attempt to obviate these problems to enable real time fax by opening all of the more than 15000 Dynamic ports. However making these ports available is not a practical solution since the relevant portion of the IP Network would be vulnerable to security breaches and or malicious attacks and content. In other words although real time fax transmission is possible on IP networks as presently architected it would bring with it very real risks that would outweigh the benefits it would provide.

Various store and forward systems have been deployed in an attempt to work around Fax over IP FoIP network issues and that would not result in vulnerability to these types of security issues. However such systems are unable to provide real time fax functionality since they buffer fax documents and retransmit them on behalf of users at a later time thus employing two or more call legs and failing to provide real time notification to originating fax devices as to whether the fax sessions were successful or not. This non real time fax facility presents a number of problems including the inability to meet requirements established for traditional fax devices or various worldwide industry compliance and or governmental mandates.

Therefore a need exists for technology that allows for real time facsimile or other non fax communications to occur via IP based networks to fully utilize the benefits of such IP based networks yet while also not leaving IP Networks vulnerable to security issues and while at least preserving if not improving upon the overall experience of existing technology and conventional methodology.

These and other needs are met by systems and methods of the present disclosure such systems and methods providing for real time communication e.g. fax voice video via a packet switched network such as an IP Network for example even if a firewall or other restriction element is present or encountered. The real time nature of the communication is ensured by preestablishing a communication session between a transfer client and a transfer server between which the firewall or other restriction element is located. Following the preestablishment of the communication session transmission control messages are exchanged between the transfer server and the transfer client via the preestablished communication session. The preestablished communication session prevents the firewall or other restriction element from blocking or delaying traffic e.g. fax voice video traffic . The preestablished communication session establishes a full duplex communication link without restriction of or by the firewall or other communication restriction element. Accordingly the firewall or restriction element considers traffic originating from outside of the portion of the IP network where the firewall is located to be in response to a request from the inside the IP Network. Thus the firewall or restriction element will not act to block or delay the traffic from entry.

Also in accordance with the systems and methods of the present disclosure IP ports that are used to open the preestablished communication session can be any IP ports within the Well Known Ports or Registered Ports or Dynamic ports and need not be but can be preselected. Moreover such systems and methods can be employed whereby steps are taken to determine and implement optimal or at least preferred transmission sessions such that for example the device that will receive the transmission can be changed on the fly during the transmission for example or otherwise modified relocated.

The disclosures of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 781 405 filed May 17 2010 entitled SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR ENABLING AND IMPLEMENTING REAL TIME FACSIMILE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 179 482 filed May 19 2009 entitled SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR ENABLING AND IMPLEMENTING REAL TIME FACSIMILE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

Systems and methods are provided to enable faxes i.e. facsimile based communications messages to be transmitted entirely or in part on or via a packet switched network such as an IP network and in real time even if a firewall or other restriction element is encountered. In addition such systems and methods enable faxes to be transmitted i.e. sent and or received without causing or facilitating security vulnerabilities that may be present with a real time transmission via a packet switched network. As used herein with respect to fax transmissions the phrase real time refers to the real time nature of the T.30 fax protocol as defined in ITU document F.185 section 3.1.1 Real time session oriented Internet facsimile real time .

For purposes of discussing the system it is assumed that faxes are being sent from the fax device A to the fax device B however it should be noted that the depicted system can likewise function to send faxes from the fax device B to the fax device A. It is also understood that the fax device A and or the fax device B can actually represent multiple fax devices as shown in and as can be the case for example where the system is part of a local area network associated with a corporate entity and or employees of the corporate entity. Moreover it is understood that the depicted fax devices A B in although visually resembling traditional fax machines can be any device machine peripheral equipment or object single or multiple wired or wireless that is capable of sending and or receiving a fax such devices including but not being limited to stand alone and other fax machines computers PCs tablet devices multi function peripherals MFPs and mobile devices some of such other devices being shown in .

Each of the fax device s A B is directly or indirectly connected to or otherwise has access to a circuit switched network such as the Public Switched Telephone Network PSTN . In the system reference numeral A represents the PSTN connection for the fax device s A and reference numeral B represents the PSTN connection for the fax device s B. It is noted that unless otherwise specified the term connect and other forms thereof e.g. connection as used herein represent either or both a direct connection or an indirect connection.

In accordance with the system a fax sent via or from the fax device A via the PSTN connection A encounters a first intermediary device A such as a gateway or an analog telephone adapter ATA which connects the PSTN to a fax transfer client . The fax transfer client may be software that is contained within or otherwise part of or built into the first intermediary device A. Alternatively or in addition fax transfer client may be client software that is running on a device or appliance not shown such as a computer or an additional ATA or gateway that is located within the IP network area . Area represents a portion of a localized security area i.e. a demilitarized zone DMZ of the IP network that is within or accessible by the premises at which the fax device s A is are located. As shown in it is also generally but not necessarily the case that the first intermediary device A is located within the first premises IP Network area .

Connection represents a connection session such as a TCP session from the fax transfer client to a fax transfer server that is located on a public portion i.e. not restricted to the first premises of the IP Network. Optionally and as shown in a firewall e.g. a control or communication restriction element or Session Border Controller can be located between the fax transfer client and the fax transfer server . If the firewall is present as part of the system and depending on the configuration and characteristics of the firewall acting as a communication restriction element for example the fax transfer client can send keep alive messages to the fax transfer server on a periodic yet at least somewhat regular basis e.g. every 60 minutes but depending again on the restriction element characteristics . Such keep alive messages cause the connection and any other communication sessions to be maintained and or not dropped by the firewall while the fax transfer client awaits an incoming fax that is to be sent from a fax device A. As described in further detail below the presence of the firewall if configured as is generally known in the art e.g. to provide network security to the first premises portion of the IP Network area would in a conventional fax transmission system inherently cause a fax transmission sent from a fax device A not to satisfy the requirements of the T.30 real time fax protocol.

At a second premises there is located in addition to at least one fax device B a second intermediary device B which like the first intermediary device A also can be a gateway or ATA as well as a PSTN connection B. Connection serves as a connection which may be for example an IP connection between the fax transfer server and the second intermediary device B. It is noted that the second intermediary device B also can be an Internet Aware Fax IAF device or an IP based fax server in which case the second intermediary device B can itself function as a fax device and can operate with or in place of the one or more of the fax devices B. Such an alternate or additional arrangement with the fax devices A and or B being optional or not present can be implemented at any or all of the premises where the fax device s normally is are located and that are served by the system .

In accordance with an exemplary implementation of the system the fax transfer client can create a session via connection to the fax transfer server to permit a fax to be sent from a fax device A to a fax device B. Assuming for purposes of this exemplary embodiment that the firewall is present and depending on the specific configuration of the firewall this created session can use IP ports not shown to open establish a communication session between the fax transfer client and the fax transfer server . The use of such IP ports can help ensure that the real time nature of the T.30 fax protocol is preserved because a full duplex communication link is established without restriction of or by the firewall . The opened established session permits the firewall to consider the traffic originating from outside of the first premises IP Network area to be a in response to a request from the first premises IP Network area . Accordingly the firewall will pass i.e. not block or delay the traffic entering the first premises IP Network area . Such traffic may include communications as part of a fax transmission being sent either from the fax device A to the fax device B or from the fax device B to the fax device A.

It is noted that the transport application layer of the opened established session can be by way of non limiting example a TCP session which may include a persistent connection to maintain the session or communication link. Also a network security protocol e.g. TLS or SSL optionally may be applied to the opened established session as well to advantageously guard against so called network packet snooping in which an unintended third party is able to view data packets and in turn to assemble the data that is transmitted so as to gain or facilitate unauthorized access to the fax devices A B.

Once the opened established communication session is provided the first premises IP network area is connected to the fax transfer server via connection and without interference or delay caused by the firewall enabling a fax to be sent from a fax device A to a fax device B in real time During the fax transmission process the first intermediary device A may provide instructions to the fax transfer client to create a fax session such instructions including information that can be used to complete the fax call placement and such instructions being processed with predetermined routing rules or by the fax transfer client intercepting the traffic generated by the first intermediary device A.

The fax transfer client contacts or notifies the fax transfer server to request that a fax call be generated to the second intermediary device B for transmission to a fax device B using a feasible call control method e.g. Session Initiation Protocol SIP known to one of ordinary skill in the art. In a embodiment of the system where a firewall is present or where it is desired to protect the fax transfer client from direct communication with the second intermediary device B messages generated in response to this request by the fax transfer server generally can be proxied on behalf of the fax transfer client by the fax transfer server .

It is noted that the fax transfer server may be responsible for other optional fax transfer clients not shown in addition to the fax transfer client wherein such other fax transfer clients do not factor directly into the sending of a fax from the fax device A to the fax device B. In such a case although the fax transfer server generally can maintain client information for each fax transfer client i.e. the fax transfer client plus some or all of the other fax transfer clients it can generally maintain connection establishment information to the specific second intermediary device B that is involved in the current transmission.

Moreover if in furtherance of the exemplary system of all traffic from the fax transfer client passes through the fax transfer server the fax transfer server can function as a central point for all fax communication. This type of arrangement is beneficial because as a central access point the fax transfer server can provide desirable services such as value add services.

Value add services can be provided by and thus beneficial to one or more of various parties who implement or are involved in the process of implementing using enabling setting up or selling systems or access to systems such as the exemplary system depicted in . For example carriers i.e. those authorized by governmental or other regulatory agencies to operate telecommunications systems can integrate certain features or services into the exemplary system to offer to their customers whether business customers or residential customers.

Value add services can be provided for example by integrating the carrier s own network equipment and or that of other third parties with one or more pieces of equipment within the system such as the fax transfer server . shows the exemplary system of as part of a larger scale value add network . Among the services such integration can enable or facilitate including value add services are fax redirect secure fax retrieval and archiving.

In accordance with or in furtherance of fax redirect services as implemented in a network such as the value add network the presence and functioning of the fax transfer server provides a facility that can be used to define rules that specify which one or more of the fax devices A will receive inbound facsimile messages for example. One or more predetermined configurations or rules can be implemented at the fax transfer server or implemented at another area or device e.g. a remote access user configuration server that is in communication with the fax transfer server . The one or more configurations or rules can provide fax routing to permit inbound faxes to be routed to one or more recipient fax devices A. In accordance with the one or more configurations or rules the inbound faxes can be redirected to one or more recipient fax devices A to which the inbound faxes were not necessarily addressed or intended for delivery. For example the fax redirect service can route in bound faxes to other than the intended recipient or addressed devices which may not have otherwise been the case had the fax redirect service not been in place. For example depicts a plurality of recipient fax devices A any one or more of which can be specified as a recipient device in accordance with a fax redirect service. Implementation of a fax redirect service can have important benefits and added value for customers of a value add network such as being able to steer fax traffic to certain fax devices A B in general or in particular to prevent faxes from going to fax devices that may be or are known to be unattended.

In accordance with or in furtherance of a secure fax retrieval service implemented in the context of the value add network of inbound faxes are held by the fax transfer server on behalf of a subscriber to the service without being delivered to the fax device A to which the fax was sent. For the inbound faxes to be held one or more predetermined configurations or rules can be implemented at the fax transfer server or at another area or device e.g. a remote access user configuration server that is in communication with the fax transfer server . The one or more configurations or rules can be enabled or disabled as desired to control whether the service such as fax retrieval is active or not.

By way of non limiting example a business may have one or more employees to whom a secure fax retrieval service is made available where in the non limiting context of three such employees are shown. It is noted that the number of employees can be greater or less than the three that are shown in . If the secure fax retrieval service is in place and active faxes that are associated with such employees or their respective fax device s A are held at fax transfer server or elsewhere within the network rather than being delivered to the intended fax device A. The employee to whom the fax is addressed or is intended to be sent is notified e.g. via email SMS phone call or the like as to the receipt of the fax and permitted to log in to a system not shown so as to view the fax e.g. as an tiff image . The employee may be permitted to have the fax sent to the employee via a predetermined method such as via an email attachment or by having the fax forwarded to a fax device A associated with the employee or to any fax device reachable via the PSTN such as via connections A or B.

Fax retrieval services can be beneficial to a wide variety of customers of value add networks like that which is shown in . For example employees can benefit who use or have access to one or more fax devices A associated with the customer but who are often or always not located at the specific site of the fax device s A such as employees who work remotely or who frequently travel. This type of fax retrieval service which can be viewed as a value add service is also beneficial to customers of carriers where the customers and or its employees utilize a shared public fax device and prefer to maintain the security of its their inbound faxes.

System of may also be used to archive fax messages that are sent or received. A fax archiving service can be useful in general but has particular value for companies that routinely send or receive faxes to comply with data protection retention regulations guidelines or laws that exist in the United States and or other countries e.g. HIPAA Sarbanes Oxley. For example retention of fax messages to show compliance can be difficult to manage when a relatively large number of faxes are sent or received. The fax archive service can help to meet the challenge of fax retention for compliance purposes.

A fax archiving service can be used in connection with the value add network of whereby one or more predetermined configurations or rules can be implemented at the fax transfer server or implemented at another area or device e.g. a remote access user configuration server that is in communication with the fax transfer server . In accordance with the one or more configurations or rules the fax transfer server can be configured to automatically retain archive information with regard to inbound and or outbound faxes. The archive information can be stored for example in an archive area which can be a server cluster or other known device or devices capable of archiving faxes. Subscribers are able to offload the often overburdening and stressful requirement of keeping track of subscriber inbound and or outbound faxes using the fax archive service.

The capabilities of the value add network of also can incorporate applications or solutions that have been written generally but not necessarily by a third party not associated with the network or its customers that provide additional value add services without in most cases requiring additional equipment to be purchased for or used on the network. For example the fax transfer server can include an application programming interface API that allows for applications to interact with and or provide functionality to the network .

Application based value add services can be implemented on the network that allow for the sending and or receiving of faxes to be automated. For example inbound faxes can be examined e.g. via optical character recognition to determine if they have certain characteristics that would be consistent with a specific type of document that should be routed to a specific fax device A. Such routing can take place even if the fax device A to which a fax is routed is different than the fax device to which the facsimile message was originally destined. As another example value add services can be implemented to cause the first intermediary device A to perform functionality normally performed by a fax device A for example outbound faxes can be sent out without having to physically feed documents into the a fax device A.

Also applications can provide rules configurations or gating that apply to some or all inbound or outbound faxes sent to or from the system . Example implementations may be for security or approval related purposes or in the case of inbound faxes to try to avoid spam messages from reaching recipients. Moreover such applications can enable fax devices A particularly fax devices implemented as MFPs to better integrate with the system to allow for certain services e.g. compliance archiving to be performed or to facilitate such services.

The value add network of also can provide or preserve important business opportunities relating to billing. This function is important because as migration away from PSTN based faxing occurs or continues fax hosting service providers and providers of other services desire to be able to bill for such services. In accordance with a fax billing service implemented in or via the value add network an application residing on the API of the fax transfer server provides data to a billing server . The provided data can be selected with regard to criteria that is either reestablished by the application or chosen by a service provider. For example such criteria might include but not be limited to billing on a per page received and or sent basis billing on a transmission time basis etc.

Alternatively or in addition the value add network also can allow a fax service entity e.g. provider carrier wholesaler reseller to reduce costs associated with the network. For example the value add network permits reduced toll costs as well as maximized off peak hours for appropriate fax traffic via what is referred to as least cost routing and or fax broadcasting .

Another benefit of the exemplary system and in particular the fax transfer server is that the fax transfer server is able to validate software running on the fax transfer client when the communication session connection is established. The established connection permits the fax transfer server to have the opportunity to provide software and data validation on the fax transfer client and to provide software and data revisions to the fax transfer client executing software. Because the software validation can be initiated by the fax transfer server to the fax transfer client using the established communication the benefit of software revisions can be performed from outside the IP network area . For example software revisions to fax transfer client can be performed without the assistance of personnel located within or otherwise having access to the IP network area .

Call control messages are generated by the second intermediary device B in response to the request by the fax transfer server and are received by the fax transfer server . The second intermediary device B can be unaware of being connected to the fax transfer client via connection in this circumstance. The fax transfer server can be proxied to the fax transfer client and the call control messages will be exchanged between the fax transfer server and the fax transfer client . The previously established communication session between the fax transfer client and the fax transfer server can prevent the presence of the firewall or other communication restriction elements from restricting communications. The desired media protocol for the communication session can thus be maintained by forming a connection through which a real time fax transmission can occur via the system . In accordance with the exemplary system of the fax transfer client will be responsible for maintaining the real time protocol requirements of T.30 to enable the real time nature of the fax call to be preserved. Doing so can include steps e.g. so called T.30 spoofing techniques to keep active the communication session should any issues arise e.g. network delays or drop outs .

As noted above the system of is also applicable to a scenario whereby a fax is desired to be sent from fax device s B to fax device s A. In accordance with such an embodiment the system will function similarly to how it has been described above however there can be adjustments to the equipment and or the process to realize such an embodiment. For example under such circumstances call establishment can originate from the fax transfer server to the fax transfer client .

The exemplary system functions in contrast to conventional fax transmission systems which do not include or incorporate a previously opened established communication session between the fax transfer client and the fax transfer server as is described herein. Therefore in connection with a conventional system a fax session response originating from outside of the first premises IP Network area will be treated by the firewall as an unsolicited message thus causing the session to be blocked or delayed which will negate prevent the real time nature of the fax communication session or which as noted herein and below can only achieve real time transmission at the expense of accompanying security vulnerability to the IP Network.

Another distinguishing aspect of the system is that it allows for selection of the IP ports that will be used to open the communication session between the fax transfer client and the fax transfer server . In the system the fax transfer client and the fax transfer server include network endpoints that function as IP ports between which data is sent via the IP network as in known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Of the currently more than 65000 usable IP ports that those in the range of 0 zero to 1023 are so called Well Known Ports and those in the range of 1024 to 49151 are so called Registered Ports and the remaining ports currently 49152 to 65535 are so called Dynamic and or Private Ports. Among these IP ports however there is no named designated port for T.38 or fax usage. Therefore in accordance with conventional fax systems seeking to achieve real time fax transmissions what generally occurs is that the IP port selected is one within the Dynamic range i.e. one of the IP Ports from 49152 to 65535. In order to attempt to achieve real time fax transmission under such circumstances the firewall is configured to allow for all unsolicited traffic in this entire Dynamic port range. Thus a tradeoff can occur whereby if real time fax transmission is to occur the consequence that the private IP Network within the firewall can be vulnerable to security breaches or malicious content attacks.

Conversely in accordance with the system of it is not necessary to configure the firewall to allow for all unsolicited traffic in entire Dynamic port range. Because there has been a previously established session between the fax transfer client and the fax transfer server the firewall can be configured differently than in the conventional manner that allows for all unsolicited traffic in the entire Dynamic port range. Moreover it is possible in accordance with the system to use not only any of the Dynamic ports in furtherance of the fax transmission session but also any of the IP ports within the Well Known Ports or Registered Ports ranges in addition or instead. Accordingly specific IP ports need not be but can be see below pre selected in order for real time fax to occur. In addition the real time nature of the fax transmission is possible without requiring new expensive equipment to be purchased or installed as part of the system and without necessitating special procedures to occur. In other words the real time fax transmission in accordance with the system may occur within the same or shorter time frame as compared to a normal i.e. non real time fax transmission and in general can outwardly appear to all parties involved to be substantially similar or identical to a conventional fax transmission that occurs via IP or PSTN.

It should be noted however that the system can support an embodiment whereby there is pre selection of the IP ports that will be used. For example it may be beneficial such as for compatibility between networks or in view of the level of security desired to select certain IP ports for use including but not limited to port hypertext transfer protocol i.e. http or port hypertext transfer protocol with security i.e. https .

Referring now to a flow diagram describes an alternative embodiment of the system of but still an embodiment in which real time fax transmission can occur. In accordance with this alternative embodiment the fax transfer client can determine an optimal or at least a preferred method to establish a real time fax transmission session. Such a determination can have numerous benefits among which is that the receiving fax device s B can be changed on the fly such as during a transmission session or modified or relocated thus providing added flexibility to the system particularly in the modern era where there is decreasing reliance on standalone fax devices.

At block of the exemplary embodiment of the fax transfer client registers itself with a routing database not shown which can be co located with the fax transfer server or can be separately located. Thereafter at block the fax transfer client processes the dial string provided by the sending fax device s A after which at decision block the fax transfer client determines if it has a known or previously defined method to establish a real time fax transmission session with the second fax device B. If not then the fax transfer client requests from the routing database an indication as to whether an alternate transmission method is available block . Such a request results in a decision being made at decision block . If an alternate method is available then the fax transfer client stores the alternative session method and uses the method to cause the fax transmission to occur via real time block . If no alternate method is available however then the fax transmission session is established with a PSTN conventional fax session block .

Referring back to decision block if there is a known or previously defined alternate method to establish a real time fax transmission session with the receiving fax device s B then the fax transmission utilizes the previously defined method block and the real time fax transmission occurs as described above in connection with the system of . At decision block a determination is made as to whether the fax transmission is successful i.e. that the fax transmission was completely transmitted without errors. If the transmission is deemed successful then at block the fax session is terminated. If however the transmission is not considered successful then the alternate transmission method is removed from the fax transfer client block and the fax transmission session is established with a PSTN conventional fax session block .

After the fax transmission session is established with a PSTN conventional fax session block whether block is reached via block or block the second fax device B may or may not contact the first fax device A with information regarding an alternative fax transmission method decision block . If such contact occurs then the fax transfer client stores the alternate fax transmission method for future reference block and the fax transmission either is completed normally block or the flow diagram could be expanded at this point to reestablish the fax transmission using the alternate transmission method. If however such contact does not occur then the fax transmission session is completed normally block .

Although the methodology depicted in the flow diagram of has been described herein as being implementable in the context of the system of it should be noted that such methodology can be implemented in whole or in part in other fax based systems whether they are real time systems or conventional non real time systems and or in fax based systems that utilize the same or different equipment than what is depicted in the system. By way of non limiting example such other fax based systems can include more complex networks and or multiple party networks such as the network depicted in .

Moreover it is further noted that the various systems and methods described and depicted herein also can be applicable to non fax communications for any media based transmission including but not limited to voice or video transmissions that utilize IP ports in furtherance of a transmission in a client server model setting. The described systems and methods applied to non fax communications also allow such media based transmissions to occur in real time full duplex as defined by the applicable protocol s for the particular medium. As with the system such transmissions are enabled because a previously established session between the client side of the client server model which in the case of the system is the fax transfer client and the server side of the client server model which in the case of the system is the fax transfer server may be utilized in the transmission of the media e.g. voice video being transmitted.
