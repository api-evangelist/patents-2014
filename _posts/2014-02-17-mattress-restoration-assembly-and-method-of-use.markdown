The present invention relates to mattresses and mattress pads and more particularly pertains to a new Mattress Restoration Assembly and Method of Use for filling in body impressions formed in a mattress over time to provide additional support and to provide additional user comfort for worn mattresses.

The use of mattress pads and mattress repair systems is known in the prior art. More specifically mattress repair systems heretofore devised and utilized are known to consist basically of familiar expected and obvious structural configurations notwithstanding the myriad of designs encompassed by the crowded prior art which have been developed for the fulfillment of countless objectives and requirements.

One such illustrative example is United States Patent Application Publication 2006 0117486 which requires a user to open up a mattress to be repaired terminating any warranty and to insert one or more inflatable bladders to provide additional support.

In these respects the Mattress Restoration Assembly according to the present invention substantially departs from the conventional concepts and designs of the prior art and in so doing provides an apparatus primarily developed for the purpose of providing additional support filling in impressions caused by collapsed foam padding or other support means.

In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the known types of mattress repair systems now present in the prior art the present invention provides a new Mattress Restoration System and Method of Use wherein the same can be utilized for filling in impressions formed in the mattress provide additional support and improve user comfort.

To attain this the present invention generally comprises a mattress abutting cover member positionable on the mattress to be restored at least one support member operationally coupled to the mattress abutting cover member a top cover member positioned over the mattress abutting cover member and the support member and a securing means for selectively securing the mattress restoration assembly to the mattress.

There has thus been outlined rather broadly the more important features of the invention in order that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated. There are additional features of the invention that will be described hereinafter and which will form the subject matter of the claims appended hereto.

In this respect before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and to the arrangements of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced and carried out in various ways. Also it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein are for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.

As such those skilled in the art will appreciate that the conception upon which this disclosure is based may readily be utilized as a basis for the designing of other structures methods and systems for carrying out the several purposes of the present invention. It is important therefore that the claims be regarded as including such equivalent constructions insofar as they do not depart from the spirit and scope of the present invention.

One significant advantage of the present invention is the ability to fill in impressions formed in the mattress over time with a new support member such as a poly foam rather than trying to push a collapsed or failed foam support into position with an air bladder.

Another significant advantage of the present invention is the ability to fill in the impressions formed into the mattress and to provide additional support without voiding the warranty of the mattress.

Further advantages of the invention along with the various features of novelty which characterize the invention are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed to and forming a part of this disclosure. For a better understanding of the invention its operating advantages and the specific objects attained by its uses reference should be made to the accompanying drawings and descriptive matter in which there are illustrated preferred embodiments of the invention.

With reference now to the drawings and in particular to thereof a new mattress restoration assembly embodying the principles and concepts of the present invention and generally designated by the reference numeral will be described.

The mattress restoration assembly at its most basic includes at least one impression filling member which is positioned in an impression formed in a mattress to be restored and a mattress topper assembly which may be positioned on top of the mattress to be restored and the impression filling member .

In at least one preferred embodiment the mattress restoration assembly includes a first impression filling member and a second impression filling member . The first impression filling member may be trimmed by a user to substantially fit within and at least partially fill the impression to be filled. Preferably the first impression filling member has a thickness between 0.25 and 2 inches and more preferably is approximately 1 inch. The second impression filling member may also be trimmed by a user to substantially fit within and at least partially fill the impression to be filled. Preferably the second impression filling member has a thickness between 0.25 and 2 inches and more preferably is 0.5 inches in thickness. The user may use both the first impression filling member and the second impression filling member to substantially fill in an impression in the mattress. Further the user may use the first impression filling member or the second impression filling member individually repetitively or in combination as desired to fill the impressions in the mattress.

The use may affix either the first or second impression filling member to the mattress or to the mattress topper assembly or to each other. From the perspective of maintaining warranty coverage for the mattress it is preferable that the impression filling members be affixed to the mattress topper assembly . Typically the impression filling members are affixed using an adhesive.

The present invention also contemplates the instance where a user prefers to have the impression filling members cut to size and affixed to the mattress topper assembly by the factory rather than performing these operations themselves. In such a case the impression geometry needs to be determined communicated and utilized to produce a custom restoration assembly.

Generally the impression filling members are made from poly foam gel foam memory foam latex synthetic latex fabric pad or thermal pad. The first and second impression filling members may be made from different materials or the same materials.

Similarly the mattress topper assembly may consist of one or more layers each of which may be made from poly foam gel foam memory foam latex synthetic latex fabric pad or thermal pad.

In at least one embodiment the mattress topper assembly includes a main support member and a main covering member . The main support member is designed cover the top surface of the mattress to be restored. The main covering member covers the top surface and a perimeter edge surface of said main support member .

In a further embodiment the mattress topper assembly includes multiple support members . Support members may be oriented in longitudinally or laterally and may cover substantially all of the top surface of the mattress or a portion of the top surface of the mattress.

In still a further embodiment the mattress topper assembly includes a plurality of spring assemblies positioned in a spaced array along a length of the assembly and either along approximately one half of the width of the assembly or along substantially the whole width of the assembly . Generally the plurality of spring assemblies is positioned underneath the main support member.

In yet a further embodiment the mattress topper assembly also includes a lumbar support member which generally runs laterally along a central third of the mattress topper assembly .

In still a further embodiment the mattress topper assembly includes a hip support member which generally runs laterally along a central third of the mattress topper . The hip support member is generally positioned substantially above the main support member .

The mattress topper assembly may also include a lower cover member designed to abut the top surface of the mattress and operationally coupled to the main covering member .

The mattress restoration assembly may also described in terms of filling support zones defined in the mattress without diverging from the present invention. One such embodiment described in terms of support zones may be described as follows. Such an embodiment may include a plurality of longitudinal support members . Each one of the longitudinal support members is uniquely associated with a longitudinal support zone of the mattress where additional support is desired. Each one of said plurality of longitudinal support members comprises a material selected from the group of materials consisting of poly foam gel foam memory foam latex synthetic latex fabric pad and thermal pad. Each one of the plurality of longitudinal support members comprises a material with an indentation load deflection coefficient corresponding to an amount of support and firmness desired for the associated longitudinal support zone. Such an embodiment may also include at least one lateral support member . Each lateral support member is uniquely associated with a lateral support zone of the mattress where additional support is desired.

An illustrative example of a lateral support member is a support member designed to provide lumbar support and is positioned substantially at a center third of the mattress.

Another illustrative example of a lateral support member is designed to provide hip support and is positioned substantially at a center third of the mattress and provides an increase in height of the mattress restoration assembly.

The lateral support zones and longitudinal support zones may overlap and lateral support members and longitudinal support members may overlap each other.

In at least one embodiment the mattress restoration assembly also includes a securing means selected from the group of restoration securing means consisting of a drawstring extending around a lower perimeter of the restoration assembly at least one elastic member extending around the lower perimeter of the restoration assembly a plurality of strap members extending outwardly from the restoration assembly and positionable under the mattress and at least one portion of hook and loop fastener . indicates the securing means along with implementations of either the elastic member or drawstring as shown by reference number a strap member as shown by reference number and a portion of hook and loop fastener as shown by reference item . Each of these securing means may be used individually.

With respect to the above description then it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the invention to include variations in size materials shape form function and manner of operation assembly and use are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the present invention.

Therefore the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention. Further since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described and accordingly all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to falling within the scope of the invention.
