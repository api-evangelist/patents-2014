title: Stovetop fire suppressor with thermal glass bulb actuation and method
abstract: An automatic stovetop fire suppressor using a compressed spring to lower a bottom lid upon thermal glass bulb fracture is provided herein. A plastic lid seals on the bottom of a can and forms a closed container. The closed container is filled with a fire suppressing agent. A compressed spring extends when a thermal glass bulb fractures. The extending spring lowers the bottom lid to open the closed container. Fire suppressing agent flows out of the radial opening, suppressing a stovetop fire with minimal or no splashing of cooking oil. A center post is secured to a top wall of the container. A ledge, or bottom support, secured to the container catches the bottom lid to limit the radial opening height. A gradual release of a fire suppressing agent in a desired distribution pattern and method of gradual and spatial agent release can be provided with a cone-shaped bottom lid.
