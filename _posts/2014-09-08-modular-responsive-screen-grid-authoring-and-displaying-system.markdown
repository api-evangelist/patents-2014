The present application claims priority to co pending U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 875 343 filed on Sep. 9 2013 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The present disclosure relates to media content aggregation. More particularly an example embodiment described in the disclosure relates to a modular responsive screen grid authoring and displaying system.

In a first aspect of the disclosure a method is described the method comprising a method comprising presenting to a user of a first computer a plurality of layout formats wherein each of plurality the layout formats is user selectable for dividing a viewing area of the first computer area into a corresponding plurality of cells creating a single page document which based on a user selection of one of the plurality of layout formats divides the displayed viewing area into the plurality of cells corresponding thereto assigning to each cell of the selected plurality a corresponding item of media content designated from among a plurality of media content items according to a user selection and rendering the created single page document over the divided viewing area based on the assigning wherein the rendered document comprises one or more of each of the media content items displayed within each of the corresponding cells or upon activating an interface associated with a selected cell of the document one or more of an expanded view or an enlarged view of the media content items or a view thereof which is displaced spatially in relation to the selected cell.

In a second aspect of the disclosure a device is described the device comprising a device comprising a bus a processor coupled with the bus a display viewing area coupled with the bus means coupled with the bus and operable to receive input from a user means coupled with the bus and operable to send and receive single page messages and a non transitory storage medium coupled with the bus and comprising instructions which are tangibly stored therewith and executable by the processor wherein upon executing the stored instructions the processor is operable for performing or controlling a process which comprises presenting to a user of a first computer a plurality of layout formats wherein each of plurality the layout formats is user selectable for dividing a viewing area of the first computer area into a corresponding plurality of cells creating a single page document which based on a user selection of one of the plurality of layout formats divides the displayed viewing area into the plurality of cells corresponding thereto assigning to each cell of the selected plurality a corresponding item of media content designated from among a plurality of media content items according to a user selection and rendering the created single page document over the divided viewing area based on the assigning wherein the rendered document comprises one or more of each of the media content items displayed within each of the corresponding cells or upon activating an interface associated with a selected cell of the document one or more of an expanded view or an enlarged view of the media content items or a view thereof which is displaced spatially in relation to the selected cell.

In a third aspect of the disclosure a device is described the device comprising a processor a display viewing area means to receive input from a user and means to send and receive single page messages wherein the display viewing area is divided into cells based on a layout chosen by the user thereby constituting a single page message wherein the cells are configured to display content items.

An example embodiment of the present invention relates to a method which comprises presenting to a user of a first computer a plurality of layout formats wherein each of the plurality of layout formats is user selectable for dividing a viewing area of the first computer area into a corresponding plurality of cells which is unique in relation to the other layout formats. A single page document is created which based on a user selection of one of the plurality of layout formats divides the displayed viewing area into the unique plurality of cells corresponding thereto. A corresponding item of media content is assigned to each cell of the selected unique plurality designated from among a plurality of media content items according to a user selection. The created single page document is rendered over the divided viewing area based on the assignment. The rendered document comprises one or more of each of the media content items displayed within each of the corresponding cells and upon activating an interface associated with a selected cell of the document one or more of an expanded view or an enlarged view of the media content items or a view thereof which is displaced spatially in relation to the selected cell.

Example embodiments of the present invention are described in relation to a method which comprises presenting to a user of a first computer a plurality of layout formats wherein each plurality of the layout formats is user selectable for dividing a viewing area of the first computer area into a corresponding plurality of cells which is unique in relation to the other layout formats.

A single page document is created which based on a user selection of one of the plurality of layout formats divides the displayed viewing area into the unique plurality of cells corresponding thereto. As used herein e.g. in this paragraph the previous two paragraphs and the next following paragraph as well as elsewhere within the present specification and claims the term unique refers to the set of spatial space filling appearance related and or other characteristics of a given certain particular selected designated example etc. individual layout format of the plurality of available layout formats as corresponding to that given layout format but that set of characteristics of the given layout format does not correspond to other layout formats of the plurality of available layout formats.

A corresponding item of media content is assigned to each cell of the selected unique plurality designated from among a plurality of media content items according to a user selection.

The rendered document comprises one or more of each of the media content items displayed within each of the corresponding cells or upon activating an interface associated with a selected cell of the document one or more of an expanded view or an enlarged view of the media content items or a view thereof which is displaced spatially in relation to the selected cell.

The present application thus describes systems and methods for online publishing and reading which permit the publication of multimedia contents with a strong visual impact in a full page uniting and mixing different types of media content. The system or instruments and methods can be used for publishing and as a service for online social networking. The system and methods allow users to read and write messages comprising for example images text audio files videos live video feeds and weblinks comprising links to other messages. A single message comprising the above elements represents a minimal unit of information. The message comprises a rectangular grid structure which can be configured by the user. The content of the message can be interactive such as allowing the insertion of text images or videos. The grid structure can be used in a tablet or a smartphone such as the devices visible in or other computers such as a desktop or laptop computer and any type of display.

The present application describes a visual platform for the messages created by a user. The message comprises content formatted in a single page message composed on a flexible and customizable grid for example made of 12 or 15 cells .

The users can mix content in a new and playful way. For example a user can compose a message by mixing different kinds of content texts files images videos sounds files link etc. directly on the cells of the grid . Content may also include API Application Program Interface accessible data PDF files and issue publications.

Cells can be merged in order to create larger areas for content. The methods described in the present application apply very well to photography. For example users can insert their own visual content by accessing images and media files directly from a tablet smartphone or the web or by uploading images see from their account on other social networks like Instagram or Flickr . The images and media files can be stored in the cloud a decentralized network of storage servers as understood by the person skilled in the art. Content may reside on the web and may include mixxied or other mashed in data.

Messages can be composed stored and viewed for example on a tablet or smartphone app or website. The users can share a message within an online community of users or alternatively the users may use the main social networks like Facebook and Twitter or send it directly to other users.

Users can connect to each other deciding to follow other users of for example receiving regular updates of messages created by other users.

The core content comprises a customizable one page grid divided into modules called cells for example of . There can be two main parent grids 3 4 and 3 5 modules. However other grid templates may be used.

The two main parent grids can be termed M15 3 5 and M12 3 4 and are the two classical grid composition boards. Several other templates are based on these two grids M15 and M12.

Users can choose from among various grids based on preference or which parent grid better suits their needs. For example some users may find that the square grid M12 can be used more suitably for displaying content such as square images like those accessed from Instagram and or for text intensive messages. Some users may find that the rectangular grid M15 can be better suited for compositions with classical 4 3 format images.

In mobile devices such as tablets or smartphones the grid can adapt automatically to the screen of the device by automatically resizing.

On laptop computers the grid can adapt in height showing always the message in its entirety. The type of dividing lines of the grid can be changed or removed at any moment. For example the dividing lines of can be removed as in . The lines in are not actual dividing lines in the real message but are only drawn in for representative purposes to illustrate herein a separation between cells of a message.

Cell behaviour is illustrated in . Users can put contents in one cell for example in or can merge more cells together in order to create a larger cell such as to accommodate contents to achieve the desire visual effect. Cells can be enlarged by merging more cells together .

Merged cells can be split back to their original size. Cell content can be moved from one position to another on the grid. Moving a cell s content from one position to another exchanges the content between the starting cell and the ending cell.

Users can drag the content into a different position. The two contents get swapped without changing the cell size. Users can also move a cell from one position to another using positioning arrows.

A cell can be enlarged as long as there are available cells nearby . A cell and its content can be deleted. A deleted cell is substituted with a standard empty cell.

In the basic message a message not yet customized with user content the first upper left cell can be termed the author cell and the second cell in the first row can be termed the title cell 

An example embodiment may be implemented in which an author cell is neither moved nor enlarged e.g. the author cell cannot be moved nor enlarged . An example embodiment may be implemented in which the title cell is resizable within the designated title cell position e.g. the title cell can be resized or enlarged in the same row but is not or cannot be moved therefrom .

An example embodiment described with reference to of the present application is based on single page messages with a strong visual impact. The message comprises a single page which fills the display of a device such as a tablet. An example embodiment may be implemented in which each cell of a message is filled for publication thereof e.g. a message must have every cell filled before it can be published .

In an example embodiment messages comprise a minimal content unit e.g. the message is the minimal unit with which content may be published . The message is characterized by a series of blocks located inside the cells of the grid. These blocks can cover one or more cells and can be dimensioned following appropriate rules.

An example embodiment may be implemented in which any message has at least two special blocks e.g. the message always has two special blocks which cannot be removed . The at least two special non removable blocks of the message comprise the author block and the title block .

A group of messages can be shown in a list. The elements of the list e.g. the messages comprise a preview image a title and some additional information such as date of publication number of likes number of comments and the collection to which the message belongs.

TEXT The font or character size of text can be defined in a template. The dimensions can be increased or reduced automatically based on the amount of text written. The user can insert the text directly into the block of the grid.

IMAGE The user can insert an image in the corresponding cell based on a number of options which are available such as snapping a picture in the moment choosing a picture from a gallery in the device used such as a smartphone or tablet choosing a picture from a gallery in the cloud or importing the picture from other services such as social networks and online galleries.

The picture can be saved in the memory of the device and in the cloud space of the system. As shown in the picture can be inserted in the cell centered and enlarged to fill the whole space available in the cell .

The user can move rotate resize or crop the image. The resulting image still fills the space of the cell entirely see for example . The user may also edit other characteristics of the image such as tone color redeye or other appearance related aspects defects or attributes of the image within the cell.

When several cells are joined the cell can change dimensions a new cell is formed and the image is repositioned and recentered with respect to the new center of the new cell .

The picture can be shown in its entirety in full screen. The user can choose whether the full screen image is shown as the original image before editing or if instead the edited picture is shown rotated resized etc. .

SLIDESHOW Referring again to the slideshow shows a sequence of images as a type of content in one cell of the grid of a message. Ways to insert a slideshow in the cell are similar to those described above for inserting images.

VIDEO The video is shown in a cell with a thumbnail and a button which can be pressed to start play back. An example embodiment may be implemented in which pressing the play button plays the video in full screen. The video can be inserted through a link given by the service provider which is hosting the video file. Storage of the video can be local in the device used and or in the cloud.

The video can also be inserted in the cell in ways that are similar to those described above for inserting images. An example embodiment may be implemented in which a video file that is linked can also not be saved locally.

SOUND FILE An audio file can also be inserted in a cell as content. The audio file is shown with a thumbnail and a play button which can activate the sound file directly inside the grid. The audio file can be inserted in the cell through the link provided by the service provider which is hosting the audio file. Storage of the audio file can be local or in the cloud. The audio file can be inserted in ways similar to those described above for inserting images. An example embodiment may be implemented in which if an audio file is linked into the cell the audio file does not need to be saved into local memory.

EXTERNAL LINKS A user can also insert an external link directly into a cell. The cell may also contain text or images at the same time as the link. A link module can permit the creation of a hypertextual link with a different message or with an external web link.

ADVERTISING An advertising e.g. media content such as an ad or advert image or the like which is primarily associated with an advertisement commercial or otherwise item can be displayed within the message with a similar modality as that which displays other content e.g. as described above .

An advertising module can comprise of any type of content block as described above such as an image block or a video block. An advertising module can occupy one or more cells and be integrated in the layout of the message. It is possible to remove or move the advertisement directly to see the entire message or at least expand the visible portion thereof which is unobstructed or unoccluded by the ad . An example embodiment may be implemented in which the removal of the advertisement can be done by paying a subscription or one off charge rendering a token or in which the ad is at least diminished minimized reduced softened removed or dissolved etc. after expiration of a time period set for its display or upon achievement of some other criterion or remains available for full or other display but is otherwise then obstructed obscured or occluded by the other non advertising related media content either automatically or upon a related user action.

MAPS A user can insert also a map module . The map module displays a map from a third party service. The user can choose a place or address and the service identifies the place by showing its location on the map. The map covers always the entire space available to the cell.

The message described in the present application can be public or private. When it is public it is visible to all users. When it is private it can be of two modalities. In a first modality it is visible only to certain users selected by the users private publishing .

In a second private modality the message is part of a private collection visible only to a group of people selected by the user private publishing in collection .

To create a new message the user can choose the option to create a new message as shown in the example dashboard depicted in .

Referring to the system can then show a configurable empty grid. The user can tap on a quadrant and the system displays an icon representative of the possible content to be inserted. The user can swipe the screen to scroll down types of content or can choose a type.

The user can tap on the screen to confirm the content choice. The system can show the procedure to insert the specific content. Possible contents are discussed below.

TEXT A cursor can be displayed directly in the selected cell. The entire keyboard can be displayed. The text which is entered by the user can be resized automatically based on its length.

IMAGE Options can be displayed that permit to choose the source of the image. A reference gallery can be chosen and the image can be inserted. The image can be automatically centered with respect to the dimension ratio of the cell. Afterwards it is possible to modify the image based on the necessary edits such as cropping rotation resizing etc. 

MAPS AUDIO VIDEO Options can be chosen to insert an address for a map or a reference link for an audio or video file. The system incorporates automatically the external content.

LINK To insert a link in a cell a panel of options can be displayed for the link. The system automatically inserts a link and a thumbnail extracted from the content. For text and image cells the link can be displayed as a secondary information with respect to the image and the text and can be inserted through an option panel specifically of the cell which hosts the link.

During editing the user can save the message at any time or the message may be automatically saved by the system.

An example embodiment may be implemented in which at the end of the editing the user can publish the message only if all the cells have been edited. An example embodiment may thus be implemented in which all messages are complete e.g. a published message cannot exist if the pre publication form precursive to the message such as a message draft is not complete .

A user can save a message as a draft even if not completed. A draft message is not published. A user can publish a message subsequently once the cells have been edited . A user can publish a private message . A user can save or delete a message .

A user can flag the message as inappropriate and if he is the owner of the message the user can modify the message .

A user can share the message through common social networks such as Facebook Twitter and Pinterest or through email.

A user can express an appreciation or like with a voting function or button. When appreciating something the message is automatically inserted into the collection of favorites .

The grid can fluidly reflow. The informative content of the grid is not altered if the display dimensions are changed based on what device is used during visualization.

The dimensions of the cells can adapt to the optimal size automatically as a function of the display size without any additional actions on the part of the user.

For screens with a width in excess of 1024 pixels e.g. desktop visualization the grid can expand to fill the entire height of the screen available preserving a ratio of 3 4 or 3 5 see e.g. .

For screens with a width equal or less than 1024 pixels e.g. smartphone or tablet visualization the grid can expand to cover the entire screen both in width and height preserving the correct proportions between the single cells see e.g. .

The message as the principal content comprises an element based on other types of content. For example the message may be used for microblogging or digital publishing. The other content is forms of aggregations of the base message and provide different possibilities depending on the type of aggregation.

THE PROJECT the project comprises a logic subgroup of the message limited to a multi user profile. The project collects together the content of different users. The project belongs to the ecosystem but it can be reached from a different link or address.

THE COLLECTION the collection comprises a public or private collection of messages. The messages contained in the collection belonging to the user or to other users refer to the original message.

As shown in the project comprises a multi user special profile which collects one or more messages . From the user s point of view e.g. in view of the fruition of the user s intent the logic environment of the project may be considered as somewhat delimited and or separated from the general application of messages. The project is however inserted into the bigger environment of the computer application that implements the messages. The project comprises a subgroup of the computer application well defined and the project can be reached from a link which can be personalized by the user.

With reference to the structure of the project comprises macro areas a feed which contains the messages produced collections which contain collections produced authors which display the partecipants in the project and all the subscribers that is those who receive updates about the project. The project may also comprise a title a description an editable cover an image descriptive of the profile of .

With reference to the messages published in a project have a standard structure as described above. One difference with regard to normal messages is that of the special author cell which for the project messages displays information on the project .

The messages can be featured that is put on top of the list in an editorial way and fixed above the list of other messages.

Referring again to participation in the project can happen by publishing directly in the project space for users who are authorized to publish or by sending a message to the principal user the project which can collect the message and therefore make it visible in the project feed.

A project can be subscribed to by a user of which entails the reception of notifications every time the project is updated or modified.

A user in a project can take different actions. A user can send a message for publication of . A project can be flagged to allow administrators of the computer application to evaluate the content. A project can be subscribed to .

A project can be created by the owners of the computer application with a direct intervention assigning a space of publication to a specific user. Once created the user becomes administrator of the space and can decide to include other users for publication.

With reference to the collection comprises a group of messages produced by a user of . The collection can be public or private. The collection can belong to a single user or to multiple users. The collection groups the messages of the author user or of other users.

An objective of the collection is to create a system of classification available to the user and a space for collaboration between users. Thus the collection may function as a classification instrument over the message group.

The structure of a collection may comprise a feed that contains collected messages an editable cover an image descriptive of the profile of the collection a title a description of .

There is no limit on the collections that can be published. There is no limit on the number of messages that can be collected by a collection.

The collection can be public therefore visible to everybody or private. Private collections are therefore visible only to the user who created it and a designated group of other users.

A collection can be subscribed to by a user of which entails the reception of notifications every time the collection is updated or modified.

The messages within a collection can be featured that is they can be put at the top of the list over other messages and kept at the top of the list.

The messages present in a collection can be references. Removing a message from a collection does not cause the deletion of a message from the computer application.

Several actions can be taken with regard to a collection a user can subscribe to a collection in . A collection can be flagged to allow administrators to verify the content of the collection.

A collection can be created by a user who creates an empty collection and then chooses messages to include in the collection or a user can collect a message and the system can ask the user whether the user wants to insert the message in a collection either existing or new.

The favorite collection comprises a special private collection which collects all the messages which have been liked by a user.

A message when created can be a draft message which is only visible by the author and not published. As shown in the message can also be published privately of visible only by the author and a designated user. The message can be published privately and inserted into a private collection visible only to a group of users designated in the private collection.

The content inserted in a collection can each maintain their own level of visibility public or private .

An example embodiment may be implemented in which if a private collection becomes public the messages go automatically to a published state. An example embodiment may be implemented in which once it is made made public a public collection cannot return to be private or otherwise take a non public status.

The computer application defines a series of relationships between users. This system of relationships and related functions constitutes a social network theme.

The principal element of the social network is the presence of a personal profile which has a function to manifest the presence of the user through a series of functions.

The social element of the application is manifested by two other elements the project and the collection. The project permits the condivision of a space and the creation of a group of messages with a theme.

The collection permits individual activity of classification and selection but using content from the community of the application rendering the organization of the content a social activity.

With reference to the profile comprises the calling card e.g. a mark signature emblem etc. of the user within the application and the principal hub for all its content.

The profile comprises a feed which contains all the messages produced or collected collections which contain all the collections created authors which displays a social network of authors connected to the user an editable cover an image descriptive of the profile a text for identification name surname a description of .

The following actions can be taken with respect to the profile. The user can send a personal message of see also of . The profile can be flagged by a user.

The user can follow another user of . This action inserts the user into the circle of contacts and enables the user to receive notifications on published content.

The profile of a user can be shared of . The user can be inserted in a collaborative collection. The user can also be permitted to publish a project.

A personal profile is always visible as a fundamental element of recognition and belonging to the system.

There are two types of notifications 1 signals which signal the fact that something has happened and 2 suggestions which suggest content that is considered in some way interesting to the circle of contacts of the user.

Signals can notify events relative to a message that has been commented on. For example a signal may annunciate the addition of a new comment. Some such notifications may be changed or disabled according to a selected user preference e.g. it is possible to disable mute or reduce the volume tone or other characteristic of the notification signal . With respect to the published content a signal may notify of a new message a new like received a new sharing a new collection event where the message has been added to a collection.

With respect to a project the signals may notify of a new subscription to the project new content sent new content published new sharing received new collections received.

With respect to a collection the signals may notify of a new subscription a new sharing a new collection event.

Suggestions may be related to a contact of the user for example suggesting a new content inserted a new like received. With respect to the project suggestions may notify of new content published. With respect to a subscribed collection the suggestions may notify of a new content collected. With respect to the general community suggestions may notify of a new contact received.

Comments e.g. as shown in may be associated with every or any message and may comprise a feedback element for the author of the message. The comments may be displayed or displayable in a layer below the message and may always be readable or at least accessible even over several pages by bringing the underlying layer to the front.

Actions that can be taken with respect to the comments comprise inserting a new comment deleting a comment or flagging a comment as inappropriate.

In the general architecture of the application the system comprises at least two areas a general feed and a personal feed.

The general feed permits the exploration of the public content inserted in this application by users.

The personal feed permits the display of updates which allow a first user to remain up to date with the activities of at least a second user who is being followed by the first user. As used herein the term followed may relate to or take the sense in which artisans of ordinary skill in related technical fields and indeed others may understand it of monitoring or staying abreast of and or current with the second user s related ongoing activities.

When the user selects or chooses a category or a type of content the system filters the content available and shows content relative to the selected or chosen category or type.

The general feed can be ordered in in by based on or according to newest content most used or favorite content with or without a time frame most viewed content within a specified or selected time frame such as a day last week last month all featured content and or content with editorial highlights by a team of administrators of the system.

When the user chooses a type of ordering the system displays the content ordered following the type of ordering chosen by the user.

It is possible to apply an ordering type to the results obtained by applying the filters of type and category.

The personal feed permits the exploration of content produced by users that a user is following receiving updates for every new content created.

The application is structured so that it can be visible to mobile devices and desktop computers through the web. Additionally the application can provide an Application Programming Interface API which allows the utilization of core functions to exploit the functionality in applications or web applications of third parties.

The application can implemented in a specific language of the reference device. The application can be used in a tablet for example with operating systems iOS and Android. The dimensions of the specific tablet do not influence the functionalities of the application. The application automatically adapts to the display screen in a fluid way as visible in .

An application can also be implemented for smartphones. The smartphones may be implemented to have a typical form factor somewhat smaller than that characterizing most tablets and thus the version for a smartphone can be reduced with respect to that of the tablet and or somewhat more focused on the visualization and interaction with the community.

The web application can be implemented with similar functionality of the tablet application. The layout and structure can be adapted to the characteristics of the computer screen keeping in consideration the height of the frame of visualization. The fundamental characteristics of visualization can be held intact for the most common dimensions.

The focus of the application can be divided in three groups which each relate primarily to content feeds and project network and profile. These three logic visualizations are significant perhaps even fundamental in some uses for the three activities which comprise the fruition of content the presence within the network of contacts and the administration of the system. These three principal activities all relate to the creation and editing of content.

The three elements representative of these functions comprise the feed of content general feed personal feed local feeds of collections projects and profiles the personal profile and the network of users.

The web server entry point can administer every request from the different levels of the application and can direct appropriately the requests to the application server.

The server side of the application hosts the system manager of the application which provides all the interactions database access and a series of functionalities for the creation and visualization of content.

A separate server can manage the access and use of data. This differentiation between servers offers a logic separation between data and content and permits the management of a separate photo bank.

A system of APIs is created which allows third parties access to the public functions of the system and the integration of these functions within applications or web applications of third parties.

The functional libraries comprise at least a first type and a second type. The first functional library type comprises the consultation functions which allow the creation of third party services that display list or allow access to public content in the system.

A second functional library type comprises the creation functions which allow the creation of messages through an external graphical user interface of the application while remaining within the application. Thus although they are created by external systems all the content produced follow the rules of the application and remain within the application.

Starting from these functions the system makes available at least two types of preconfigurable modules which can be integrated on an external website website social network landing page and any other web service as described below.

The first type of preconfigurable module shows a preview of one or more messages made in a specific context of . It can be customized to show the number of elements that a user wants. The elements are selected in a specific space directly decided by the user among the available ones personal profile project collection etc. and selected depending on a precise criteria the last published ones the most viewed the most commented the most liked ones for example a landing page or a blog that shows the preview of the messages on a project collection or specific profile .

The second type of preconfigurable module comprises a player which can be embedded in a website of or social network or any other interactive service eg. totem or vertical screen in shopping centers as in . This player shows the selected message and gives the same type of interactions that are in the native system appreciation sharing comment etc. . Moreover this player allows a series of additional discovery functions tied to the native contest profile project or collection and to the category of the message.

The system offers a third group of functions that allow to create an automatic message. The system automatically combines a series of multimedial content given by a user in a message with a layout selected among the available ones. The system allows users to modify the initial contents or choose a new available template. All these functions are used both internally to produce an automatic message both as public APIs to develop third parties services.

The system can be used with a physical device created on purpose for the use of the application which enlarges the ecosystem of the entire system.

This physical device can be called a cam . The cam comprises a camera to take audio and video content in and a multifunctional display through which a user can interact with the system and create messages in a mobile context.

The cam can be connected to a telephone network a wireline network and or a wireless network to allow real time transmission of messages.

As shown in an example embodiment may be implemented in which certain layouts of cells for a message may be available as a choice from the user while others may be purchased separately by the user .

Every element in a message is independent from the other elements and can also be searchable. Text is not rendered as an image therefore it can be searched. Images could be searchable for example through an image search engine.

A cell may also contain and embed in a module reference to other messages or to collections of messages or to a specific author links internal to the application to profiles of a message author .

A message may also be referred to as a mixxie as it mixes different kind of content in one document while keeping the contents separate and independent.

A message or mixxie comprises a container of content in which each module can embed different kinds of digital content and the user author can define not only the kind of content but also the size and or the importance or the space that this content has relatively to the mixxie page as a whole.
