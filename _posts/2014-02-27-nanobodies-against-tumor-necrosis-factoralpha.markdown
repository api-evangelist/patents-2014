WO 04 003019 inter alia describes ligands comprising a first binding domain against TNF alpha and a second binding domain against a serum protein such as serum albumin.

It is a general object of the present invention to provide Nanobodies against TNF alpha in particular against human TNF alpha.

In particular it is an object of the present invention to provide Nanobodies against TNF alpha in particular against human TNF alpha and to provide proteins or polypeptides comprising the same that are suitable for therapeutic and or diagnostic use and in particular for the prevention treatment and or diagnosis of one or more diseases and disorders associated with and or mediated by TNF alpha such as those mentioned above and or that can be used in the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for the prevention and or treatment of one or more diseases associated with and or mediated by TNF alpha such as those mentioned above.

More in particular it is an object of the invention to provide Nanobodies against TNF alpha and to provide proteins and polypeptides comprising the same that are either an alternative to the Nanobodies and polypeptides against TNF alpha described in WO 04 041862 and or that have one or more improved properties or characteristics compared to the Nanobodies and polypeptides against TNF alpha described in WO 04 041862.

More in particular it is an object of the invention to provide Nanobodies against TNF alpha and to provide proteins or polypeptides comprising the same that are improved compared to the Nanobodies and polypeptides against TNF alpha described in WO 04 041862 with respect to one or more of the following properties or characteristics 

These objects are achieved by the Nanobodies proteins and polypeptides described herein. These Nanobodies are also referred to herein as Nanobodies of the invention and these proteins and polypeptides are also collectively referred to herein polypeptides of the invention .

Since the Nanobodies and polypeptides described herein are mainly intended for therapeutic and or diagnostic use they are directed against as defined herein human TNF alpha. It is however not excluded but also not required that Nanobodies and polypeptides described herein show cross reactivity with TNF alpha from one or more other species of warm blooded animals for example with TNF alpha from one or more other species of primates and or with TNF alpha from one or more species of animals that are often used in animal models for diseases for example mouse rat rabbit pig or dog and in particular in animal models for diseases and disorders associated with TNF alpha such as the species and animal models mentioned herein . In this respect it will be clear to the skilled person that such cross reactivity when present may have advantages from a drug development point of view since it allows the Nanobodies and polypeptides against human TNF alpha to be tested in such disease models.

The present invention is in its broadest sense also not particularly limited to or defined by a specific antigenic determinant epitope part domain subunit or confirmation where applicable of TNF alpha against which the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention are directed.

However in a preferred embodiment the Nanobodies proteins or polypeptides described herein are directed against and or can bind to an epitope of TNF alpha that lies in and or forms part of the TNF receptor binding site s e.g. the binding sites for the TNF RI THF RII also known as p55 or p75 . As is well known in the art a TNF trimer comprises three receptor binding sites which are essentially equivalent and which are formed by at the interface of two TNF monomers within the TNF trimer. For example the Nanobodies proteins or polypeptides described herein are preferably directed against and or can bind to an epitope of TNF alpha that comprises the following amino acid residues of TNF alpha Gln at position 88 Lys at position 90 and or Glu at position 146 .

In particular the Nanobodies proteins or polypeptides described herein are directed against and or can bind to an epitope of the TNF alpha trimer which lies in and or forms part of the TNF receptor binding site s . For example the Nanobodies proteins or polypeptides described herein may be directed against and or can bind to an epitope of the TNF alpha trimer that comprises the following amino acid residues Gln at position 88 and Lys at position 90 on a first TNF monomer referred to herein as monomer A and Glu at position 146 on a second TNF monomer referred to herein as monomer B in which Monomer A and Monomer B together in the TNF trimer form the TNF receptor binding site s .

More particularly the Nanobodies proteins or polypeptides described herein may be directed against and or can bind to an epitope of the TNF alpha trimer that comprises the aforementioned amino acids Gln at position 88 in monomer A Lys at position 90 in monomer A and Glu at position 146 in monomer B and in addition at least one preferably two or more more preferably 5 or more and preferably all or essentially all of the following amino acid residues of TNF alpha monomer A Gly at position 24 Gln at position 25 Thr at position 72 His at position 73 Val at position 74 Leu at position 75 Thr at position 77 Thr at position 79 Ile at position 83 Thr at position 89 Val at position 91. Asn at position 92 Ile at position 97 Arg at position 131 Glu at position 135 Ile at position 136 Asn at position 137 Arg at position 138 Pro at position 139 Asp at position 140 and the following residues in monomer B Pro at position 20 Arg at position 32 Lys at position 65 Lys at position 112 Tyr at position 115 Ala at position 145 Ser at position 147.

Alternatively the Nanobodies proteins or polypeptides described herein may be directed against and or can bind to an epitope of TNF alpha that comprises the aforementioned amino acids Gln at position 88 in monomer A Lys at position 90 in monomer A and Glu at position 146 in monomer B and in addition at least one preferably two or more more preferably 5 or more and preferably all or essentially all of the following amino acid residues of TNF alpha monomer A Leu at position 75 Thr at position 77 Thr at position 79 Ile at position 80 Ser at position 81 Tyr at position 87 Thr at position 89 Val at position 91 Asn at position 92 Ser at position 95 Ile at position 97 Glu at position 135 Ile at position 136 Asn at position 137 and the following residues in monomer B Ala at position 33 Ala at position 145 Ser at position 147.

Such epitope can be delineated from structural analysis of the nanobody crystallized in complex with the TNF molecule or from other approaches such as epitope mapping via pepscan analysis.

By comparison from crystallographic data not shown it can be seen that the Nanobody 3E from WO 04 041862 binds to a different epitope i.e. an epitope comprising Tyr at position 141 Asp at position 140 Gln at position 67 Gly at position 24 and Glu at position 23 than the preferred epitope of the invention.

Thus in another aspect the present invention relates to an immunoglobulin variable domain or a suitable fragment thereof that can bind to an epitope of TNF alpha that lies in and or forms part of the TNF receptor binding site and preferably to an epitope that comprises at least one preferably two or more and preferably all of the following amino acid residues of TNF alpha Gln at position 88 Lys at position 90 and Glu at position 146. Such an immunoglobulin variable domain is preferably a heavy chain variable domain or a light chain variable domain and in particular a heavy chain variable domain which may be any mammalian heavy chain variable domain including but not limited to human heavy chain variable domains mouse heavy chain variable domains and Camelid heavy chain variable domains such as the heavy chain variable domains from Camelid 4 chain immunoglobulins or the heavy chain variable domains VHH domains from so called heavy chain antibodies . The immunoglobulin variable domain is preferably a domain antibody or single domain antibody or suitable for use as a single domain antibody. Most preferably the immunoglobulin variable domain is a Nanobody as defined herein and some preferred but non limiting examples of Nanobodies that are suitable for use in this aspect of the invention are PMP1C2 TNF1 SEQ ID NO 52 and PMP5F10 TNF3 SEQ ID NO 60 as well as humanized and other variants thereof as further described herein .

The aforementioned immunoglobulin variable domain may also be humanized as for example and without limitation described herein with respect to Nanobodies. The invention also relates to proteins and polypeptides that comprise or essentially consist of such immunoglobulin variable domains which may for example be as defined herein. Alternatively such variable domains may form part of ScFv constructs dual specific constructs chimeric antibody or antibody structures and other immunoglobulin constructs as for example reviewed by Hoogenboom Nature Biotechnology 1997 15 125 126 . Preferably however the immunoglobulin variable domains directed against the above epitope are Nanobodies in which case the proteins and polypeptides comprising such Nanobodies may be as further described herein.

It should be noted that when a Nanobody is mentioned above as being in accordance with any one of I to V above it is at least according to one of I to V may be according to two or more of I to V and may also include any one or more of the other aspects that are indicated as being in accordance with any one of I to V above. Similarly when a protein or polypeptide is mentioned above as being in accordance with any one of VI to XVIII above it is at least according to one of VI to XVIII may be according to two or more of VI to XVIII and may also include any one or more of the other aspects that are indicated as being in accordance with any one of VI to XVIII above.

It is also within the scope of the invention that where applicable a Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention can bind to two or more antigenic determinants epitopes parts domains subunits or confirmations of TNF alpha. In such a case the antigenic determinants epitopes parts domains or subunits of TNF alpha to which the Nanobodies and or polypeptides of the invention bind may be the essentially same for example if TNF alpha contains repeated structural motifs or is present as a multimer or may be different and in the latter case the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention may bind to such different antigenic determinants epitopes parts domains subunits of TNF alpha with an affinity and or specificity which may be the same or different . Also for example when TNF alpha exists in an activated conformation and in an inactive conformation the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention may bind to either one of these conformation or may bind to both these conformations i.e. with an affinity and or specificity which may be the same or different . Also for example the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention may bind to a conformation of TNF alpha in which it is bound to a pertinent ligand may bind to a conformation of TNF alpha in which it not bound to a pertinent ligand or may bind to both such conformations again with an affinity and or specificity which may be the same or different .

It is also expected that the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention will generally bind to all naturally occurring or synthetic analogs variants mutants alleles parts and fragments of TNF alpha or at least to those analogs variants mutants alleles parts and fragments of TNF alpha that contain one or more antigenic determinants or epitopes that are essentially the same as the antigenic determinant s or epitope s to which the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention bind in TNF alpha e.g. in wild type TNF alpha . Again in such a case the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention may bind to such analogs variants mutants alleles parts and fragments with an affinity and or specificity that are the same as or that different from i.e. higher than or lower than the affinity and specificity with which the Nanobodies of the invention bind to wild type TNF alpha. It is also included within the scope of the invention that the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention bind to some analogs variants mutants alleles parts and fragments of TNF alpha but not to others.

Generally the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention will at least bind to those forms including monomeric multimeric and associated forms that are the most relevant from a biological and or therapeutic point of view as will be clear to the skilled person.

Also as TNF alpha exists in a monomeric form and in multimeric forms and in particular in trimeric form it is within the scope of the invention that the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention only bind to TNF alpha in monomeric form or that the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention in addition also bind to one or more of such multimeric forms such as the trimeric form of TNF or may only bind to such a multimeric e.g. trimeric form. Thus generally when in this description reference is made to a Nanobody protein or polypeptide that is directed to TNF alpha it should be understood that this also comprises Nanobodies directed against TNF alpha in its trimeric form including but not limited to Nanobodies against the receptor binding sites e.g. the binding sites for the TNF RI THF RII also known as p55 or p75 of such a trimer . In all these cases the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention may bind to such multimers or associated protein complexes with an affinity and or specificity that may be the same as or different from i.e. higher than or lower than the affinity and or specificity with which the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention bind to TNF alpha in its monomeric and non associated state.

Also generally polypeptides of the invention that contain two or more Nanobodies directed against TNF alpha may bind with higher avidity than the corresponding monomeric Nanobody or Nanobodies.

For example and without limitation a multivalent as defined herein protein or polypeptide that contains two or more Nanobodies that are directed against different epitopes of TNF alpha multivalent as defined herein protein or polypeptide that contains two or more Nanobodies that are directed against different epitopes of TNF alpha may bind to TNF alpha with higher avidity than the corresponding monomers.

More importantly a multivalent as defined herein protein or polypeptide that contains two or more Nanobodies that are directed against TNF alpha may and usually will bind with higher avidity to a multimer of TNF alpha than to a monomer of TNF alpha and will usually also bind with higher avidity than the corresponding monomeric Nanobodies. In such a multivalent protein or polypeptide the two or more Nanobodies may for example be directed against the same epitopes substantially equivalent epitopes or different epitopes. In one embodiment of such a multivalent protein or polypeptide the two or more Nanobodies may be the same and therefore be directed against the same epitope .

The latter is of particular importance as it is known that the primary mode of signal transduction by TNF involves crosslinking by TNF receptors by a trimer of TNF molecules which contains three receptor binding sites see for example Peppel et al. 174 1991 1483 1489 Engelmann et al. 265 1990 14497 Smith and Baglioni 264 1989 14646 . For example as described by Peppel et al. an engineered monovalent extracellular domain of the TNF receptor which was only capable of blocking a single receptor binding site on aTNF trimer was unable to prevent crosslinking of the TNF receptors by the remaining two receptor binding sites whereas an engineered protein that comprises two such extracellular domains thus being capable of blocking two receptor binding sites provided a striking efficacy compared to the monovalent extracellular domain.

In the present invention it has been found that monovalent Nanobodies are capable of binding to TNF alpha in such a way that the activity of TNF is reduced both in in vitro models in cellular models and in ex vivo models see the Experimental Section below . Although the invention is not limited to any specific mechanism explanation or hypothesis it is assumed that because of their small size and high affinity for TNF alpha two or three monovalent Nanobodies of the invention are capable of simultaneously occupying two or three different receptor binding sites on the TNF trimer thus preventing the trimer to initiate receptor crosslinking and thereby to initiate signal transduction however other mechanisms of action are not excluded for example depending on the epitope against which it is directed a Nanobody of the invention may also inhibit the association of TNF into the trimeric state .

It should also be noted that in addition or as an alternative to binding to two or more receptor binding sites on a single TNF trimer the proteins or polypeptides of the present invention that comprises or essentially consists of two or more immunoglobulin variable domains or suitable fragments thereof that are directed against epitopes of TNF alpha may bind e.g. intermolecularly epitopes on two separate TNF alpha molecules e.g. two separate trimers .

However according to one particularly preferred embodiment the invention relates to a protein or polypeptide that comprises or essentially consists of two or more immunoglobulin variable domains or suitable fragments thereof that are each directed against epitopes on TNF alpha and in particular of the TNF alpha trimer that lie in and or form part of the receptor binding site s of the TNF trimer such that said polypeptide upon binding to a TNF trimer is capable inhibiting or reducing the TNF receptor crosslinking that is mediated by said TNF trimer and or the signal transduction that is mediated by such receptor crosslinking.

In particular according to this preferred embodiment the invention relates to a protein polypeptide that comprises or essentially consist of two or more immunoglobulin variable domains or suitable fragments thereof that are each directed against epitopes on TNF alpha and in particular of the TNF alpha trimer that lie in and or form part of the receptor binding site s of the TNF trimer wherein said immunoglobulin variable domains are linked to each other in such a way that the protein or polypeptide is capable of simultaneously binding to two or more receptor binding sites on a single TNF trimer in other words is capable of intramolecular binding to at least two TNF receptor binding sites on a TNF trimer . In this embodiment the two or more immunoglobulin variable domains are preferably as defined above and are most preferably Nanobodies so that the protein or polypeptide is a multivalent Nanobody construct as further described herein . Also in this embodiment the two or more immunoglobulin variable domains may be the same or different and may directed against different epitopes within the TNF receptor binding site s but are preferably directed against the same epitope.

In one preferred aspect of this embodiment the two or more immunoglobulin variable domains are directed against epitopes of the TNF alpha trimer which epitopes lie in and or form part of the TNF receptor binding site s . For example the two or more immunoglobulin variable domains are preferably directed against and or can bind to an epitope of the TNF alpha trimer that comprises the following amino acid residues Gln at position 88 and Lys at position 90 on a first TNF monomer referred to herein as monomer A and Glu at position 146 on a second TNF monomer referred to herein as monomer B in which Monomer A and Monomer B together in the TNF trimer form the TNF receptor binding site s .

As further described below in more details with respect to Nanobodies in such a protein or polypeptide the at least two immunoglobulin variable domains are preferably linked in such a way that the distance between the N terminus and the C terminus of the two immunoglobulin variable domains present in such a protein or polypeptide is preferably at least 50 Angstroms and more preferably in the region of 55 200 Angstroms and more preferably in the region of Angstroms and in particular in the region of 65 150 Angstroms.

In a particularly preferred aspect of this embodiment these two or more immunoglobulin sequences are Nanobodies and are preferably chosen from the Nanobodies described herein. Some particularly preferred Nanobodies for use in this embodiment of the invention are PMP1C2 TNF1 SEQ ID NO 52 and or PMP5F10 TNF3 SEQ ID NO 60 as well as humanized and other variants thereof as described herein with PMP1C2 TNF1 SEQ ID NO 52 and its humanized variants being particularly preferred.

Accordingly the present embodiment will now be described in more detail with reference to Nanobodies. However it will be clear to the skilled person that the teaching herein may be applied analogously to immunoglobulin variable domains.

In this embodiment of the invention the two or more immunoglobulin sequences will usually be linked via one or more suitable linkers which linkers are such that each immunoglobulin sequence can bind to a different receptor binding site on the same TNF trimer. Suitable linkers will inter alia depend on the distance between the epitopes on the TNF trimer to which the immunoglobulin sequences bind and will be clear to the skilled person based on the disclosure herein optionally after some limited degree of routine experimentation. For example when the two or more immunoglobulin sequences are single domain antibodies or Nanobodies suitable linkers may be chosen from the linkers described herein but with a linker length that is such that the two or more single domain antibodies or Nanobodies can each bind to a different receptor binding site on the same TNF trimer.

Also when the two or more immunoglobulin sequences that bind to the receptor binding sites of TNF alpha are single domain antibodies or Nanobodies they may also be linked to each other via a third single domain antibody or Nanobody in which the two or more immunoglobulin sequences may be linked directly to the third single domain antibody Nanobody or via suitable linkers . Such a third single domain antibody or Nanobody may for example be a single domain antibody or Nanobody that provides for an increased half life as further described herein. For example the latter single domain antibody or Nanobody may be a single domain antibody or Nanobody that is capable of binding to a human serum protein such as human serum albumin as further described herein.

Alternatively the two or more immunoglobulin sequences that bind to the receptor binding site s of TNF alpha may be linked in series either directly or via a suitable linker and the third single domain antibody or Nanobody which may provide for increased half life as described above may be connected directly or via a linker to one of these two or more aforementioned immunoglobulin sequences. Some non limiting examples of such constructs are the constructs of SEQ ID NOS 93 or 94.

In particular it has been found in the invention see the crystallography data referred to herein that when the Nanobodies present in a multivalent or multispecific protein or polypeptide of the invention bind to the particular epitope described above which is the epitope of TNF1 and its humanized variants as well as of TNF3 and its humanized variants then preferably the two or more anti TNF Nanobodies present in such a protein or polypeptide should be linked in such a way that the distance between the N terminus and the C terminus of two anti TNF Nanobodies present in such a protein or polypeptide should preferably be at least 50 Angstroms and more preferably in the region of 55 200 Angstroms and in particular in the region of 65 150 Angstroms with the upper limit being less critical and being chosen for reasons of convenience e.g. with a view to expression production of the protein or more generally that said distance should be such that it allows the protein or polypeptide to undergo intramolecular binding to the TNF trimer i.e. instead of intermolecular binding . The distance between the N terminus and the C terminus of two anti TNF Nanobodies can be determined by any suitable means such as by crystallography or molecular modelling as described herein . These techniques generally also make it possible to determine whether a specific multivalent or multispecific protein or polypeptide is capable of providing intramolecular modelling. Alternatively the present invention also provides a simple experiment using size exclusion chromatography as described by Santora et al. Anal. Biochem. 299 119 129 that can be used to determine whether a given protein or polypeptide of the invention will predominantly provide intramolecular binding to a TNF trimer or predominantly intermolecular binding between two or more TNF trimers. Thus in one particular embodiment of the invention a protein or polypeptide of the invention is preferably such that in this experiment it predominantly or essentially exclusively leads to intramolecular binding However as emphasized above it should be noted that proteins or polypeptides of the invention that operate via intermolecular binding of separate TNF alpha molecules e.g. trimers are also within the scope of the present invention.

Thus in another preferred aspect the invention provides for a multivalent or multispecific protein or polypeptide that comprises at least two Nanobodies against TNF alpha and in particular of the TNF alpha trimer in which said Nanobodies are preferably directed to essentially the same epitope as Nanobody PMP1C2 as mentioned herein and in which said at least two Nanobodies are linked in such a way that the distance the distance between the N terminus and the C terminus of the at least two anti TNF Nanobodies is such that the protein or polypeptide is capable of undergoing intramolecular binding as described herein with a TNF trimer. Preferably in such a protein or polypeptide the distance between the N terminus and the C terminus of two anti TNF Nanobodies is at least 50 Angstroms and more preferably in the region of 55 200 Angstroms and in particular in the region of 65 150 Angstroms.

In such a preferred protein or polypeptide the two or more Nanobodies may be linked in any suitable fashion as long as the preferred distance between the N terminus and the C terminus of the at least two anti TNF Nanobodies can be achieved and or as long as the protein or polypeptide is capable of undergoing intramolecular binding as described herein with a TNF trimer.

For example in its simplest form the at least two Nanobodies are directly linked via a suitable linker or spacer that provides for the preferred distance between the N terminus and the C terminus of the at least two anti TNF Nanobodies and which may allow the protein or polypeptide to undergo intramolecular binding as described herein with a TNF trimer. Suitable linkers are described herein and may for example and without limitation comprise an amino acid sequence which amino acid sequence preferably has a length of 14 amino acids more preferably at least 17 amino acids such as about 20 40 amino acid sequence which using an average distance of 3.5 Angstrom for one amino acid corresponds to linker lengths of 49 Angstroms 59.5 Angstroms and about 70 Angstroms respectively with the maximum amount of amino acids being calculated in the same way based on the distances mentioned above . Preferably such an amino acid sequence should also be such that it allows the protein or polypeptide to undergo intramolecular binding as described herein with a TNF trimer.

Thus in another preferred aspect the invention provides for a multivalent or multispecific protein or polypeptide that comprises at least two Nanobodies against TNF alpha and in particular of the TNF alpha trimer in which said Nanobodies are preferably directed to essentially the same epitope as Nanobody PMP1C2 as mentioned herein and in which said at least two Nanobodies are directly linked to each other using a suitable linker or spacer such that the distance the distance between the N terminus and the C terminus of the at least two anti TNF Nanobodies is such that the protein or polypeptide is capable of undergoing intramolecular binding as described herein with a TNF trimer. Preferably in such a protein or polypeptide the distance between the N terminus and the C terminus of two anti TNF Nanobodies and thereby the preferred length of the linker or spacer is at least 50 Angstroms and more preferably in the region of 55 200 Angstroms and in particular in the region of 65 150 Angstroms.

More preferably in this preferred aspect the linker or spacer is an amino acid sequence that comprises at least 14 preferably at least 17 more preferably at least 20 amino acids with a non critical upper limit chosen for reasons of convenience being abut 50 and preferably about 40 amino acids . In one preferred but non limiting embodiment the linker essentially consists of glycine and serine residues as further described below . For example one suitable linker is the GS30 linker described herein which comprises 30 amino acid residues.

In another embodiment the at least two Nanobodies against TNF alpha are linked to each other via another moiety optionally via one or two linkers such as another protein or polypeptide. In this embodiment it may be desirable to have the preferred distance i.e. as mentioned above between the N terminus and the C terminus of the at least two anti TNF Nanobodies for example such that the protein or polypeptide can still undergo intramolecular binding as described herein with a TNF trimer. In this embodiment the at least two Nanobodies may be linked directly to the other moiety or using a suitable linker or spacer again as long as the preferred distance and or desired intramolecular binding can still be achieved. The moiety may be any suitable moiety which does not detract too much from the binding of the protein or polypeptide to TNF and or from the further desired biological or pharmacological properties of the protein or polypeptide. As such the moiety may be essentially inactive or may be biologically active and as such may or may not improve the desired properties of the protein or polypeptide and or may confer one or more additional desired properties to the protein or polypeptide. For example and without limitation the moiety may improve the half life of the protein or polypeptide and or may reduce its immunogenicity or improve any other desired property. In one preferred embodiment the moiety may be another Nanobody including but not limited to a third Nanobody against TNF alpha although this is not necessary and usually less preferred and in particular another Nanobody that improves the half life of the protein or polypeptide such as a Nanobody that is directed against a serum protein for example against human serum albumin. Examples of such proteins and polypeptides are described herein.

Thus in one embodiment the invention relates to a multivalent multispecific construct comprising two or more immunoglobulin sequences or suitable fragments thereof that are each directed against epitopes on TNF alpha e.g. of the TNF alpha trimer that lie in and or form part of the receptor binding site and that are linked to each other via at least one immunoglobulin sequence that provides for increased half life and optionally via one or more suitable linkers such that said polypeptide upon binding to a TNF trimer is capable inhibiting or reducing the TNF receptor crosslinking and or the signal transduction that is mediated by said TNF trimer. Such a polypeptide may be such such that said first mentioned two or more immunoglobulin sequences can each bind to a different receptor binding site on a TNF trimer.

In particular in this embodiment the polypeptide may comprise a trivalent bispecific Nanobody that comprises two Nanobodies that are each directed against epitopes on TNF alpha and in particular of the TNF alpha trimer that lie in and or form part of the receptor binding site in which said Nanobodies are linked to each other via a third Nanobody that provides for an increased half life e.g. a Nanobody that is directed to a serum protein such as human serum albumin in which each of the firstmentioned two Nanobodies may be directly linked to said third Nanobody or via one or more suitable linkers such that said polypeptide upon binding to a TNF trimer is capable inhibiting or reducing the TNF receptor crosslinking and or the signal transduction that is mediated by said TNF trimer. Such a polypeptide may be such that said firstmentioned two Nanobodies can each bind to a different receptor binding site on a TNF trimer. Again some particularly preferred Nanobodies for use in this embodiment of the invention are PMP1C2 TNF1 SEQ ID NO 52 and or PMP5F10 TNF3 SEQ ID NO 60 as well as humanized and other variants thereof as described herein with PMP1C2 TNF1 SEQ ID NO 52 and its humanized variants being particularly preferred and the Nanobodies directed against human serum albumin described herein. Some preferred but non limiting constructs of this embodiment of the invention are TNF 24 SEQ ID NO 90 TNF 26 SEQ ID NO 92 TNF 27 SEQ ID NO 93 TNF 28 SEQ ID NO 94 TNF 60 SEQ ID NO 417 and TNF 62 SEQ ID NO 418 of which TNF 60 is particularly preferred.

It should be noted that when a protein or polypeptide is mentioned above as being in accordance with any one of XIX to XX above it is at least according to one of XIX to XX and may be according to both XIX and XX and may also include any one or more of the other aspects that are indicated as being in accordance with any one of XIX to XX above .

However it should be noted that the invention is not limited to any specific mechanism of action or hypothesis. In particular it has been found that the monovalent Nanobodies of the invention may be also active in the assays and models described herein which confirms that intramolecular binding of he TNF trimer although preferred in one specific embodiment of the invention is not required to obtain the desired action and effect of the Nanobodies proteins and polypeptides described herein. Similarly it is also encompassed within the scope of the invention that the proteins and polypeptides described herein achieve their desired action via any appropriate mechanism i.e. by intramolecular binding intermolecular binding or even by binding to monomeric TNF thus inhibiting the formation of TNF trimers .

It is also within the scope of the invention to use parts fragments analogs mutants variants alleles and or derivatives of the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention and or to use proteins or polypeptides comprising or essentially consisting of the same as long as these are suitable for the uses envisaged herein. Such parts fragments analogs mutants variants alleles derivatives proteins and or polypeptides will be described in the further description herein.

In another aspect the invention relates to a Nanobody as defined herein against TNF alpha which consist of 4 framework regions FR1 to FR4 respectively and 3 complementarity determining regions CDR1 to CDR3 respectively in which

Even more preferably in the Nanobodies of the invention all three CDR1 CDR2 and CDR3 sequences present are suitably chosen from the group consisting of the CDR1 CDR2 and CDR3 sequences respectively listed in Table I.

Also generally the combinations of CDR s listed in Table I i.e. those mentioned on the same line in Table I are preferred.

In one aspect the invention provides Nanobodies against TNF alpha that are better performing than Nanobody 3E the best performing Nanobody according to WO 04 041862.

It should be noted that when a Nanobody is mentioned above as being in accordance with any one of XXI to XXV above it is at least according to one of XXI to XXV may be according to two or more of XXI to XXV and may also include any one or more of the other aspects that are indicated as being in accordance with any one of XXI to XXV above.

A clone that has been found to be particularly useful as an anti TNF Nanobody is the clone PMP1C2 TNF1 . As can be seen from the comparative data from the KYM assay in Table 39 TNF1 has an ECvalue that is more then 4 times better than the best monovalent Nanobody described in WO 04 41862 Nanobody 3E i.e. 2 466 nM for PMP1C2 vs. 12 nM for 3E As can be seen from Table 39 all Nanobodies TNF1 to TNF 9 of the invention gave a better EC50 value in this assay than 3E . In this respect it should also be noted that Nanobody 3E from WO 04 41862 belongs to the KERE class as described herein and can therefore be humanized to a lesser degree than Nanobody PMP1C2 which belongs to the GLEW class . When Nanobody PMP1C2 is compared to the Nanobody 1A from WO 04 41862 a GLEW class Nanobody with the highest degree in sequence homology with PMP1C2 in both the CDR s and the frameworks the ECvalue obtained for PMP1C2 in the KYM assay is more than 50 times better i.e. 2.466 nM for PMP1C2 compared to 100 nM for 1A.

Preferably a polypeptide of the invention is either bivalent or trivalent i.e. comprising two or three Nanobodies of the invention respectively optionally linked via one or two linkers as defined below respectively or a multispecific polypeptide comprising one or two and preferably two Nanobodies of the invention and at least one Nanobody directed against a serum protein and in particular against a human serum protein such as against human serum albumin.

In one preferred but non limiting embodiments the Nanobodies of the invention present in the polypeptides of the invention are chosen from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO s 52 to 60 and SEQ ID NO s 105 129 or from humanized variants thereof and in particular from the humanized Nanobodies of SEQ ID NO s 76 to 86 and SEQ ID NO s 95 to 99. The Nanobodies against human serum albumin present in the polypeptides of the invention are preferably as defined below and are more preferably chosen from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO s 61 to 67 SEQ ID NO s 87 to 89 and SEQ ID NO s 100 104 and in particular from the humanized Nanobodies against human serum albumin of SEQ ID NO s 76 to 86 and SEQ ID NO s 100 104.

With respect to the Nanobodies that are present in the polypeptides of the invention it will be clear to the skilled person that the Nanobodies that are mentioned herein as preferred or as more preferred even more preferred etc. are also preferred or more preferred or even more preferred etc. for use in the polypeptides described herein. Thus polypeptides that comprise or essentially consist of one or more preferred Nanobodies of the invention will generally be preferred and polypeptides that comprise or essentially consist of one or more more preferred Nanobodies of the invention of the invention will generally be more preferred etc.

Thus in the invention polypeptides that comprise one or more Nanobodies that essentially consist of one of the preferred variants of clone PMP1C2 TNF1 SEQ ID NO 52 in which said preferred variants are as defined herein are particularly preferred. Even more preferred are polypeptides that comprise one or more Nanobodies that essentially consist of one of the humanized variants of clone PMP1C2 TNF1 SEQ ID NO 52 in which said humanized variants are as defined herein examples being without limitation TNF13 TNF14 TNF29 and TNF30 . TNF30 is a particularly preferred humanized building block for use in the polypeptides of the invention.

Some preferred but non limiting examples of such proteins and polypeptides are PMP1C2 itself the humanized variants TNF13 TNF14 TNF29 and TNF30 the constructs of SEQ ID NO 70 TNF4 SEQ ID NO 73 TNF7 SEQ ID NO 90 TNF24 SEQ ID NO 93 TNF27 and the constructs of SEQ ID NO 417 TNF60 SEQ ID NO 419 TNF55 and SEQ ID NO 420 TNF56 in which the latter three constructs contain the humanized variant TNF 30 as a building block.

As mentioned herein the Nanobodies and constructs described herein may be pegylated or contain one or more additional amino acid residues that allow for pegylation and or facilitate pegylation. Two preferred but non limiting examples of such polypeptides are TNF55 and TNF56 which both contain an additional cysteine residue for easy attachment of a PEG group.

Some preferred but non limiting examples of polypeptides of the invention are the bivalent polypeptides of the invention of SEQ ID NO s 70 to 75 and the multispecific polypeptides of the invention of SEQ ID NO s 90 to 94 and SEQ ID NO s 417 to 420.

As can be seen from the data represented below and in particular from the data given in the Comparative Example the Nanobodies and or polypeptides of the invention have improved properties. In particular the proteins and polypeptides of the invention may have an improved affinity for human TNF alpha expressed as the EC value in the KYM assay described herein compared to the commercially available anti TNF biologicals Enbrel Humira and Remicade . Also the Nanobodies described herein may have an improved affinity for TNF alpha compared to best performing Nanobody described in the International application WO 04 041862. It can thus be expected that polypeptides of the invention comprising at least one of the Nanobodies of the invention will also have improved properties compared to polypeptides that comprise only the Nanobodies against TNF alpha described in WO 04 041862.

More in particular a polypeptide as described herein that comprises two or more and preferably two Nanobodies as herein and optionally for example a Nanobody against human serum albumin has an EC50 value in the cell based assay using KYM cells described in Example 1 under 3 of WO 04 041862 that is better than the EC50 value of Humira en Remicade and preferably also better than Enbrel in the same assay.

For example such a protein or polypeptide preferably has an EC50 value in the cell based assay using KYM cells described in Example 1 under 3 of WO 04 041862 that is better than 0.2 nM preferably better than 0.1 nM such as betet than 0.7 Nm and in particular better than 0.4 nM.

It has also been shown by applicants that Nanobodies against mouse TNF alpha and polypeptides comprising Nanobodies against mouse TNF alpha show a beneficial biological activity in the following disease models data not shown 

Preferably the Nanobodies described herein are better than Nanobody 1A from WO 04 041862 in at least one of these models and preferably in all of these models and more preferably Nanobody 3E from WO 04 041862 in at least one of these models and preferably in all of these models. Also the polypeptides described herein are preferably equivalent to or better than Humira or Remicade in at least one of these models and preferably in all of these models and more preferably also equivalent to or better than Enbrel in at least one of these models and preferably in all of these models.

These data confirm that Nanobodies against TNF alpha and polypeptides containing the same such as the Nanobodies and polypeptides described in WO 04 041862 and in particular the Nanobodies and polypeptides described herein should have therapeutic efficacy against TNF mediated diseases and disorders such as the diseases and disorders mentioned above.

Other aspects embodiments advantages and applications of the invention will become clear from the further description hereinbelow.

The above and other aspects and embodiments of the invention will become clear from the further description hereinbelow in which 

Alternatively the degree of sequence identity between two or more nucleotide sequences may be calculated using a known computer algorithm for sequence alignment such as NCBI Blast v2.0 using standard settings.

Some other techniques computer algorithms and settings for determining the degree of sequence identity are for example described in WO 04 037999 EP 0 967 284 EP 1 085 089 WO 00 55318 WO 00 78972 WO 98 49185 and GB 2 357 768 A.

Usually for the purpose of determining the percentage of sequence identity between two nucleotide sequences in accordance with the calculation method outlined hereinabove the nucleotide sequence with the greatest number of nucleotides will be taken as the first nucleotide sequence and the other nucleotide sequence will be taken as the second nucleotide sequence 

Alternatively the degree of sequence identity between two amino acid sequences may be calculated using a known computer algorithm such as those mentioned above for determining the degree of sequence identity for nucleotide sequences again using standard settings.

Usually for the purpose of determining the percentage of sequence identity between two amino acid sequences in accordance with the calculation method outlined hereinabove the amino acid sequence with the greatest number of amino acid residues will be taken as the first amino acid sequence and the other amino acid sequence will be taken as the second amino acid sequence.

Also in determining the degree of sequence identity between two amino acid sequences the skilled person may take into account so called conservative amino acid substitutions which can generally be described as amino acid substitutions in which an amino acid residue is replaced with another amino acid residue of similar chemical structure and which has little or essentially no influence on the function activity or other biological properties of the polypeptide. Such conservative amino acid substitutions are well known in the art for example from WO 04 037999 GB A 2 357 768 WO 98 49185 WO 00 46383 and WO 01 09300 and preferred types and or combinations of such substitutions may be selected on the basis of the pertinent teachings from WO 04 037999 as well as WO 98 49185 and from the further references cited therein.

Such conservative substitutions preferably are substitutions in which one amino acid within the following groups a e is substituted by another amino acid residue within the same group a small aliphatic nonpolar or slightly polar residues Ala Ser Thr Pro and Gly b polar negatively charged residues and their uncharged amides Asp Asn Glu and Gln c polar positively charged residues His Arg and Lys d large aliphatic nonpolar residues Met Leu Ile Val and Cys and e aromatic residues Phe Tyr and Trp.

Particularly preferred conservative substitutions are as follows Ala into Gly or into Ser Arg into Lys Asn into Gln or into His Asp into Glu Cys into Ser Gln into Asn Glu into Asp Gly into Ala or into Pro His into Asn or into Gln Ile into Leu or into Val Leu into Ile or into Val Lys into Arg into Gln or into Glu Met into Leu into Tyr or into Ile Phe into Met into Leu or into Tyr Ser into Thr Thr into Ser Trp into Tyr Tyr into Trp and or Phe into Val into Ile or into Leu.

Any amino acid substitutions applied to the polypeptides described herein may also be based on the analysis of the frequencies of amino acid variations between homologous proteins of different species developed by Schulz et al. Principles of Protein Structure Springer Verlag 1978 on the analyses of structure forming potentials developed by Chou and Fasman Biochemistry 13 211 1974 and Adv. Enzymol. 47 45 149 1978 and on the analysis of hydrophobicity patterns in proteins developed by Eisenberg et al. Proc. Nad. Acad. Sci. USA 81 140 144 1984 Kyte Doolittle J Molec.

However in the present description claims and figures the numbering according to Kabat as applied to Vdomains by Riechmann and Muyldermans will be followed unless indicated otherwise and

In accordance with the terminology used in the above references the variable domains present in naturally occurring heavy chain antibodies will also be referred to as Vdomains in order to distinguish them from the heavy chain variable domains that are present in conventional 4 chain antibodies which will be referred to hereinbelow as Vdomains and from the light chain variable domains that are present in conventional 4 chain antibodies which will be referred to hereinbelow as Vdomains .

As mentioned in the prior art referred to above Vdomains have a number of unique structural characteristics and functional properties which make isolated Vdomains as well as Nanobodies based thereon which share these structural characteristics and functional properties with the naturally occurring Vdomains and proteins containing the same highly advantageous for use as functional antigen binding domains or proteins. In particular and without being limited thereto Vdomains which have been designed by nature to functionally bind to an antigen without the presence of and without any interaction with a light chain variable domain and Nanobodies can function as a single relatively small functional antigen binding structural unit domain or protein. This distinguishes the Vdomains from the Vand Vdomains of conventional 4 chain antibodies which by themselves are generally not suited for practical application as single antigen binding proteins or domains but need to be combined in some form or another to provide a functional antigen binding unit as in for example conventional antibody fragments such as Fab fragments in ScFv s fragments which consist of a Vdomain covalently linked to a Vdomain .

Because of these unique properties the use of Vdomains and Nanobodies as single antigen binding proteins or as antigen binding domains i.e. as part of a larger protein or polypeptide offers a number of significant advantages over the use of conventional Vand Vdomains scFv s or conventional antibody fragments such as Fab or F ab fragments 

As mentioned above the invention generally relates to Nanobodies directed against TNF alpha as well as to polypeptides comprising or essentially consisting of one or more of such Nanobodies that can be used for the prophylactic therapeutic and or diagnostic purposes described below and in WO 04 041862.

As also mentioned above and further described below the invention further relates to nucleic acids encoding such Nanobodies and polypeptides to methods for preparing such Nanobodies and polypeptides to host cells expressing or capable of expressing such Nanobodies or polypeptides to uses of such Nanobodies polypeptides nucleic acids or host cells and to compositions comprising such Nanobodies polypeptides nucleic acids or host cells.

Generally it should be noted that the term Nanobody as used herein in its broadest sense is not limited to a specific biological source or to a specific method of preparation. For example as will be discussed in more detail below the Nanobodies of the invention can be obtained 1 by isolating the Vdomain of a naturally occurring heavy chain antibody 2 by expression of a nucleotide sequence encoding a naturally occurring Vdomain 3 by humanization as described below of a naturally occurring Vdomain or by expression of a nucleic acid encoding a such humanized Vdomain 4 by camelization as described below of a naturally occurring Vdomain from any animal species in particular a species of mammal such as from a human being or by expression of a nucleic acid encoding such a camelized Vdomain 5 by camelisation of a domain antibody or Dab as described by Ward et al supra or by expression of a nucleic acid encoding such a camelized Vdomain 6 using synthetic or semi synthetic techniques for preparing proteins polypeptides or other amino acid sequences 7 by preparing a nucleic acid encoding a Nanobody using techniques for nucleic acid synthesis followed by expression of the nucleic acid thus obtained and or 8 by any combination of the foregoing. Suitable methods and techniques for performing the foregoing will be clear to the skilled person based on the disclosure herein and for example include the methods and techniques described in more detail hereinbelow.

However according to a specific embodiment the Nanobodies of the invention do not have an amino acid sequence that is exactly the same as i.e. as a degree of sequence identity of 100 with the amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring Vdomain such as the amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring Vdomain from a mammal and in particular from a human being.

One particularly preferred class of Nanobodies of the invention comprises Nanobodies with an amino acid sequence that corresponds to the amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring Vdomain but that has been humanized i.e. by replacing one or more amino acid residues in the amino acid sequence of said naturally occurring Vsequence by one or more of the amino acid residues that occur at the corresponding position s in a Vdomain from a conventional 4 chain antibody from a human being e.g. indicated above . This can be performed in a manner known per se which will be clear to the skilled person for example on the basis of the further description below and the prior art on humanization referred to herein. Again it should be noted that such humanized Nanobodies of the invention can be obtained in any suitable manner known per se i.e. as indicated under points 1 8 above and thus are not strictly limited to polypeptides that have been obtained using a polypeptide that comprises a naturally occurring Vdomain as a starting material.

A preferred but non limiting humanzing substitution for Nanobodies belonging to the 103 P R S group and or the GLEW group as defined herein is 108Q to 108L.

Another particularly preferred class of Nanobodies of the invention comprises Nanobodies with an amino acid sequence that corresponds to the amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring Vdomain that has been camelized i.e. by replacing one or more amino acid residues in the amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring Vdomain from a conventional 4 chain antibody by one or more of the amino acid residues that occur at the corresponding position s in a Vdomain of a heavy chain antibody. This can be performed in a manner known per se which will be clear to the skilled person for example on the basis of the further description below. Reference is also made to WO 94 04678. Such camelization may preferentially occur at amino acid positions which are present at the V Vinterface and at the so called Camelidae hallmark residues see for example also WO 94 04678 as also mentioned below. Preferably the Vdomain or sequence that is used as a starting material or starting point for generating or designing the camelized Nanobody is preferably a Vsequence from a mammal more preferably the Vsequence of a human being. However it should be noted that such camelized Nanobodies of the invention can be obtained in any suitable manner known per se i.e. as indicated under points 1 8 above and thus are not strictly limited to polypeptides that have been obtained using a polypeptide that comprises a naturally occurring Vdomain as a starting material.

For example again as further described below both humanization and camelization can be performed by providing a nucleotide sequence that encodes such a naturally occurring Vdomain or Vdomain respectively and then changing in a manner known per se one or more codons in said nucleotide sequence such that the new nucleotide sequence encodes a humanized or camelized Nanobody of the invention respectively and then expressing the nucleotide sequence thus obtained in a manner known per se so as to provide the desired Nanobody of the invention. Alternatively based on the amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring Vdomain or Vdomain respectively the amino acid sequence of the desired humanized or camelized Nanobody of the invention respectively can be designed and then synthesized de novo using techniques for peptide synthesis known per se. Also based on the amino acid sequence or nucleotide sequence of a naturally occurring Vdomain or Vdomain respectively a nucleotide sequence encoding the desired humanized or camelized Nanobody of the invention respectively can be designed and then synthesized de novo using techniques for nucleic acid synthesis known per se after which the nucleotide sequence thus obtained can be expressed in a manner known per se so as to provide the desired Nanobody of the invention.

Other suitable ways and techniques for obtaining Nanobodies of the invention and or nucleotide sequences and or nucleic acids encoding the same starting from the amino acid sequence of naturally occurring Vdomains or preferably Vdomains and or from nucleotide sequences and or nucleic acid sequences encoding the same will be clear from the skilled person and may for example comprising combining one or more amino acid sequences and or nucleotide sequences from naturally occurring Vdomains such as one or more FR s and or CDR s with one or more amino acid sequences and or nucleotide sequences from naturally occurring Vdomains such an one or more FR s or CDR s in a suitable manner so as to provide a nucleotide sequence or nucleic acid encoding a Nanobody of the invention.

According to one preferred but non limiting aspect of the aspect of the invention a Nanobody in its broadest sense can be generally defined as a polypeptide comprising 

Thus in a first preferred but non limiting aspect a Nanobody of the invention may have the structure FR1 CDR1 FR2 CDR2 FR3 CDR3 FR4 in which FR1 to FR4 refer to framework regions 1 to 4 respectively and in which CDR1 to CDR3 refer to the complementarity determining regions 1 to 3 respectively and in which

In particular a Nanobody against TNF alpha according to the invention may have the structure FR1 CDR1 FR2 CDR2 FR3 CDR3 FR4 in which FR1 to FR4 refer to framework regions 1 to 4 respectively and in which CDR1 to CDR3 refer to the complementarity determining regions 1 to 3 respectively and in which

In particular according to one preferred but non limiting aspect of the aspect of the invention a Nanobody can generally be defined as a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence that is comprised of four framework regions sequences interrupted by three complementarity determining regions sequences in which 

Thus in another preferred but non limiting aspect a Nanobody of the invention may have the structure FR1 CDR1 FR2 CDR2 FR3 CDR3 FR4 in which FR1 to FR4 refer to framework regions 1 to 4 respectively and in which CDR1 to CDR3 refer to the complementarity determining regions 1 to 3 respectively and in which 

In another preferred but non limiting aspect a Nanobody of the invention may have the structure FR1 CDR1 FR2 CDR2 FR3 CDR3 FR4 in which FR1 to FR4 refer to framework regions 1 to 4 respectively and in which CDR1 to CDR3 refer to the complementarity determining regions 1 to 3 respectively and in which 

In another preferred but non limiting aspect a Nanobody of the invention may have the structure FR1 CDR1 FR2 CDR2 FR3 CDR3 FR4 in which FR1 to FR4 refer to framework regions 1 to 4 respectively and in which CDR1 to CDR3 refer to the complementarity determining regions 1 to 3 respectively and in which 

Two particularly preferred but non limiting groups of the Nanobodies of the invention are those according to a above according to I to a 4 above according to b above according to b 1 to b 4 above according to c above and or according to c 1 to c 4 above in which 

Thus in another preferred but non limiting aspect a Nanobody of the invention may have the structure FR1 CDR1 FR2 CDR2 FR3 CDR3 FR4 in which FR1 to FR4 refer to framework regions 1 to 4 respectively and in which CDR1 to CDR3 refer to the complementarity determining regions 1 to 3 respectively and in which 

In another preferred but non limiting aspect a Nanobody of the invention may have the structure FR1 CDR1 FR2 CDR2 FR3 CDR3 FR4 in which FR1 to FR4 refer to framework regions 1 to 4 respectively and in which CDR1 to CDR3 refer to the complementarity determining regions 1 to 3 respectively and in which 

In the Nanobodies of the invention in which the amino acid residues at positions 43 46 according to the Kabat numbering form the sequence KERE or KQRE the amino acid residue at position 37 is most preferably F. In the Nanobodies of the invention in which the amino acid residues at positions 44 47 according to the Kabat numbering form the sequence GLEW the amino acid residue at position 37 is chosen from the group consisting of Y H I V or F and is most preferably F.

Thus without being limited hereto in any way on the basis of the amino acid residues present on the positions mentioned above the Nanobodies of the invention can generally be classified is on the basis of the following three groups 

Thus in another preferred but non limiting aspect a Nanobody of the invention may be a Nanobody belonging to the GLEW group as defined herein and in which CDR1 CDR2 and CDR3 are as defined above and are preferably as defined according to one of the preferred definitions above and are more preferably as defined according to one of the more preferred definitions above.

In another preferred but non limiting aspect a Nanobody of the invention may be a Nanobody belonging to the KERE group as defined herein and in which CDR1 CDR2 and CDR3 are as defined above and are preferably as defined according to one of the preferred definitions above and are more preferably as defined according to one of the more preferred definitions above.

Thus in another preferred but non limiting aspect a Nanobody of the invention may be a Nanobody belonging to the 103 P R S group as defined herein and in which CDR1 CDR2 and CDR3 are as defined above and are preferably as defined according to one of the preferred definitions above and are more preferably as defined according to one of the more preferred definitions above.

Also more generally and in addition to the 108Q 43E 44R and 103P R S residues mentioned above the Nanobodies of the invention can contain at one or more positions that in a conventional Vdomain would form part of the V Vinterface contain one or more amino acid residues that are more highly charged than the amino acid residues that naturally occur at the same position s in the corresponding naturally occurring Vor Vdomain and in particular one or more charged amino acid residues as mentioned in Table 1 .

Such substitutions include but are not limited to the GLEW like sequences mentioned in Table 2 below as well as the substitutions that are described in the International Application WO 00 29004 for so called microbodies e.g. a Q at position 108 and KLEW at positions 44 47.

In some embodiments of the Nanobodies of the invention the amino acid residue at position 83 is chosen from the group consisting of L M S V and W and is preferably L.

Also in some embodiments of the Nanobodies of the invention the amino acid residue at position 83 is chosen from the group consisting of R K N E I and Q and is most preferably either K or E for Nanobodies corresponding to naturally occurring Vdomains or R for humanized Nanobodies as described below . The amino acid residue at position 84 in some embodiments is chosen from the group consisting of P A R S D and V and is most preferably P for Nanobodies corresponding to naturally occurring Vdomains or R for humanized Nanobodies as described below .

Furthermore in some embodiments of the Nanobodies of the invention the amino acid residue at position 104 is chosen from the group consisting of G and D and is most preferably G.

Collectively the amino acid residues at positions 11 37 44 45 47 83 84 103 104 and 108 which in the Nanobodies are as mentioned above will also be referred to herein as the Hallmark Residues . The Hallmark Residues and the amino acid residues at the corresponding positions of the most closely related human VH domain VH3 are summarized in Table 2.

Some especially preferred combinations of these Hallmark Residues as occur in naturally occurring Vdomains are mentioned in Table 3. For comparison the corresponding amino acid residues of the human V3 called DP 47 have been indicated in italics.

In the Nanobodies each amino acid residue at any other position than the Hallmark Residues can be any amino acid residue that naturally occurs at the corresponding position according to the Kabat numbering of a naturally occurring Vdomain.

Such amino acid residues will be clear to the skilled person. Tables 4 7 mention some non limiting residues that can be present at each position according to the Kabat numbering of the FR1 FR2 FR3 and FR4 of naturally occurring Vdomains. For each position the amino acid residue that most frequently occurs at each position of a naturally occurring Vdomain and which is the most preferred amino acid residue for said position in a Nanobody is indicated in bold and other preferred amino acid residues for each position have been underlined note the number of amino acid residues that are found at positions 26 30 of naturally occurring VHH domains supports the hypothesis underlying the numbering Chothia supra that the residues at these positions already form part of CDR1. 

In Tables 4 7 some of the non limiting residues that can be present at each position of a human V3 domain have also been mentioned. Again for each position the amino acid residue that most frequently occurs at each position of a naturally occurring human V3 domain is indicated in bold and other preferred amino acid residues have been underlined.

Thus in another preferred but not limiting aspect a Nanobody of the invention can have the structure FR1 CDR1 FR2 CDR2 FR3 CDR3 FR4 in which FR1 to FR4 refer to framework regions 1 to 4 respectively and in which CDR1 to CDR3 refer to the complementarity determining regions 1 to 3 respectively and in which 

In another preferred but not limiting aspect a Nanobody of the invention can have the structure FR1 CDR1 FR2 CDR2 FR3 CDR3 FR4 in which FR1 to FR4 refer to framework regions 1 to 4 respectively and in which CDR1 to CDR3 refer to the complementarity determining regions 1 to 3 respectively and in which and in which

In another preferred but not limiting aspect a Nanobody of the invention can have the structure FR1 CDR1 FR2 CDR2 FR3 CDR3 FR4 in which FR1 to FR4 refer to framework regions 1 to 4 respectively and in which CDR1 to CDR3 refer to the complementarity determining regions 1 to 3 respectively and in which and in which

In another preferred but not limiting aspect a Nanobody of the invention can have the structure FR1 CDR1 FR2 CDR2 FR3 CDR3 FR4 in which FR1 to FR4 refer to framework regions 1 to 4 respectively and in which CDR1 to CDR3 refer to the complementarity determining regions 1 to 3 respectively and in which and in which

In another preferred but not limiting aspect a Nanobody of the invention can have the structure FR1 CDR1 FR2 CDR2 FR3 CDR3 FR4 in which FR1 to FR4 refer to framework regions 1 to 4 respectively and in which CDR1 to CDR3 refer to the complementarity determining regions 1 to 3 respectively and in which 

Some other framework sequences that can be present in the Nanobodies of the invention can be found in the European patent EP 656 946 mentioned above see for example also the granted U.S. Pat. No. 5 759 808 .

In another preferred but not limiting aspect a Nanobody of the invention can have the structure FR1 CDR1 FR2 CDR2 FR3 CDR3 FR4 in which FR1 to FR4 refer to framework regions 1 to 4 respectively and in which CDR1 to CDR3 refer to the complementarity determining regions 1 to 3 respectively and in which and in which

Some particularly preferred Nanobodies of the invention can be chosen from the group consisting of the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO s 52 to 60 SEQ ID NO s 76 to 86 or SEQ ID NO s 95 to 99 and in particular in the humanized Nanobodies of SEQ ID NO s 76 to 86 or SEQ ID NO s 95 to 99 or from the group consisting of amino acid sequences that have at least 80 preferably at least 90 more preferably at least 95 even more preferably at least 99 sequence identity as defined herein with one of the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO s 52 to 60 SEQ ID NO s 76 to 86 or SEQ ID NO s 95 to 99 in which

Some even more particularly preferred Nanobodies of the invention can be chosen from the group consisting of the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO s 52 to 60 SEQ ID NO s 76 to 86 or SEQ ID NO s 95 to 99 and in particular in the humanized Nanobodies of SEQ ID NO s 76 to 86 or SEQ ID NO s 95 to 99 or from the group consisting of amino acid sequences that have at least 80 preferably at least 90 more preferably at least 95 even more preferably at least 99 sequence identity as defined herein with one of the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO s 52 to 60 SEQ ID NO s 76 to 86 or SEQ ID NO s 95 to 99 in which

Some of the most preferred Nanobodies of the invention can be chosen from the group consisting of the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO s 52 to 60 SEQ ID NO s 76 to 86 or SEQ ID NO s 95 to 99 and in particular from the humanized Nanobodies of SEQ ID NO s 76 to 86 or SEQ ID NO s 95 to 99.

As will be clear from the above the term Nanobodies of the invention as used herein in its broadest sense also comprises natural or synthetic mutants variants alleles analogs and orthologs hereinbelow collectively referred to as analogs of the Nanobodies mentioned in the SEQ ID NO s 52 to 60 SEQ ID NO s 76 to 86 or SEQ ID NO s 95 to 99.

Generally such analogs can for example comprise homologous sequences functional portions or a functional portion of a homologous sequence as further defined below of a Nanobody. Generally in such analogs each amino acid residue other than the Hallmark Residue in each of the framework regions can be replaced by any other amino acid residue provided that the total degree of sequence identity of the framework regions remains as defined above. Preferably however in such analogs 

Also although generally less preferred in such analogs one or more amino acid residues may be deleted from the framework regions and or inserted into the framework regions optionally in addition to one or more amino acid substitutions as mentioned above provided that the total degree of sequence identity of the framework regions remains as defined above. The Hallmark residues should not be deleted. Also most preferably amino acid residues for which only one amino acid residue is mentioned for both the Vdomain and the Vdomain in Tables 4 7 above are preferably not deleted.

Preferably such analogs should be such that they still can bind to have affinity for and or have specificity for TNF alpha i.e. with an affinity and or a specificity which is at least 10 preferably at least 50 more preferably at least 70 even more preferably at least 80 such as at least 90 at least 95 at least 99 or more of the affinity and or specificity of at least one of the Nanobodies of SEQ ID No s SEQ ID NO s 52 to 60 SEQ ID NO s 76 to 86 or SEQ ID NO s 95 to 99 as determined using a suitable assay for example an assay to determine binding of the analog to TNF and in particular one of the assays as used in the Examples below.

Generally such analogs can for example be obtained by providing a nucleic acid that encodes a naturally occurring Vdomain changing the codons for the one or more amino acid residues that are to be humanized into the codons for the corresponding human amino acid residue s expressing the nucleic acid nucleotide sequence thus obtained in a suitable host or expression system and optionally isolating and or purifying the analog thus obtained to provide said analog in essentially isolated form as defined hereinabove . This can generally be performed using methods and techniques known per se which will be clear to the skilled person for example from the handbooks and references cited herein and or from the further description hereinbelow. Alternatively and for example a nucleic acid encoding an analog can be synthesized in a manner known per se for example using an automated apparatus for synthesizing nucleic acid sequences with a predefined amino acid sequence and can be expressed in a suitable host or expression system upon which the analog thus obtained can optionally be isolated and or purified so as to provide said analog in essentially isolated form as defined hereinabove . Another way to provide the analogs involves chemical synthesis of the pertinent amino acid sequence using techniques for peptide synthesis known per se such as those mentioned hereinbelow.

It will be also generally be clear to the skilled person that Nanobodies including analogs thereof can also be prepared starting from human Vsequences i.e. amino acid sequences or the corresponding nucleotide sequences such as for example human V3 sequences such as DP 47 DP 51 DP 54 or DP 29 by changing one or more amino acid residues in the amino acid sequence of said human Vdomain so as to provide an amino acid sequence that has a a Q at position 108 and or b E at position 44 and or R at position 45 and preferably E at position 44 and R at position 45 and or c P R or S at position 103 as described above. Again this can generally be performed using the various methods and techniques referred to in the previous paragraph using an amino acid sequence and or nucleotide sequence for a human Vdomain as a starting point.

The term Nanobodies as used herein in its broadest sense also comprises parts or fragments of the Nanobodies including analogs of the invention as defined above which can again be as further described below.

Generally parts or fragments of the Nanobodies and or analogs have amino acid sequences in which compared to the amino acid sequence of the corresponding full length Nanobody or analog one or more of the amino acid residues at the N terminal end one or more amino acid residues at the C terminal end one or more contiguous internal amino acid residues or any combination thereof have been deleted and or removed. It is also possible to combine one or more of such parts or fragments to provide a Nanobody of the invention.

Preferably the amino acid sequence of a Nanobody that comprises one or more parts or fragments of a full length Nanobody and or analog should have a degree of sequence identity of at least 50 preferably at least 60 more preferably at least 70 such as at least 80 at least 90 or at least 95 with the amino acid sequence of the corresponding full length Nanobody.

Also the amino acid sequence of a Nanobody that comprises one or more parts or fragments of a full length Nanobody and or analog is preferably such that is comprises at least 10 contiguous amino acid residues preferably at least 20 contiguous amino acid residues more preferably at least 30 contiguous amino acid residues such as at least 40 contiguous amino acid residues of the amino acid sequence of the corresponding full length Nanobody.

Generally such parts or fragments of the Nanobodies of the invention will have amino acid sequences in which compared to the amino acid sequence of the corresponding full length Nanobody of the invention one or more of the amino acid residues at the N terminal end one or more amino acid residues at the C terminal end one or more contiguous internal amino acid residues or any combination thereof have been deleted and or removed. It is also possible to combine one or more of such parts or fragments to provide a Nanobody of the invention.

According to one preferred embodiment a fragment as used herein comprises at least one of the CDR s present in a full sized Nanobody of the invention preferably at least two of the CDR s present in a full sized Nanobody of the invention more preferably at least CDR2 and CDR3 present in a full sized Nanobody of the invention such as for example all three CDR s present in a full sized Nanobody of the invention.

According to another particularly preferred but non limiting embodiment such a part or fragment comprises at least FR3 CDR3 and FR4 of the corresponding full length Nanobody of the invention i.e. as for example described in the International application WO 03 050531 Lasters et al. .

Preferably such parts or fragments should be such that they still can bind to have affinity for and or have specificity for TNF alpha i.e. with an affinity and or a specificity which is at least 10 preferably at least 50 more preferably at least 70 even more preferably at least 80 such as at least 90 at least 95 at least 99 or more of the affinity and or specificity of the corresponding full sized Nanobody of the invention for example an assay to determine binding of the analog to TNF and in particular one of the assays as used in the Examples below.

From the description hereinabove it will be clear that the amino acid sequences of the Nanobodies used herein differ at at least one amino acid position in at least one of the framework regions from the amino acid sequences of naturally occurring Vdomains such as the amino acid sequences of naturally occurring Vdomains of antibodies from human beings. In particular it will be clear that the amino acid sequences of the Nanobodies used herein differ at at least one of the Hallmark Residues from amino acid sequences of naturally occurring Vdomains such as the amino acid sequences of naturally occurring Vdomains from antibodies from Camelids and or human beings.

Thus according to one specific embodiment a Nanobody of the invention has an amino acid sequence that differs at at least one amino acid position in one of the framework regions from the amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring Vdomain. According to a more specific but non limiting embodiment of the invention a Nanobody of the invention has an amino acid sequence that differs at at least one of the Hallmark residues from the amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring Vdomain.

From the description hereinabove it will also be clear that the amino acid sequences of the some of the Nanobodies of the invention such as the humanized Nanobodies of the invention will differ at at least one amino acid position in at least one of the framework regions i.e. either at the position of a Hallmark residue or at another position from the amino acid sequences of naturally occurring Vdomains. Thus according to one specific but non limiting embodiment a Nanobody of the invention has an amino acid sequence that differs at at least one amino acid position in one of the framework regions from the amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring Vdomain. According to a more specific but non limiting embodiment of the invention a Nanobody of the invention has an amino acid sequence that differs at at least one of the Hallmark residues from the amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring Vdomain.

The invention in its broadest sense also comprises derivatives of the Nanobodies of the invention. Such derivatives can generally be obtained by modification and in particular by chemical and or biological e.g enzymatical modification of the Nanobodies of the invention and or of one or more of the amino acid residues that form the Nanobodies of the invention.

Examples of such modifications as well as examples of amino acid residues within the Nanobody sequence that can be modified in such a manner i.e. either on the protein backbone but preferably on a side chain methods and techniques that can be used to introduce such modifications and the potential uses and advantages of such modifications will be clear to the skilled person.

For example such a modification may involve the introduction e.g. by covalent linking or in an other suitable manner of one or more functional groups residues or moieties into or onto the Nanobody of the invention and in particular of one or more functional groups residues or moieties that confer one or more desired properties or functionalities to the Nanobody of the invention. Example of such functional groups will be clear to the skilled person.

For example such modification may comprise the introduction e.g. by covalent binding or in any other suitable manner of one or more functional groups that that increase the half life the solubility and or the absorption of the Nanobody of the invention that reduce the immunogenicity and or the toxicity of the Nanobody of the invention that eliminate or attenuate any undesirable side effects of the Nanobody of the invention and or that confer other advantageous properties to and or reduce the undesired properties of the Nanobodies and or polypeptides of the invention or any combination of two or more of the foregoing. Examples of such functional groups and of techniques for introducing them will be clear to the skilled person and can generally comprise all functional groups and techniques mentioned in the general background art cited hereinabove as well as the functional groups and techniques known per se for the modification of pharmaceutical proteins and in particular for the modification of antibodies or antibody fragments including ScFv s and single domain antibodies for which reference is for example made to Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th ed. Mack Publishing Co. Easton Pa. 1980 . Such functional groups may for example be linked directly for example covalently to a Nanobody of the invention or optionally via a suitable linker or spacer as will again be clear to the skilled person.

One of the most widely used techniques for increasing the half life and or the reducing immunogenicity of pharmaceutical proteins comprises attachment of a suitable pharmacologically acceptable polymer such as poly ethyleneglycol PEG or derivatives thereof such as methoxypoly ethyleneglycol or mPEG . Generally any suitable form of pegylation can be used such as the pegylation used in the art for antibodies and antibody fragments including but not limited to single domain antibodies and ScFv s reference is made to for example Chapman Nat. Biotechnol. 54 531 545 2002 by Veronese and Harris Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 54 453 456 2003 by Harris and Chess Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2 2003 and in WO 04 060965. Various reagents for pegylation of proteins are also commercially available for example from Nektar Therapeutics USA.

Preferably site directed pegylation is used in particular via a cysteine residue see for example Yang et al. Protein Engineering 16 10 761 770 2003 . For example for this purpose PEG may be attached to a cysteine residue that naturally occurs in a Nanobody of the invention a Nanobody of the invention may be modified so as to suitably introduce one or more cysteine residues for attachment of PEG or an amino acid sequence comprising one or more cysteine residues for attachment of PEG may be fused to the N and or C terminus of a Nanobody of the invention all using techniques of protein engineering known per se to the skilled person.

Preferably for the Nanobodies and proteins of the invention a PEG is used with a molecular weight of more than 5000 such as more than 10 000 and less than 200 000 such as less than 100 000 for example in the range of 20 000 80 000.

With regard to pegylation its should be noted that generally the invention also encompasses any Nanobody of the invention and or polypeptide of the invention that has been pegylated at one or more amino acid positions preferably in such a way that said pegylation either 1 increases the half life in vivo 2 reduces immunogenicity 3 provides one or more further beneficial properties known per se for pegylation 4 does not essentially affect the affinity of the Nanobody and or polypeptide for TNF alpha e.g. does not reduce said affinity by more than 90 preferably not by more than 50 and more preferably not by more than 10 as determined by a suitable assay such as those described in the Examples below and or 4 does not affect any of the other desired properties of the Nanobodies and or polypeptides of the invention. Suitable PEG groups and methods for attaching them either specifically or non specifically will be clear to the skilled person. Suitable kits and reagents for such pegylation can for example be obtained from Nektar CA USA .

Another usually less preferred modification comprises N linked or O linked glycosylation usually as part of co translational and or post translational modification depending on the host cell used for expressing the Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention.

Yet another modification may comprise the introduction of one or more detectable labels or other signal generating groups or moieties depending on the intended use of the labelled Nanobody. Suitable labels and techniques for attaching using and detecting them will be clear to the skilled person and for example include but are not limited to fluorescent labels such as fluorescein isothiocyanate rhodamine phycoerythrin phycocyanin allophycocyanin o phthaldehyde and fluorescamine and fluorescent metals such as Eu or others metals from the lanthanide series phosphorescent labels chemiluminescent labels or bioluminescent labels such as luminal isoluminol theromatic acridinium ester imidazole acridinium salts oxalate ester dioxetane or GFP and its analogs radio isotopes such as H I P S C Cr Co Co Fe and Se metals metals chelates or metallic cations for example metallic cations such as Tc I In I Ru Ga and Ga or other metals or metallic cations that are particularly suited for use in in vivo in vitro or in situ diagnosis and imaging such as Gd Mn Dy Cr and Fe as well as chromophores and enzymes such as malate dehydrogenase staphylococcal nuclease delta V steroid isomerase yeast alcohol dehydrogenase alpha glycerophosphate dehydrogenase triose phosphate isomerase biotinavidin peroxidase horseradish peroxidase alkaline phosphatase asparaginase glucose oxidase galactosidase ribonuclease urease catalase glucose VI phosphate dehydrogenase glucoamylase and acetylcholine esterase . Other suitable labels will be clear to the skilled person and for example include moieties that can be detected using NMR or ESR spectroscopy.

Such labelled Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention may for example be used for in vitro in vivo or in situ assays including immunoassays known per se such as ELISA RIA EIA and other sandwich assays etc. as well as in vivo diagnostic and imaging purposes depending on the choice of the specific label.

As will be clear to the skilled person another modification may involve the introduction of a chelating group for example to chelate one of the metals or metallic cations referred to above. Suitable chelating groups for example include without limitation diethyl enetriaminepentaacetic acid DTPA or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid EDTA .

Yet another modification may comprise the introduction of a functional group that is one part of a specific binding pair such as the biotin strept avidin binding pair. Such a functional group may be used to link the Nanobody of the invention to another protein polypeptide or chemical compound that is bound to the other half of the binding pair i.e. through formation of the binding pair. For example a Nanobody of the invention may be conjugated to biotin and linked to another protein polypeptide compound or carrier conjugated to avidin or streptavidin. For example such a conjugated Nanobody may be used as a reporter for example in a diagnostic system where a detectable signal producing agent is conjugated to avidin or streptavidin. Such binding pairs may for example also be used to bind the Nanobody of the invention to a carrier including carriers suitable for pharmaceutical purposes. One non limiting example are the liposomal formulations described by Cao and Suresh Journal of Drug Targetting 8 4 257 2000 . Such binding pairs may also be used to link a therapeutically active agent to the Nanobody of the invention.

For some applications in particular for those applications in which it is intended to kill a cell that expresses the target against which the Nanobodies of the invention are directed e.g. in the treatment of cancer or to reduce or slow the growth and or proliferation such a cell the Nanobodies of the invention may also be linked to a toxin or to a toxic residue or moiety. Examples of toxic moieties compounds or residues which can be linked to a Nanobody of the invention to provide for example a cytotoxic compound will be clear to the skilled person and can for example be found in the prior art cited above and or in the further description herein. One example is the so called ADEPT technology WO 03 055527.

Other potential chemical and enzymatical modifications will be clear to the skilled person. Such modifications may also be introduced for research purposes e.g. to study function activity relationships . Reference is for example made to Lundblad and Bradshaw Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 26 143 151 1997 .

As mentioned above the invention also relates to proteins or polypeptides comprising at least one Vdomain i.e. as identified using the methods of the invention or at least one Nanobody based thereon.

According to one non limiting embodiment of the invention such a polypeptide of the invention essentially consists of a Nanobody. By essentially consist of is meant that the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide of the invention either is exactly the same as the amino acid sequence of a Nanobody as mentioned above or corresponds to the amino acid sequence of a Nanobody in which a limited number of amino acid residues such as 1 10 amino acid residues and preferably 1 6 amino acid residues such as 1 2 3 4 5 or 6 amino acid residues have been added to the amino terminal end to the carboxy terminal end or both to the amino terminal end and to the carboxy terminal end of the amino acid sequence of the Nanobody.

Said amino acid residues may or may not change alter or otherwise influence the biological properties of the Nanobody and may or may not add further functionality to the Nanobody. For example such amino acid residues 

According to another embodiment a polypeptide of the invention comprises a Nanobody of the invention which is fused at its amino terminal end at its carboxy terminal end or both at its amino terminal end and at its carboxy terminal end to at least one further amino acid sequence i.e. so as to provide a fusion protein comprising said Nanobody of the invention and the one or more further amino acid sequences. Such a fusion will also be referred to herein as a Nanobody fusion .

The one or more further amino acid sequence may be any suitable and or desired amino acid sequences. The further amino acid sequences may or may not change alter or otherwise influence the biological properties of the Nanobody and may or may not add further functionality to the Nanobody or the polypeptide of the invention. Preferably the further amino acid sequence is such that it confers one or more desired properties or functionalities to the Nanobody or the polypeptide of the invention.

Example of such amino acid sequences will be clear to the skilled person and may generally comprise all amino acid sequences that are used in peptide fusions based on conventional antibodies and fragments thereof including but not limited to ScFv s and single domain antibodies . Reference is for example made to the review by Holliger and Hudson Nature Biotechnology 23 9 1126 1136 2005 

For example such an amino acid sequence may be an amino acid sequence that increases the half life the solubility or the absorption reduces the immunogenicity or the toxicity eliminates or attenuates undesirable side effects and or confers other advantageous properties to and or reduces the undesired properties of the polypeptides of the invention compared to the Nanobody of the invention per se. Some non limiting examples of such amino acid sequences are serum proteins such as human serum albumin see for example WO 00 27435 or haptenic molecules for example haptens that are recognized by circulating antibodies see for example WO 98 22141 .

The further amino acid sequence may also provide a second binding site which binding site may be directed against any desired protein polypeptide antigen antigenic determinant or epitope including but not limited to the same protein polypeptide antigen antigenic determinant or epitope against which the Nanobody of the invention is directed or a different protein polypeptide antigen antigenic determinant or epitope . For example the further amino acid sequence may provide a second binding site that is directed against a serum protein such as for example human serum albumin or another serum protein such as IgG so as to provide increased half life in serum. Reference is for example made to EP 0 368 684 WO 91 01743 WO 01 45746 and WO 04 003019 in which various serum proteins are mentioned the International application by applicant entitled Nanobodies against amyloid beta and polypeptides comprising the same for the treatment of degenerative neural diseases such as Alzheimer s disease in which various other proteins are mentioned as well as to Harmsen et al. Vaccine 23 41 4926 42.

According to another embodiment the one or more further amino acid sequences may comprise one or more parts fragments or domains of conventional 4 chain antibodies and in particular human antibodies and or of heavy chain antibodies. For example although usually less preferred a Nanobody of the invention may be linked to a conventional preferably human Vor Vdomain or to a natural or synthetic analog of a Vor Vdomain again optionally via a linker sequence including but not limited to other single domain antibodies such as the dAb s described by Ward et al. .

The at least one Nanobody may also be linked to one or more preferably human CH CHand or CHdomains optionally via a linker sequence. For instance a Nanobody linked to a suitable CHdomain could for example be used together with suitable light chains to generate antibody fragments structures analogous to conventional Fab fragments or F ab 2 fragments but in which one or in case of an F ab 2 fragment one or both of the conventional Vdomains have been replaced by a Nanobody of the invention. Also two Nanobodies could be linked to a CH3 domain optionally via a linker to provide a construct with increased half life in vivo.

According to one specific embodiment of a polypeptide of the invention one or more Nanobodies of the invention may linked to one or more antibody parts fragments or domains that confer one or more effector functions to the polypeptide of the invention and or may confer the ability to bind to one or more Fc receptors. For example for this purpose and without being limited thereto the one or more further amino acid sequences may comprise one or more CHand or CHdomains of an antibody such as from a heavy chain antibody as described herein and more preferably from a conventional human 4 chain antibody and or may form part of and Fc region for example from IgG from IgE or from another human Ig. For example WO 94 04678 describes heavy chain antibodies comprising a Camelid Vdomain or a humanized derivative thereof i.e. a Nanobody in which the Camelidae CHand or CHdomain have been replaced by human CHand CHdomains so as to provide an immunoglobulin that consists of 2 heavy chains each comprising a Nanobody and human CH2 and CH3 domains but no CH1 domain which immunoglobulin has the effector function provided by the CH2 and CH3 domains and which immunoglobulin can function without the presence of any light chains. Other amino acid sequences that can be suitably linked to the Nanobodies of the invention so as to provide an effector function will be clear to the skilled person and may be chosen on the basis of the desired effector function s . Reference is for example made to WO 04 058820 WO 99 42077 and WO 05 017148 as well as the review by Holliger and Hudson supra. Coupling of a Nanobody of the invention to an Fc portion may also lead to an increased half life compared to the corresponding Nanobody of the invention. For some applications the use of an Fc portion and or of constant domains i.e. CHand or CHdomains that confer increased half life without any biologically significant effector function may also be suitable or even preferred. Other suitable constructs comprising one or more Nanobodies and one or more constant domains with increased half life in vivo will be clear to the skilled person and may for example comprise two Nanobodies linked to a CH3 domain optionally via a linker sequence. Generally any fusion protein or derivatives with increased half life will preferably have a molecular weight of more than 50 kD the cut off value for renal absorption.

The further amino acid sequences may also form a signal sequence or leader sequence that directs secretion of the Nanobody or the polypeptide of the invention from a host cell upon synthesis for example to provide a pre pro or prepro form of the polypeptide of the invention depending on the host cell used to express the polypeptide of the invention .

The further amino acid sequence may also form a sequence or signal that allows the Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention to be directed towards and or to penetrate or enter into specific organs tissues cells or parts or compartments of cells and or that allows the Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention to penetrate or cross a biological barrier such as a cell membrane a cell layer such as a layer of epithelial cells a tumor including solid tumors or the blood brain barrier. Suitable examples of such amino acid sequences will be clear to the skilled person and for example include but are not limited to the Peptrans vectors mentioned above the sequences described by Cardinale et al. and the amino acid sequences and antibody fragments known per se that can be used to express or produce the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention as so called intrabodies for example as described in WO 94 02610 WO 95 22618 U.S. Pat. No. 7 004 940 WO 03 014960 WO 99 07414 WO 05 01690 EP 1 512 696 and in Cattaneo A. Biocca S. 1997 Intracellular Antibodies Development and Applications. Landes and Springer Verlag and in Kontermann Methods 34 2004 163 170 and the further references described therein.

For some applications in particular for those applications in which it is intended to kill a cell that expresses the target against which the Nanobodies of the invention are directed e.g. in the treatment of cancer or to reduce or slow the growth and or proliferation such a cell the Nanobodies of the invention may also be linked to a cyto toxic protein or polypeptide. Examples of such toxic proteins and polypeptides which can be linked to a Nanobody of the invention to provide for example a cytotoxic polypeptide of the invention will be clear to the skilled person and can for example be found in the prior art cited above and or in the further description herein. One example is the so called ADEPT technology WO 03 055527.

According to one non limiting embodiment one or more amino acid residues can be added to inserted in and or substituted in the amino acid sequence of a Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention so as to provide one or more specific amino acid residues for attachment of a PEG group.

The efficacy of protein pharmaceuticals depends on its potency to neutralize the target but also on the intrinsic pharmacokinetics of the potential drug. Because the kidney generally filters out molecules below 60 000 Daltons Da efforts to reduce clearance have focussed on increasing the molecular weight of the biopharmaceutical through protein fusions Syed et al. 1997 glycosylations or modification with polyethylene glycol polymers i.e. PEGylation Lee et al. 1999 Abuchowski et al. 1977 Nucci et al. 1991 Lecolley et al. Chem Commun 2004 Tao et al. J Am Chem Soc 2004 Mantovani et al. 2005 . These methods successfully extend the in vivo exposure of the biopharmaceutical.

Alternatively the half life can be extended using another pegylating agent POLY PEG for conjugation to the bivalent Nanobodies TNF56 or TNF55. POLY PEG are comb shape polymers with PEG teeth on a methacrylic backbone. POLY PEGs can vary on the length of the PEG chain on the methacrylic backbone and on the active end group which determines the method of conjugation of the POLY PEG to the Nanobody. Site specific conjugation to the C terminal cysteine present in the Nanobodies can be achieved through the active maleimide end group in the POLY PEG.

The invention also encompasses any Nanobody of the invention and or polypeptide of the invention that has been glycosylated at one or more amino acid positions usually depending upon the host used to express the Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention as further described below .

According to one non limiting embodiment one or more amino acid residues can be added to inserted in and or substituted in the amino acid sequence of a Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention so as to provide one or more specific amino acid residues and or a site that can be glycosylated by the host organism used. By means of a preferred but non limiting example the N residue on position 50 within CDR2 of a Nanobody of the invention can for example be replaced by a Q D or S residue so as to provide a glycosylation site e.g. for glycosylation by

According to another embodiment a polypeptide of the invention can comprise the amino acid sequence of a Nanobody which is fused at its amino terminal end at its carboxy terminal end or both at its amino terminal end and at its carboxy terminal end with at least one further amino acid sequence.

Again said further amino acid sequence s may or may not change alter or otherwise influence the biological properties of the Nanobody and may or may not add further functionality to the Nanobody.

For example according to one preferred but non limiting embodiment said further amino acid sequence may comprise at least one further Nanobody so as to provide a polypeptide of the invention that comprises at least two such as three four or five Nanobodies in which said Nanobodies may optionally be linked via one or more linker sequences as defined herein .

Polypeptides of the invention comprising two or more Nanobodies will also referred to herein as multivalent polypeptides. For example a bivalent polypeptide of the Invention comprises two Nanobodies optionally linked via a linker sequence whereas a trivalent polypeptide of the invention comprises three Nanobodies optionally linked via two linker sequences etc.

In a multivalent polypeptide of the invention the two or more Nanobodies may be the same or different. For example the two or more Nanobodies in a multivalent polypeptide of the invention 

Polypeptides of the invention that contain at least two Nanobodies in which at least one Nanobody is directed against a first antigen and at least one Nanobody is directed against a second antigen different from the first antigen will also be referred to as multispecific Nanobodies. Thus a bispecific Nanobody is a Nanobody that comprises at least one Nanobody directed against a first antigen and at least one further Nanobody directed against a second antigen whereas a trispecific Nanobody is a Nanobody that comprises at least one Nanobody directed against a first antigen at least one further Nanobody directed against a second antigen and at least one further Nanobody directed against a third antigen etc.

Accordingly in their simplest form a bispecific polypeptide of the invention is a bivalent polypeptide of the invention as defined herein comprising a first Nanobody directed against a first antigen and a second Nanobody directed against a second antigen in which said first and second Nanobody may optionally be linked via a linker sequence as defined herein whereas a trispecific polypeptide of the invention in its simplest form is a trivalent polypeptide of the invention as defined herein comprising a first Nanobody directed against a first antigen a second Nanobody directed against a second antigen and a third Nanobody directed against a third antigen in which said first second and third Nanobody may optionally be linked via one or more and in particular one and more in particular two linker sequences.

However as will be clear from the description hereinabove the invention is not limited thereto in the sense that a multispecific polypeptide of the invention may comprise any number of Nanobodies directed against two or more different antigens.

For multivalent and multispecific polypeptides containing one or more Vdomains and their preparation reference is also made to Conrath et al. . Vol. 276 10. 7346 7350 as well as to EP 0 822 985.

In the polypeptides of the invention the one or more Nanobodies and the one or more polypeptides may be directly linked to each other as for example described in WO 99 23221 and or may be linked to each other via one or more suitable spacers or linkers or any combination thereof.

Suitable spacers or linkers for use in multivalent and multispecific polypeptides will be clear to the skilled person and may generally be any linker or spacer used in the art to link amino acid sequences. Preferably said linker or spacer is suitable for use in constructing proteins or polypeptides that are intended for pharmaceutical use.

Some particularly preferred spacers include the spacers and linkers that are used in the art to link antibody fragments or antibody domains. These include the linkers mentioned in the general background art cited above as well as for example linkers that are used in the art to construct diabodies or ScFv fragments in this respect however its should be noted that whereas in diabodies and in ScFv fragments the linker sequence used should have a length a degree of flexibility and other properties that allow the pertinent Vand Vdomains to come together to form the complete antigen binding site there is no particular limitation on the length or the flexibility of the linker used in the polypeptide of the invention since each Nanobody by itself forms a complete antigen binding site .

Other suitable linkers generally comprise organic compounds or polymers in particular those suitable for use in proteins for pharmaceutical use. For instance poly ethyleneglycol moieties have been used to link antibody domains see for example WO 04 081026.

It is also within the scope of the invention that the linker s used confer one or more other favourable properties or functionality to the polypeptides of the invention and or provide one or more sites for the formation of derivatives and or for the attachment of functional groups e.g. as described herein for the derivatives of the Nanobodies of the invention . For example linkers containing one or more charged amino acid residues see Table A 3 above can provide improved hydrophilic properties whereas linkers that form or contain small epitopes or tags can be used for the purposes of detection identification and or purification. Again based on the disclosure herein the skilled person will be able to determine the optimal linkers for use in a specific polypeptide of the invention optionally after on some limited routine experiments.

Finally when two or more linkers are used in the polypeptides of the invention these linkers may be the same or different. Again based on the disclosure herein the skilled person will be able to determine the optimal linkers for use in a specific polypeptide of the invention optionally after on some limited routine experiments.

Linkers for use in multivalent and multispecific polypeptides will be clear to the skilled person and for example include gly ser linkers for example of the type glyser such as for example glyser or glyser as described in WO 99 42077 hinge like regions such as the hinge regions of naturally occurring heavy chain antibodies or similar sequences. For other suitable linkers reference is also made to the general background art cited above. Some particularly preferred linkers are given in SEQ ID NO s 68 and 69.

Linkers can also provide some functionality for the multivalent or multispecific polypeptide. For example linkers containing one or more charged amino acid residues see Table 1 above can provide improved hydrophilic properties whereas linkers that form or contain small epitopes or tags can be used for the purposes of detection identification and or purification.

As mentioned herein in a protein or polypeptide of the invention the anti TNF Nanobodies mentioned herein are preferably linked in such a way that said protein or polypeptide upon binding to a TNF trimer is capable inhibiting or reducing the TNF receptor crosslinking that is mediated by said TNF trimer and or the signal transduction that is mediated by such receptor crosslinking and or in such a way that the protein or polypeptide is capable of intramolecular binding to at least two TNF receptor binding sites on a TNF trimer. Suitable linkers are as described herein.

As also mentioned herein whether a protein or polypeptide provides intermolecular binding or extramolecular binding can be assessed at least initially by a size exclusion chromatography. By Size Exclusion Chromatography the complexes of TNF alpha and antibodies can be analyzed for determining the number and the ratio of antibody and TNF alpha molecules in the complex. From these data it can be deduced if inter or intramolecular binding occurs as was done by Santora and colleagues Santora L. C. et al Anal Biochem. 2001 for establishing the stoichiometry of binding of monoclonal antibody D2E7 Humira to TNF alpha at different ratios of antibody and target. From the molecular weight of the complex it was concluded that three antibody molecules complexed with three TNF trimers thereby indicating that the antibody binds in an intermolecular mode. Similar experiments were performed with bivalent Nanobodies in which a very short linker induced the formation of large molecular complexes which were obtained by intermolecular bonds. However the same bivalent Nanobodies constructs with longer linkers eluted from the gel filtration column as discrete small complexes thereby demonstrating that intramolecular bonds were formed. Combined with the bioassay data in which the longer linker containing Nanobody TNF1 had an optimal potency complete neutralization of amount of TNF used in the assay i.e. 10 pM it can be concluded that intramolecular binding of the bivalent Nanobody efficiently prevents cross linking of two cell bound receptors and the associated receptor activation. Known monoclonal antibodies such as Humira or Remicade can not form such intramolecular bonds leaving always two receptor bindingsites on the trimeric TNF molecule to a certain degree available for interaction with cell bound receptor which translates into less potent neutralization as measured in the bioassay.

Alternatively whether a protein or polypeptide provides intermolecular binding or extramolecular binding can be assessed by crystallography and or molecular modelling or other suitable in silico techniques . A model of a trimeric TNF30 TNF alpha complex was generated based on the crystal structure of the monomeric wild type TNF1 TNF alpha complex. From this structure the final TNF30 linker ALB8 linker TNF30 construct was modeled. The TNF30 linker ALB8 linker TNF30 construct was modelled starting from the trimer of TNF with two TNF30 molecules bound. As the structure of the ALB8 is not known a third TNF30 molecule was used instead which was placed in between the other two Nanobodies along the line between the N and C termini. The 9 amino acid linkers were then added manually.

The model is shown in . Clearly the 9 amino acid linkers together with the ALB8 provide ample room to span the about 66 between the two TNF30 domains bound to TNF . ALB8 by itself already spans 40 and each linker can span another 27 in completely extended conformation. As a result the ALB8 has quite some flexibility of movement and it is not expected that its binding to albumin would interfere much with the binding to TNF .

Moreover it is likely that the linkers can be shortened without affecting avidity especially in the case of the linker that is C terminal of ALB8. This may have the beneficial effect of increased binding to the same TNF trimer versus crosslinking trimers because the probability that the second TNF30 associates with a different TNF increases with the length of the linker.

As also further described herein a multispecific polypeptide of the invention directed against a desired antigen and against at least one serum protein such as the serum proteins mentioned hereinbelow and in particular against human serum albumin may show increased half life in serum compared to the corresponding monovalent Nanobody.

As mentioned hereinabove the methods described herein are particularly suited for generating such multivalent of multispecific polypeptides of the invention. In a polypeptide of the invention the at least one Nanobody may also be linked to a conventional Vdomain or to a natural or synthetic analog of a Vdomain optionally via a linker sequence.

In a polypeptide of the invention the at least one Nanobody may also be linked to a Vdomain or to a natural or synthetic analog of a Vdomain optionally via a linker sequence so as to provide a polypeptide of the invention that is in the form analogous to a conventional scFv fragment but containing a Nanobody instead of a Vdomain.

In a polypeptide of the invention the at least one Nanobody may also be linked to one or more of a CH1 CH2 and or CH3 domain optionally via a linker sequence. For instance a Nanobody linked to a suitable CH1 domain could for example be used together with suitable light chains to generate antibody fragments structures analogous to conventional Fab fragments or F ab fragments but in which one or in case of an F ab fragment one or both of the conventional Vdomains have been replaced by a Nanobody. Such fragments may also be heterospecific or bispecific i.e. directed against two or more antigens. A Nanobody linked to suitable CH2 and CH3 domains for example derived from Camelids could be used to form a monospecific or bispecific heavy chain antibody. Finally a Nanobody linked to suitable CH1 CH2 and CH3 domains for example derived from a human being could be used together with suitable light chains to form an antibody that is analogous to a conventional 4 chain antibody but in which one or both of the conventional Vdomains have been replaced by a Nanobody.

Also in addition to the one or more Nanobodies Polypeptides of the Invention can also contain functional groups moieties or residues for example therapeutically active substances such as those mentioned below and or markers or labels such as fluorescent markers isotopes etc. as further described hereinbelow.

The Nanobodies of the invention the polypeptides of the invention and nucleic acids encoding the same can be prepared in a manner known per se as will be clear to the skilled person from the further description herein. Some preferred but non limiting methods for preparing the Nanobodies polypeptides and nucleic acids include the methods and techniques mentioned above and or further described hereinbelow.

As will be clear to the skilled person one particularly useful method for preparing a Nanobody and or a polypeptide of the invention generally comprises the steps of 

A nucleic acid of the invention can be in the form of single or double stranded DNA or RNA and is preferably in the form of double stranded DNA. For example the nucleotide sequences of the invention may be genomic DNA cDNA or synthetic DNA such as DNA with a codon usage that has been specifically adapted for expression in the intended host cell or host organism .

According to one embodiment of the invention the nucleic acid of the invention is in essentially isolated from as defined hereinabove.

The nucleic acid of the invention may also be in the form of be present in and or be part of a vector such as for example a plasmid cosmid or YAC which again may be in essentially isolated form.

The nucleic acids of the invention can be prepared or obtained in a manner known per se based on the information on the amino acid sequences for the polypeptides of the invention given herein and or can be isolated from a suitable natural source. To provide analogs nucleotide sequences encoding naturally occurring Vdomains can for example be subjected to site directed mutagenesis so as to provide a nucleic acid of the invention encoding said analog. Also as will be clear to the skilled person to prepare a nucleic acid of the invention also several nucleotide sequences such as at least one nucleotide sequence encoding a Nanobody and for example nucleic acids encoding one or more linkers can be linked together in a suitable manner.

Techniques for generating the nucleic acids of the invention will be clear to the skilled person and may for instance include but are not limited to automated DNA synthesis site directed mutagenesis combining two or more naturally occurring and or synthetic sequences or two or more parts thereof introduction of mutations that lead to the expression of a truncated expression product introduction of one or more restriction sites e.g. to create casettes and or regions that may easily be digested and or ligated using suitable restriction enzymes and or the introduction of mutations by means of a PCR reaction using one or more mismatched primers using for example a sequence of a naturally occurring GPCR as a template. These and other techniques will be clear to the skilled person and reference is again made to the standard handbooks such as Sambrook et al. and Ausubel et al. mentioned above as well as the Examples below.

The nucleic acid of the invention may also be in the form of be present in and or be part of a genetic construct as will be clear to the person skilled in the art. Such genetic constructs generally comprise at least one nucleic acid of the invention that is optionally linked to one or more elements of genetic constructs known per se such as for example one or more suitable regulatory elements such as a suitable promoter s enhancer s terminator s etc. and the further elements of genetic constructs referred to hereinbelow. Such genetic constructs comprising at least one nucleic acid of the invention will also be referred to herein as genetic constructs of the invention .

The genetic constructs of the invention may be DNA or RNA and are preferably double stranded DNA. The genetic constructs of the invention may also be in a form suitable for transformation of the intended host cell or host organism in a form suitable for integration into the genomic DNA of the intended host cell or in a form suitable independent replication maintenance and or inheritance in the intended host organism. For instance the genetic constructs of the invention may be in the form of a vector such as for example a plasmid cosmid YAC a viral vector or transposon. In particular the vector may be an expression vector i.e. a vector that can provide for expression in vitro and or in vivo e.g. in a suitable host cell host organism and or expression system .

Preferably in the genetic constructs of the invention said at least one nucleic acid of the invention and said regulatory elements and optionally said one or more further elements are operably linked to each other by which is generally meant that they are in a functional relationship with each other. For instance a promoter is considered operably linked to a coding sequence if said promoter is able to initiate or otherwise control regulate the transcription and or the expression of a coding sequence in which said coding sequence should be understood as being under the control of said promotor . Generally when two nucleotide sequences are operably linked they will be in the same orientation and usually also in the same reading frame. They will usually also be essentially contiguous although this may also not be required.

Preferably the regulatory and further elements of the genetic constructs of the invention are such that they are capable of providing their intended biological function in the intended host cell or host organism.

For instance a promoter enhancer or terminator should be operable in the intended host cell or host organism by which is meant that for example said promoter should be capable of initiating or otherwise controlling regulating the transcription and or the expression of a nucleotide sequence e.g. a coding sequence to which it is operably linked as defined herein .

Some particularly preferred promoters include but are not limited to promoters known per se for the expression in bacterial cells such as those mentioned hereinbelow and or those used in the Examples.

A selection marker should be such that it allows i.e. under appropriate selection conditions host cells and or host organisms that have been succesfully transformed with the nucleotide sequence of the invention to be distinguished from host cells organisms that have not been succesfully transformed. Some preferred but non limiting examples of such markers are genes that provide resistance against antibiotics such as kanamycine or ampicilline genes that provide for temperature resistance or genes that allow the host cell or host organism to be maintained in the absence of certain factors compounds and or food components in the medium that are essential for survival of the non transformed cells or organisms.

A leader sequence should be such that in the intended host cell or host organism it allows for the desired post translational modifications and or such that it directs the transcribed mRNA to a desired part or organelle of a cell. A leader sequence may also allow for secretion of the expression product from said cell. As such the leader sequence may be any pro pre or prepro sequence operable in the host cell or host organism. Leader sequences may not be required for expression in a bacterial cell.

An expression marker or reporter gene should be such that in the host cell or host organism it allows for detection of the expression of a gene or nucleotide sequence present on the genetic construct. An expression marker may optionally also allow for the localisation of the expressed product e.g. in a specific part or organelle of a cell and or in a specific cell s tissue s organ s or part s of a multicellular organism. Such reporter genes may also be expressed as a protein fusion with the amino acid sequence of the invention. Some preferred but non limiting examples include fluorescent proteins such as GFP.

Some preferred but non limiting examples of suitable promoters terminator and further elements include those used in the Examples below. For some further non limiting examples of the promoters selection markers leader sequences expression markers and further elements that may be present used in the genetic constructs of the invention such as terminators transcriptional and or translational enhancers and or integration factors reference is made to the general handbooks such as Sambrook et al. and Ausubel et al. mentioned above as well as to the examples that are given in WO 95 07463 WO 96 23810 WO 95 07463 WO 95 21191 WO 97 11094 WO 97 42320 WO 98 06737 WO 98 21355 U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 207 410 5 693 492 and EP 1 085 089. Other examples will be clear to the skilled person. Reference is also made to the general background art cited above and the further references cited hereinbelow.

The genetic constructs of the invention may generally be provided by suitably linking the nucleotide sequence s of the invention to the one or more further elements described above for example using the techniques described in the general handbooks such as Sambrook et al. and Ausubel et al. mentioned above.

Often the genetic constructs of the invention will be obtained by inserting a nucleotide sequence of the invention in a suitable expression vector known per se. Some preferred but non limiting examples of suitable expression vectors are those used in the Examples below as well as those mentioned below.

The nucleic acids of the invention and or the genetic constructs of the invention may be used to transform a host cell or host organism. The host cell or host organism may be any suitable fungal prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell or cell line or any suitable fungal prokaryotic or eukaryotic organism for example 

The Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention can also be introduced and expressed in one or more cells tissues or organs of a multicellular organism for example for prophylactic and or therapeutic purposes e.g. as a gene therapy . For this purpose the nucleotide sequences of the invention may be introduced into the cells or tissues in any suitable way for example as such e.g. using liposomes or after they have been inserted into a suitable gene therapy vector for example derived from retroviruses such as adenovirus or parvoviruses such as adeno associated virus . As will also be clear to the skilled person such gene therapy may be performed in vivo and or in situ in the body of a patient by administering a nucleic acid of the invention or a suitable gene therapy vector encoding the same to the patient or to specific cells or a specific tissue or organ of the patient or suitable cells often taken from the body of the patient to be treated such as explanted lymphocytes bone marrow aspirates or tissue biopsies may be treated in vitro with a nucleotide sequence of the invention and then be suitably re introduced into the body of the patient. All this can be performed using gene therapy vectors techniques and delivery systems which are well known to the skilled person for example Culver K. W. Gene Therapy 1994 p. xii Mary Ann Liebert Inc. Publishers New York N.Y. Giordano Nature F Medicine 2 1996 534 539 Schaper Circ. Res. 79 1996 911 919 Anderson Science 256 1992 808 813 Verma Nature 389 1994 239 Isner Lancet 348 1996 370 374 Muhlhauser Circ.

For example in situ expression of ScFv fragments Afanasieva et al. Gene Ther. 10 1850 1859 2003 and of diabodies Blanco et al. J. Immunol 171 1070 1077 2003 has been described in the art.

For expression of the Nanobodies in a cell they may also be expressed as so called intrabodies as for example described in WO 94 02610 WO 95 22618 and U.S. Pat. No. 7 004 940 WO 03 014960 in Cattaneo A. Biocca S. 1997 Intracellular Antibodies Development and Applications. Landes and Springer Verlag and in Kontermann Methods 34 2004 163 170.

For production the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention can for example also be produced in the milk of transgenic mammals for example in the milk of rabbits cows goats or sheep see for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 741 957 6 304 489 and 6 849 992 for general techniques for introducing transgenes into mammals in plants or parts of plants including but not limited to their leaves flowers fruits seed roots or tubers for example in tobacco maize soybean or alfalfa or in for example pupae of the silkworm

Furthermore the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention can also be expressed and or produced in cell free expression systems and suitable examples of such systems will be clear to the skilled person. Some preferred but non limiting examples include expression in the wheat germ system in rabbit reticulocyte lysates or in the Zubay system.

As mentioned above one of the advantages of the use of Nanobodies is that the polypeptides based thereon can be prepared through expression in a suitable bacterial system and suitable bacterial expression systems vectors host cells regulatory elements etc. will be clear to the skilled person for example from the references cited above. It should however be noted that the invention in its broadest sense is not limited to expression in bacterial systems.

Preferably in the invention an in vivo or in vitro expression system such as a bacterial expression system is used that provides the polypeptides of the invention in a form that is suitable for pharmaceutical use and such expression systems will again be clear to the skilled person. As also will be clear to the skilled person Polypeptides of the invention suitable for pharmaceutical use can be prepared using techniques for peptide synthesis.

For production on industrial scale preferred heterologous hosts for the industrial production of Nanobodies or Nanobody containing protein therapeutics include strains of that are suitable for large scale expression production fermentation and in particular for large scale pharmaceutical expression production fermentation. Suitable examples of such strains will be clear to the skilled person. Such strains and production expression systems are also made available by companies such as Biovitrum Uppsala Sweden .

Alternatively mammalian cell lines in particular Chinese hamster ovary CHO cells can be used for large scale expression production fermentation and in particular for large scale pharmaceutical expression production fermentation. Again such expression production systems are also made available by some of the companies mentioned above.

The choice of the specific expression system would depend in part on the requirement for certain post translational modifications more specifically glycosylation. The production of a Nanobody containing recombinant protein for which glycosylation is desired or required would necessitate the use of mammalian expression hosts that have the ability to glycosylate the expressed protein. In this respect it will be clear to the skilled person that the glycosylation pattern obtained i.e. the kind number and position of residues attached will depend on the cell or cell line that is used for the expression. Preferably either a human cell or cell line is used i.e. leading to a protein that essentially has a human glycosylation pattern or another mammalian cell line is used that can provide a glycosylation pattern that is essentially and or functionally the same as human glycosylation or at least mimics human glycosylation. Generally prokaryotic hosts such as do not have the ability to glycosylate proteins and the use of lower eukaryotes such as yeast are usually leads to a glycosylation pattern that differs from human glycosylation. Nevertheless it should be understood that all the foregoing host cells and expression systems can be used in the invention depending on the desired Nanobody or protein to be obtained.

Thus according to one non limiting embodiment of the invention the Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention is glycosylated. According to another non limiting embodiment of the invention the Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention is non glycosylated.

According to one preferred but non limiting embodiment of the invention the Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention is produced in a bacterial cell in particular a bacterial cell suitable for large scale pharmaceutical production such as cells of the strains mentioned above.

According to another preferred but non limiting embodiment of the invention the Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention is produced in a yeast cell in particular a yeast cell suitable for large scale pharmaceutical production such as cells of the species mentioned above.

According to yet another preferred but non limiting embodiment of the invention the Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention is produced in a mammalian cell in particular in a human cell or in a cell of a human cell line and more in particular in a human cell or in a cell of a human cell line that is suitable for large scale pharmaceutical production such as the cell lines mentioned hereinabove.

When expression in a host cell is used to produce the Nanobodies and the proteins of the invention the Nanobodies and proteins of the invention can be produced either intracellullarly e.g. in the cytosol in the periplasma or in inclusion bodies and then isolated from the host cells and optionally further purified or can be produced extracellularly e.g. in the medium in which the host cells are cultured and then isolated from the culture medium and optionally further purified. When eukaryotic hosts cells are used extracellular production is usually preferred since this considerably facilitates the further isolation and downstream processing of the Nanobodies and proteins obtained. Bacterial cells such as the strains of mentioned above normally do not secrete proteins extracellularly except for a few classes of proteins such as toxins and hemolysin and secretory production in refers to the translocation of proteins across the inner membrane to the periplasmic space. Periplasmic production provides several advantages over cytosolic production. For example the N terminal amino acid sequence of the secreted product can be identical to the natural gene product after cleavage of the secretion signal sequence by a specific signal peptidase. Also there appears to be much less protease activity in the periplasm than in the cytoplasm. In addition protein purification is simpler due to fewer contaminating proteins in the periplasm. Another advantage is that correct disulfide bonds may form because the periplasm provides a more oxidative environment than the cytoplasm. Proteins overexpressed in are often found in insoluble aggregates so called inclusion bodies. These inclusion bodies may be located in the cytosol or in the periplasm the recovery of biologically active proteins from these inclusion bodies requires a denaturation refolding process. Many recombinant proteins including therapeutic proteins are recovered from inclusion bodies. Alternatively as will be clear to the skilled person recombinant strains of bacteria that have been genetically modified so as to secrete a desired protein and in particular a Nanobody or a polypeptide of the invention can be used.

Thus according to one non limiting embodiment of the invention the Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention is a Nanobody or polypeptide that has been produced intracellularly and that has been isolated from the host cell and in particular from a bacterial cell or from an inclusion body in a bacterial cell. According to another non limiting embodiment of the invention the Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention is a Nanobody or polypeptide that has been produced extracellularly and that has been isolated from the medium in which the host cell is cultivated.

Suitable techniques for transforming a host or host cell of the invention will be clear to the skilled person and may depend on the intended host cell host organism and the genetic construct to be used. Reference is again made to the handbooks and patent applications mentioned above.

After transformation a step for detecting and selecting those host cells or host organisms that have been succesfully transformed with the nucleotide sequence genetic construct of the invention may be performed. This may for instance be a selection step based on a selectable marker present in the genetic construct of the invention or a step involving the detection of the amino acid sequence of the invention e.g. using specific antibodies.

The transformed host cell which may be in the form of a stable cell line or host organisms which may be in the form of a stable mutant line or strain form further aspects of the present invention.

Preferably these host cells or host organisms are such that they express or are at least capable of expressing e.g. under suitable conditions an amino acid sequence of the invention and in case of a host organism in at least one cell part tissue or organ thereof . The invention also includes further generations progeny and or offspring of the host cell or host organism of the invention that may for instance be obtained by cell division or by sexual or asexual reproduction.

To produce obtain expression of the amino acid sequences of the invention the transformed host cell or transformed host organism may generally be kept maintained and or cultured under conditions such that the desired amino acid sequence of the invention is expressed produced. Suitable conditions will be clear to the skilled person and will usually depend upon the host cell host organism used as well as on the regulatory elements that control the expression of the relevant nucleotide sequence of the invention. Again reference is made to the handbooks and patent applications mentioned above in the paragraphs on the genetic constructs of the invention.

Generally suitable conditions may include the use of a suitable medium the presence of a suitable source of food and or suitable nutrients the use of a suitable temperature and optionally the presence of a suitable inducing factor or compound e.g. when the nucleotide sequences of the invention are under the control of an inducible promoter all of which may be selected by the skilled person. Again under such conditions the amino acid sequences of the invention may be expressed in a constitutive manner in a transient manner or only when suitably induced.

It will also be clear to the skilled person that the amino acid sequence of the invention may first be generated in an immature form as mentioned above which may then be subjected to post translational modification depending on the host cell host organism used. Also the amino acid sequence of the invention may be glycosylated again depending on the host cell host organism used.

The amino acid sequence of the invention may then be isolated from the host cell host organism and or from the medium in which said host cell or host organism was cultivated using protein isolation and or purification techniques known per se such as preparative chromatography and or electrophoresis techniques differential precipitation techniques affinity techniques e.g. using a specific cleavable amino acid sequence fused with the amino acid sequence of the invention and or preparative immunological techniques i.e. using antibodies against the amino acid sequence to be isolated .

Generally for pharmaceutical use the polypeptides of the invention of the inventions may be formulated as a pharmaceutical preparation comprising at least one polypeptide of the invention and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier diluent or excipient and or adjuvant and optionally one or more further pharmaceutically active polypeptides and or compounds. By means of non limiting examples such a formulation may be in a form suitable for oral administration for parenteral administration such as by intravenous intramuscular or subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion for topical administration for administration by inhalation by a skin patch by an implant by a suppository etc. Such suitable administration forms which may be solid semi solid or liquid depending on the manner of administration as well as methods and carriers for use in the preparation thereof will be clear to the skilled person and are further described hereinbelow.

Generally the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention can be formulated and administered in any suitable manner known per se for which reference is for example made to the general background art cited above and in particular to WO 04 041862 WO 04 041863 WO 04 041865 and WO 04 041867 as well as to the standard handbooks such as Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences 18Ed. Mack Publishing Company USA 1990 or Remington the Science and Practice of Pharmacy 21th Edition Lippincott Williams and Wilkins 2005 .

For example the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention may be formulated and administered in any manner known per se for conventional antibodies and antibody fragments including ScFv s and diabodies and other pharmaceutically active proteins. Such formulations and methods for preparing the same will be clear to the skilled person and for example include preparations suitable for parenteral administration for example intravenous intraperitoneal subcutaneous intramuscular intraluminal intra arterial or intrathecal administration or for topical i.e. transdermal or intradermal administration.

Preparations for parenteral administration may for example be sterile solutions suspensions dispersions or emulsions that are suitable for infusion or injection. Suitable carriers or diluents for such preparations for example include without limitation sterile water and aqueous buffers and solutions such as physiological phosphate buffered saline Ringer s solutions dextrose solution and Hank s solution water oils glycerol ethanol glycols such as propylene glycol or as well as mineral oils animal oils and vegetable oils for example peanut oil soybean oil as well as suitable mixtures thereof. Usually aqueous solutions or suspensions will be preferred.

The Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention can also be administered using gene therapy methods of delivery. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 399 346 which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. Using a gene therapy method of delivery primary cells transfected with the gene encoding a Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention can additionally be transfected with tissue specific promoters to target specific organs tissue grafts tumors or cells and can additionally be transfected with signal and stabilization sequences for subcellularly localized expression.

Thus the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention may be systemically administered e.g. orally in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle such as an inert diluent or an assimilable edible carrier. They may be enclosed in hard or soft shell gelatin capsules may be compressed into tablets or may be incorporated directly with the food of the patient s diet. For oral therapeutic administration the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention may be combined with one or more excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets buccal tablets troches capsules elixirs suspensions syrups wafers and the like. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1 of the Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention. The percentage of the compositions and preparations may of course be varied and may conveniently be between about 2 to about 60 of the weight of a given unit dosage form. The amount of the Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage level will be obtained.

The tablets troches pills capsules and the like may also contain the following binders such as gum tragacanth acacia corn starch or gelatin excipients such as dicalcium phosphate a disintegrating agent such as corn starch potato starch alginic acid and the like a lubricant such as magnesium stearate and a sweetening agent such as sucrose fructose lactose or aspartame or a flavoring agent such as peppermint oil of wintergreen or cherry flavoring may be added. When the unit dosage form is a capsule it may contain in addition to materials of the above type a liquid carrier such as a vegetable oil or a polyethylene glycol. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the solid unit dosage form. For instance tablets pills or capsules may be coated with gelatin wax shellac or sugar and the like. A syrup or elixir may contain the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention sucrose or fructose as a sweetening agent methyl and propylparabens as preservatives a dye and flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Of course any material used in preparing any unit dosage form should be pharmaceutically acceptable and substantially non toxic in the amounts employed. In addition the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention may be incorporated into sustained release preparations and devices.

Preparations and formulations for oral administration may also be provided with an enteric coating that will allow the constructs of the invention to resist the gastric environment and pass into the intestines. More generally preparations and formulations for oral administration may be suitably formulated for delivery into any desired part of the gastrointestinal tract. In addition suitable suppositories may be used for delivery into the gastrointestinal tract.

The Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention may also be administered intravenously or intraperitoneally by infusion or injection. Solutions of the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention or their salts can be prepared in water optionally mixed with a nontoxic surfactant. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol liquid polyethylene glycols triacetin and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.

The pharmaceutical dosage forms suitable for injection or infusion can include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions or sterile powders comprising the active ingredient which are adapted for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable or infusible solutions or dispersions optionally encapsulated in liposomes. In all cases the ultimate dosage form must be sterile fluid and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The liquid carrier or vehicle can be a solvent or liquid dispersion medium comprising for example water ethanol a polyol for example glycerol propylene glycol liquid polyethylene glycols and the like vegetable oils nontoxic glyceryl esters and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained for example by the formation of liposomes by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions or by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents for example parabens chlorobutanol phenol sorbic acid thimerosal and the like. In many cases it will be preferable to include isotonic agents for example sugars buffers or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption for example aluminum monostearate and gelatin.

Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above as required followed by filter sterilization. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and the freeze drying techniques which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient present in the previously sterile filtered solutions.

For topical administration the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention may be applied in pure form i.e. when they are liquids. However it will generally be desirable to administer them to the skin as compositions or formulations in combination with a dermatologically acceptable carrier which may be a solid or a liquid.

Useful solid carriers include finely divided solids such as talc clay microcrystalline cellulose silica alumina and the like. Useful liquid carriers include water hydroxyalkyls or glycols or water alcohol glycol blends in which the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention can be dissolved or dispersed at effective levels optionally with the aid of non toxic surfactants. Adjuvants such as fragrances and additional antimicrobial agents can be added to optimize the properties for a given use. The resultant liquid compositions can be applied from absorbent pads used to impregnate bandages and other dressings or sprayed onto the affected area using pump type or aerosol sprayers.

Thickeners such as synthetic polymers fatty acids fatty acid salts and esters fatty alcohols modified celluloses or modified mineral materials can also be employed with liquid carriers to form spreadable pastes gels ointments soaps and the like for application directly to the skin of the user.

Examples of useful dermatological compositions which can be used to deliver the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention to the skin are known to the art for example see Jacquet et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4 608 392 Geria U.S. Pat. No. 4 992 478 Smith et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4 559 157 and Wortzman U.S. Pat. No. 4 820 508 .

Useful dosages of the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention can be determined by comparing their in vitro activity and in vivo activity in animal models. Methods for the extrapolation of effective dosages in mice and other animals to humans are known to the art for example see U.S. Pat. No. 4 938 949.

Generally the concentration of the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention in a liquid composition such as a lotion will be from about 0.1 25 wt preferably from about 0.5 10 wt . The concentration in a semi solid or solid composition such as a gel or a powder will be about 0.1 5 wt preferably about 0.5 2.5 wt .

The amount of the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention required for use in treatment will vary not only with the particular Nanobody or polypeptide selected but also with the route of administration the nature of the condition being treated and the age and condition of the patient and will be ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician or clinician. Also the dosage of the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention varies depending on the target cell tumor tissue graft or organ.

The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered at appropriate intervals for example as two three four or more sub doses per day. The sub dose itself may be further divided e.g. into a number of discrete loosely spaced administrations such as multiple inhalations from an insufflator or by application of a plurality of drops into the eye.

An administration regimen could include long term daily treatment. By long term is meant at least two weeks and preferably several weeks months or years of duration. Necessary modifications in this dosage range may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using only routine experimentation given the teachings herein. See Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences Martin E. W. ed. 4 Mack Publishing Co. Easton Pa. The dosage can also be adjusted by the individual physician in the event of any complication.

In another aspect the invention relates to a method for the prevention and or treatment of at least one TNF relates disease or disorder as mentioned herein said method comprising administering to a subject in need thereof a pharmaceutically active amount of a Nanobody of the invention of a polypeptide of the invention and or of a pharmaceutical composition comprising the same.

In the context of the present invention the term prevention and or treatment not only comprises preventing and or treating the disease but also generally comprises preventing the onset of the disease slowing or reversing the progress of disease preventing or slowing the onset of one or more symptoms associated with the disease reducing and or alleviating one or more symptoms associated with the disease reducing the severity and or the duration of the disease and or of any symptoms associated therewith and or preventing a further increase in the severity of the disease and or of any symptoms associated therewith preventing reducing or reversing any physiological damage caused by the disease and generally any pharmacological action that is beneficial to the patient being treated.

The subject to be treated may be any warm blooded animal but is in particular a mammal and more in particular a human being. As will be clear to the skilled person the subject to be treated will in particular be a person suffering from or at risk from the diseases and disorders mentioned herein.

The invention also relates to a method for the prevention and or treatment of at least one disease or disorder that can be prevented and or treated by administering a Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention to a patient said method comprising administering to a subject in need thereof a pharmaceutically active amount of a Nanobody of the invention of a polypeptide of the invention and or of a pharmaceutical composition comprising the same.

More in particular the invention relates to a method for the prevention and or treatment of at least one disease or disorder chosen from the group consisting of the diseases and disorders listed herein said method comprising administering to a subject in need thereof a pharmaceutically active amount of a Nanobody of the invention of a polypeptide of the invention and or of a pharmaceutical composition comprising the same.

In another embodiment the invention relates to a method for immunotherapy and in particular for passive immunotherapy which method comprises administering to a subject suffering from or at risk of the diseases and disorders mentioned herein a pharmaceutically active amount of a Nanobody of the invention of a polypeptide of the invention and or of a pharmaceutical composition comprising the same.

In the above methods the Nanobodies and or polypeptides of the invention and or the compositions comprising the same can be administered in any suitable manner depending on the specific pharmaceutical formulation or composition to be used. Thus the Nanobodies and or polypeptides of the invention and or the compositions comprising the same can for example be administered orally intraperitoneally e.g. intravenously subcutaneously intramuscularly or via any other route of administration that circumvents the gastrointestinal tract intranasally transdermally topically by means of a suppository by inhalation again depending on the specific pharmaceutical formulation or composition to be used. The clinician will be able to select a suitable route of administration and a suitable pharmaceutical formulation or composition to be used in such administration depending on the disease or disorder to be prevented or treated and other factors well known to the clinician.

The Nanobodies and or polypeptides of the invention and or the compositions comprising the same are administered according to a regime of treatment that is suitable for preventing and or treating the disease or disorder to be prevented or treated. The clinician will generally be able to determine a suitable treatment regimen depending on factors such as the disease or disorder to be prevented or treated the severity of the disease to be treated and or the severity of the symptoms thereof the specific Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention to be used the specific route of administration and pharmaceutical formulation or composition to be used the age gender weight diet general condition of the patient and similar factors well known to the clinician.

Generally the treatment regimen will comprise the administration of one or more Nanobodies and or polypeptides of the invention or of one or more compositions comprising the same in one or more pharmaceutically effective amounts or doses. The specific amount s or doses to administered can be determined by the clinician again based on the factors cited above.

Generally for the prevention and or treatment of the diseases and disorders mentioned herein and depending on the specific disease or disorder to be treated the potency of the specific Nanobody and polypeptide of the invention to be used the specific route of administration and the specific pharmaceutical formulation or composition used the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention will generally be administered in an amount between 1 gram and 0.01 microgram per kg body weight per day preferably between 0.1 gram and 0.1 microgram per kg body weight per day such as about 1 10 100 or 1000 microgram per kg body weight per day either continuously e.g. by infusion as a single daily dose or as multiple divided doses during the day. The clinician will generally be able to determine a suitable daily dose depending on the factors mentioned herein. It will also be clear that in specific cases the clinician may choose to deviate from these amounts for example on the basis of the factors cited above and his expert judgment. Generally some guidance on the amounts to be administered can be obtained from the amounts usually administered for comparable conventional antibodies or antibody fragments against the same target administered via essentially the same route taking into account however differences in affinity avidity efficacy biodistribution half life and similar factors well known to the skilled person.

Usually in the above method a single Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention will be used. It is however within the scope of the invention to use two or more Nanobodies and or polypeptides of the invention in combination.

The Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention may also be used in combination with one or more further pharmaceutically active compounds or principles i.e. as a combined treatment regimen which may or may not lead to a synergistic effect. Again the clinician will be able to select such further compounds or principles as well as a suitable combined treatment regimen based on the factors cited above and his expert judgement.

In particular the Nanobodies and polypeptides of the invention may be used in combination with other pharmaceutically active compounds or principles that are or can be used for the prevention and or treatment of the diseases and disorders cited herein as a result of which a synergistic effect may or may not be obtained. Examples of such compounds and principles as well as routes methods and pharmaceutical formulations or compositions for administering them will be clear to the clinician.

When two or more substances or principles are to be used as part of a combined treatment regimen they can be administered via the same route of administration or via different routes of administration at essentially the same time or at different times e.g. essentially simultaneously consecutively or according to an alternating regime . When the substances or principles are administered to be simultaneously via the same route of administration they may be administered as different pharmaceutical formulations or compositions or part of a combined pharmaceutical formulation or composition as will be clear to the skilled person.

Also when two or more active substances or principles are to be used as part of a combined treatment regimen each of the substances or principles may be administered in the same amount and according to the same regimen as used when the compound or principle is used on its own and such combined use may or may not lead to a synergistic effect. However when the combined use of the two or more active substances or principles leads to a synergistic effect it may also be possible to reduce the amount of one more or all of the substances or principles to be administered while still achieving the desired therapeutic action. This may for example be useful for avoiding limiting or reducing any unwanted side effects that are associated with the use of one or more of the substances or principles when they are used in their usual amounts while still obtaining the desired pharmaceutical or therapeutic effect.

The effectiveness of the treatment regimen used according to the invention may be determined and or followed in any manner known per se for the disease or disorder involved as will be clear to the clinician. The clinician will also be able where appropriate and on a case by case basis to change or modify a particular treatment regimen so as to achieve the desired therapeutic effect to avoid limit or reduce unwanted side effects and or to achieve an appropriate balance between achieving the desired therapeutic effect on the one hand and avoiding limiting or reducing undesired side effects on the other hand.

Generally the treatment regimen will be followed until the desired therapeutic effect is achieved and or for as long as the desired therapeutic effect is to be maintained. Again this can be determined by the clinician.

Thus in a further aspect the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition that contains at least one Nanobody of the invention or at least one polypeptide of the invention and at least one suitable carrier i.e. a carrier suitable for veterinary use and optionally one or more further active substances.

The invention also relates to the use of a Nanobody of the invention and or of a polypeptide of the invention in the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition in particular in the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for the prevention and or treatment including but not limiting to the alleviation of at least one symptom of a disease or disorder mediated by TNF alpha and or associated with TNF alpha for example associated with an abnormal activity of TNF alpha abnormal levels of TNF alpha abnormal expression of TNF alpha and or abnormal sensitivity or response to TNF alpha or of one of the biological phenomena associated with TNF alpha such as one of the diseases or disorders mentioned above.

The invention also relates to a method for preventing and or treating including but not limiting to the alleviation of at least one symptom of a disease or disorder mediated by TNF alpha and or associated with TNF alpha for example associated with an abnormal activity of TNF alpha abnormal levels of TNF alpha abnormal expression of TNF alpha and or abnormal sensitivity or response to TNF alpha or of one of the biological phenomena associated with TNF alpha such as one of the diseases or disorders mentioned above which method comprises administering to a subject in need thereof a therapeutically active amount of a Nanobody of the invention of polypeptide of the invention and or of a pharmaceutical composition as described above.

The present invention provides polypeptides comprising one or more nanobodies directed towards tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF alpha . The present invention further relates to their use in diagnosis and therapy. Such antibodies may have a framework sequence with high homology to the human framework sequences. Compositions comprising antibodies to tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF alpha alone or in combination with other drugs are described.

Tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF alpha is believed to play an important role in various disorders for example in inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis Crohn s disease ulcerative colitis and multiple sclerosis. Both TNF alpha and the receptors CD120a CD120b have been studied in great detail. TNF alpha in its bioactive form is a trimer and the groove formed by neighboring subunits is important for the cytokine receptor interaction. Several strategies to antagonize the action of the cytokine have been developed and are currently used to treat various disease states.

A TNF alpha inhibitor which has sufficient specificity and selectivity to TNF alpha may be an efficient prophylactic or therapeutic pharmaceutical compound for preventing or treating disorders where TNF alpha has been implicated as causative agent. Methods of treating toxic shock EP 486526 tumor regression inhibition of cytotoxicity U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 448 380 6 451 983 6 498 237 autoimmune disease such as RA and Crohn s disease EP 663836 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 672 347 5 656 272 graft versus host reaction U.S. Pat. No. 5 672 347 bacterial meningitis EP 585705 by means of an antibody to TNF alpha have been described.

Yet none of the presently available drugs are completely effective for the treatment of autoimmune disease and most are limited by severe toxicity. In addition it is extremely difficult and a lengthy process to develop a new chemical entity NCE with sufficient potency and selectivity to such target sequence. Antibody based therapeutics on the other hand have significant potential as drugs because they have exquisite specificity to their target and a low inherent toxicity. In addition the development time can be reduced considerably when compared to the development of new chemical entities NCE s . However conventional antibodies are difficult to raise against multimeric proteins where the receptor binding domain of the ligand is embedded in a groove as is the case with TNF alpha. Heavy chain antibodies described in the invention which are derived from Camelidae are known to have cavity binding propensity WO97 49805 Lauwereys et al EMBO J. 17 5312 1998 . Therefore such heavy chain antibodies are inherently suited to bind to receptor binding domains of such ligands as TNF. In addition such antibodies are known to be stable over long periods of time therefore increasing their shelf life Perez et al Biochemistry 40 74 2001 . Furthermore such heavy chain antibody fragments can be produced en masse in fermentors using cheap expression systems compared to mammalian cell culture fermentation such as yeast or other microorganisms EP 0 698 097 .

The use of antibodies derived from sources such as mouse sheep goat rabbit etc. and humanised derivatives thereof as a treatment for conditions which require a modulation of inflammation is problematic for several reasons. Traditional antibodies are not stable at room temperature and have to be refrigerated for preparation and storage requiring necessary refrigerated laboratory equipment storage and transport which contribute towards time and expense. Refrigeration is sometimes not feasible in developing countries. Furthermore the manufacture or small scale production of said antibodies is expensive because the mammalian cellular systems necessary for the expression of intact and active antibodies require high levels of support in terms of time and equipment and yields are very low. Furthermore the large size of conventional antibodies would restrict tissue penetration for example at the site of inflamed tissue. Furthermore traditional antibodies have a binding activity which depends upon pH and hence are unsuitable for use in environments outside the usual physiological pH range such as for example in treating gastric bleeding gastric surgery. Furthermore traditional antibodies are unstable at low or high pH and hence are not suitable for oral administration. However it has been demonstrated that camelidae antibodies resist harsh conditions such as extreme pH denaturing reagents and high temperatures Dumoulin et al Protein Science 11 500 2002 so making them suitable for delivery by oral administration. Furthermore traditional antibodies have a binding activity which depends upon temperature and hence are unsuitable for use in assays or kits performed at temperatures outside biologically active temperature ranges e.g. 37 20 C. .

Polypeptide therapeutics and in particular antibody based therapeutics have significant potential as drugs because they have exquisite specificity to their target and a low inherent toxicity. However it is known by the skilled addressee that an antibody which has been obtained for a therapeutically useful target requires additional modification in order to prepare it for human therapy so as to avoid an unwanted immunological reaction in a human individual upon administration thereto. The modification process is commonly termed humanisation . It is known by the skilled artisan that antibodies raised in species other than in humans require humanisation to render the antibody therapeutically useful in humans 1 CDR grafting Protein Design Labs U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 180 370 5 693 761 Genentech U.S. Pat. No. 6 054 297 Celltech 460167 EP 626390 U.S. Pat. No. 5 859 205 2 Veneering Xoma U.S. Pat. No. 5 869 619 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 766 886 5 821 123 . There is a need for a method for producing antibodies which avoids the requirement for substantial humanisation or which completely obviates the need for humanisation. There is a need for a new class of antibodies which have defined framework regions or amino acid residues and which can be administered to a human subject without the requirement for substantial humanisation or the need for humanisation at all.

Another important drawback of conventional antibodies is that they are complex large molecules and therefore relatively unstable and they are sensitive to breakdown by proteases. This means that conventional antibody drugs cannot be administered orally sublingually topically nasally vaginally rectally or by inhalation because they are not resistant to the low pH at these sites the action of proteases at these sites and in the blood and or because of their large size. They have to be administered by injection intravenously subcutaneously etc. to overcome some of these problems. Administration by injection requires specialist training in order to use a hypodermic syringe or needle correctly and safely. It further requires sterile equipment a liquid formulation of the therapeutic polypeptide vial packing of said polypeptide in a sterile and stable form and of the subject a suitable site for entry of the needle. Furthermore subjects commonly experience physical and psychological stress prior to and upon receiving an injection. Therefore there is need for a method for the delivery of therapeutic polypeptides which avoids the need for injection which is not only cost time saving but which would also be more convenient and more comfortable for the subject.

Nanobody based therapeutics have significant potential as drugs because they have exquisite specificity to their target and a low inherent toxicity. However improving further their intrinsic and functional affinity can lead to many benefits for a patient such as reduced dose of therapeutic faster therapy and reduced side effects.

Vs according to the present invention and as known to the skilled addressee are heavy chain variable domains derived from immunoglobulins naturally devoid of light chains such as those derived from Camelidae as described in WO 94 04678 and referred to hereinafter as Vdomains or nanobodies . Vmolecules are about 10 smaller than IgG molecules. They are single polypeptides and very stable resisting extreme pH and temperature conditions. Moreover they are resistant to the action of proteases which is not the case for conventional antibodies. Furthermore in vitro expression of Vs produces high yield properly folded functional Vs. In addition antibodies generated in Camelids will recognize epitopes other than those recognised by antibodies generated in vitro through the use of antibody libraries or via immunisation of mammals other than Camelids WO 9749805 . As such anti TNF alpha V s may interact more efficiently with TNF alpha than conventional antibodies thereby blocking its interaction with the TNF alpha receptor more efficiently.

TNF alpha is also a fragment of TNF alpha capable of eliciting an immune response. TNF alpha is also a fragment of TNF alpha capable of binding to a nanobody raised against the full length TNF alpha.

A nanobody directed against TNF alpha means nanobody that it is capable of binding to TNF alpha with an affinity of better than 10M.

One embodiment of the present invention is an anti TNF polypeptide wherein the nanobodies comprise Camelidae Vdirected against TNF alpha.

The one or more nanobodies of the anti TNF polypeptide which are directed against a TNF alpha may be of the same sequence. Alternatively they may not all have the same sequence. It is within the scope of the invention that an anti TNF polypeptide comprises anti TNF alpha nanobodies which do not all share the same sequence but which are directed against the same target one or more antigens thereof.

The present invention further relates to an anti TNF alpha polypeptide wherein said nanobody is a Vdirected against TNF alpha wherein the Vbelongs to a class having human like sequences. The class is characterised in that the Vs carry an amino acid from the group consisting of glycine alanine valine leucine isoleucine proline phenylalanine tyrosine tryptophan methionine serine threonine asparagine or glutamine at position 45 such as for example L45 and a tryptophan at position 103 according to the Kabat numbering. Another human like class of Camelidae nanobodies have been described in WO03035694 and contain the hydrophobic FR2 residues typically found in conventional antibodies of human origin or from other species but compensating this loss in hydrophilicity by the charged arginine residue on position 103 that substitutes the conserved tryptophan residue present in VH from double chain antibodies. As such peptides belonging to these two classes show a high amino acid sequence homology to human VH framework regions and said peptides might be administered to a human directly without expectation of an unwanted immune response therefrom and without the burden of further humanisation. The invention also relates to nucleic acids capable of encoding said polypeptides.

Any of the Vs as used by the invention may be of the traditional class or of the classes of human like Camelidae antibodies. Said antibodies may be directed against whole TNF alpha or a fragment thereof or a fragment of a homologous sequence thereof. These polypeptides include the full length Camelidae antibodies namely Fc and Vdomains chimeric versions of heavy chain Camelidae antibodies with a human Fc domain or V s by themselves or derived fragments.

Anti serum albumin V s may interact in a more efficient way with serum albumin than conventional antibodies which is known to be a carrier protein. As a carrier protein some of the epitopes of serum albumin may be inaccessible by bound proteins peptides and small chemical compounds. Since V s are known to bind into unusual or non conventional epitopes such as cavities WO 97 49805 the affinity of such V s to circulating albumin may be increased.

The present invention also relates to the finding that an anti TNF polypeptide as described herein further comprising one or more nanobodies directed against one or more serum proteins of a subject surprisingly has significantly prolonged half life in the circulation of said subject compared with the half life of the anti TNF alpha nanobody when not part of said construct. Furthermore the said polypeptides were found to exhibit the same favourable properties of nanobodies such as high stability remaining intact in mice extreme pH resistance high temperature stability and high target affinity.

The serum protein may be any suitable protein found in the serum of subject. In one aspect of the invention the serum protein is serum albumin serum immunoglobulins thyroxine binding protein transferrin or fibrinogen. Depending on the intended use such as the required half life for effective treatment and or compartmentalization of the target antigen the V partner can be directed to one of the above serum proteins.

According to a specific but non limiting aspect of the invention the Nanobody against human serum albumin consists of 4 framework regions FR1 to FR4 respectively and 3 complementarity determining regions CDR1 to CDR3 respectively in which 

 1 any amino acid substitution is preferably a conservative amino acid substitution as defined herein and or

 2 said amino acid sequence preferably only contains amino acid substitutions and no amino acid deletions or insertions compared to the above amino acid sequences.

In another aspect the invention relates to a Nanobody against human serum albumin which consist of 4 framework regions FR1 to FR4 respectively and 3 complementarity determining regions CDR1 to CDR3 respectively which is chosen from the group consisting of domain antibodies and or single domain antibodies with the one of the following combinations of CDR1 CDR2 and CDR3 respectively 

In the Nanobodies of the invention that comprise the combinations of CDR s mentioned above each CDR can be replaced by a CDR chosen from the group consisting of amino acid sequences that have at least 80 preferably at least 90 more preferably at least 95 even more preferably at least 99 sequence identity as defined herein with the mentioned CDR s in which

However of the Nanobodies of the invention that comprise the combinations of CDR s mentioned above Nanobodies comprising one or more of the CDR s listed above are particularly preferred Nanobodies comprising two or more of the CDR s listed above are more particularly preferred and Nanobodies comprising three of the CDR s listed above are most particularly preferred.

In these Nanobodies against human serum albumin the Framework regions FR1 to FR4 are preferably as defined hereinabove for the Nanobodies of the invention.

Particularly preferred Nanobodies against human serum albumin are chosen from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO s 61 to 67 SEQ ID NO s 87 to 89 and SEQ ID NO s 100 104. The preferred combinations of CDR s and framework regions present in these Nanobodies are also listed in Table II

Another aspect of the invention is a method of treating an autoimmune disease or condition as cited herein comprising administering to a patient an effective amount of an anti TNF alpha polypeptide further comprising a least one polypeptide selected from the group consisting of anti IFN gamma polypeptide anti TNF alpha receptor polypeptide and anti IFN gamma receptor polypeptide such polypeptides joined to each other as described below.

Such multi specific constructs may have improved potency as inflammatory therapeutic compound over mono specific constructs.

One aspect of the invention is a composition comprising an anti TNF alpha polypeptide as disclosed herein and at least one polypeptide selected from the group consisting of anti IFN gamma polypeptide anti TNF alpha receptor polypeptide and anti IFN gamma receptor polypeptide for simultaneous separate or sequential administration to a subject.

One aspect of the invention is a method for treating autoimmune disease comprising administering to an individual an effective amount of an anti TNF alpha polypeptide and a least one polypeptide selected from the group consisting of anti IFN gamma polypeptide anti TNF alpha receptor polypeptide and anti IFN gamma receptor polypeptide simultaneously separately or sequentially.

Another aspect of the invention is a kit containing an anti TNF alpha polypeptide and a least one polypeptide selected from the group consisting of anti IFN gamma polypeptide anti TNF alpha receptor polypeptide and anti IFN gamma receptor polypeptide for simultaneous separate or sequential administration to a subject. It is an aspect of the invention that the kit may be used according to the invention. It is an aspect of the invention that the kit may be used to treat the diseases as cited herein.

By simultaneous administration means the polypeptides are administered to a subject at the same time. For example as a mixture of the polypeptides or a composition comprising said polypeptides. Examples include but are not limited to a solution administered intraveneously a tablet liquid topical cream etc. wherein each preparation comprises the polypeptides of interest.

By separate administration means the polypeptides are administered to a subject at the same time or substantially the same time. The polypeptides are present in the kit as separate unmixed preparations. For example the different polypeptides may be present in the kit as individual tablets. The tablets may be administered to the subject by swallowing both tablets at the same time or one tablet directly following the other.

By sequential administration means the polypeptides are administered to a subject sequentially. The polypeptides are present in the kit as separate unmixed preparations. There is a time interval between doses. For example one polypeptide might be administered up to 336 312 288 264 240 216 192 168 144 120 96 72 48 24 20 16 12 8 4 2 1 or 0.5 hours after the other component.

In sequential administration one polypeptide may be administered once or any number of times and in various doses before and or after administration of another polypeptide. Sequential administration may be combined with simultaneous or sequential administration.

The medical uses of the anti TNF alpha polypeptide described below also apply to the composition comprising an anti TNF alpha polypeptide as disclosed herein and at least one polypeptide selected from the group consisting of anti IFN gamma polypeptide anti TNF alpha receptor polypeptide and anti IFN gamma receptor polypeptide for simultaneous separate or sequential administration to a subject as disclosed here above.

According to one aspect of the invention an anti IFN gamma polypeptide anti TNF alpha a nanobody directed against IFN gamma. Said nanobody may be a Camelidae V.

According to one aspect of the invention anti TNF alpha a nanobody directed against TNF alpha receptor. Said nanobody may be a Camelidae V.

According to one aspect of the invention an anti IFN gamma receptor polypeptide anti TNF alpha a nanobody directed against IFN gamma receptor. Said nanobody may be a Camelidae V.

Another embodiment of the present invention is an anti TNF alpha polypeptide as disclosed herein wherein the number of nanobodies directed against TNF alpha is two or more. Such multivalent anti TNF alpha polypeptides have the advantage of unusually high functional affinity for the target displaying much higher than expected inhibitory properties compared to their monovalent counterparts.

The multivalent anti TNF alpha polypeptides have functional affinities that are several orders of magnitude higher than the monovalent parent anti TNF alpha polypeptides. The inventors have found that the functional affinities of these multivalent polypeptides are much higher than those reported in the prior art for bivalent and multivalent antibodies. Surprisingly anti TNF alpha polypeptides of the present invention linked to each other directly or via a short linker sequence show the high functional affinities expected theoretically with multivalent conventional four chain antibodies.

The inventors have found that such large increased functional activities can be detected preferably with antigens composed of multidomain and multimeric proteins either in straight binding assays or in functional assays e.g. cytotoxicity assays.

The nanobodies may be joined to form any of the polypeptides disclosed herein comprising more than one nanobody using methods known in the art or any future method.

For example they may be fused by chemical cross linking by reacting amino acid residues with an organic derivatising agent such as described by Blattler et al Biochemistry 24 1517 1524 EP294703. Alternatively the nanobody may be fused genetically at the DNA level i.e. a polynucleotide construct formed which encodes the complete polypeptide construct comprising one or more anti target nanobodies and one or more anti serum protein nanobodies. A method for producing bivalent or multivalent Vpolypeptide constructs is disclosed in PCT patent application WO 96 34103. One way of joining multiple nanobodies is via the genetic route by linking nanobody coding sequences either directly or via a peptide linker. For example the C terminal end of the first nanobody may be linked to the N terminal end of the next nanobody. This linking mode can be extended in order to link additional nanobodies for the construction and production of tri tetra etc. functional constructs.

According to one aspect of the present invention the nanobodies are linked to each other directly without use of a linker. Contrary to joining bulky conventional antibodies where a linker sequence is needed to retain binding activity in the two subunits polypeptides of the invention can be linked directly thereby avoiding potential problems of the linker sequence such as antigenicity when administered to a human subject instability of the linker sequence leading to dissociation of the subunits.

According to another aspect of the present invention the nanobodies are linked to each other via a peptide linker sequence. Such linker sequence may be a naturally occurring sequence or a non naturally occurring sequence. The linker sequence is expected to be non immunogenic in the subject to which the anti TNF alpha polypeptide is administered. The linker sequence may provide sufficient flexibility to the multivalent anti TNF alpha polypeptide at the same time being resistant to proteolytic degradation. A non limiting example of a linker sequences is one that can be derived from the hinge region of Vs described in WO 96 34103.

According to another aspect of the invention multivalent nanobodies comprising more than two nanobodies can be linked to each other either directly or via a linker sequence. Such constructs are difficult to produce with conventional antibodies and due to steric hindrance of the bulky subunits functionality will be lost or greatly diminished rather than increased considerably as seen with V s of the invention compared to the monovalent construct.

The polypeptide constructs disclosed herein may be made by the skilled artisan according to methods known in the art or any future method. For example Vs may be obtained using methods known in the art such as by immunising a camel and obtaining hybridomas therefrom or by cloning a library of nanobodies using molecular biology techniques known in the art and subsequent selection by using phage display.

A homologous nucleotide sequence according to the present invention may refer to nucleotide sequences of more than 50 100 200 300 400 500 600 800 or 1000 nucleotides able to hybridize to the reverse complement of the nucleotide sequence capable of encoding the patent sequence under stringent hybridisation conditions such as the ones described by Sambrook et al. Molecular Cloning Laboratory Manuel Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory press New York .

As used herein a functional portion refers to a sequence of a nanobody that is of sufficient size such that the interaction of interest is maintained with affinity of 1 10M or better.

Alternatively a functional portion comprises a partial deletion of the complete amino acid sequence and still maintains the binding site s and protein domain s necessary for the binding of and interaction with the target.

As used herein a functional portion refers to less than 100 of the complete sequence e.g. 99 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 5 1 etc. but comprises 5 or more amino acids or 15 or more nucleotides.

Targets as mentioned herein such as TNF alpha TNF alpha receptor serum proteins e.g. serum albumin serum immunoglobulins thyroxine binding protein transferrin fibrinogen and IFN gamma IFN gamma receptor may be fragments of said targets. Thus a target is also a fragment of said target capable of eliciting an immune response. A target is also a fragment of said target capable of binding to a nanobody raised against the full length target.

A fragment as used herein refers to less than 100 of the sequence e.g. 99 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 etc. but comprising 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 or more amino acids. A fragment is of sufficient length such that the interaction of interest is maintained with affinity of 1 10M or better.

A fragment as used herein also refers to optional insertions deletions and substitutions of one or more amino acids which do not substantially alter the ability of the target to bind to a nanobody raised against the wild type target. The number of amino acid insertions deletions or substitutions is preferably up to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 or 70 amino acids.

A homologous sequence of the present invention may include an anti TNF alpha polypeptide which has been humanised. The humanisation of antibodies of the new class of Vs would further reduce the possibility of unwanted immunological reaction in a human individual upon administration.

One embodiment of the present invention relates to a method for preparing modified polypeptides based upon llama antibodies by determining the amino acid residues of the antibody variable domain V which may be modified without diminishing the native affinity of the domain for antigen and while reducing its immunogenicity with respect to a heterologous species the use of Vs having modifications at the identified residues which are useful for administration to heterologous species and to the Vso modified.

More specifically the invention relates to the preparation of modified Vs which are modified for administration to humans the resulting Vthemselves and the use of such humanized Vs in the treatment of diseases in humans. By humanised is meant mutated so that immunogenicity upon administration in human patients is minor or nonexistent. Humanising a polypeptide according to the present invention comprises a step of replacing one or more of the Camelidae amino acids by their human counterpart as found in the human consensus sequence without that polypeptide losing its typical character i.e. the humanisation does not significantly affect the antigen binding capacity of the resulting polypeptide. Such methods are known by the skilled addressee.

Humanization of Camelidae nanobodies requires the introduction and mutagenesis of a limited amount of amino acids in a single polypeptide chain. This is in contrast to humanization of scFv Fab Fab 2 and IgG which requires the introduction of amino acid changes in two chains the light and the heavy chain and the preservation of the assembly of both chains.

As described in WO 04 041862 an anti TNF nanobody can be humanized. Humanization may for example involve mutagenesis of residues in FR1 at position 1 and 5 which were introduced by the primer used for repertoire cloning and do not occur naturally in the llama sequence. Mutagenesis of those residues did not result in loss of binding and or inhibition activity. Humanization may also involve mutagenesis of residues in FR3 at position 74 76 83 84 93. Mutagenesis of those residues did not result in a dramatic loss of binding and or inhibition activity. Combining the mutations of FR1 and FR3 therefore did not affect the binding and or inhibition activity. Humanization may also involve mutagenesis of residues in FR4 at position 108. Mutagenesis of Q108L resulted in lower production level in . Position 108 is solvent exposed in camelid V while in human antibodies this position is buried at the VH VL interface Spinelli 1996 Nieba 1997 . In isolated VHs position 108 is solvent exposed. The introduction of a non polar hydrophobic Leu instead of polar uncharged Gln can have a drastic effect on the intrinsic folding stability of the molecule. Also replacement of the hydrophilic residues by human hydrophobic residues at positions 44 and 45 E44G and R45L did not have an effect on binding and or inhibition. However loss of binding and or inhibition activity was observed when F37V and F47W were introduced. Modeling data confirmed the critical residue 37 to preserve the integrity of the CDR3 loop conformation and hence on activity all numbering according to the Kabat .

According to one embodiment of the present invention humanization involves replacing of any of the following residues either alone or in combination 

One embodiment of the present invention is an anti TNF alpha polypeptide or a nucleic acid capable of encoding said polypeptide for use in treating preventing and or alleviating the symptoms of disorders relating to inflammatory processes. TNF alpha is involved in inflammatory processes and the blocking of TNF alpha action can have an anti inflammatory effect which is highly desirable in certain disease states such as for example Crohn s disease. The Examples demonstrate Vs according to the invention which bind TNF alpha and moreover block its binding to the TNF alpha receptor.

The anti TNF alpha polypeptides of the present invention are applicable to autoimmune diseases such as Addison s disease adrenal Autoimmune diseases of the ear ear Autoimmune diseases of the eye eye Autoimmune hepatitis liver Autoimmune parotitis parotid glands Crohn s disease intestine Diabetes Type I pancreas Epididymitis epididymis Glomerulonephritis kidneys Graves disease thyroid Guillain Barre syndrome nerve cells Hashimoto s disease thyroid Hemolytic anemia red blood cells Systemic lupus erythematosus multiple tissues Male infertility sperm Multiple sclerosis nerve cells Myasthenia Gravis neuromuscular junction Pemphigus primarily skin Psoriasis skin Rheumatic fever heart and joints Rheumatoid arthritis joint lining Sarcoidosis multiple tissues and organs Scleroderma skin and connective tissues Sjogren s syndrome exocrine glands and other tissues Spondyloarthropathies axial skeleton and other tissues Thyroiditis thyroid Vasculitis blood vessels .

Another embodiment of the present invention is a use of an anti TNF alpha polypeptide according to the invention or a nucleic acid capable of encoding said polypeptide for the preparation of a medicament for treating a disorder relating to inflammatory processes. Examples of disorders include rheumatoid arthritis Crohn s disease ulcerative colitis inflammatory bowel syndrome and multiple sclerosis.

Polypeptides and nucleic acids according to the present invention may be administered to a subject by conventional routes such as intravenously. However a special property of the anti TNF alpha polypeptides of the invention is that they penetrate barriers such as tissue membranes and or tumours and act locally thereon and they are sufficiently stable to withstand extreme environments such as in the stomach. Therefore another aspect of the present invention relates to the delivery of anti TNF alpha polypeptides.

When the Nanobodies and or polypeptides of the invention are used for or are intended for use in the prevention or treatment of diseases and disorders of the gastro intestinal tract in particular by means of oral administration or other administration into the gastrointestinal tract it will usually not be necessary to use polypeptides of the invention that have increased half life in serum i.e. that have been pegylated or that contain a Nanobody directed against a serum protein . Thus for such indications polypeptides of the invention can be used that only contain Nanobodies of the invention. In particular it has been found that for oral administration for the prevention and treatment of diseases or disorders of the gastro intestinal tract associated with and or mediated by TNF alpha such as IBD and the other diseases and disorders of the gastro intestinal tract mentioned above the use of a monovalent Nanobody of the invention or of a polypeptide of the invention that essentially consists of a monovalent Nanobody of the invention may be preferred. For other indications such as the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis RA the use of a bivalent Nanobody of the invention may be preferred. When such a Nanobody has to reach its intended site of action via the blood stream the use of a polypeptide of the invention that has increased half life in serum may be preferred.

A subject according to the invention can be any mammal susceptible to treatment by therapeutic polypeptides.

Oral delivery of anti TNF alpha polypeptides of the invention results in the provision of such molecules in an active form in the colon at local sites that are affected by the disorder. These sites may be highly inflamed and contain TNF alpha producing cells. The anti TNF alpha polypeptides of the invention which bind to TNF alpha can neutralise the TNF alpha locally avoiding distribution throughout the whole body and thus limiting negative side effects. Genetically modified microorganisms such as are able to secrete antibody or functional portions thereof. Such modified microorganisms can be used as vehicles for local production and delivery of antibodies or functional portions thereof in the intestine. By using a strain which produces an anti TNF alpha polypeptide inflammatory bowel syndrome could be treated.

Another aspect of the invention involves delivering anti TNF polypeptides by using surface expression on or secretion from non invasive bacteria such as Gram positive host organisms like spec. using a vector such as described in WO00 23471.

In another embodiment of the present invention an anti TNF alpha polypeptide further comprises a carrier nanobody e.g. V which acts as an active transport carrier for transport said anti TNF alpha polypeptide from the lung lumen to the blood.

An anti TNF alpha polypeptide further comprising a carrier binds specifically to a receptor present on the mucosal surface bronchial epithelial cells resulting in the active transport of the polypeptide from the lung lumen to the blood. The carrier nanobody may be fused to the polypeptide construct. Such fusion constructs may be made using methods known in the art and are describe herein. The carrier nanobody binds specifically to a receptor on the mucosal surface which induces an active transfer through the surface.

Another aspect of the present invention is a method to determine which nanobodies e.g. Vs are actively transported into the bloodstream upon nasal administration. Similarly a na ve or immune Vphage library can be administered nasally and after different time points after administration blood or organs can be isolated to rescue phages that have been actively transported to the bloodstream. A non limiting example of a receptor for active transport from the lung lumen to the bloodstream is the Fc receptor N FcRn . One aspect of the invention includes the Vmolecules identified by the method. Such Vcan then be used as a carrier Vfor the delivery of a therapeutic Vto the corresponding target in the bloodstream upon nasal administration.

In one aspect of the invention one can use an anti TNF alpha polypeptide as disclosed herein in order to screen for agents that modulate the binding of the polypeptide to TNF alpha. When identified in an assay that measures binding or said polypeptide displacement alone agents will have to be subjected to functional testing to determine whether they would modulate the action of the antigen in vivo.

In an example of a displacement experiment phage or cells expressing TNF alpha or a fragment thereof are incubated in binding buffer with polypeptide of the invention which has been labeled in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of a candidate modulator. To validate and calibrate the assay control competition reactions using increasing concentrations of said polypeptide and which is unlabeled can be performed. After incubation cells are washed extensively and bound labeled polypeptide is measured as appropriate for the given label e.g. scintillation counting fluorescence etc. . A decrease of at least 10 in the amount of labeled polypeptide bound in the presence of candidate modulator indicates displacement of binding by the candidate modulator. Candidate modulators are considered to bind specifically in this or other assays described herein if they displace 50 of labeled polypeptide sub saturating polypeptide dose at a concentration of 1 M or less.

Alternatively binding or displacement of binding can be monitored by surface plasmon resonance SPR . Surface plasmon resonance assays can be used as a quantitative method to measure binding between two molecules by the change in mass near an immobilized sensor caused by the binding or loss of binding of the polypeptide of the invention from the aqueous phase to TNF alpha immobilized in a membrane on the sensor. This change in mass is measured as resonance units versus time after injection or removal of the said polypeptide or candidate modulator and is measured using a Biacore Biosensor Biacore AB . TNF alpha can be for example immobilized on a sensor chip for example research grade CM5 chip Biacore AB in a thin film lipid membrane according to methods described by Salamon et al. Salamon et al. 1996 Biophys J. 71 283 294 Salamon et al. 2001 Biophys. J. 80 1557 1567 Salamon et al. 1999 Trends Biochem. Sci. 24 213 219 each of which is incorporated herein by reference . Sarrio et al. demonstrated that SPR can be used to detect ligand binding to the GPCR A 1 adenosine receptor immobilized in a lipid layer on the chip Sarrio et al. 2000 Mol. Cell. Biol. 20 5164 5174 incorporated herein by reference . Conditions for the binding of a polypeptide of the invention to TNF alpha in an SPR assay can be fine tuned by one of skill in the art using the conditions reported by Sarrio et al. as a starting point.

SPR can assay for modulators of binding in at least two ways. First a polypeptide of the invention can be pre bound to immobilized TNF alpha followed by injection of candidate modulator at a concentration ranging from 0.1 nM to 1 M. Displacement of the bound polypeptide can be quantitated permitting detection of modulator binding. Alternatively the membrane bound TNF alpha can be pre incubated with a candidate modulator and challenged with the polypeptide of the invention. A difference in binding affinity between said polypeptide and TNF alpha pre incubated with the modulator compared with that between said polypeptide and TNF alpha in absence of the modulator will demonstrate binding or displacement of said polypeptide in the presence of modulator. In either assay a decrease of 10 or more in the amount of said polypeptide bound in the presence of candidate modulator relative to the amount of said polypeptide bound in the absence of candidate modulator indicates that the candidate modulator inhibits the interaction of TNF alpha and said polypeptide.

Another method of detecting inhibition of binding of for example a polypeptide of the invention to TNF alpha uses fluorescence resonance energy transfer FRET . FRET is a quantum mechanical phenomenon that occurs between a fluorescence donor D and a fluorescence acceptor A in close proximity to each other usually 

A sample as used herein may be any biological sample containing TNF alpha such as clinical e.g. cell fractions whole blood plasma serum tissue cells etc. derived from clinical agricultural forensic research or other possible samples. The clinical samples may be from human or animal origin. The sample analysed can be both solid or liquid in nature. It is evident when solid materials are used these are first dissolved in a suitable solution.

A variation on FRET uses fluorescence quenching to monitor molecular interactions. One molecule in the interacting pair can be labelled with a fluorophore and the other with a molecule that quenches the fluorescence of the fluorophore when brought into close apposition with it. A change in fluorescence upon excitation is indicative of a change in the association of the molecules tagged with the fluorophore quencher pair. Generally an increase in fluorescence of the labelled TNF alpha is indicative that anti TNF alpha polypeptide bearing the quencher has been displaced. For quenching assays a 10 or greater increase in the intensity of fluorescent emission in samples containing a candidate modulator relative to samples without the candidate modulator indicates that the candidate modulator inhibits TNF alpha anti TNF alpha polypeptide interaction.

In addition to the surface plasmon resonance and FRET methods fluorescence polarization measurement is useful to quantitate binding. The fluorescence polarization value for a fluorescently tagged molecule depends on the rotational correlation time or tumbling rate. Complexes such as those formed by TNF alpha associating with a fluorescently labelled anti TNF alpha polypeptide have higher polarization values than uncomplexed labelled polypeptide. The inclusion of a candidate inhibitor of the TNF alpha anti TNF alpha polypeptide interaction results in a decrease in fluorescence polarization relative to a mixture without the candidate inhibitor if the candidate inhibitor disrupts or inhibits the interaction of TNF alpha with said polypeptide. Fluorescence polarization is well suited for the identification of small molecules that disrupt the formation of TNF alpha anti TNF alpha polypeptide complexes. A decrease of 10 or more in fluorescence polarization in samples containing a candidate modulator relative to fluorescence polarization in a sample lacking the candidate modulator indicates that the candidate modulator inhibits the TNF alpha anti TNF alpha polypeptide interaction.

Another alternative for monitoring TNF alpha anti TNF alpha polypeptide interactions uses a biosensor assay. ICS biosensors have been described in the art Australian Membrane Biotechnology Research Institute Cornell B Braach Maksvytis V King L Osman P Raguse B Wieczorek L and Pace R. A biosensor that uses ion channel switches Nature 1997 387 580 . In this technology the association of TNF alpha and a anti TNF alpha polypeptide is coupled to the closing of gramicidine facilitated ion channels in suspended membrane bilayers and thus to a measurable change in the admittance similar to impedance of the biosensor. This approach is linear over six orders of magnitude of admittance change and is ideally suited for large scale high throughput screening of small molecule combinatorial libraries. A 10 or greater change increase or decrease in admittance in a sample containing a candidate modulator relative to the admittance of a sample lacking the candidate modulator indicates that the candidate modulator inhibits the interaction of TNF alpha and said polypeptide. It is important to note that in assays testing the interaction of TNF alpha with an anti TNF alpha polypeptide it is possible that a modulator of the interaction need not necessarily interact directly with the domain s of the proteins that physically interact with said polypeptide. It is also possible that a modulator will interact at a location removed from the site of interaction and cause for example a conformational change in the TNF alpha. Modulators inhibitors or agonists that act in this manner are nonetheless of interest as agents to modulate the binding of TNF alpha to its receptor.

Any of the binding assays described can be used to determine the presence of an agent in a sample e.g. a tissue sample that binds to TNF alpha or that affects the binding of for example a polypeptide polypeptide of the invention to the TNF alpha. To do so a TNF alpha is reacted with said polypeptide in the presence or absence of the sample and polypeptide binding is measured as appropriate for the binding assay being used. A decrease of 10 or more in the binding of said polypeptide indicates that the sample contains an agent that modulates the binding of said polypeptide to the TNF alpha. Of course the above generalized method might easily be applied to screening for candidate modulators which alter the binding between any anti TNF alpha polypeptide of the invention an homologous sequence thereof a functional portion thereof or a functional portion of an homologous sequence thereof and TNF alpha or a fragment thereof.

Brandon Associates Merrimack N.H. and Microsource New Milford Conn. . A rare chemical library is available from Aldrich Milwaukee Wis. . Combinatorial libraries are available and can be prepared. Alternatively libraries of natural agents in the form of bacterial fungal plant and animal extracts are available from e.g. Pan Laboratories Bothell Wash. or MycoSearch NC or are readily producible by methods well known in the art. Additionally natural and synthetically produced libraries and agents are readily modified through conventional chemical physical and biochemical means.

Useful agents may be found within numerous chemical classes. Useful agents may be organic agents or small organic agents.

The TNF sensitive mouse fibroblast cell line L929s was used for measuring the anti TNF activity of the selected nanobodies. At a sufficiently high concentration of TNF in the medium i.e. cytotoxic dose L929s cells undergo necrosis. The inhibition of TNF interaction with its receptor was determined by pre incubating a series of antibody dilutions with a cytotoxic concentration of TNF before adding the mixture to the cells. The presence of actinomycin D in the medium sensitises the cells further to TNF resulting in increased sensitivity of the bioassay for free TNF .

The L929 cells were grown to nearly confluency plated out in 96 well microtiter plates at 5000 cells per well and incubated overnight. Actinomycin D was added to the cells at a final concentration of 1 g ml.

In this Comparative Example nine Nanobodies of the invention were compared with three Nanobodies from WO 04 041862 called V 1A or 1A V3E or 3E and V 3G or 3G respectively SEQ ID NOS 1 4 and 5 in WO 04 041862 . The assay used was the cell based assay using KYM cells referred to in WO 04 41862 see for example Example 1 under 3 . The results are mentioned in Table 39 below. As can be seen the Nanobodies of the invention have an EC50 value in this assay that is 18 fold better than the EC50 value of 3E the best performing Nanobody according to WO 04 041862.

Trivalent bispecific Nanobodies were formatted and cloned in the expression vector pAX054 first and then rescued through PCR and cloned in the pPICZ A expression vector.

pAX54 is a derivative of pUC19. It contains the LacZ promoter which enables a controlled induction of expression using IPTG. The vector has a resistance gene for Ampicillin or Carbenicillin. The multicloning sites harbours several restriction sites of which SfiI and BstEII are frequently used for cloning of Nanobodies . The signal peptide is the gen3 leader sequence which translocates the expressed Nanobody to the periplasm.

pPICZ A contains a pUC derived origin of replication allowing propagation in . It contains the promoter of the AOX1 alcohol oxidase 1 gene. This 942 bp promoter region i allows methanol inducible high level expression of the gene of interest and ii targets plasmid integration to the AOX1 locus following transformation of with vector DNA that is linearized within the 5 AOX1 promoter region. Note that pPICZ vectors do not contain a yeast origin of replication and that consequently transformants can only be isolated if recombination occurs between the plasmid and the genome. The vector specifies resistance to the antibiotic Zeocin in both and host cells. The vector incorporates the secretion signal of the mating factor allowing for efficient secretion of most proteins to the culture medium. The initiation ATG in the factor signal sequence corresponds to the native initiation ATG of the AOX1 gene. The multicloning site harbours several restriction sites of which Xho1 EcoR1 or Xho1 Not1 are typically used for fusion of the Nanobody coding sequences to the secretion signal. The multicloning site is followed by the AOX1 transcription termination region.

At 13 weeks of age all mice were sacrificed and sera and joints were collected. Sera were stored at 70 C. and ankle joints were conserved in formalin.

For selected groups ankle joints were embedded in paraffin and sectioned. Ankle joint sections were subsequently used for histopathological evaluation of disease progression.

Transgenic mouse lines carrying and expressing a 3 modified human tumour necrosis factor hTNF alpha cachectin transgene were used as a model to study the efficacy of an anti TNF Nanobody formatted in different ways in the prevention of chronic polyarthritis EMBO J. 10 4025 4031 . These mice have been shown to develop chronic polyarthritis with 100 incidence at four to seven weeks of age.

From the third week of age litters of transgenic mice were divided into groups of eight animals. Before initializing the study the average body weight was calculated for each group. From then on during the whole study animal weights were recorded once a week for each group.

Captive bred rhesus monkeys are used to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of TNF60 and TNF56 PEG40.

Sixteen animals are used in this study eight males and eight females and are divided into four groups two males and two females per group . All animals weighed approximately 5 kg and are disease free for at least six weeks prior to use. Sniff Pri vegetarisch V3994 serves as food. Sixty g kg b.w. are offered to each monkey. The residue is removed. At regular intervals at least twice a year the food is analyzed based on EPA USA for contaminants by LUFA ITL. Tap water is offered ad libitum. The animals in each treatment group are housed in a block of several adjacent cages within the monkey unit. The monkeys are kept singly in VA steel cages with a size of 90 cm 82 cm 96 cm. The room temperature is maintained at 23 C. 3 C. maximum range and the relative humidity at 60 20 maximum range . Deviations from the maximum range caused for example during cleaning procedure are dealt with in SOPs. The rooms are lit and darkened for periods of 12 hours each.

Two groups are infused with TNF60 and two groups are infused with TNF56 PEG40. Intravenous infusions of TNF60 and TNF56 PEG40 dissolved in PBS into the vena cephalica of the right or the left arm using indwelling catheters and a TSE infusion pump see below are given at a fixed dose of 2 mg kg.

Four single administrations are performed separated by a wash out period of at least fourteen days. After the last administration the follow up period is at least eight weeks. Two out of the four groups are treated with TNF60 or TNF56 PEG40 in combination with methotrexate MTX dissolved in PBS . Group 2 is treated with TNF60 and MTX group 4 is treated with TNF56 PEG40 and MTX. MTX is dosed weekly intramuscularly at 0.2 mg kg. On the administration days MTX is given approximately 30 minutes prior to administration. Dosing starts at the first Nanobody administration and will continue throughout the eight week wash out after the fourth dose. There are fourteen single MTX administrations separated by a wash out period of at least one week starting at the first test item administration.

In this study the ability of the anti TNF biologicals ALX0071 and Etanercept to attenuate TNF induced IL 6 production by RA synovium derived fibroblasts was assessed.

Synovial joint tissue from consenting RA patients was stored in DMEM based medium with antibiotics at 4 C. for up to 96 hours after joint replacement surgery. Synovial cells were isolated from dissected synovium by collagenase digestion at 37 C. for 2 hours. The resultant cell suspension was then washed by a series of centrifugation and resuspension steps and the resultant cells then cultured at 37 C. in DMEM based culture medium supplemented with 10 FCS v v . The resultant fibroblasts were used for the following experiment at either the second or third passage. Cells from four donors were used in individual experiments. Fibroblasts were seeded into 96 well flat bottom polystyrene plates at 1.5 10cells in a final volume of 250 L of DMEM based culture medium supplemented with 10 FCS v v per well and cultured overnight.

Cells were then incubated for 72 hours in DMEM based culture medium supplemented with TNF at 50 ng per mL 3 nM R D Systems 210 TA CF alone or in the presence of increasing doses of ALX0071 0.575 to 1920 ng per mL 0.015 to 50 nM or Etanercept Wyeth Labs 3.75 to 11250 ng per mL 0.025 to 75 nM . The final volume in each well was 250 L and each assessment was performed in triplicate. After 72 hours the supernatant media was removed and stored at 40 C. prior to analysis by IL 6 ELISA R D Systems . The inhibition of TNF induced IL 6 production was determined and ICvalues were calculated for both ALX0071 and Etanercept.

Both ALX10071 and Etanercept dose dependently reduced TNF induced IL 6 production by RA synovium derived fibroblasts from all four donors. There was a similar potency between the two reagents under these assay conditions.

In this study the ability of the anti TNF biologicals ALX0071 and Etanercept to attenuate TNF induced cell infiltration in to a murine air pouch was assessed.

Air pouches were formed by the sub cutaneous s.c. injection of 2.5 mL of sterile air in to the dorsal surface of anaesthetised male C57B1 6 J mice 25 30 g Harlan . The pouch was re inflated by injecting 2.5 ml of sterile air 3 days later.

Six days after the initial creation of the air pouch the animals were anaesthetised and the pouch injected with 1 ml of 0.5 CarboxyMethylCellulose CMC vehicle containing 0.1 g recombinant human TNF R D Systems 210 TA 050 CF . In three other groups of animals ALX0071 0.0625 0.125 and 0.25 mg kg was injected s.c. 19 hours prior to the injection of TNF . A second three groups of animals were injected s.c. with Etanercept Wyeth Labs 0.125 0.25 and 0.5 mg kg immediately prior to the injection of TNF .

24 hours following TNF injection mice were culled with a rising concentration of CO. Pouches were lavaged with 2 ml of ice cold endotoxin free sterile PBS containing 5 IU ml heparin. Volumes were recorded and 0.5 ml aliquots were separated for counting of the total white blood cell WBC population on a Sysmex XT Vet cell counter. The mean and standard error of the mean SEM total WBC counts for each group were calculated per ml of lavage fluid withdrawn. Statistical analysis was by ANOVA with Kruskal Wallis post test on untransformed data.

Both ALX0071 and Etanercept attenuated the TNF induced WBC infiltration in to the air pouches Table . While this attenuation reached statistical significance at both the 0.125 P
