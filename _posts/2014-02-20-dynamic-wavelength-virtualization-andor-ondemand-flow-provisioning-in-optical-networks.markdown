This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 767 896 entitled Novel Software Defined Tunable Optical Line Terminal OLT Architecture for Dynamic Wavelength Virtualization and On Demand Flow Provisioning in Optical Access Networks filed on Feb. 22 2013 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates to dynamic wavelength virtualization and or on demand flow provisioning in an optical network and more particularly to optical line terminal OLT architecture used in an optical access network.

With the predominance of dynamic traffic in modern networks bandwidth on demand rather than aggregate bandwidth has emerged as a key feature for revenue generation i.e. monetizing the network infrastructure . While this trend applies to all optical networking sectors the need for rapid service introduction and the fluctuation unpredictability of traffic patterns are highest in optical access aggregation networks. However inefficient use of optical spectrum in existing optical access networks as well as conflicting requirements between operators have resulted in a wavelength plan gridlock. This significantly limits the potential for rapid service innovation introduction that is crucial for monetizing the network as well as the ability for dynamic traffic engineering balancing to optimize network performance.

Previously standardization bodies e.g. Full Services Access Network FSAN have defined fixed wavelength plans with operational wavelength bands that are disproportionately large compared to the service data rate 1 for example 5 nm for downstream 10 Gb s passive optical networks PON residential access and 20 nm for downstream GPON residential service. Moreover very large spectral guard bands have also been defined to isolate different types of services 1 for example a 10 nm guard band is defined to separate GPON from RF video services. The reason for the inefficient wavelength planning is that lowcost non tunable optical components including lasers and filters could be exploited in the network. With increasing optical spectrum congestion recently tunable optical network unit ONU side devices including tunable lasers and filters have been proposed to enable more efficient and flexible spectrum use 2 . However tunable ONU side filters proposed for 40 Gb s time and wavelength division multiplexed PON TWDM PON within the NG PON2 FSAN standard 3 are not fully commercially mature and are targeted to operate only over a limited wavelength range 4 8 wavelengths which limits wavelength assignment flexibility and may not be a convenient operational choice for all operators. Moreover tunable components increase ONU side cost such that on demand services bandwidth would be restricted to users with more costly optical hardware. Consequently this approach would not include users with legacy ONUs who might wish to subscribe to temporary on demand high speed service delivery without upgrading ONU side optical hardware and or to services such as low cost on demand mobile backhaul.

An objective of the present invention is to efficiently use optical spectrum in an optical access network.

An aspect of the present invention includes a network apparatus used in an optical network. The network apparatus comprises one or more first tunable and temperature controlled TTC lasers one or more transmitters each of which is connected to one of said one or more TTC lasers one or more second TTC lasers one or more digital signal processing DSP transponders TPNDs each of which is connected to one of said one or more second TTC lasers one or more receivers and a controller to control said one or more transmitters and said one or more DSP TPNDs wherein said one or more transmitters defragment an optical access spectrum and said one or more DSP TPNDs exploit a newly available spectrum.

Another aspect of the present invention includes a method used in an optical network. The method comprises controlling one or more transmitters each of which is connected to a first tunable and temperature controlled TTC laser and one or more digital signal processing DSP transponders TPNDs each of which is connected to a second TTC laser wherein said one or more transmitters defragment an optical access spectrum and said one or more DSP TPNDs exploit a newly available spectrum.

Still another aspect of the present invention includes an optical network comprising a network apparatus an optical network unit connected to the network apparatus through an optical fiber wherein the network apparatus comprises one or more first tunable and temperature controlled TTC lasers one or more transmitters each of which is connected to one of said one or more TTC lasers one or more second TTC lasers one or more digital signal processing DSP transponders TPNDs each of which is connected to one of said one or more second TTC lasers one or more receivers and a controller to control said one or more transmitters and said one or more DSP TPNDs wherein said one or more transmitters defragment an optical access spectrum and said one or more DSP TPNDs exploit a newly available spectrum.

Unlike in previous work the problem is solved neither by defining a fixed wavelength plan for new services as in previous standardization work 1 nor by seeking to enable limited wavelength flexibility through tunable ONU side hardware as in TWDM PON or several variants of wavelength division multiplexed WDM based PON for NG PON2 4 . Rather extensive wavelength flexibility is enabled by 1. cost efficient digital signal processing DSP enhanced ONUs in combination with legacy optical components and 2. tunable optical line terminal OLT side components specifically tunable narrow linewidth lasers and flexible grid wavelength selective switches WSS which are centralized at the OLT such that their cost can be amortized over the large number of ONUs and services they support. Moreover rather than defining fixed physical wavelength plan as has been done previously 1 flexible virtualized wavelength planning is adopted at the OLT using software defined algorithms and for example generic OpenFlow based control messaging. In this way each operator can define a customized software reconfigurable wavelength plan for their network enabling flexible operator specific network monetization while avoiding standardization gridlock which can occur in seeking to define a one size fits all wavelength plan.

By exploiting centralized software defined wavelength management the solution offers a generic abstracted wavelength space view to external parties enabling secure multi operator interoperability and rapid service introduction without physical wavelength plan standardization gridlock that can significantly delay new service introduction and limit revenue growth. Moreover the tunable optical components that enable extensive wavelength flexibility are centralized at the OLT rather than distributed at the ONUs such that their cost can be amortized over a large number of ONUs and services. Finally by centralizing both the tunable components and the software reconfigurable wavelength control algorithms at the OLT on demand services bandwidth can be made available to legacy users through cost efficient DSP based ONU enhancements and without requiring more costly ONU side optical hardware upgrades. In this way a novel and attractive business model to monetize the underlying network by dynamically and cost efficiently satisfying user side requirements can be created.

Solutions are 1. the upgrades of OLT side legacy transmitters to operate using tunable temperature controlled lasers which enables the defragmentation of optical access spectrum and increased spectral availability for new services 2. the introduction of the OLT side DSP TPND which in conjunction the tunable temperature stabilized laser can exploit the newly available spectral space and advanced DSP based modulation to rapidly introduce beyond 10 Gb s wavelength data flows into the network 3. the dynamic wavelength assignment algorithm and wavelength virtualization map which enable a global logical view of the underlying physical spectrum space such that a single physical standardized wavelength plan is no longer necessary to enable operator interoperability and new service introduction 4. DSP enhanced ONUs which exploit broadband direct photodetection and frequency domain DSP to isolate the downstream signal of the new services without legacy service signal interference and or 5. a software controlled flexible grid OLT side WSS which creates multiple signal pass bands with variable center frequencies and variable pass band sizes to enable wavelength tunable upstream signal separation.

A software defined SD tunable OLT architecture supporting bi directional communication with both legacy ONUs and DSP enhanced ONUs is shown in . It is noted that in functional blocks and are exploited for both downstream DS and upstream US operation functional blocks are used for DS operation only and blocks and are exploited for US operation only.

As shown in unlike in legacy networks where wavelength DS US assignment is fixed in the SD tunable OLT wavelengths are allocated and managed dynamically using the SD dynamic planning algorithm and physical to virtual port mapping . Specifically whereas in core optical networks a SD controller has a global view of the switches and routers in the network topology and computes optimal flow paths in the planning algorithm has a global view of the physical wavelength space and computes assignment metrics and according to a set of operator specific criteria. Consequently the assignment metrics and the wavelengths that correspond to the optimal allocation scheme of could vary greatly depending on the specific operator needs and requirements. The algorithm of could thus range from a highly sophisticated optimization algorithm for maximized spectral efficiency for example the meta MAC 2 to a simpler algorithm that identifies wavelength regions that meet a certain performance criterion e.g. carrier to noise ratio or relative intensity noise requirements to a basic heuristic that populates an ITU T standardized wavelength grid. It is noted that the need for backwards compatibility with legacy services can a priori restrict the usage of some sub set of wavelengths e.g. GPON 10 G PON RF video etc. such that these restrictions would be communicated by legacy service Tx hardware to via a generic interface such as OpenFlow for example.

With the novel exploitation of OLT side tunable and temperature controlled narrow lasers in however the sub set of restricted wavelengths for can be greatly reduced compared to legacy wavelength band operational requirements for legacy services. Moreover regardless of the algorithm choice in its decisions are ultimately abstracted to a virtualized i.e. logical view of the wavelength space by the PHY to virtual mapping and made available in virtualized form to a centralized graphical user interface which provides a global logical view of the underlying physical wavelength space resources. In for example instead of providing the exact physical description e.g. 1550.15 nm 1317.8 nm of each of the 8 available wavelengths 4 DS 4 US the PHY to virtual mapping provides a single virtual port number to the graphical user interface . By thus exploiting sufficient physical resources can be made available for either internal or third party service flow provisioning while abstracting the detailed physical layer implementation of the on demand service support.

The detailed view of the PHY to virtual mapping is shown in and comprises five 16 bit fields which are compatible with OpenFlow based control signaling. For downstream PHY to virtual mapping the port field directly assigns a 16 bit numerical label to an underlying optical wavelength while the next three fields i.e. f f and f denote the sub operational frequencies of the downstream signal. The fifth field denotes the modulation format of the downstream signal. To illustrate the downstream operation of the PHY to virtual mapping of three examples are given in for a 0 1 GHz binary modulation GPON signal on port e.g. 1490 nm a 0 10 GHz binary modulation 10 GPON signal on port e.g. 1490.5 nm and a 0 1 GHz RF video signal on port e.g. 1551 nm with M 2 64 QAM modulation and the physical layer capability to extend to a 3 GHz maximum sub PHY bandwidth. It is noted that the OLT side physical layer capability for allocating arbitrary downstream wavelengths with minimal guard bands to different services is enabled by temperature stabilized tunable lasers DSP TPND as well as the WDM 1r x coupler .

To illustrate the upstream operation of the PHY to virtual mapping of two examples are given in for a dual rate binary modulated GPON 10 G PON upstream signal with 10 GHz physical bandwidth for which a 50 GHz slot centered at port e.g. 1262 nm is created and a special purpose data flow with 25 GHz physical bandwidth and M 2 16 QAM modulation for which a 100 GHz slot centered at port e.g. 1579 nm is created using software defined control of the flexible grid WSS . It is noted that the fparameter is communicated to the planning and virtual mapping algorithms and by the ONU side hardware while the f f Port and Mod parameters in are decided by the planning algorithm and communicated to the ONU side hardware by the virtual map control messaging.

As shown in after the PHY to virtual assignment and mapping and optical signal generation and modulation using the legacy and DSP transmitters and the complete set of DS wavelengths is combined using existing WDM WDM 1r 1x combiners and or passive optical couplers for distribution of the optical fiber link which is terminated with passive optical splitters .

As shown in and in more detail in at the ONU side and legacy ONU side WDM 1r 1x filters can be used for wavelength based separation of legacy and new services leaving downstream legacy ONU operation unchanged. Moreover even in the absence of the ONU side WDM 1r 1x filters so long as the sub operational signal frequencies f f and fgenerated by the DSP transponder and intended for DSP enhanced ONUs are outside of the sub operational frequencies of the legacy ONU photodiode the legacy ONU optical front end will intrinsically behave as a low pass filter and remove these without altering its operation or the operation of the post photodetection legacy Rx in any way. The broadband photodiode of the DSP enhanced ONU on the other hand can capture the optical signal of both legacy and emerging services. However unlike the legacy ONU photodiode which must act as a low pass filter to maintain sub signal frequency separation between legacy and new services the frequency domain DSP enhanced ONU Rx e.g. based on frequency division multiple access FDMA orthogonal frequency division multiple access OFDMA for example can exploit its DSP capabilities and knowledge of the sub operational signal frequencies f f and fto isolate its designated signal in post photodetection DSP and discard all other frequency content. It is noted that in addition to these differences between the legacy ONU and DSP enhanced ONU downstream receiveres it is the software defined assignment algorithm such as the meta MAC 1 that ensures there will be no sub frequency domain overlap interference between the signal content of legacy and new service flows.

Finally DSP based Tx enhancements can also be exploited for upstream transmission such that unlike in legacy US Tx hardware for which both US wavelengths and transmission bit rates are fixed and can reach up to 10 Gb s multi level modulation can be implemented in a software reconfigurable fashion to dynamically support beyond 10 Gb s bit rate assignments. After upstream transmission through the WDM 1r splitter which is operated as a coupler in upstream mode followed by the PON passive splitter and optical fiber the flexible grid WSS is used at the OLT side to separate the upstream optical signal components . Specifically using software defined control the WSS is exploited to create multiple signal pass bands with variable center frequencies and variable pass band size. At the WSS output the upstream flows are wavelength separated and independently routed to their designated receivers . For legacy TDM based services with data rates up to 10 Gb s burst mode optical receivers may be used for while for beyond 10 Gb s service flows coherent detection may be exploited for .

We demonstrate the first software defined OpenFlow1.0 based flex grid flow architecture enabling 150 Mb s per cell OFDMA MBH overlays onto bidirectional 10 Gb s PON without any ONU side optical filtering amplification or coherent detection over 20 km SSMF and 1 64 passive split.

Flexible on demand provisioning of low latency wavelength flows for high quality of service 100 Mb s per cell mobile backhaul MBH over legacy passive optical networks PON is rapidly becoming a vital technical and economic priority for optical access networks 4 5 . However notable spectrum fragmentation and gridlock exist in legacy PONs due to the concatenation of fixed operational and spectral guardbands that are disproportionately large compared to service data rates 20 nm for 1 Gb s PON for example 1 . Localized differences in traffic demands also complicate partitioning of the remaining spectral space into a universal physical plan. While optical network unit ONU side optical filters with limited tunability and large upstream spectral bands accommodating tunable laser drift seek to alleviate this gridlock 2 further spectrum fragmentation limiting MBH overlays remains a challenge.

With the software defined networking SDN approach however instead of defining a fixed physical plan software reconfigurable flex grid or grid less planning can be introduced at the optical line terminal OLT by which a centralized controller with a global view of the space can compute customized provisioning metrics on demand and communicate them using a generic OpenFlow based 6 application programming interface API . The OpenFlow based API can then both provide external interoperability and flexible dynamic per PON physical plans. At the OLT the space virtualization can be supported by widely tunable DFB lasers for which C band cost points nearly equal those of fixed lasers and for the upstream by flexible grid filters i.e. wavelength selective switches WSS which can be software controlled to track upstream signals and relax ONU side tunable laser requirements while reducing spectral band size. Moreover at the downstream ONU side direct photodetection with digital signal processing DSP based sub Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access OFDMA based signal separation can be used for OFDMA MBH 10 G on off keying OOK PON coexistence without tunable optical filtering.

We propose and experimentally demonstrate the first software defined OpenFlow1.0 based flex grid flow architecture for 150 Mb s per cell OFDMA MBH overlays onto PON comprising bidirectional 10 Gb s OOK channels without any ONU side optical filtering amplification or coherent detection over 20 km SSMF and 1 64 passive split. The new approach is attractive for next generation converged optical access MBH.

To our best knowledge we have experimentally demonstrated the first software defined OpenFlow1.0 based flex grid flow architecture for dynamic 150 Mb s per cell 4G OFDMA MBH overlays onto 10 Gb s PON without ONU side optical filtering amplification or coherent detection over 20 km SSMF with a 1 64 passive split. By enabling interoperable on demand spectrum allocation using software defined control and DSP based ONU enhancements the novel approach is promising for future high speed converged fixed mobile access networks.
