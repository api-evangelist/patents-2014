The present disclosure relates to computer systems and software and more particularly to techniques for facilitating and automating the provision of services in a cloud environment.

Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient on demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources e.g. networks servers storage applications and services . The services provided or accessed through the cloud or network are referred to as cloud services. There is a lot of processing that needs to be performed by a cloud service provider to make cloud services available to a subscribing customer. Due to its complexity much of this processing is still done manually. For example provisioning resources for providing such cloud services can be a very labor intensive process.

Consumers and businesses have an expectation that ordering and starting the use of computer network cloud based services be seamless. However many cloud services are difficult to start up requiring the provisioning of resources that might be shared. For example servers in a server farm may run cloud services for many customers at once and adding another customer may require shifting around resources. Different users may wish to employ different services. For example some users may only want raw storage on the cloud while other users may want to use sophisticated database storage. Still others may want the use of graphical user interface GUI software applications running on the cloud for its employees or customers.

There exists a need in the art for faster less expensive and easier to use cloud based computer systems.

Generally aspects of the present disclosure relate to enabling already provisioned services such as database services and Java services in a computer network cloud infrastructure system to be reused in order to reduce the time to provision new services.

The disclosed techniques offer a faster easier and non intrusive way to achieve multi tenancy virtualization in applications including legacy applications keeping most of the existing code design as it is and improves code quality by reducing coupling. Various embodiments provide on premise and cloud deployment support for components that may not be multi tenant enabled. A single application in a highly non intrusive way without effecting application functional logic. On premise deployments can run with fixed default tenant and no tenant information needs to be captured anywhere anytime. The application code accesses the hierarchical bean factory to get any tenant specific or shared resources seamlessly without knowledge of multi tenancy in functional code anywhere

In certain embodiments a computing device having one or more processors receives a hierarchical bean factory associated with an application. A parent bean factory represents a shared application context. Each child bean factory represents an entity specific application context. When a request is to invoke a function associated with the application an entity is determined based on the request. A child bean factory in the hierarchical bean factory that is associated with the entity is determined. The function associated with the application can then be invoked using the child bean factory specific to the entity.

In one aspect entity information is stored in a session context. The entity information can be accessed in order to determine the child bean factory. The entity information may be generated in response to authenticating a user of a tenant in a cloud infrastructure system the tenant being the determined entity.

In various embodiments one or more interfaces in the parent bean factory are defined identified or otherwise received. Access to the one or more interfaces in the parent bean factory can be restricted to the child bean factories. In another aspect one or more entity aware components in the child bean factory are defined identified or otherwise received. Access to the entity aware components can be shared based on only loading each entity aware component once per entity. In yet another aspect one or more shared components in the parent bean factory can be define identified or otherwise received. Access to the shared components can be shared based on only loading each shared component once per application instance.

In one embodiment a non transitory computer readable medium stores a computer program product which when executed by a processor of a computer systems causes the processor to receive a hierarchical bean factory associated with an application a parent bean factory representing a shared application context and each child bean factory representing an entity specific application context receive a request to invoke a function associated with the application determine an entity based on the request determine a child bean factory in the hierarchical bean factory that is associated with the entity and cause the function associated with the application to be invoked using the child bean factory specific to the entity.

In another embodiment a system includes at least one processor and a memory storing a computer program product which when executed by the processor causes the processor to receive a hierarchical bean factory associated with an application a parent bean factory representing a shared application context and each child bean factory representing an entity specific application context receive a request to invoke a function associated with the application determine an entity based on the request determine a child bean factory in the hierarchical bean factory that is associated with the entity and cause the function associated with the application to be invoked using the child bean factory specific to the entity.

Exemplary database servers include without limitation those commercially available from Oracle Microsoft Sybase IBM and the like.

In various embodiments cloud infrastructure system may be adapted to automatically provision manage and track a customer s subscription to services offered by cloud infrastructure system . In one embodiment as depicted in the components in cloud infrastructure system include an Identity Management IDM module a services module a Tenant Automation System TAS module a Service Deployment Infrastructure SDI module an Enterprise Manager EM module one or more front end web interfaces such as a store user interface UI a cloud user interface UI and a support user interface UI an order management module sales personnel operator personnel and an order database . These modules may include or be provided using one or more computers and or servers which may be general purpose computers specialized server computers server farms server clusters or any other appropriate arrangement and or combination. In one embodiment one or more of these modules can be provided by cloud management functionality or IaaS platform in cloud infrastructure system . The various modules of the cloud infrastructure system depicted in are meant for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to limit the scope of embodiments of the present invention. Alternative embodiments may include more or fewer modules than those shown in .

In an exemplary operation at a customer using a client device such as client device or may interact with cloud infrastructure system by browsing the various services provided by cloud infrastructure system and placing an order for a subscription for one or more services offered by cloud infrastructure system . In certain embodiments the customer may access store UI or cloud UI and place a subscription order via these user interfaces.

The order information received by cloud infrastructure system in response to the customer placing an order may include information identifying the customer and one or more services offered by the cloud infrastructure system that the customer intends to subscribe to. A single order may include orders for multiple services. For instance a customer may login to cloud UI and request a subscription for a CRM service and a Java cloud service in the same order.

Additionally the order may also include one or more service levels for the ordered services. As used herein and as will be discussed in greater detail below a service level for a service determines the amount of resources to be allocated for providing the requested service in the context of the subscription such as the amount of storage amount of computing resources data transfer facilities and the like. For example a basic service level may provide a minimum level of storage data transmission or number of users and higher service levels may include additional resources.

In addition in some instances the order information received by cloud infrastructure system may include information indicative of a customer level and the time period during which the service is desired. The customer level specifies the priority of the customer making the subscription request. In one example the priority may be determined based on the quality of service that the cloud infrastructure system guarantees or promises the customer as specified by a Service Level Agreement SLA agreed to between the customer and the provider of the cloud services. In one example the different customer levels include a basic level a silver level and a gold level. The time period for a service may specify the start date and time for the service and the time period for which the service is desired e.g. a service end date and time may be specified .

In one embodiment a customer may request a new subscription via store UI or request for a trial subscription via cloud UI . In certain embodiments store UI may represent the service provider s eCommerce store front e.g. www.oracle.com store for Oracle Cloud services . Cloud UI may represent a business interface for the service provider. Consumer can explore available services and sign up for interested services through cloud UI . Cloud UI captures user input necessary for ordering trial subscriptions provided by cloud infrastructure system . Cloud UI may also be used to view account features and configure the runtime environment located within cloud infrastructure system . In addition to placing an order for a new subscription store UI may also enable the customer to perform other subscription related tasks such as changing the service level of a subscription extending the term of the subscription increasing the service level of a subscription terminating an existing subscription and the like.

After an order has been placed per at the order information that is received via either store UI or cloud UI is stored in order database which can be one of several databases operated by cloud infrastructure system and utilized in conjunction with other system elements. While order database is shown logically as a single database in in actual implementation this may comprise one or more databases.

At the order is forwarded to order management module . Order management module is configured to perform billing and accounting functions related to the order such as verifying the order and upon verification booking the order. In certain embodiments order management module may include a contract management module and an install base module. The contract management module may store contract information associated with the customer s subscription order such as the customer s service level agreement SLA with cloud infrastructure system . The install base module may include detailed descriptions of the services in the customer s subscription order. In addition to order information the install base module may track installation details related to the services product status and support service history related to the services. As a customer orders new services or upgrades existing ones the install base module may automatically add new order information.

At information regarding the order is communicated to TAS module . In one embodiment TAS module utilizes the order information to orchestrate the provisioning of services and resources for the order placed by the customer. At TAS component orchestrates the provisioning of resources to support the subscribed services using the services of SDI module . At TAS module provides information related to the provisioned order received from SDI module to services module . In some embodiments at SDI module may also use services provided by services module to allocate and configure the resources needed to fulfill the customer s subscription order.

At services module sends a notification to the customers on client devices and regarding the status of the order.

In certain embodiments TAS module functions as an orchestration component that manages business processes associated with each order and applies business logic to determine whether an order should proceed to provisioning. In one embodiment upon receiving an order for a new subscription TAS module sends a request to SDI module to allocate resources and configure those resources needed to fulfill the subscription order. SDI module enables the allocation of resources for the services ordered by the customer. SDI module provides a level of abstraction between the cloud services provided by cloud infrastructure system and the physical implementation layer that is used to provision the resources for providing the requested services. TAS module may thus be isolated from implementation details such as whether or not services and resources are actually provisioned on the fly or pre provisioned and only allocated assigned upon request.

In certain embodiments a user may use store UI to directly interact with order management module to perform billing and accounting related functions such as verifying the order and upon verification booking the order. In some embodiments instead of a customer placing an order at the order may instead be placed by sales personnel on behalf of the customer such as a customer s service representative or sales representative. Sales personnel may directly interact with order management module via a user interface not shown in provided by order management module for placing orders or for providing quotes for the customer. This for example may be done for large customers where the order may be placed by the customer s sales representative through order management module . The sales representative may set up the subscription on behalf of the customer.

EM module is configured to monitor activities related to managing and tracking a customer s subscription in cloud infrastructure system . EM module collects usage statistics for the services in the subscription order such as the amount of storage used the amount data transferred the number of users and the amount of system up time and system down time. At a host operator personnel who may be an employee of a provider of cloud infrastructure system may interact with EM module via an enterprise manager user interface not shown in to manage systems and resources on which services are provisioned within cloud infrastructure system .

Identity management IDM module is configured to provide identity services such as access management and authorization services in cloud infrastructure system . In one embodiment IDM module controls information about customers who wish to utilize the services provided by cloud infrastructure system . Such information can include information that authenticates the identities of such customers and information that describes which actions those customers are authorized to perform relative to various system resources e.g. files directories applications communication ports memory segments etc. IDM module can also include the management of descriptive information about each customer and about how and by whom that descriptive information can be accessed and modified.

In one embodiment information managed by the identity management module can be partitioned to create separate identity domains. Information belonging to a particular identity domain can be isolated from all other identity domains. Also an identity domain can be shared by multiple separate tenants. Each such tenant can be a customer subscribing to services in the cloud infrastructure system . In some embodiments a customer can have one or many identity domains and each identity domain may be associated with one or more subscriptions each subscription having one or many services. For example a single customer can represent a large entity and identity domains may be created for divisions departments within this large entity. EM module and IDM module may in turn interact with order management module at and respectively to manage and track the customer s subscriptions in cloud infrastructure system .

In one embodiment at support services may also be provided to the customer via a support UI . In one embodiment support UI enables support personnel to interact with order management module via a support backend system to perform support services at . Support personnel in the cloud infrastructure system as well as customers can submit bug reports and check the status of these reports via support UI .

Other interfaces not shown in may also be provided by cloud infrastructure system . For example an identity domain administrator may use a user interface to IDM module to configure domain and user identities. In addition customers may log into a separate interface for each service they wish to utilize. In certain embodiments a customer who wishes to subscribe to one or more services offered by cloud infrastructure system may also be assigned various roles and responsibilities. In one embodiment the different roles and responsibilities that may be assigned for a customer may include that of a buyer an account administrator a service administrator an identity domain administrator or a user who utilizes the services and resources offered by cloud infrastructure system . The different roles and responsibilities are described more fully in below.

At a customer s subscription order is processed. The processing may include validating the order in one example. Validating the order includes ensuring that the customer has paid for the subscription and ensuring that the customer does not already have subscriptions with the same name or that the customer is not attempting to create multiple subscriptions of the same type in the same identity domain for subscription types for which this is disallowed such as in the case of a CRM service . Processing may also include tracking the status of an order for each order that is being processed by cloud infrastructure system .

At a business process associated with the order is identified. In some instances multiple business processes may be identified for an order. Each business process identifies a series of steps for processing various aspects of the order. As an example a first business process may identify one or more steps related to provisioning physical resources for the order a second business process may identify one or more steps related to creating an identity domain along with customer identities for the order a third business process may identify one or more steps for related to performing back office functions such as creating a customer record for the user performing accounting functions related to the order and the like. In certain embodiments different business processes may also be identified for processing different services in an order. For example different business process may be identified to process a CRM service and a database service.

At the business process identified for the order in is executed. Executing the business process associated with the order may include orchestrating the series of steps associated with the business process identified in step . For example executing a business process related to provisioning physical resources for the order may include sending a request to SDI module to allocate resources and configure those resources needed to fulfill the subscription order.

At a notification is sent to the customer regarding the status of the provisioned order. Additional description related to performing steps and is provided in detail in .

In one embodiment order processing module receives an order from a customer from one or more input sources . For example order processing module may directly receive an order via cloud UI or store UI in one embodiment. Alternatively order processing module may receive an order from order management module or order database . Order processing module then processes the order. In certain embodiments processing the order includes generating a customer record which includes information about the order such as a service type a service level a customer level the type of resources the amount of the resources to be allocated to the service instance and a time period during which the service is desired. As part of the processing order processing module also determines whether the order is a valid order. This includes ensuring that the customer does not already have subscriptions with the same name or that the customer is not attempting to create multiple subscriptions of the same type in the same identity domain for subscription types where this is disallowed such as in the case of a fusion CRM service .

Order processing module may also perform additional processing on the order. Processing may include tracking the status of an order for each order that is being processed by cloud infrastructure system . In one embodiment order processing module may process each order to identify a number of states pertaining to the order. In one example the different states of an order may be an initialized state a provisioned state an active state an administration required state an error state and the like. An initialized state refers to the state of a new order a provisioned state refers to the state of an order once the services and resources for the order have been provisioned. An order is in an active state when the order has been processed by TAS module and a notification to that effect has been delivered to the customer. An order is in an administration required state when intervention by an administrator is needed to resolve the issue. The order is in an error state when the order cannot be processed. In addition to maintaining the order progress status order processing module also maintains detailed information about any failures encountered during process execution. In other embodiments and as will be discussed in detail below the additional processing performed by order processing module may also include changing the service level for a service in the subscription changing the services included in the subscription extending the time period of the subscription and canceling the subscription or specifying different service levels for different time periods in the subscription.

After an order has been processed by order processing module business logic is applied to determine whether the order should proceed to provisioning. In one embodiment as part of orchestrating the order business process identifier receives the processed order from order processing module and applies business logic to identify a particular business process to use for the order being processed. In one embodiment business process identifier may utilize information stored in a service catalog to determine the particular business process to be used for the order. In one embodiment and as discussed in multiple business processes may be identified for an order and each business process identifies a series of steps for processing various aspects of the order. In another embodiment and as discussed above different business processes may be defined for different types of services or combinations of services such as a CRM service or a database service. In one embodiment service catalog may store information mapping an order to a particular type of business process. Business process identifier may use this information to identify a specific business process for the order being processed.

Once a business process has been identified business process identifier communicates the particular business process to be executed to business process executor . Business process executor then executes steps of the identified business process by operating in conjunction with one or more modules in the cloud infrastructure system . In some embodiments business process executor acts as an orchestrator for performing the steps associated with a business process. For example the business process executor may interact with order processing module to execute steps in a business process that identifies workflows related to the order determines the overage of services in the order or identifies service components related to the order.

In one example business process executor interacts with SDI module to execute steps in a business process for allocating and provisioning resources for services requested in the subscription order. In this example for each step in the business process business process executor may send a request to SDI component to allocate resources and configure resources needed to fulfill the particular step. SDI component is responsible for the actual allocation of the resources. Once all the steps of the business processes of an order have been executed business process executor may send a notification to the customer of the processed order by utilizing the services of services component . The notification may include sending an email notification to the customer with details of the processed order. The email notification may also include deployment information related to the order to enable the customer to access the subscribed services.

In certain embodiments TAS module may provide one or more TAS Application Programming Interfaces APIs that enable TAS module to interact with other modules in cloud infrastructure system and for other modules to interact with TAS module . For example the TAS APIs may include a system provisioning API that interacts with SDI module via an asynchronous Simple Object Access Protocol SOAP based web services call to provision resources for the customer s subscription order. In one embodiment TAS module may also utilize the system provisioning API to accomplish system and service instance creation and deletion switch a service instance to an increased service level and associate service instances. An example of this is the association of a Java service instance to a fusion applications service instance to allow secure web service communications. The TAS APIs may also include a notification API that interacts with the services module to notify the customer of a processed order. In certain embodiments the TAS module also periodically propagates subscription information outages and notifications e.g. planned downtime to services component .

In certain embodiments TAS module periodically receives usage statistics for each of the provisioned services such as the amount of storage used the amount data transferred the number of users and the amount of system up time and system down time from EM module . Overage framework utilizes the usage statistics to determine whether over use of a service has occurred and if so to determine how much to bill for the overage and provides this information to order management module .

In certain embodiments TAS module includes an order workflow identification module that is configured to identify one or more workflows associated with processing a customer s subscription order. In certain embodiments TAS module may include a subscription order generation framework for generating subscription orders for a customer when the customer places a subscription order for one or more services offered by the cloud infrastructure system . In one embodiment a subscription order includes one or more service components responsible for providing the services requested by a customer in the subscription order.

Additionally TAS module may also interact with one or more additional databases such as a Tenant Information System TIS database to enable the provisioning of resources for one or more services subscribed by the customer while taking into consideration historical information if any available for the customer. TIS database may include historical order information and historical usage information pertaining to orders subscribed by the customer.

TAS module may be deployed using different deployment models. In certain embodiments the deployment includes a central component that interfaces with one or more distributed components. The distributed components may for example be deployed as various data centers and accordingly may also be referred to as data center components. The central component includes capabilities to process orders and co ordinate services in cloud infrastructure system while the data center components provide capabilities for provisioning and operating the runtime system that provides the resources for the subscribed services.

As described above with respect to SDI task manager module translates each step specified in a business process into a series of tasks by utilizing the services of SDI connector module which may include one or more connectors for handling the deployment of tasks specified by SDI task manager module to provision one or more services related to the order request. One or more of the connectors may handle tasks that are specific to a particular service type while other connectors may handle tasks that are common across different service types. In one embodiment SDI connector module includes a set of connectors wrapper APIs that interface with one or more of the external modules shown in in cloud infrastructure system to provision the services and resources related to the order request.

In certain embodiments Nuviaq system may be configured to provide a runtime engine for orchestrating PaaS operations. Nuviaq system may provide a web service API to facilitate integration with other products and services. Nuviaq system also provides support for complex workflows in system provisioning application deployment and associated lifecycle operations and integrates with management and monitoring solutions.

In the embodiment depicted in Nuviaq system comprises a Nuviaq proxy a Nuviaq manager and a Nuviaq database . In certain embodiments Nuviaq manager provides an entry point into Nuviaq system providing secure access to PaaS operations via the web service API. Internally it tracks system state in the database and controls job execution on the workflow engine. In a public cloud Nuviaq manager may be accessed by the Tenant Provisioning system SDI and the Tenant Console to drive provisioning and deployment operations respectively.

In one embodiment Nuviaq manager executes jobs asynchronously via an internal workflow engine. A job may be a sequence of actions specific to a given PaaS workflow. Actions may be performed in order with failure in any step resulting in failure of the overall job. Many workflow actions delegate to external systems relevant to the workflow such as the EM command line interface cli . In one implementation Nuviaq manager application may be hosted in a 2 node WebLogic cluster with associated HTTP server e.g. Oracle HTTP Server or OHS instance running inside a firewall.

In certain embodiments Nuviaq proxy is the public access point to the Nuviaq API. In one embodiment only Public API may be exposed here. Requests received by proxy may be forwarded to Nuviaq manager . In one embodiment Nuviaq proxy runs outside the firewall whereas manager runs within the firewall. In one implementation Nuviaq proxy application runs on a WebLogic cluster running outside the firewall.

In certain embodiments Nuviaq database tracks various domain entities such as without limitation platform instance deployment plan application WebLogic domain jobs alerts and the like. Primary keys may be aligned with the Service Database where appropriate.

In one embodiment Platform Instance may contain all resources required for a WebLogic service for a given tenant.

Nuviaq system may rely on additional systems of cloud infrastructure system to carry out the workflows used the WebLogic cloud service. These dependencies may include dependencies on SDI IDM a virus scan system a service database CRM instances and the like. For example Nuviaq system may depend upon functions performed by an Assembly Deployer in SDI . In one embodiment the Assembly Deployer is a system to manage interactions with OVAB Oracle Virtual Assembly Builder and OVM Oracle Virtual Machine . Capabilities of the Assembly Deployer used by Nuviaq system may include without limitation functions for deploying an assembly un deploying an assembly describing assembly deployment scaling appliance and the like. In one implementation Nuviaq system accesses the Assembly Deployer via a web service API.

In certain embodiments security policies may require certain artifacts to be scanned for viruses before being deployed to an application. Cloud infrastructure system may provide a virus scan system for this purpose that provides scanning as a service for multiple components of the public cloud.

In certain embodiments a public cloud infrastructure may maintain a Service Database containing information about tenants e.g. customers and their service subscriptions. Nuviaq workflows may access to this data in order to properly configure a WebLogic service as a client to other services that the tenant also subscribes to.

Nuviaq system may depend on IDM for its security integration. In certain embodiments Java Service instances can be associated with a CRM instance. The association allows user applications deployed to their Java Service instance to access a CRM instance though Web Service calls.

Various entities may use services provided by Nuviaq system . These clients of Nuviaq system may include a Tenant Console which is an management server e.g. Oracle Management Server based user interface that customers may access to manage their applications on their platform instances several IDEs such as Oracle IDEs JDeveloper NetBeans and OEPE have been extended to offer access to application lifecycle management operations one or more Command Line Interfaces CLIs that are available to access lifecycle operations on the platform instances.

Provisioning use case for Nuviaq system A Provision Platform Instance use case is realized via the Create Platform Instance operation of the Nuviaq API. In the context of cloud infrastructure system a service instance with respect to the Nuviaq system corresponds to a Nuviaq platform instance. A platform instance is assigned a unique identifier is used on all subsequent operations related to this instance. A Platform Deployment descriptor provided to the Create Platform Instance action allows for properties to be set that modify the configuration of the platform instance to meet the subscription requirements of the tenant. These properties may include for example 

Install Update Application use case The Install Application operation deploys an application to a running WebLogic Server after validating that the application archive meets the security requirements of the Public Cloud. In one embodiment the Application Deployment descriptor provided to the Install Application action allows for properties to be set that modify the configuration of the application to meet the subscription requirements of the tenant. These properties may include for example 

Referring back to in certain embodiments TAS and SDI working in cooperation are responsible for provisioning resources for one or more services ordered by a customer from a set of services offered by cloud infrastructure system . For example in one embodiment for provisioning a database service the automated provisioning flow may be as follows for a paid subscription 

 3 When services are available TAS initiates provisioning by using the services of SDI . TAS may perform business process orchestration which will execute the relevant business process to complete the provisioning aspect of the order. In one embodiment TAS may use a BPEL Business Process Execution Language Process Manager to orchestrate the steps involved in the provisioning and handle the lifecycle operations. 4 In one embodiment to provision a database service SDI may call PLSQL APIs in the CLOUD UI to associate a schema for the requesting customer. 5 After successful association of a schema to the customer SDI signals TAS and TAS send a notification to the customer that the database service is now available for use by the customer. 6 The customer may log into cloud infrastructure system e.g. using an URAL such as cloud.oracle.com and activate the service.

In some embodiments a customer may also be allowed to subscribe to a service on a trial basis. For example such a trial order may be received via cloud UI e.g. using cloud.oracle.com .

In certain embodiments cloud infrastructure system enables underlying hardware and service instances to be shared between customers or tenants. For example the database service may be provisioned as shown in in one embodiment. depicts multiple Exadata compute nodes and each providing a database instance provisioned for the database service. For example compute node provides a database instance for a database service. Each Exadata compute node may have multiple database instances.

In certain embodiments each database instance can comprise multiple schemas and the schemas may be associated with different customers or tenants. For example in database instance provides two schemas and each with its own tables. Schema may be associated with a first customer or tenant subscribing to a database service and schema may be associated with a second customer or tenant subscribing to the database service. Each tenant gets a completely isolated schema. Each schema acts like a container that can manage database objects including tables views stored procedures triggers etc. for the associated tenant. Each schema may have one dedicated tablespace with each tablespace having one data file.

In this manner a single database instance can provide database services to multiple tenants. This not only enables sharing of underlying hardware resources but also enables sharing of service instance between tenants.

In certain embodiments such a multi tenancy system is facilitated by IDM which beneficially enables multiple separate customers each having their own separate identity domains to use hardware and software that is shared in the cloud. Consequently there is no need for each customer to have its own dedicated hardware or software resources and in some cases resources that are not being used by some customers at a particular moment can be used by other customers thereby preventing those resources from being wasted. For example as depicted in a database instance can service multiple customers each with their respective identity domains. Although each such database service instance can be a separate abstraction or view of a single physical multi tenant database system that is shared among the many separate identity domains each such database service instance can have a separate and potentially different schema than each other database service instance has. Thus the multi tenant database system can store mappings between customer specified database schemas and the identity domains to which those database schemas pertain. The multi tenant database system can cause the database service instance for a particular identity domain to use the schema that is mapped to that particular identity domain.

The multi tenancy can also be extended to other services such as the Java Service. For example multiple customers can have a JAVA service instance placed within their respective identity domains. Each such identity domain can have a JAVA virtual machine which can be viewed as being a virtual slice of hardware. In one embodiment a job monitoring service e.g. Hudson can be combined with a JAVA enterprise edition platform e.g. Oracle WebLogic in the cloud to enable each separate identity domain to have its own separate virtual slice of the JAVA enterprise edition platform. Such a job monitoring service can for example monitor the execution of repeated jobs such as building a software project or jobs run by an operating system s time based job scheduler. Such repeated jobs can include the continuous building and or testing of software projects. Additionally or alternatively such repeated jobs can include the monitoring of executions of operating system run jobs that are executed on machines that are remote from the machine on which the job monitoring service executes.

In certain embodiments cloud infrastructure system provides a faster easier and non intrusive way to achieve multi tenancy virtualization in applications including legacy applications keeping most of the existing code design as it is and improves code quality by reducing coupling. Nowadays it has almost become a requirement to have applications deployed both on premise and on the cloud and provide the same functionality everywhere. A single application developed with just functional requirements in mind can work for customers with on premise deployments. However the same application if deployed on cloud to be used by multiple customers tenants having per tenant customizations configurations and resource integrations requires per tenant application deployment. This can be very costly and complicated to manage and loses all the benefits of cloud.

In order to support per tenant customizations configurations and resource integrations with one single application an application can be developed changed in such a way that one single deployment can serve multiple customers with parallel tenant access. The application can separate tenant storage and runtime data such that there is no overlap. This can introduce tenant specific logic in the functional components of the application as all the application level singletons would now be tenant level singletons or application level static data access would be tenant level static data access caching has to be per tenant etc. This could result in either two versions of the same application one for the cloud and one for on premise deployments or a total re write of the application with tenant specific logic built into it.

In one aspect cloud infrastructure system achieves application multi tenancy using a hierarchical bean factory container without knowledge of multi tenancy in the functional code. Cloud infrastructure system can provide a hierarchy of bean factories that handle each tenants context and any shared resources. In such an embodiment cloud infrastructure system treats each tenant as a child bean factory or sub container running inside the main application container.

At login time tenant information is taken and added to a session context in one embodiment. The tenant information can then be made available everywhere throughout the lifetime of the current login session. At the time of bean factory access the tenant information can be extracted from the session context to access the bean factory container appropriate to that tenant. By defining integration on interfaces whose implementations are provided by the bean factory container all integrations can happen via the bean factory container. A parent shared bean factory can be provided and a child per tenant bean factory can override beans in the parent factory. Tenant aware components can be defined in the child bean factory and the child can be loaded one per tenant while all shared components are defined in the parent bean factory that is loaded once for whole of application.

In various embodiments the parent bean factory is never directly accessed. Access is managed via the child bean factory. In one aspect based on a tenant identifier in a call context cloud infrastructure system can access the right child bean factory to get all tenant specific info which can never be shared across tenants. The approach can be applied to any new application development or existing applications can be refactored easily to become multi tenant enabled while other approaches which require multi tenant awareness in code design are difficult impossible to apply in existing legacy applications.

In this embodiment hierarchical bean factory includes parent bean factory and children bean factories and . Each bean factory controls the life cycle of an object bean and applications never directly create that object but they extract it from the factory. The factory handles the creation pooling and destruction of the object.

All across tenant shared services and data access happens via parent bean factory . Parent bean factory can be defined at the application level. All per tenant customizations resource access database access etc. caching and the like happens via child bean factories and which extend parent bean factory . All services or implementations which are stateless can be defined in parent bean factory as there can be no overlap of information with stateless beans. Similarly all services which have inbuilt multi tenancy support can also be defined at parent bean factory . All static data or singletons need to be accessed via child bean factories and .

In step tenant information is determined. In various embodiments tenant information is determined at login time. Tenant information may include a tenant identifier or other tenant specific information. In step the tenant information is added to a session context. In one embodiment the tenant information is referenced so that its available everywhere throughout the lifetime of the current login session.

In step a child bean factory is determined based on the tenant information. In various embodiments the child bean factory for a tenant identified by the tenant information extends a parent bean factory for a given application. In step the application is accessed using the per tenant child bean factory. As discussed above all services or implementations which are stateless are defined in the parent bean factory. All static data or singletons are accessed via the child bean factory. ends in step .

In step tenant T invokes a function named getProperty in order to retrieve property X from a Configuration Service ConfigService . In step in order to determine from which entity property X is to be retrieved ConfigService invokes a function named getEntityManager to retrieve an entity manager from a Utility Service Utils . Utils identifies tenant information from the current session context. In this example the tenant information identifies tenant T as invoking the function in step . In step Utils invokes a function named getFactory using the tenant information for tenant T in order to determine the appropriate bean factory to handle the getEntityManager request.

In step Utils invokes a function named getEntityManager from a child bean factory for tenant T. In one aspect if the getEntityManager function is specific to tenant T the child bean factory for tenant T handles the request. In another aspect if the getEntityManager function is not specific to tenant T or is otherwise stateless or multi tenant enabled the child bean factory for tenant T can ask a parent bean factory to handle the request. In this embodiment in step the child bean factory for tenant T does not override the function in the parent bean factory allowing the parent bean factory to handle the request.

Having received the appropriate entity manager EntityManager ConfigService then invokes a function named getProperty in order to retrieve property X from EntityManager in step . In step EntityManager invokes a function named getDatasource from Utils to determine the appropriate datasource for the managed entity from which the property X is to be retrieved. In step Utils again invokes the function named getFactory using the tenant information for tenant T in order to determine the appropriate bean factory to handle the getDatasource request.

In step Utils invokes a function named getDatasource from the child bean factory for tenant T. In one aspect if the getDatasource function is specific to tenant T the child bean factory for tenant T handles the request. In another aspect if the getDatasource function is not specific to tenant T or is multi tenant enabled the child bean factory for tenant T can ask a parent bean factory to handle the request. In this embodiment in step the child bean factory for tenant T invokes a function named getConnection from a database for tenant T to handle the request.

Having now received connection information for the appropriate datasource or otherwise established a connection ConfigService then invokes a function named readProperty in order to retrieve the value of property X from the database for tenant T in step . The value of property X can then be delivered to tenant T as the getProperty function returns from execution.

In much the same pattern as above in step tenant T invokes a function named getProperty in order to retrieve property X from the Configuration Service ConfigService . In step in order to determine from which entity property X is to be retrieved ConfigService invokes the function named getEntityManager to retrieve an entity manager from the Utility Service Utils . Utils identifies tenant information from the current session context. In this example the tenant information identifies tenant T as invoking the function in step . In step Utils invokes the function named getFactory using the tenant information for tenant T in order to determine the appropriate bean factory to handle the getEntityManager request.

In step Utils invokes a function named getEntityManager from a child bean factory for tenant T. In one aspect if the getEntityManager function is specific to tenant T the child bean factory for tenant T handles the request. In another aspect if the getEntityManager function is not specific to tenant T or is otherwise stateless or multi tenant enabled the child bean factory for tenant T can ask the parent bean factory to handle the request. In this embodiment in step the child bean factory for tenant T does not override the function in the parent bean factory allowing the parent bean factory to handle the request.

Having received the appropriate entity manager EntityManager ConfigService then invokes a function named getProperty in order to retrieve property X from EntityManager in step . In step EntityManager invokes the function named getDatasource from Utils to determine the appropriate datasource for the managed entity from which the property X is to be retrieved. In step Utils again invokes the function named getFactory using the tenant information for tenant T in order to determine the appropriate bean factory to handle the getDatasource request.

In step Utils invokes a function named getDatasource from the child bean factory for tenant T. In one aspect if the getDatasource function is specific to tenant T the child bean factory for tenant T handles the request. In another aspect if the getDatasource function is not specific to tenant T or is otherwise stateless or multi tenant enabled the child bean factory for tenant T can ask the parent bean factory to handle the request. In this embodiment in step the child bean factory for tenant T invokes a function named getConnection from a database for tenant T to handle the request.

Having now received connection information for the appropriate datasource or otherwise established a connection ConfigService then invokes a function named readProperty in order to retrieve the value of property X from the database for tenant T in step . The value of property X can then be delivered to tenant T as the getProperty function returns from execution.

As discussed above various embodiments provide on premise and cloud deployment support for components that may not be multi tenant enabled. A single application in a highly non intrusive way without effecting application functional logic. On premise deployments can run with fixed default tenant and no tenant information needs to be captured anywhere anytime. The application code accesses the hierarchical bean factory to get any tenant specific or shared resources seamlessly without knowledge of multi tenancy in functional code anywhere.
