Current network technologies allow for a variety of interactions between business institutions and consumers or users. For example a user may access her bank account information and perform transfers of funds to pay her electric bill all online via her computer or mobile phone. A consumer may purchase groceries or pizza for delivery to his home via websites hosted by respective businesses that offer these goods. However most of the above interactions require the user or consumer to create an account which may require divulging personal information that can include monetary information such as credit card numbers or personal information such as contact information in order to successfully complete a transaction. The business institutions or services that offer goods available to consumers online may have varying security measures in place for protecting a consumer s personal information. The personal information may be subject to malicious scripts programs actors that attempt to crack the security measures in place and gain access to the consumer s personal information for personal gain. The consumer has little input during account creation to guarantee the safety of his or her information and may rarely if ever receive any information indicating that his or her account is under attack.

In the following description various embodiments will be described. For purposes of explanation specific configurations and details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments. However it will also be apparent to one skilled in the art that the embodiments may be practiced without the specific details. Furthermore well known features may be omitted or simplified in order not to obscure the embodiment being described.

Techniques described and suggested herein include systems methods and computer readable medium for providing a password fraud detection feature for authentication information such as passwords associated with accounts that may be utilized for login requests corresponding to online accounts such as e commerce sites banking entities forums marketplaces etc. In accordance with at least one embodiment the password fraud detection feature may ingest receive or process incoming password authentication information set requests which can include authentication information change requests or initial authentication information set requests. In accordance with at least one embodiment authentication information may include passwords security question answers biometric information or any other suitable information for authenticating a login request for an account. The authentication information included in these requests may be compared to a ranked list table or database that indicates the frequency of use of authentication information for a plurality of accounts to determine if the accounts associated with the requests should be marked as potentially compromised. For example the frequency of use of passwords associated with the plurality of accounts may represent a normal distribution of passwords utilized for the accounts. The indication that a particular password or piece of authentication information has displaced the normal distribution or surpassed the frequency of use for a commonly used password associated with the plurality of accounts in a short time period could represent that an account has been compromised as a subset of accounts are having their passwords set to the particular password within the short time period. The frequency of use information may be maintained and updated by the service. An indication that a password has displaced the normal distribution of passwords or surpassed the frequency of use for a commonly used password could be an indication that a password set request is intended for fraudulent purposes and the system can utilize this information accordingly e.g. require authentication on next access . The service may mark an accounts as being potentially compromised based on a comparison of the password included in the set request and a subset of passwords included in the frequency of use information.

In embodiments the frequency of use information for passwords is maintained separately from the data stores maintaining the passwords for the accounts. Segregating these two data stores ensures an extra level of security for the accounts because the frequency of use information may not maintain any information about the users who could potentially share the same compromised password.

In a non limiting example the password fraud detection service may maintain frequency of use information for passwords associated with a plurality of accounts. Further the service may receive a request to set a password for a user s account to the password 45p. The service may compare the password 45p to the passwords included in the frequency of use information. If the service determines that the frequency of use of the password has surpassed the frequency of use of at least one password included in the frequency of use information for the plurality of accounts the service may flag the user s account as potentially being compromised by a malicious actor such as malware. Once an account has been flagged the service may perform due diligence security inquiries into the account to aid in a determination that the account has been compromised by a malicious actor. For example the service may use the flagged account s recent purchase history changes in personal information such as adding additional shipping addresses and browsing history to determine if the account is compromised. Upon a determination that the account is compromised the service may require the user provide an answer to an account question or correctly fill in a provided CAPTCHA completely automated public turing test to tell computers and humans apart to have access to the account. The requirement of providing an answer to an account question or CAPTCHA may prevent further action by the compromising entity as a virus or computer based compromising actor will be unable to answer either the CAPTCHA or the account question and a human compromising actor will be unable to answer the account question.

In accordance with at least one embodiment the determination of whether to mark the account as potentially being compromised may have a temporal aspect. For example the frequency of use information may be updated according to a specified time period. The time period may be dynamically updated by the service according to the type of account that is associated with the service. In an embodiment a different time period may exist for accounts associated with a service that utilizes a user s monetary information such as bank account information or credit debit card information than for accounts associated with a service that utilizes a user s contact information such as their email address. The behavior of the service associated with the account and password may also be utilized to update the frequency of use information. For example if the service s volume of transactions for password set requests is thousands per minute a ten second time period or threshold may be appropriate whereas if a service s volume of transactions includes only a thousand per day a ten second time period for updating or determining the frequency of use of passwords may not be appropriate.

The password fraud detection service may utilize the behavior of the service associated with the accounts and passwords to specify and update the time periods described herein. In accordance with at least one embodiment the password fraud detection service may compare a password included in a set request to a password that is quickly increasing in frequency of use to flag the associated account as potentially being compromised. The speed or rate at which the password in question is increasing in frequency of use may also be used by the password fraud detection service to flag the account as being potentially compromised. The behavior of the service associated with the frequency of use information may also be a factor in determining which rate or speed of increasing use warrants flagging an account as potentially being compromised. The password fraud detection service may also utilize the dynamically updated frequency of use information for passwords to take retroactive action for accounts that have set their password to a password that at the time was not considered to be an indicator of a compromised account but after a certain time period is considered to be an indicator of a compromised account such as the password s frequency of use dramatically increasing within a time period . As described herein the retroactive action may include marking or flagging the account as compromised and requiring that during the next login session associated with the flagged account that the user provide user verification information such as a phone number or an answer to a security question.

In accordance with at least one embodiment an authentication information management application may maintain authentication information for an account a network document or any suitable authentication information associated with a login request session including verification information on behalf of a user. The authentication information management application may be configured to run locally on a client device on behalf of a user and generate store and maintain authentication information for login requests made by the user. In an embodiment the authentication information management application may be configured to receive or obtain other authentication information that has been marked as potentially compromised. For example a password fraud detection service that implements a password fraud detection module as described herein may provide a set of one or more passwords or other types of authentication information that has been marked as potentially compromised. The password fraud detection service or other providers of potentially compromised authentication information may also provide or be queried for authentication information scope rules which indicate minimum and maximum rules for setting passwords or authentication information such as character limitations or supported symbol sets . In response to receiving or obtaining the potentially compromised authentication information the authentication information management feature may take several actions including at least generating a recommendation that the user change update their authentication information for one or more accounts automatically update the user s authentication information for one or more accounts or automatically update the user s authentication information for one or more accounts and notify the user of the update.

In an embodiment an authentication information clearinghouse service that implements an authentication information clearinghouse feature may manage compromised authentication information for one or more accounts on behalf of a user share and receive other authentication information maintained by peer members of a compromised authentication information clearinghouse and update the authentication information for the one or more accounts based on the authentication information that is shared and received by the password fraud detection service. In accordance with at least one embodiment an authentication information peer network may be comprised of members that each maintain compromised authentication information for a plurality of accounts associated with each member. Each member of the authentication information peer network may maintain metadata associated with the compromised authentication information such as how the authentication information is utilized creating new accounts being set after compromise has occurred etc. or authentication information structure. In an embodiment an authentication information clearinghouse service that implements an authentication information clearinghouse module may determine patterns or characteristics of compromise based on the metadata that can be utilized to generate recommendations for updating authentication information for one or more of the accounts associated with each member.

In accordance with at least one embodiment the password fraud detection feature may determine and generate frequency of use information for authentication information associated with a plurality of accounts utilize the frequency of use information to determine whether an account should be marked as compromised and take further action based on whether the account is marked as compromised such as implementing security mechanisms as described herein. The frequency of use information or potentially compromised authentication information may be provided to an authentication information management application that maintains authentication information for an account on behalf of a user. The authentication information management application may utilize the received potentially compromised authentication information to take several actions to ensure security of authentication information maintained on behalf of the user. For example the authentication information management application may automatically updating authentication information on behalf of the user when the maintained authentication information is similar to authentication information that has been marked as potentially compromised. The password fraud detection feature may also provide the potentially compromised authentication information to an authentication information clearinghouse service that includes one or more authentication information peer network members. Each member may utilize the potentially compromised authentication information to update accounts maintained by the member and for sharing their own collected potentially compromised authentication information with other peer members.

In accordance with at least one embodiment a user s account account A may request to set the password which may be a change password request or a request to set up an account for the first time associated with account A . The password fraud detection module may receive the request to set the password via a network . As described herein the password fraud detection module may compare the password included in the request to set the password to the passwords included in the frequency of use information to determine if the account A should be marked as potentially compromised.

In the password included in the request may have been Open Sesame. The frequency of use of the password Open Sesame may have recently surpassed the frequency of use of another password not pictured maintained in the frequency of use information . Based on the Open Sesame password included in the request being the same or similar to a password that has surpassed the frequency of use information that is normally associated with the plurality of accounts the password fraud detection module may mark or provide instructions to mark account A as potentially being compromised. In some embodiments if the frequency of use information for password included in the request was not abnormal compared to the normal distribution of passwords or did not surpass the frequency of use for passwords for the plurality of accounts the password fraud detection module will not mark the account as potentially compromised. However the password fraud detection module may update the frequency of use information for passwords based on all incoming password set requests and the password accepted at this time point may be determined at a later time to be an indication that a malicious actor has compromised account A and other accounts and is rapidly changing the passwords on multiple accounts to the same or similar password. Additionally the password fraud detection component may maintain time stamp information indicating when an account s password was changed for retroactive action as described herein.

Thus the password fraud detection feature described herein may provide increased security for passwords as the actor attempting to login with the marked account must provide user authentication information before the login session is allowed by the password fraud detection module . As described herein the password fraud detection module may request user authentication information request that the user answer a CAPTCHA provide an answer to a security question provide a code included in an email verification or any other suitable means for determining the user s identity. The further security step of requesting user authentication information may be provided to a user s account that coincidentally changed their password to a password that is suspicious based on the frequency of use information . However upon the user providing the authentication information the user s login session would be allowed. If however the user s account had been compromised as predicted by the marking or flagging of the account the malicious actor may be limited in the actions they may take with the user s account as their login session would be denied until further verification information could be provided.

The illustrative flow may conclude at by marking the account as potentially compromised based on the access factors included in the set request and the frequency of use information about access factors associated with the plurality of accounts. In an embodiment the password fraud detection service may compare the access factors included in the set request from account to the frequency of use information maintained. The password fraud detection service may be configured to identify if the access factors included in the set request are included similar or identical in a subset of access factors that are exhibiting suspicious behavior such as access factors that have exhibited an increased frequency of use within a time period or displaced the normal distribution of access factors maintained for the plurality of accounts . A subset can comprise as few as one or as many as all or any size set in between one and all. Based on the identification of access factors that are included in the subset of access factors that are exhibiting suspicious behavior the password fraud detection service may mark or provide instructions to mark the account .

Turning to the contents of the memory in more detail and as will be described in further detail in the memory may include an operating system one or more data stores and or one or more application programs or services for implementing the features disclosed herein including a password fraud detection module . The password fraud detection module may be an example of the password fraud detection module and from . Further the service provider computers may be enabled to utilize the password fraud detection module to implement the password fraud detection features described herein such as the password fraud detection service computers from . In accordance with at least one embodiment the password fraud detection module may be configured to receive password set requests compare the password included in the request to a subset of passwords included in frequency of use information about passwords mark the account associated with the request as being potentially compromised based on the comparison of the password to the subset of passwords and provide instructions for requesting user authentication information before granting access to any subsequent login sessions associated with the account as described herein. In accordance with at least one embodiment the password fraud detection module may be configured to provide the frequency of use information to an authentication information management feature or application. The frequency of use information can include the frequency of use for authentication information associated with a plurality of accounts and indicate potentially compromised accounts. The authentication information management feature may utilize the frequency of use information to automatically update change authentication information for a particular user generate and provide a recommendation that the user update the authentication information associated with a particular account or update the authentication information on behalf of the user for an account and notify the user of the update. In accordance with at least one embodiment the frequency of use information may be provided to one or more peer members of a compromised authentication information clearinghouse. An authentication information clearinghouse service that receives or obtains the frequency of use information from the password fraud detection module may determine patterns associated with the frequency of use information for generating recommendations for updating authentication for one or more accounts associated with each member of the peer members.

In accordance with at least one embodiment the frequency of use module may be configured to determine and maintain frequency of use information for passwords associated with a plurality of accounts that utilize the password fraud detection service as described herein. The frequency of use module may keep a running tally or scoreboard of frequency of use information for passwords that are being set by a user for accounts associated with the password fraud detection feature. The frequency of use module may maintain and update the frequency of use information for passwords within a data store such as the data store separate from a data store for the actual password account information stored in data store . The separation of the data stores e.g. storing different information on different storage devices strengthens the security of the protected password data store as the password fraud detection feature described herein may not need to crack or transform the hashes or protected state of the password account information stored in data store in order to determine the frequency of use information for passwords associated with the accounts.

In accordance with at least one embodiment the frequency of use module may be configured to dynamically determine a subset of passwords for comparison to the password included in the set request for an account. For example if the password fraud detection feature is determining whether to flag an account as being potentially compromised the subset of passwords utilized for comparison to the password in question may need to be more inclusive depending on the information gained by accessing the account associated with the password in question or based on the nature of the online activity or web service attached to the account. This may capture more false positives password set requests from users that coincidentally pick a password with abnormally increased frequency of use but ensures a higher security standard for more sensitive information by lowering the threshold required before an account is marked as potentially compromised. If a larger subset is utilized for comparison to the password included in the set request than more accounts may be marked as potentially compromised as do the odds of capturing coincidental changes to a password as opposed to password set requests that are originated by a malicious actor thus maintain a higher security standard. The larger subsets may be utilized for more sensitive information such as payment or shipping information. The opposite may be true as well. For example the subset utilized for comparison may be less inclusive for example a subset of three or fewer passwords based on the frequency of use information when dealing with a service or account that does not protect as sensitive information such as contact information or user preferences. The frequency of use module may be configured to determine the subset utilized in comparison for determining whether to mark an account as potentially being compromised using any of the above mentioned methods in any combination. Further the size of the subset to utilize for comparison may be specified by receiving input from an administrator associated with the password fraud detection feature service.

In accordance with at least one embodiment the frequency of use module may be configured to dynamically determine the time period or threshold utilized for updating the frequency of use information for passwords. For example the time period may be dynamically updated by the frequency of use module according to the type of account associated with the password fraud detection feature. In an embodiment a different time period may exist for accounts associated with a service that utilizes a user s monetary information such as bank account information or credit debit card information then for accounts associated with a service that utilizes a user s contact information such as their email address the type of account may be obtained and maintained by the account parameter module . In some embodiments the frequency of use module may have the time period specified by an administrator associated with the password fraud detection service described herein. In accordance with at least one embodiment the determined time period may be utilized to update the frequency of use information for passwords and for updating the subset of passwords utilized for comparison to a password included in a set request to determine if the associated account should be flagged as being compromised.

In accordance with at least one embodiment the account parameter module may also keep track of statistics or metrics associated with the maintained frequency of use information for passwords. For example the account parameter module may maintain information such as the most frequently used password for a plurality of accounts the least frequently used password for a plurality of accounts a list of frequently used passwords since the creation of the accounts the speed or rate at which each password is gaining in frequency of use total number of unique passwords for the accounts or any other suitable metrics that may be obtained from a plurality of passwords maintained for accounts. In an embodiment the password fraud detection module may utilize the metrics associated with the maintained frequency of use information for passwords for determining whether an account associated with a set request is potentially compromised. For example in addition to comparing the password included in the set request to a subset of passwords included in the frequency of use information for passwords the password may also be compared to one or more passwords that are quickly gaining in frequency of use or displaying an abnormal distribution across the accounts. In an embodiment a threshold speed or rate of increased frequency of use for example going from not being used at all to being used for 100 accounts within milliseconds may be utilized to determine the one or more passwords maintained in the frequency of use information for use in comparison to the password included in the set request to further determine if an account is potentially compromised.

In accordance with at least one embodiment the frequency of use module may utilize security measures to protect the frequency of use information for passwords maintained on the data store . In some embodiments each entry included in the frequency of use information for passwords may be protected by a hashing and salting function as described Protecting Customer Secrets with a Trusted Execution Environment application Ser. No. 13 606 635 which is hereby incorporated by reference. Further encryption methods may be utilized during the hashing function of each entry by utilizing encryption within a trusted execution environment such as a hardware security module prior to storing the entry as described in application Ser. No. 13 606 635. In an embodiment each entry in the frequency of use information for passwords may be protected by decryption within the hardware security module along with token assignment and re encryption within the hardware security module as described in Hardening Tokenization Security and Key Rotation application Ser. No. 12 242 746 which is hereby incorporated by reference. Utilizing decryption within a hardware security module as described in application Ser. No. 12 242 746 can ensure transformation to a clear text which may aid in the determination of whether the password included in the set request is similar to a password included in the subset of popular passwords as described herein. Additionally the token may describe the type of data the clear text embodies such as a password for a specific account. Each entry in the frequency of use information for passwords may also be protected by utilizing any suitable one way function encryption. In an embodiment additional security measures may be employed for each data store including data store which aids in maintaining the frequency of use information for passwords.

In accordance with at least one embodiment the password fraud detection module may be configured to compare the password included in the set request to a subset of passwords included in the frequency of use information for passwords to determine if an account should be marked flagged as potentially compromised. In some embodiments the password included in the set request may be an exact match to a password included in the subset before a flag instruction is provided. In accordance with at least one embodiment different comparison variations may be utilized to determine if the password included in the set request is similar to a password included in the subset or among the passwords that are quickly gaining in frequency of use for accounts. For example a string comparison may be utilized to compare passwords for similarity with different thresholds of similarity triggering the determination to flag an account. The thresholds of similarity can be determined by the frequency of use module using similar attributes as described above behavior of services nature of transactions etc. determined by the account parameter module . A logical exclusive OR operation can be utilized for comparing the passwords to determine similarity.

Approximation techniques may also be utilized to determine similarity. For example the password fraud detection module may utilize a percentage sub string match to determine out of N characters how many are similar. The nature of the service the information protected by the account in question or other suitable factors may be utilized to determine the percentage of similar characters between the passwords to determine similarity and flag an account as compromised as maintained by the account parameter module . In accordance with at least one embodiment the password fraud detection module may communicate via the communication module with an electronic marketplace or with the service hosting the account in question to obtain information about the account to aid in determining whether to flag an account as potentially compromised. For example if a fifty percent match occurs during a sub string comparison the password fraud detection module may attempt to obtain additional information about the account such as recent purchases that are not similar to other purchases for the account changes or additions in shipping information as an additional factor in determining whether the account should be flagged as potentially compromised.

Any suitable percentage of sub string match may be utilized in the present disclosure before additional account information may be obtained for determining whether to flag an account as compromised or not. For example depending on the nature of the account any percentage greater than zero may trigger the password fraud detection module obtaining additional account information to utilize in its determination of whether to flag an account for further investigation. The password fraud detection module may compare the password included in the set request to a subset of passwords included in the frequency of use information for passwords for similarity or exact match as described above to determine whether to flag an account as potentially compromised. If the password included in the set request is similar exact to a password included in the subset or to a password that is quickly gaining in frequency of use the account may be flagged as potentially compromised and further actions may be taken before the account may be accessed and utilized. In accordance with at least one embodiment the password fraud detection module may generate and provide a notification indicating that the account has been marked as potentially being compromised. The notification may be provided to the account via the communication module and may take the form of an email a short message service SMS text message an application driven message such as a message provided via the service that the account is associated with or any other suitable digital communication channel.

In accordance with at least one embodiment the communication module and the authentication module may be configured to implement security measures or account verifications necessary before an account can be utilized or accessed after it has been flagged. The authentication module may be configured to request user authentication from an account that is attempting to change the password for a flagged account or login in utilizing a flagged account. For example the authentication module may generate and provide CAPTCHAs verification emails security questions or use any suitable verification techniques before access to the account or updates to the account may be granted for a flagged account. The communication module may aid the authentication module in providing and receiving input regarding the user authentication information.

In accordance with at least one embodiment the password fraud detection module may provide password fraud detection for accounts that had their password changed to a password included in the frequency of use information for passwords maintained by module before the password was included in a subset of password that are potentially compromised based on their frequency of use. This feature can help capture accounts that were compromised and had their password set to a password that at the time was not popular enough to warrant flagging the account as potentially compromised but later on would share a password with the a password that is exhibiting increased frequency of use that is abnormal or reflects an abnormal distribution of usage when compared to the usual distribution of passwords associated with the accounts. The password fraud detection module may be configured for determining and assigning a score for a password during a set request. The score may be based on a comparison of the password included in the request to the current frequency of use information for passwords maintained by module . The score or security score may reflect the strength of the password included in the request given the information obtained from the frequency of use information for passwords associated with a plurality of accounts. For example a low security score may reflect that the password included in the request is not unique and an exact match to or similar to a password exhibiting unusual increased frequency of use as determined by the frequency of use module . On the other hand a high security score may reflect that the password is unique and not similar to any passwords included in the frequency of use information for passwords.

As described above the score may be calculated each time a user sets a password associated with an account that utilizes the password fraud detection feature described herein. Additionally the score may be updated based on the dynamic nature of the frequency of use information for passwords. This can help capture passwords that during initial account creation do not indicate a compromised account but after more information is obtained from other accounts the password would indicate that the account may be compromised.

The illustrative environment includes at least one application server and a data store . It should be understood that there can be several application servers layers or other elements processes or components which may be chained or otherwise configured which can interact to perform tasks such as obtaining data from an appropriate data store. As used herein the term data store refers to any device or combination of devices capable of storing accessing and retrieving data which may include any combination and number of data servers databases data storage devices and data storage media in any standard distributed or clustered environment. The application server can include any appropriate hardware and software for integrating with the data store as needed to execute aspects of one or more applications for the client device handling a majority of the data access and business logic for an application. The application server provides access control services in cooperation with the data store and is able to generate content such as text graphics audio and or video to be transferred to the user which may be served to the user by the Web server in the form of HyperText Markup Language HTML Extensible Markup Language XML or another appropriate structured language in this example. The handling of all requests and responses as well as the delivery of content between the client device and the application server can be handled by the Web server. It should be understood that the Web and application servers are not required and are merely example components as structured code discussed herein can be executed on any appropriate device or host machine as discussed elsewhere herein.

The data store can include several separate data tables databases or other data storage mechanisms and media for storing data relating to a particular aspect. For example the data store illustrated includes mechanisms for storing production data and user information which can be used to serve content for the production side. The data store also is shown to include a mechanism for storing log data which can be used for reporting analysis or other such purposes. It should be understood that there can be many other aspects that may need to be stored in the data store such as for page image information and to access right information which can be stored in any of the above listed mechanisms as appropriate or in additional mechanisms in the data store . The data store is operable through logic associated therewith to receive instructions from the application server and obtain update or otherwise process data in response thereto. In one example a user might submit a search request for a certain type of item. In this case the data store might access the user information to verify the identity of the user and can access the catalog detail information to obtain information about items of that type. The information then can be returned to the user such as in a results listing on a Web page that the user is able to view via a browser on the user device . Information for a particular item of interest can be viewed in a dedicated page or window of the browser.
