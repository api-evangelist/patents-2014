In avalanche photodiodes or photodetectors incoming light is used to generate carriers i.e. free electrons or holes . Semiconductor materials are selected for photodiodes based upon the wavelength range of the radiation that is desired to be utilized or detected. Group III nitride avalanche detectors can presumably be widely functional between 1900 nm and 200 nm i.e. infrared to ultraviolet radiation . Generally the binary alloys utilized in such semiconductor devices are Indium Nitride bandgap of 0.65 eV corresponding to approximately 1900 nm Gallium Nitride band gap of 3.4 eV corresponding to approximately 365 nm and Aluminum Nitride bandgap of 6.1 eV corresponding to approximately 200 nm . By varying the relative mole fractions of these binaries ternary or quaternary alloys may be composed that can achieve radiation absorption at intermediate wavelengths to the stated values.

III Nitride semiconductors are commonly grown in the wurtzite crystal structure and are therefore a polar semiconductor as discussed by Ambacher in O. Ambacher Growth and Applications of Group III Nitrides J. Phys. D Appl. Phys. 31 1998 2653 2710 herein incorporated by reference as though fully rewritten herein.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 326 654 to Ruden hereinafter Ruden 654 hereby incorporated by reference entitled A Hybrid Ultraviolet Detector discloses a semiconductor material avalanche photodiode photodetector. The detector of Ruden 654 is an avalanche photodetector comprised of a group III nitride semiconductor material such as aluminum gallium nitride AlGaN serving as a photon to charge carrier transducer and an avalanche charge carrier multiplication region comprised of different semiconductor materials such as silicon see abstract .

Deep ultraviolet DUV photodetectors sensitive at wavelengths shorter than 260 nm are useful in numerous medical and military applications including chemical and biological identification and non line of sight communications. Often these applications require very low light level or single photon detection and as a result photomultiplier tubes PMTs are widely used. However in addition to being large and fragile photomultiplier tubes require the use of expensive filters to limit the bandwidth of detection. Therefore a need remains for low cost compact high sensitivity devices that offer a narrow and tunable bandwidth. Silicon Carbide SiC has emerged as an attractive candidate for DUV pin and avalanche photodetectors APDs due to their very low dark currents small k factor and high gain. Previously demonstrated APDs exhibit peak quantum efficiency QE of 60 at 268 nm and gain values reaching over 1000. Despite this success SiC is still characterized by poor responsivity below 260 nm and a long absorption tail out to 380 nm. The deep ultraviolet response in pin detectors is hindered by the absorption of high energy photons in the heavily doped surface layer p or n type where photo generated carriers are trapped by surface states or recombine due to the short diffusion length of minority carriers. The long wavelength tail results from weak absorption associated with the indirect bandgap of 4H SiC at 3.23 eV.

The preferred embodiment of may be for example a III Nitride SiC nip structure comprising a p type semiconductor metal contact region or layer which may be for example a 2 m thick p SiC layer doped 2 10cm an absorption multiplication region or layer which may be for example a 350 nm thick n SiC layer lightly doped n type 5 10cm a transparent barrier region or layer which may be for example a 120 nm thick AlN layer a transparent window layer or region which may be for example a 50 nm thick AlGaN layer and a region suitable for forming an n metal contact which may be for example a 50 nm thick n AlGaN layer. The thickness of barrier region or layer may be as thin as 5 nm. The region or layer is predominantly transparent to photons of interest for conversion in that these photons are generally not converted to electrons and holes in region or layer . The SiC epitaxial layers or regions may be grown on n type Si face 4H SiC substrate . The III polar AlGaN epitaxial layers or regions may be heteroepitaxially grown by plasma assisted molecular beam epitaxy at 780 C. directly upon the SiC epitaxial layers or regions. The two AlGaN layers or regions and may be combined into a single layer and may be fully strained to the AlN region which is relaxed as determined by high resolution x ray diffraction. Epilayers were fabricated into 250 m diameter circular mesas with seven degree beveled sidewalls. The n AlGaN Ohmic contact comprises of a stack comprising Ti 10 nm Al 100 nm Ni 30 nm Au 50 nm metallization scheme while the p SiC Ohmic contact consists of Ni 25 nm Ti 35 nm Al 100 nm Ni 80 nm. The contacts and are similar to element number in the U.S. Pat. No. 8 269 223 herein incorporated by reference. The selection of metals for the contact layer depend upon metal work function adhesion as well as impurity diffusion considerations. There are a number of Ohmic contacts schemes to n AlGaN and p SiC reported in the literature. The stacks that may be used are commonly employed. The constraint is that the contacts make a low resistance Ohmic contact in contrast to a Schottky contact.

The semiconductor absorption multiplication region which may be designated as a first region barrier region or layer which may be designated as a second region and the third region each have a total polarization P P and P respectively. In accordance with the principles of the present invention the magnitude of the total polarization of the barrier region having a polarization magnitude P defined in terms of absolute value that is greater than either of the magnitudes of the total polarizations of the absorption multiplication region which has a total polarization of P or the transparent region which has a total polarization of P. This results in interface charge densities due to the discontinuity in polarization at the heterointerfaces between regions and that enable a large electrostatic potential barrier and therefore a large electric field across region that suppresses the collection of photogenerated carriers excited to the lower energy band gaps of region . As a result this structure eliminates or reduces the requirement for an optical filter for tuning the bandwidth of the photodetector near the lower energy band gaps of absorption multiplication region.

It is important to note that the dipole strength and energy barrier presented for carrier transport by the barrier layer is dependent on the net total charge at the heterointerfaces between the barrier layer and the absorption multiplication layer as well as interface between the barrier layer and the n metal contact layer or and the doping of these layers may be used to further modify the dipole strength and energy barrier. Specifically the introduction of ionized acceptor impurities at the heterointerface between the barrier layer and the absorption multiplication layer or ionized donor impurities at the heterointerface between the barrier layer and the n metal contact layer or may be used to reduce the net total charge at either of these interfaces and therefore reduce the dipole strength and energy barrier. Conversely the introduction of ionized donor impurities at the heterointerface between the barrier layer and the absorption multiplication layer or ionized acceptor impurities at the heterointerface between the barrier layer and the n metal contact layer or may be used to increase the net total charge at either of these interfaces and therefore increase the dipole strength and electrostatic potential barrier. By adjusting the charge the height in terms of energy needed to surmount it of the electrostatic potential barrier may be adjusted.

By using a transparent layer or region comprising AlGaN in conjunction with the preferred embodiment shown in the short wavelength cutoff of AlGaN can be tuned from 365 to 200 nm.

An alternative preferred embodiment assembly is illustrated in . The preferred embodiment comprises a p metal contact layer or region which may be positioned or formed on a substrate such as a bulk SiC substrate. The absorption multiplication region or layer is formed on the p metal contact layer as shown in . Barrier layer or region is formed on region and N metal contact layer or region is formed on the barrier region . As illustrated in the magnitude of the total polarization P of the barrier region which may be denoted as the second region is greater than the magnitude of the polarization of either of the regions P which may be denoted as the first region or P which may be denoted as the third region . The interface charge densities that arise due to the discontinuity in polarization at the interfaces between regions and with respect to barrier region enable a large electrostatic potential barrier and therefore a large electric field across barrier region that suppresses the collection of photogenerated carriers excited to the lower energy band gaps of absorption multiplication region as depicted in general by the band diagram shown in .

Material selection for the regions and may include any semiconductor materials for which the conditions P P and P are satisfied. That is the magnitude of the polarization of the barrier region is greater than the magnitude of the polarization of the n metal contact layer and the absorption multiplication region . For example the regions could be alloys of AlGaN where different amounts of aluminum are used to regulate the magnitude of polarization. Other examples are magnesium zinc oxide aluminum gallium arsenide indium gallium arsenide and indium gallium nitride. A further example is where the P material is chosen as silicon and the P and P regions aluminum gallium nitride. The electrostatic potential energy barrier in barrier region is significantly enhanced by the dipole formed by the fixed interface polarization charge induced by the difference in polarization between the barrier region and the absorption multiplication and n contact regions. As is known without a barrier holes migrate to the p contact and electrons migrate to the n contact. The barrier region in prevents hole transport and collection from the AlGaN layer in in . High energy photogenerated electrons in the SiC absorption multiplication region can traverse the barrier region and be collected in the n metal contact region in . Lower energy photogenerated electrons in SiC absorption multiplication region cannot traverse the barrier layer so those carriers are not collected. As a result long wavelength photoresponse is suppressed without using an optical filter.

The employment of polarization induced charge densities arising from the difference in polarization between the barrier layer and the surrounding regions results in significant suppression of long wavelength response in the device without requiring an optical filter. As shown in the band diagram of the barrier region of a Group III Nitride material which in this case is AlN creates a barrier for the transport of electrons excited to the L and M conduction bands of the absorption multiplication region which in this case is SiC shown to the left of . When referring to the polarization of the regions and the polarizations are compared using the Scalar Projections S S S which are defined as the absolute values of the magnitudes of the polarizations P P P times the cosine of the angle between the direction of the polarizations and the growth direction. In a positive polarization charge is formed at the interface of the material where S

The embodiment of incorporating a transparent window is preferred in that with reference to the distance over which the potential is dropped within the n contact region can be modified by adjusting the doping profile within the extended n contact region or transparent region . In the embodiment of the doping on the transparent region adjacent to the AlN barrier region has been reduced. Reduction of the doping in the region adjacent to the barrier region is represented by . If the doping was high throughout the n contact layer as in the case of a much sharper drop in potential would occur in this layer leading to a larger electric field that may be desirable in some instances.

The preferred embodiments of the present invention shown in comprise a heterogeneous n III Nitride i p SiC structure operable to extend the deep ultraviolet DUV response of SiC below 260 nm while suppressing the long wavelength response. Since the direct bandgap of aluminum gallium nitride AlGaN can be engineered from 3.4 eV to 6.1 eV depending on the AlN to GaN mole fraction these alloys are employed as UV transparent n type contact windows for example the transparent windows and in to increase the collection of carriers created by absorption of high energy photons in the high electric field depletion region of the nip structure. As described in the following photo generated carriers in the AlGaN windows do not contribute to photoresponse and can therefore be used to adjust the high energy cutoff wavelength of this device.

In order to suppress the long wavelength response of SiC between 260 nm and 380 nm the preferred embodiments and of respectively utilize polarization charge densities induced at the interfaces using a barrier region to create a large barrier to transport and allow only electrons excited by high energy photons to higher energy bands within the SiC region to be collected. Further utilizing a transparent window in the embodiment of this transparent window and electron filter barrier facilitate the fabrication of high responsivity narrow bandwidth detectors in which the spectral response can be adjusted though the window and barrier properties.

Note that the barrier region functions in a manner different from the interface charge control layer disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 8 269 223 223 Patent . As shown in FIG. 24 of the 223 Patent an AlGaN interface charge control layer ICCL 5F operates to improve the transport of holes generated in the GaN UID layer into the 480 nm SiC UID layer. Note further that in the 223 Patent the thickness of interface charge control layer is much thinner than the thickness of barrier region of the embodiments shown in herein. The reduced thickness in the 223 Patent results in conduction and valence band bending associated with the formation of a dipole over a very short distance. As a result this facilitates the transfer of holes from the GaN absorption region to the SiC multiplication region in the heterogeneous GaN SiC separate absorption and multiplication SAM APD and was called a nitride interface charge control layer ICCL see 223 Patent for details . The coinventors have now theoretically found that this only occurs if the thickness of the AlN region is less than 5 nm at thicknesses greater than that the barrier created by the dipole will prevent photogenerated holes in the GaN UID from being collected in the SiC UID layer. In comparison to U.S. Pat. No. 8 269 223 the thickness of AlN is about one percent of the thickness of the barrier region . Thickness reduction results in band bending over a very short distance 1 nm that facilitates tunneling of holes from the GaN absorption region to the SiC multiplication region. In the GaN SiC structure disclosed in the 223 patent the photoresponse is primarily associated with hole injection to the p contact layer. In preferred embodiments of the AlN barrier region is sufficiently thick so that the hole transport from the n contact layer or transparent AlGaN region to the absorption multiplication region is blocked. However the barrier in the conduction band allows the transport of high energy photogenerated electrons in the SiC region to cross into the III Nitride region while simultaneously suppressing the collection of electrons generated by lower energy photons in SiC associated with wavelengths between 260 380 nm.

The origins of the observed spectral response can be understood by considering the influence of the AlN barrier region . shows an illustration of the band alignment between the direct E and indirect E L E M conduction band valleys of 4H SiC and the direct valley of the III Nitride region at zero bias under UV illumination. For the solid lines shown in the central portion of this illustrates the case where lowest conduction band of SiC is in alignment with AlN. The transition energy between the M L and valleys of SiC was assumed to be 3.25 eV 4 eV and 5 eV respectively as provided by the Ioffe Physico Technical Institute. It should be noted there is some uncertainty in these values especially for the transition which may lie between 5 6 eV.

At zero bias there is a large field generated in the AlN region as a result of the positive polarization induced interface charge at the SiC AlN interface and negative polarization induced interface charge at the AlN AlGaN interface. This field combined with the difference in bandgap creates a large interface barrier which impedes the injection of holes from AlGaN to SiC and electrons from SiC to AlGaN depending upon the energy of the conduction band valley into which the electrons are photoexcited. As shown in under optical excitation photogenerated holes in AlGaN accumulate at the AlN AlGaN interface forming a 2 dimensional hole gas 2 DHG and electrons in the lower M and L valleys of SiC accumulate at the SiC AlN interface forming a 2 dimensional electron gas 2 DEG . These accumulated charges partially cancel the polarization charge at each interface and reduce the overall barrier height. Photogenerated holes in the AlGaN region are still unable to overcome this barrier and therefore no response from AlGaN is observed as evidenced by the high energy cutoff in the photoresponse shown in that corresponds to absorption in this layer. Likewise there is approximately a 2 eV barrier between the M valley of 4H SiC and AlN which impedes electron injection across the interface leading to a suppressed long wavelength response from SiC. On the other hand this barrier has a minimal impact on the transport of electrons excited to the valley across the interface and therefore these carriers are collected as illustrated by the lightly shaded electrons in . The presence of the 226 nm peak in both the DC and modulated measurements at zero bias is therefore likely due to the direct collection of carriers excited to the valley. This conclusion is supported by the lack of phase delay in the modulated photoresponse at wavelengths shorter than 226 nm which indicates that the signal experiences no time delay associated with the accumulation of carriers at the interface. Due to the large electric field in the SiC region it is expected that the carriers in the valley are hot when they reach the barrier and are able to overcome it without difficulty. It is interesting to note that the reported hot electron energy relaxation time in 4H SiC is about 2.5 psec. Using a saturation velocity of 2 10cm sec for electrons in SiC the calculated average time for an electron to reach the SiC AlN interface is about 1.7 psec. Considering the strong absorption due to the transition most carriers excited at 226 nm are likely generated within 1 cm of the SiC AlN interface and therefore the average time may be even shorter. However since the QE measured in this work at 226 nm is only 20 considerably lower than expected the hot electron energy relaxation time in the valley might be even shorter than 2.5 psec.

As indicated in increasing the reverse bias voltage increases decreases the electric field in the SiC AlN region thus lowering the barrier for carrier injection across the interface. The field is increased in the SiC region and decreased in the AlN region. Although reduced the barrier continues to impede photo generated holes in the AlGaN layer. However as indicated by the redshift shifting to a longer wavelength in the DC photoresponse hot electrons in lower energy bands of SiC are able to overcome the barrier and be collected. The peak QE of 76 at 40 V is almost double that of typical SiC pin diodes which exhibit approximately 40 QE at 242 nm under unity gain. This enhanced DUV response is not due to photoconductive gain since the operation of this device relies on the accumulation of both holes and electrons at the interface to lower the barrier. In the modulated measurement at large reverse bias voltages the long wavelength response experiences a 50 degree phase delay as compared to the 226 nm peak and can be attributed to the charge accumulation process discussed previously. Considering the spontaneous polarization charge density of 5 10C cmand the photogenerated current density of 3 10A cmat optical power of 100 nW and wavelength of 242 nm the phase delay in these measurements is reasonable. The 226 nm peak exhibits no bias dependence in DC or modulated measurements indicating that this signal is due to the collection of carriers directly from the valley and not from carriers that have relaxed from the valley to lower energies. Collection of relaxed carriers would likely have a bias dependence based on the lowering of the barrier. The negative quadrature component at 228 nm represents the on set of the interaction with the barrier and is due to hot electrons in the bottom of the valley able to tunnel through the barrier. As a result this signal does experience a phase delay and is bias dependent. This further indicates that the collection of electrons leading to the 242 nm peak are from the lower energy L valley. At low bias voltages these carriers are impeded by the barrier and therefore their contribution to the photoresponse is suppressed while at large bias voltages these carriers are delayed as compared to the 226 nm signal due to interaction with the barrier. Although not shown here increasing the power of the optical illumination results in a reduced phase lag of the long wavelength signal due to a faster barrier lowering process.

The use of AlGaN alloys as a transparent n type window increases the collection of electrons created by absorption of high energy photons in the high field n SiC region. Peak QE of 76 at 242 nm has been measured and attributed to the minimization of the effects of surface states and absorption in heavily doped layers currently hindering homogeneous SiC devices. Utilizing the large polarization induced interface charges in these material systems to create a barrier at the interface has been demonstrated to filter the long wavelength response by prohibiting collection of carriers from the M valley of SiC. Adjusting the field in the barrier region through the difference in polarization and thickness adds further control over the long wavelength cutoff and also voltage response.

Referring now to some of the material layers forming the photodetector are generally formed of atoms from Groups II and VI or Groups III and V. In the materials are referred to as being Group II or III polar or Group V or VI polar. For Group V or Group VI polar the surface is terminated with Group V or Group VI atoms and the polarization P is towards the surface. For Group II or Group III polar the surface is terminated with Group II or Group III atoms and the polarization P is towards the substrate. part a is a schematic illustration of a crystal structure in which the growth direction and the polarization vector are in the opposite direction.

The left side of is a schematic illustration of the portions of the embodiments of which have a determinative polarization component to enable the creation of the electrostatic potential barrier formed of Group III or Group II polar materials.

The left side of is directed preferred embodiments in which the P type layer is grown closest to the substrate. The right side of is directed preferred embodiments in which the N type layer is grown closest to the substrate. Referring to the case of the P type layer grown closest to the substrate for Group III or Group II polar materials to enable the creation of the electrostatic potential barrier the absolute value of the polarization P which correlates to the barrier regions in must be greater than the absolute value of the polarization P which correlates to the absorption multiplication region and the absolute value of the polarization P which correlates to the region in and region in taken individually. The scalar projection S of the region must be less than zero and must be less than the scalar projections S correlating to region and S which correlates to the region in and region in taken individually.

As an example referring to the preferred embodiment p SiC i SiC AlN AlGaN structure of P P P where P is the polarization in AlN barrier region P is the polarization in AlGaN transparent window region P is the polarization in SiC multiplication absorption region and theta 180 degrees which applies to group III polar materials. Hence the cosine is equal to 1 and this implies that S P S P S P and since larger negative numbers are smaller than smaller negative numbers S

With reference to the right side of referring to the case of the N type layer grown closest to the substrate for Group III or Group II polar materials to enable the creation of the electrostatic potential barrier the absolute value of the polarization P which correlates to the barrier regions in must be less than the absolute value of the polarization P which correlates to the absorption multiplication region and the absolute value of the polarization P which correlates to the region in taken individually. The scalar projection Sof the region must be less than zero and must be greater than the scalar projections S correlating to region and S which correlates to the region in taken individually.

With reference to the right side of the alternate preferred embodiment of may be for example a III Nitride ZnO pin structure grown on bulk ZnO substrate comprising a n type semiconductor metal contact region or layer which may be for example a 2 m thick n ZnO layer doped 2 10cm an absorption multiplication region or layer which may be for example a 350 nm thick n ZnO layer lightly doped n type 5 10cm a transparent barrier region or layer which may be for example a 120 nm thick AlGaN layer and a transparent window region suitable for forming a p metal contact which may be for example a 50 nm thick p AlGaN layer. The thickness of barrier region or layer may be as thin as 5 nm. The region or layer is predominantly transparent to photons of interest for conversion in that these photons are generally not converted to electrons and holes in region or layer . The ZnO epitaxial layers or regions may be grown on n type Zn face ZnO substrate . The III polar AlGaN epitaxial layers or regions may be heteroepitaxially grown by plasma assisted molecular beam epitaxy at 780 C. directly upon the ZnO epitaxial layers or regions. Epilayers can be fabricated into for example 250 m diameter circular mesas with seven degree beveled sidewalls. The p AlGaN Ohmic contact comprises of a stack comprising 30 nm Ni 100 nm Au metallization scheme while the n ZnO Ohmic contact consists of 30 nm Ta 20 nm Au. The selection of metals for the contact layer depend upon metal work function adhesion as well as impurity diffusion considerations. There are a number of Ohmic contacts schemes to p AlGaN and n ZnO reported in the literature. The stacks that may be used are commonly employed. The constraint is that the contacts make a low resistance Ohmic contact in contrast to a Schottky contact.

In this case the preferred embodiment acts as a barrier for hole transport from the lower valleys in the valence band and therefore as a hole filter rather than an electron filter because it passes higher energy holes or holes in higher energy valleys created by higher energy photons in the multiplication absorption region thereby operating to define a predetermined wavelength range of the photodetector.

With reference to the left side of the alternate preferred embodiment of may be for example a III Nitride ZnO nip structure grown on bulk ZnO substrate comprising a p type semiconductor metal contact region or layer which may be for example a 2 m thick p ZnO layer doped 2 10cm an absorption multiplication region or layer which may be for example a 350 nm thick p ZnO layer lightly doped p type 5 10cm a transparent barrier region or layer which may be for example a 120 nm thick AlGaN layer and a transparent window region suitable for forming a n metal contact which may be for example a 50 nm thick n AlGaN layer.

The selection of metals for the contact layer depend upon metal work function adhesion as well as impurity diffusion considerations.

With reference to the right side of referring to the case of the N type layer grown closest to the substrate for Group V or Group VI polar materials to enable the creation of the electrostatic potential barrier the absolute value of the polarization P which correlates to the barrier region in must be greater than the polarization P which correlates to the absorption multiplication region and the polarization P which correlates to the region in taken individually. The scalar projection Sof the region must be greater than zero and must be greater than the scalar projections S correlating to region and S which correlates to the region in taken individually.

Although only one mesa is illustrated in a group of mesas that form an array could be interconnected and used together. Using the teaching shown in conjunction with one of ordinary skill in the art could create an array of mesas in which case each mesa could produce a single pixel in an image array.

Optionally the entire assembly with the exception of the metal contact areas is covered with a layer of SiO deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition PECVD .

It is important to note that the suppression observed in the response between 260 380 nm is associated with the energy band structure associated with the M and L valleys of SiC. The preferred embodiments of can be used to detect light in the solar blind region that is normally considered to be less than 280 nm at low elevations. Using different materials as an absorption multiplication region will allow the fabrication of detectors that are sensitive with different bandwidths associated with suppression of the collection of photogenerated carriers that is related to their particular band structure. For example detectors may be fabricated using an absorption multiplication region comprised of Zinc Oxide or Magnesium Zinc Oxide by employing a barrier layer of suitable total polarization see .

It is important to note that the absorption multiplication regions or layers and may be composed of a single layer or a number of layers that may spatially separate absorption and multiplication or modify electric field distribution within the region.

Potential usages of the preferred embodiments of the present invention include replacing the photomultiplier tube PMT within compact biological agent identification systems based on fluorescence free Raman spectroscopy employing these detectors within water monitoring systems replacing UV enhanced Si avalanche photodiodes within sniper fire weaponry detections systems replacing PMTs and UV enhanced Si avalanche photodiodes in UV communications systems. Solar blind ultraviolet detectors are useful for bioagent detection identification systems for hospitals and commercial HVAC systems as well as compact water quality monitoring systems for disaster relief workers and outdoor enthusiasts.

Currently system designers requiring high sensitivity and low noise UV detectors for spectroscopy and single photon counting have the option of employing PMTs or UV enhanced Si APDs. Generally speaking PMTs have significant shortcomings including high cost bulky packaging requiring high voltage for operation 1000 V and cooling for high sensitivity. UV enhanced Si APDs can provide high gain but can have high dark current and significant long wavelength response that can make them suboptimal for certain applications. SiC APDs are still in the developmental stage but they can have high gain and very low dark current. However these devices exhibit low quantum efficiencies at long wavelength approaching the band gap 380 nm because of poor absorption due to the indirect band gap of SiC. Most of these detectors are inherently broad band thus expensive optical filtering is often required to narrow the spectral response to a desired band such a solar blind or visible blind. Operation in the solar blind region is useful for imaging detecting human generated phenomena against a solar background. These devices are critical for developing systems for sniper fire detection UV communications biological chemical agent identification and detection and water quality monitoring.

In contrast the preferred embodiments of the present invention utilize a novel approach to provide a long wavelength cut off to the photoresponse of a photodetector that leverages the polarization interface charge that occurs at the heterointerfaces between materials with different polarity. By inserting an appropriate barrier layer within the photodetector design the long wavelength response can be significantly suppressed. One embodiment of particular military and commercial interest is the development of solar blind or visible blind detectors with no or greatly reduced optical filter requirements. A solar blind AlGaN AlN SiC Electron Filter Photodetector EFP illustrated schematically in has been demonstrated that has significant cut off of long wavelength response at 260 nm. These devices are attractive as a replacement for PMTs and UV enhanced Si APDs for system designers because of 1 lower cost an AlGaN AlN SiC EFP can be produced at significantly lower cost than PMTs 2 room temperature operation An AlGaN AlN SiC EFP can be operated at room temperature while PMTs often require thermoelectric cooling depending upon the sensitivity required and 3 Fragility PMTs require the cathode detection material and dynode gain medium to be encased within a vacuum sealed tube. This packaging is inherently more fragile than that employed for semiconductor based detectors 4 Solar Visible blind detection An AlGaN AlN SiC EFP can be made inherently visible solar blind by tuning the relative AlN InN and GaN compositions of the III Nitride barrier and contact layers. In contrast UV enhanced Si APDs require external filters that can be costly depending upon the level of rejection required. AlGaN AlN SiC EFPs shown schematically in exhibit peak unity gain quantum efficiency QE of 76 at 242 nm that is significantly higher than what is observed for conventional homogeneous SiC pin photodiodes and a long wavelength cut off at 260 nm.
