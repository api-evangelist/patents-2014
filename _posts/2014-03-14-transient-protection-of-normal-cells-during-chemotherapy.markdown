The entirety of each of these applications is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes.

The U.S. Government has rights in this invention by virtue of support under Grant No. 5R44AI084284 awarded by the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease.

This invention is in the area of improved compounds compositions and methods of transiently protecting healthy cells and in particular hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells HSPC as well as renal cells from damage associated with DNA damaging chemotherapeutic agents. In one aspect improved protection of healthy cells is disclosed using disclosed compounds that act as highly selective and short transiently acting cyclin dependent kinase 4 6 CDK 4 6 inhibitors when administered to subjects undergoing DNA damaging chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of proliferative disorders.

Chemotherapy refers to the use of cytotoxic typically DNA damaging drugs to treat a range of proliferative disorders including cancer tumors psoriasis arthritis lupus and multiple sclerosis among others. Chemotherapeutic compounds tend to be non specific and particularly at high doses toxic to normal rapidly dividing cells. This often leads to a variety of side effects in patients undergoing chemotherapy.

Bone marrow suppression a severe reduction of blood cell production in bone marrow is one such side effect. It is characterized by both myelosuppression anemia neutropenia agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia. Neutropenia is characterized by a selective decrease in the number of circulating neutrophils and an enhanced susceptibility to bacterial infections. Anemia a reduction in the number of red blood cells or erythrocytes the quantity of hemoglobin or the volume of packed red blood cells characterized by a determination of the hematocrit affects approximately 67 of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy in the United States. See BioWorld Today page 4 Jul. 23 2002. Thrombocytopenia is a reduction in platelet number with increased susceptibility to bleeding. Lymphopenia is a common side effect of chemotherapy characterized by a reduction in the number of circulating lymphocytes also called T and B cells . Lymphopenic patients are predisposed to a number of types of infections.

Myelosuppression continues to represent the major dose limiting toxicity of cancer chemotherapy resulting in considerable morbidity along with the potential need to require a reduction in chemotherapy dose intensity which may compromise disease control and survival. Considerable evidence from prospective and retrospective randomized clinical trials clearly shows that chemotherapy induced myelosuppression compromises long term disease control and survival Lyman G. H. Chemotherapy dose intensity and quality cancer care Oncology Williston Park 2006. 20 14 Suppl 9 p. 16 25 . Furthermore treatment regimens for for example lung breast and colorectal cancer recommended in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines are increasingly associated with significant myelosuppression yet are increasingly recommended for treating early stage disease as well as advanced stage or metastatic disease Smith R. E. Trends in recommendations for myelosuppressive chemotherapy for the treatment of solid tumors. J Natl Compr Canc Netw 2006. 4 7 p. 649 58 . This trend toward more intensive treatment of patients with cancer creates demand for improved measures to minimize the risk of myelosuppression and complications while optimizing the relative dose intensity.

In addition to bone marrow suppression chemotherapeutic agents can adversely affect other healthy cells such as renal epithelial cells resulting potentially in the development of acute kidney injury due to the death of the tubular epithelia. Acute kidney injury can lead to chronic kidney disease multi organ failure sepsis and death.

One mechanism to minimize myelosuppression nephrotoxicity and other chemotherapeutic cytotoxicities is to reduce the planned dose intensity of chemotherapies. Dose reductions or cycle delays however diminish the effectiveness and ultimately compromise long term disease control and survival.

Small molecules have been used to reduce some of the side effects of certain chemotherapeutic compounds. For example leukovorin has been used to mitigate the effects of methotrexate on bone marrow cells and on gastrointestinal mucosa cells. Amifostine has been used to reduce the incidence of neutropenia related fever and mucositis in patients receiving alkylating or platinum containing chemotherapeutics. Also dexrazoxane has been used to provide cardioprotection from anthracycline anti cancer compounds. Unfortunately there is concern that many chemoprotectants such as dexrazoxane and amifostine can decrease the efficacy of chemotherapy given concomitantly.

Additional chemoprotectant therapies particularly with chemotherapy associated anemia and neutropenia include the use of growth factors. Hematopoietic growth factors are available on the market as recombinant proteins. These proteins include granulocyte colony stimulating factor G CSF and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor GM CSF and their derivatives for the treatment of neutropenia and erythropoietin EPO and its derivatives for the treatment of anemia. However these recombinant proteins are expensive. Moreover EPO has significant toxicity in cancer patients leading to increased thrombosis relapse and death in several large randomized trials. G CSF and GM CSF may increase the late 2 years post therapy risk of secondary bone marrow disorders such as leukemia and myelodysplasia. Consequently their use is restricted and not readily available any more to all patients in need.

Further while growth factors can hasten recovery of some blood cell lineages no therapy exists to treat suppression of platelets macrophages T cells or B cells.

Roberts et al in 2012 reported that Pfizer compound PD 0332991 induced a transient cell cycle arrest in CDK4 6 dependent subsets of healthy cells such as HSPCs see Roberts et al. Multiple Roles of Cyclin Dependent Kinase 4 6 Inhibitors in Cancer Therapy. JNCI 2012 104 6 476 487 . This compound is currently being tested by Pfizer in clinical trials as an anti neoplastic agent against estrogen positive HER2 negative breast cancer.

Hematopoietic stem cells give rise to progenitor cells which in turn give rise to all the differentiated components of blood as shown in e.g. lymphocytes erythrocytes platelets granulocytes monocytes . HSPCs require the activity of CDK4 6 for proliferation see Roberts et al. Multiple Roles of Cyclin Dependent Kinase 4 6 Inhibitors in Cancer Therapy. JNCI 2012 104 6 476 487 . In healthy kidneys the renal epithelium infrequently enters the cell cycle about 1 of epithelial cells . After a renal insult however a robust increase in epithelial proliferation occurs see Humphreys B. D. et al. Intrinsic epithelial cells repair the kidney after injury. Cell Stem Cell 2 284 91 2008 . Importantly following renal injury surviving renal epithelial cells replicate to repair damage to the kidney tubular epithelium see Humphreys B. D. et al. Repair of injured proximal tubule does not involve specialized progenitors. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 108 9226 31 2011 . See also WO 2010132725 filed by Sharpless et al.

A number of CDK 4 6 inhibitors have been identified including specific pyrido 2 3 d pyrimidines 2 anilinopyrimidines diaryl ureas benzoyl 2 4 diaminothiazoles indolo 6 7 a pyrrolo 3 4 c carbazoles and oxindoles see P. S. Sharma R. Sharma R. Tyagi Curr. Cancer Drug Targets 8 2008 53 75 . WO 03 062236 identifies a series of 2 pyridin 2 ylamino pyrido 2 3 pyrimidin 7 ones for the treatment of Rb positive cancers that show selectivity for CDK4 6 including 6 acetyl 8 cyclopentyl 5 methyl 2 5 piperazin 1 yl pyridin 2 ylammino 8H pyrido 2 3 d pyrimidin 7 one PD0332991 . The clinical trial studies have reported rates of Grade 3 4 neutropenia and leukopenia with the use of PD0332991 resulting in 71 of patients requiring a dose interruption and 35 requiring a dose reduction and adverse events leading to 10 of the discontinuations see Finn Abstract S1 6 SABCS 2012 .

Accordingly it is an object of the present invention to provide new compounds compositions and methods to treat patients during chemotherapy.

In one embodiment improved compounds methods and compositions are provided to minimize the effect of chemotherapeutic agent toxicity on CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells such as hematopoietic stem cells and hematopoietic progenitor cells together referred to as HSPCs and or renal epithelial cells in subjects typically humans that will be are being or have been exposed to the chemotherapeutic agent typically a DNA damaging agent .

Specifically the invention includes administering an effective amount of a selected compound of Formula I II III IV or V as described herein a pharmaceutically acceptable composition salt isotopic analog or prodrug thereof which provides an optimal transient G1 arrest of healthy cells for example HSPCs and or renal epithelial cells in a subject during or following the subject s exposure to a chemotherapeutic agent such as a DNA damaging chemotherapeutic agent 

The described compounds provide improved protection of CDK replication dependent healthy cells during chemotherapeutic agent treatment due in part because they i exhibit a short transient G1 arresting effect and ii display a rapid synchronous reentry into the cell cycle by the cells following the cessation of the chemotherapeutic damaging effect. The use of these CDK4 6 specific short transient G1 arresting compounds as chemoprotectants allows for for example an accelerated cell lineage recovery reduced cytotoxicity risk due to replication delay and or a minimization of chemotherapeutic agent induced cell death.

Despite reports using known CDK4 6 inhibitors such as 2BrIC and PD0332991 to demonstrate chemoprotection it has been discovered that these inhibitors may not be the most ideal compounds for use in pharmacological quiescence PQ strategies. For example the use of 2BrIC in vivo is limited by its restricted bioavailability and despite the relative selectivity for CDK4 6 exhibited by PD0332991 the compound has a relatively long acting intra cellular effect see Roberts et al. Multiple Roles of Cyclin Dependent Kinase 4 6 Inhibitors in Cancer Therapy. JCNI 2012 104 6 476 487 extending the transiency of G1 arrest beyond what may be necessary for sufficient protection from chemotherapeutic treatments. Such a long acting effect delays for example the proliferation of HSPC cell lineages necessary to reconstitute the hematological cell lines that are adversely affected by chemotherapeutic agents or are cycled out during their natural life cycle. The long acting G1 arrest provided by PD0332991 may limit its use as a potential chemoprotectant in subjects whose chemotherapeutic treatment regimen requires a rapid reentry into the cell cycle by HSPCs in order to reconstitute the erythroid platelet and myeloid cells monocyte and granulocyte adversely effected by chemotherapeutic agents or acute HSPC G1 arrest in order to limit myelosuppressive or hematologic toxicity effects. Furthermore PD0332991 may be limited in its use as a chemoprotectant in subjects exposed to chemotherapeutic agents at regular and repeated intervals for example on regimens that are repeated every several days as it may limit the ability of these subjects HSPCs to reenter the cell cycle quickly before it would be necessary to arrest them again prior to the subject s next chemotherapeutic cycle. With respect to other affected tissues for example renal cells the timely resumption of proliferation is critical to tissue repair for example renal tubular epithelium repair due to nephrotoxic agents and therefore an overly long period of PQ is undesirable.

Thus in an alternative embodiment the invention includes administering a compound described herein in an effective amount to a host in need thereof such compound displaying one or any combination of the following factors which provide an improved therapeutic effect either alone or in any combination thereof each of which is considered specifically and independently described i wherein a substantial portion of the CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells e.g. at least 80 or greater return to or approach pre treatment baseline cell cycle activity i.e. reenter the cell cycle in less than 24 hours 30 hours or 36 hours from the last administration of the active compound in humans or for example using a protocol described in the Examples below ii wherein a substantial portion of the healthy cells reenter the cell cycle synchronously in less than 24 hours 30 hours or 36 hours from the last administration of the active compound iii wherein the dissipation of the active compound s CDK4 6 inhibitory effect occurs in less than 24 hours 30 hours or 36 hours from the administration of the inhibitor iv wherein the active compound has an 1050 for CDK4 and or CDK6 inhibition that is more than 1500 times less than its 1050 concentration for CDK2 inhibition v wherein a substantial portion of the healthy cells return to or approach pre treatment baseline cell cycle activity i.e. reenter the cell cycle in less than 24 hours 30 hours or 36 hours from the dissipation of the active compound s CDK4 6 inhibitory effect vi wherein the pre treatment baseline cell cycle activity i.e. reenter the cell cycle within less than about 24 hours about 30 hours or about 36 hours from the point in which the CDK4 6 inhibitor s concentration level in the subject s blood drops below a therapeutic effective concentration or vii wherein a substantial portion of the healthy cells reenter the cell cycle synchronously in less than 24 hours 30 hours or 36 hours from the last administration of the chemotherapeutic agent.

The compounds described herein can be administered to the subject prior to treatment with a chemotherapeutic agent during treatment with a chemotherapeutic agent after exposure to a chemotherapeutic agent or a combination thereof. The compound described herein is typically administered in a manner that allows the drug facile access to the blood stream for example via intravenous injection or sublingual intraaortal or other efficient blood stream accessing route however oral topical transdermal intranasal intramuscular or by inhalation such as by a solution suspension or emulsion or other desired administrative routes can be used. In one embodiment the compound is administered to the subject less than about 24 hours 20 hours 16 hours 12 hours 8 hours or 4 hours 2.5 hours 2 hours 1 hour hour or less prior to treatment with the chemotherapeutic agent. Typically the active compound described herein is administered to the subject prior to treatment with the chemotherapeutic agent such that the compound reaches peak serum levels before or during treatment with the chemotherapeutic agent. In one embodiment the active compound is administered concomitantly or closely thereto with the chemotherapeutic agent exposure. If desired the active compound can be administered multiple times during the chemotherapeutic agent treatment to maximize inhibition especially when the chemotherapeutic drug is administered over a long period or has a long half life. The active compound described herein can be administered following exposure to the chemotherapeutic agent if desired to mitigate healthy cell damage associated with chemotherapeutic agent exposure. In certain embodiments the active compound is administered up to about hour up to about 1 hour up to about 2 hours up to about 4 hours up to about 8 hours up to about 10 hours up to about 12 hours up to about 14 hours up to about 16 hours or up to about 20 hours or greater following the chemotherapeutic agent exposure. In a particular embodiment the active compound is administered up to between about 12 hours and 20 hours following exposure to the chemotherapeutic agent.

The CDK4 6 inhibitors described herein show a marked selectivity for the inhibition of CDK4 and or CDK6 in comparison to other CKD for example CDK2. For example CDK4 6 inhibitors described in the present invention provide for a dose dependent G1 arresting effect on a subject s CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells for example HSPCs or renal epithelial cells and the methods provided for herein are sufficient to afford chemoprotection to targeted CDk4 6 replication dependent healthy cells during chemotherapeutic agent exposure for example during the time period that a DNA damaging chemotherapeutic agent is capable of DNA damaging effects on CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells in the subject while allowing for the synchronous and rapid reentry into the cell cycle by these cells shortly after the chemotherapeutic agent dissipates due to the time limited CDK4 6 inhibitory effect provided by the compounds described herein compared to for example PD0332991. Likewise CDK4 6 inhibitors useful in the present invention provide for a dose dependent mitigating effect on CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells that have been exposed to toxic levels of chemotherapeutic agents for example an accidental overdose allowing for repair of DNA damage associated with chemotherapeutic agent exposure and synchronous rapid reentry into the cell cycle following dissipation of the CDK4 6 inhibitory effect compared to for example PD0332991. In one embodiment the use of a CDK4 6 inhibitor described herein results in the G1 arresting effect on the subject s CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells dissipating following administration of the CDK4 6 inhibitor so that the subject s healthy cells return to or approach their pre administration baseline cell cycle activity within less than about 24 hours 30 hours 36 hours or 40 hours of administration. In one embodiment the G1 arresting effect dissipates such that the subject s CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells return to their pre administration baseline cell cycle activity within less than about 24 hours 30 hours 36 hours or 40 hours.

In one embodiment the use of a CDK4 6 inhibitor described herein results in the G1 arresting effect dissipating such that the subject s CDk4 6 dependent healthy cells return to or approach their pre administration baseline cell cycle activity within less than about 24 hours 30 hours 36 hours or 40 hours of the chemotherapeutic agent effect. In one embodiment the G1 arresting effect dissipates such that the subject s CDK4 6 replication dependent cells return to their pre administration baseline cell cycle activity within less than about 24 hours 30 hours 36 hours or 40 hours or within about 48 hours of the cessation of the chemotherapeutic agent administration. In one embodiment the CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells are HSPCs. In one embodiment the CDK4 6 dependent healthy cells are renal epithelial cells.

In one embodiment the use of a CDK4 6 inhibitor described herein results in the G1 arresting effect dissipating so that the subject s CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells return to or approach their pre administration baseline cell cycle activity within less than about 24 hours 30 hours 36 hours 40 hours or within less than about 48 hours from the point in which the CDK4 6 inhibitor s concentration level in the subject s blood drops below a therapeutic effective concentration.

In one embodiment the CDK4 6 inhibitors described herein are used to protect renal epithelium cells during exposure to a chemotherapeutic agent for example a DNA damaging chemotherapeutic agent wherein the renal epithelial cells are transiently prevented from entering S phase in response to chemotherapeutic agent induced renal tubular epithelium damage for no more than about 24 hours about 30 hours about 36 hours about 40 hours or about 48 hours from the point in which the CDK4 6 inhibitor s concentration level in the subject s blood drops below a therapeutic effective concentration from the cessation of the chemotherapeutic agent effect or from administration of the CDK4 6 administration.

CDK4 6 inhibitors useful in the described methods may be synchronous in their off effect that is upon dissipation of the G1 arresting effect CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells exposed to a CDK4 6 inhibitor described herein reenter the cell cycle in a similarly timed fashion. CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells that reenter the cell cycle do so such that the normal proportion of cells in G1 and S are reestablished quickly and efficiently within less than about 24 hours 30 hours 36 hours 40 hours or within about 48 hours of the from the point in which the CDK4 6 inhibitor s concentration level in the subject s blood drops below a therapeutic effective concentration.

This advantageously allows for a larger number of healthy cells to begin replicating upon dissipation of the G1 arrest compared with asynchronous CDK4 6 inhibitors such as PD0332991.

In addition synchronous cell cycle reentry following G1 arrest using a CDK4 6 inhibitor described herein provides for the ability to time the administration of hematopoietic growth factors to assist in the reconstitution of hematopoietic cell lines to maximize the growth factor effect. As such in one embodiment the use of the compounds or methods described herein is combined with the use of hematopoietic growth factors including but not limited to granulocyte colony stimulating factor G CSF granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor GM CSF thrombopoietin interleukin IL 12 steel factor and erythropoietin EPO or their derivatives. In one embodiment the CDK4 6 inhibitor is administered prior to administration of the hematopoietic growth factor. In one embodiment the hematopoietic growth factor administration is timed so that the CDK4 6 inhibitor s effect on HSPCs has dissipated.

In one aspect the use of a CDK4 6 inhibitor described herein allows for a chemo protective regimen for use during standard chemotherapeutic dosing schedules or regimens common in many anti cancer treatments. For example the CDK4 6 inhibitor can be administered so that CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells are G1 arrested during chemotherapeutic agent exposure wherein due to the rapid dissipation of the G1 arresting effect of the compounds a significant number of healthy cells reenter the cell cycle and are capable of replicating shortly after chemotherapeutic agent exposure for example within less than about 24 30 40 or 48 hours and continue to replicate until administration of the CDK4 6 inhibitor in anticipation of the next chemotherapeutic treatment. In one embodiment the CDK4 6 inhibitor is administered to allow for the cycling of the CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells between G1 arrest and reentry into the cell cycle to accommodate a repeated dosing chemotherapeutic treatment regimen for example including but not limited to a treatment regimen wherein the chemotherapeutic agent is administered on day 1 3 every 21 days on days 1 3 every 28 days on day 1 every 3 weeks on day 1 day 8 and day 15 every 28 days on day 1 and day 8 every 28 days on days 1 and 8 every 21 days on days 1 5 every 21 days 1 day a week for 6 8 weeks on days 1 22 and 43 days 1 and 2 weekly days 1 4 and 22 25 1 4 22 25 and 43 46 and similar type regimens wherein the CDK4 6 replication dependent cells are G1 arrested during chemotherapeutic agent exposure and a significant portion of the cells reenter the cell cycle between chemotherapeutic agent exposure. In one embodiment the CDK4 6 inhibitor can be administered so that the subject s CDK4 6 replication dependent cells are G1 arrested during daily chemotherapeutic agent exposure for example a contiguous multi day chemotherapeutic regimen but a significant portion of CDK4 6 replication dependent cells reenter the cell cycle and replicate between daily treatment. In one embodiment the CDK4 6 inhibitors can be administered so that the subject s CDK4 6 replication dependent cells are G1 arrested during chemotherapeutic agent exposure for example a contiguous multi day regimen but a significant portion of healthy cells reenter the cell cycle and replicate during the off periods before the next chemotherapeutic agent exposure. In one embodiment the CDK4 6 inhibitor is administered so that a subject s CDK4 6 replication dependent cells G1 arrest is provided during a daily chemotherapeutic agent treatment regimen for example a contiguous multi day treatment regimen and the arrested cells are capable of reentering the cell cycle shortly after the multi day regimen ends. In one embodiment the cancer is small cell lung cancer and the CDK4 6 inhibitor is administered on days 1 2 and 3 during a 21 day treatment cycle wherein the administered DNA damaging agent is selected from the group consisting of carboplatin cisplatin and etoposide or a combination thereof.

The subject treated according to the present invention may be undergoing therapeutic chemotherapy for the treatment of a proliferative disorder or disease such as cancer. The cancer can be characterized by one or a combination of increased activity of cyclin dependent kinase 1 CDK1 increased activity of cyclin dependent kinase 2 CDK2 loss deficiency or absence of retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein Rb Rb null high levels of MYC expression increased cyclin E1 E2 and increased cyclin A. The cancer may be characterized by reduced expression of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein or a retinoblastoma family member protein or proteins such as but not limited to p107 and p130 . In one embodiment the subject is undergoing chemotherapeutic treatment for the treatment of an Rb null or Rb deficient cancer including but not limited to small cell lung cancer triple negative breast cancer HPV positive head and neck cancer retinoblastoma Rb negative bladder cancer Rb negative prostate cancer osteosarcoma or cervical cancer. In one embodiment the cancer is a CDK4 6 independent cancer. Administration of the inhibitor compound may allow for a higher dose of a chemotherapeutic agent to be used to treat the disease than the standard dose that would be safely used in the absence of administration of the CDK4 6 inhibitor compound.

The host or subject including a human may be undergoing chemotherapeutic treatment of a non malignant proliferative disorder or other abnormal cellular proliferation such as a tumor multiple sclerosis lupus or arthritis.

The protected HSPCs include hematopoietic stem cells such as long term hematopoietic stem cells LT HSCs and short term hematopoietic stem cells ST HSCs and hematopoietic progenitor cells including multipotent progenitors MPPs common myeloid progenitors CMPs common lymphoid progenitors CLPs granulocyte monocyte progenitors GMPs and megakaryocyte erythroid progenitors MEPs . Administration of the inhibitor compound provides temporary transient pharmacologic quiescence of hematopoietic stem and or hematopoietic progenitor cells in the subject.

Administration of a CDK4 6 inhibitor as described herein can result in reduced anemia reduced lymphopenia reduced thrombocytopenia or reduced neutropenia compared to that typically expected after common after or associated with treatment with chemotherapeutic agents in the absence of administration of the CDK4 6 inhibitor. The use of the CDK4 6 inhibitor as described herein results in a faster recovery from bone marrow suppression associated with long term use of CDK4 6 inhibitors such as myelosuppression anemia lymphopenia thrombocytopenia or neutropenia following the cessation of use of the CDK4 6 inhibitor. In some embodiments the use of a CDK4 6 inhibitor as described herein results in reduced or limited bone marrow suppression associated with long term use of CDK4 6 inhibitors such as myelosuppression anemia lymphopenia thrombocytopenia or neutropenia.

In an alternative aspect a CDK4 6 inhibitor described herein can be used for its anti cancer anti tumor or anti proliferative effect in combination with a chemotherapeutic agent to treat an Rb negative cancer or other Rb negative abnormal proliferation. In one embodiment the CDK4 6 inhibitor described herein provides an additive effect to or synergistic effect with the anti cancer or anti proliferative activity of the chemotherapeutic. Chemotherapeutics that can be combined with the CDK4 6 inhibitors described herein are any chemotherapeutics effective or useful to treat RB null cancers or abnormal cellular proliferation. In one particular embodiment the use of a compound described herein is combined in a therapeutic regime with at least one other chemotherapeutic agent and can be one that does not rely on proliferation or advancement through the cell cycle for anti proliferative activity. Such agent may include but is not limited to tamoxifen midazolam letrozole bortezomib anastrozole goserelin an mTOR inhibitor a PI3 kinase inhibitors dual mTOR PI3K inhibitors MEK inhibitors RAS inhibitors ALK inhibitors HSP inhibitors for example HSP70 and HSP 90 inhibitors or a combination thereof BCL 2 inhibitors apopototic inducing compounds AKT inhibitors PD 1 inhibitors or FLT 3 inhibitors or combinations thereof.

The present invention includes compounds and the use of compounds with desired isotopic substitutions of atoms at amounts above the natural abundance of the isotope i.e. enriched. Isotopes are atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers i.e. the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons. By way of general example and without limitation isotopes of hydrogen for example deuterium H and tritium H may be used anywhere in described structures. Alternatively or in addition isotopes of carbon e.g. C and C may be used. A preferred isotopic substitution is deuterium for hydrogen at one or more locations on the molecule to improve the performance of the drug. The deuterium can be bound in a location of bond breakage during metabolism an deuterium kinetic isotope effect or next to or near the site of bond breakage a deuterium kinetic isotope effect .

Substitution with isotopes such as deuterium can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability such as for example increased in vivo half life or reduced dosage requirements. Substitution of deuterium for hydrogen at a site of metabolic break down can reduce the rate of or eliminate the metabolism at that bond. At any position of the compound that a hydrogen atom may be present the hydrogen atom can be any isotope of hydrogen including protium H deuterium H and tritium H . Thus reference herein to a compound encompasses all potential isotopic forms unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.

The term isotopically labeled analog refers to an analog that is a deuterated analog a C labeled analog or a deuterated C labeled analog. The term deuterated analog means a compound described herein whereby a H isotope i.e. hydrogen protium H is substituted by a H isotope i.e. deuterium H . Deuterium substitution can be partial or complete. Partial deuterium substitution means that at least one hydrogen is substituted by at least one deuterium. In certain embodiments the isotope is 90 95 or 99 or more enriched in an isotope at any location of interest. In some embodiments it is deuterium that is 90 95 or 99 enriched at a desired location.

Tissue specific stem cells and subsets of other resident proliferating cells are capable of self renewal meaning that they are capable of replacing themselves throughout the adult mammalian lifespan through regulated replication. Additionally stem cells divide asymmetrically to produce progeny or progenitor cells that in turn produce various components of a given organ. For example in the hematopoietic system the hematopoietic stem cells give rise to progenitor cells which in turn give rise to all the differentiated components of blood e.g. white blood cells red blood cells and platelets . See .

Certain proliferating cells such as HSPCs require the enzymatic activity of the proliferative kinases cyclin dependent kinase 4 CDK4 and or cyclin dependent kinase 6 CDK6 for cellular replication. In contrast the majority of proliferating cells in adult mammals e.g. the more differentiated blood forming cells in the bone marrow do not require the activity of CDK4 and or CDK6 i.e. CDK4 6 . These differentiated cells can proliferate in the absence of CDK4 6 activity by using other proliferative kinases such as cyclin dependent kinase 2 CDK2 or cyclin dependent kinase 1 CDK1 .

The CDK4 6 inhibitor administered is selected from the group consisting of a compound or composition comprising Formula I Formula II Formula III Formula IV or Formula V or a combination thereof. In one embodiment the compound is selected from the compounds described in Table 1.

In certain embodiments the CDK4 6 inhibitor is a CDK4 6 inhibitor of Formula I II III IV or V or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition salt isotopic analog or prodrug thereof wherein the protection afforded by the compound is short term and transient in nature allowing a significant portion of the cells to synchronously renter the cell cycle quickly following the cessation of the chemotherapeutic agent s effect for example within less than about 24 30 36 or 40 hours. In one embodiment the compound is selected from the compounds described in Table 1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition salt isotopic analog or prodrug thereof. In one embodiment the compound is selected from compounds T Q GG U or AAAA or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition salt isotopic analog or prodrug thereof. Cells that are quiescent within the G1 phase of the cell cycle are more resistant to the damaging effect of chemotherapeutic agents than proliferating cells. CDK4 6 inhibitory compounds for use in the described methods are highly selective potent CDK4 6 inhibitors with minimal CDK2 inhibitory activity. In one embodiment a CDK4 6 compound for use in the methods described herein has a CDK4 CycD1 ICinhibitory concentration value that is 1500 times 1800 times 2000 times 2200 times 2500 times 2700 times 3000 times 3200 times or greater lower than its respective ICconcentration value for CDK2 CycE inhibition. In one embodiment a CDK4 6 inhibitor for use in the methods described herein has an ICconcentration value for CDK4 CycD1 inhibition that is about 3.5 M or greater. In one embodiment a CDK4 6 inhibitor for use in the methods described herein has an ICconcentration value for CDK2 CycA ICthat is 0.80 M 0.85 M 0.90 M 0.95 M .1.0 M 1.25 M 1.50 M 1.75 M 2.0 M 2.25 M 2.50 M 2.75 uM 3.0 M or greater. In one embodiment the CDK4 6 inhibitor for use in the methods described herein are selected from the group consisting of Formula I Formula II Formula III Formula IV or Formula V or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition salt or prodrug thereof. In one embodiment the compound is selected from the compounds described in Table 1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition salt isotopic analog or prodrug thereof. In one embodiment the compound is selected from compounds T Q GG U or AAAA or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition salt isotopic analog or prodrug thereof.

In one embodiment the CDK4 6 inhibitors described herein are used in CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cell cycling strategies wherein a subject is exposed to regular repeated chemotherapeutic treatments wherein the healthy cells are G1 arrested when chemotherapeutic agent exposed and allowed to reenter the cell cycle before the subject s next chemotherapeutic treatment. Such cycling allows CDK4 6 replication dependent cells to regenerate damaged blood cell lineages between regular repeated treatments for example those associated with standard chemotherapeutic treatments for cancer and reduces the risk associated with long term CDK4 6 inhibition. This cycling between a state of G1 arrest and a state of replication is not feasible in limited time spaced repeated chemotherapeutic agent exposures using longer acting CDK4 6 inhibitors such as PD0332991 as the lingering G1 arresting effects of the compound prohibit significant and meaningful reentry into the cell cycle before the next chemotherapeutic agent exposure or delay the healthy cells from entering the cell cycle and reconstituting damaged tissues or cells following treatment cessation.

Proliferative disorders that are treated with chemotherapy include cancerous and non cancer diseases. In a typical embodiment the proliferative disorder is a CDK4 6 replication independent disorder. The compounds are effective in protecting healthy CDK4 6 replication dependent cells for example HSPCs during chemotherapeutic treatment of a broad range of tumor types including but not limited to the following breast prostate ovarian skin lung colorectal brain i.e. glioma and renal. Preferably the selective CDK4 6 inhibitor should not compromise the efficacy of the chemotherapeutic agent or arrest G1 arrest the cancer cells. Many cancers do not depend on the activities of CDK4 6 for proliferation as they can use the proliferative kinases promiscuously e.g. can use CDK 1 2 4 or 6 or lack the function of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein Rb which is inactivated by the CDKs. The potential sensitivity of certain tumors to CDK4 6 inhibition can be deduced based on tumor type and molecular genetics using standard techniques. Cancers that are not typically affected by the inhibition of CDK4 6 are those that can be characterized by one or more of the group including but not limited to increased activity of CDK1 or CDK2 loss deficiency or absence of retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein Rb high levels of MYC expression increased cyclin E e.g. E1 or E2 and increased cyclin A or expression of a Rb inactivating protein such as HPV encoded E7 . Such cancers can include but are not limited to small cell lung cancer retinoblastoma HPV positive malignancies like cervical cancer and certain head and neck cancers MYC amplified tumors such as Burkitts Lymphoma and triple negative breast cancer certain classes of sarcoma certain classes of non small cell lung carcinoma certain classes of melanoma certain classes of pancreatic cancer certain classes of leukemia certain classes of lymphoma certain classes of brain cancer certain classes of colon cancer certain classes of prostate cancer certain classes of ovarian cancer certain classes of uterine cancer certain classes of thyroid and other endocrine tissue cancers certain classes of salivary cancers certain classes of thymic carcinomas certain classes of kidney cancers certain classes of bladder cancers and certain classes of testicular cancers.

The loss or absence of retinoblastoma Rb tumor suppressor protein Rb null can be determined through any of the standard assays known to one of ordinary skill in the art including but not limited to Western Blot ELISA enzyme linked immunoadsorbent assay IHC immunohistochemistry and FACS fluorescent activated cell sorting . The selection of the assay will depend upon the tissue cell line or surrogate tissue sample that is utilized e.g. for example Western Blot and ELISA may be used with any or all types of tissues cell lines or surrogate tissues whereas the IHC method would be more appropriate wherein the tissue utilized in the methods of the present invention was a tumor biopsy. FACs analysis would be most applicable to samples that were single cell suspensions such as cell lines and isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. See for example US 20070212736 Functional Immunohistochemical Cell Cycle Analysis as a Prognostic Indicator for Cancer .

Alternatively molecular genetic testing may be used for determination of retinoblastoma gene status. Molecular genetic testing for retinoblastoma includes the following as described in Lohmann and Gallie Retinoblastoma. Gene Reviews 2010 http www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov bookshelf br.fcgi book gene part retinoblastoma or Parsam et al. A comprehensive sensitive and economical approach for the detection of mutations in the RB1 gene in retinoblastoma Journal of Genetics 88 4 517 527 2009 .

Increased activity of CDK1 or CDK2 high levels of MYC expression increased cyclin E and increased cyclin A can be determined through any of the standard assays known to one of ordinary skill in the art including but not limited to Western Blot ELISA enzyme linked immunoadsorbent assay IHC immunohistochemistry and FACS fluorescent activated cell sorting . The selection of the assay will depend upon the tissue cell line or surrogate tissue sample that is utilized e.g. for example Western Blot and ELISA may be used with any or all types of tissues cell lines or surrogate tissues whereas the IHC method would be more appropriate wherein the tissue utilized in the methods of the present invention was a tumor biopsy. FACs analysis would be most applicable to samples that were single cell suspensions such as cell lines and isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

In some embodiments the cancer is selected from a small cell lung cancer retinoblastoma and triple negative ER PR Her2 negative or basal like breast cancer which almost always inactivate the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein Rb and therefore do not require CDK4 6 activity to proliferate. Triple negative basal like breast cancer is also almost always genetically or functionally Rb null. Also certain virally induced cancers e.g. cervical cancer and subsets of Head and Neck cancer express a viral protein E7 which inactivates Rb making these tumors functionally Rb null. Some lung cancers are also believed to be caused by HPV. In one particular embodiment the cancer is small cell lung cancer and the patient is treated with a DNA damaging agent selected from the group consisting of etoposide carboplatin and cisplatin or a combination thereof.

The selected CDK4 6 inhibitors described herein can also be used in protecting healthy CDK4 6 replication dependent cells during chemotherapeutic treatments of abnormal tissues in non cancer proliferative diseases including but not limited to psoriasis lupus arthritis notably rheumatoid arthritis hemangiomatosis in infants multiple sclerosis myelodegenerative disease neurofibromatosis ganglioneuromatosis keloid formation Paget s Disease of the bone fibrocystic disease of the breast Peyronie s and Duputren s fibrosis restenosis and cirrhosis. Further selective CDK4 6 inhibitors can be used to ameliorate the effects of chemotherapeutic agents in the event of accidental exposure or overdose e.g. methotrexate overdose .

According to the present invention the active compound can be administered to a subject on any chemotherapeutic treatment schedule and in any dose consistent with the prescribed course of treatment. The selective CDK4 6 inhibitor compound is administered prior to during or following the administration of the chemotherapeutic agent. In one embodiment the CDK4 6 inhibitors described herein can be administered to the subject during the time period ranging from 24 hours prior to chemotherapeutic treatment until 24 hours following exposure. This time period however can be extended to time earlier that 24 hour prior to exposure to the agent e.g. based upon the time it takes the chemotherapeutic agent used to achieve suitable plasma concentrations and or the compound s plasma half life . Further the time period can be extended longer than 24 hours following exposure to the chemotherapeutic agent so long as later administration of the CDK4 6 inhibitor leads to at least some protective effect. Such post exposure treatment can be especially useful in cases of accidental exposure or overdose.

In some embodiments the selective CDK4 6 inhibitor can be administered to the subject at a time period prior to the administration of the chemotherapeutic agent so that plasma levels of the selective CDK4 6 inhibitor are peaking at the time of administration of the chemotherapeutic agent. If convenient the selective CDK4 6 inhibitor can be administered at the same time as the chemotherapeutic agent in order to simplify the treatment regimen. In some embodiments the chemoprotectant and chemotherapeutic can be provided in a single formulation.

In some embodiments the selective CDK4 6 inhibitor can be administered to the subject such that the chemotherapeutic agent can be administered either at higher doses increased chemotherapeutic dose intensity or more frequently increased chemotherapeutic dose density . Dose dense chemotherapy is a chemotherapy treatment plan in which drugs are given with less time between treatments than in a standard chemotherapy treatment plan. Chemotherapy dose intensity represents unit dose of chemotherapy administered per unit time. Dose intensity can be increased or decreased through altering dose administered time interval of administration or both. Myelosuppression continues to represent the major dose limiting toxicity of cancer chemotherapy resulting in considerable morbidity and mortality along with frequent reductions in chemotherapy dose intensity which may compromise disease control and survival. The compounds and their use as described herein represent a way of increasing chemotherapy dose density and or dose intensity while mitigating adverse events such as but not limited to myelosuppression.

If desired multiple doses of the selected CDK4 6 inhibitor compound can be administered to the subject. Alternatively the subject can be given a single dose of the selected CDK4 6 inhibitor. For example the CDK4 6 inhibitor can be administered so that CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells are G1 arrested during chemotherapeutic agent exposure wherein due to the rapid dissipation of the G1 arresting effect of the compounds a significant number of healthy cells reenter the cell cycle and are capable of replicating shortly after chemotherapeutic agent exposure for example within about 24 48 hours or less and continue to replicate until administration of the CDK4 6 inhibitor in anticipation of the next chemotherapeutic treatment. In one embodiment the CDK4 6 inhibitor is administered to allow for the cycling of the CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells between G1 arrest and reentry into the cell cycle to accommodate a repeated dosing chemotherapeutic treatment regimen for example including but not limited to a treatment regimen wherein the chemotherapeutic agent is administered on day 1 3 every 21 days on days 1 3 every 28 days on day 1 every 3 weeks on day 1 day 8 and day 15 every 28 days on day 1 and day 8 every 28 days on days 1 and 8 every 21 days on days 1 5 every 21 days 1 day a week for 6 8 weeks on days 1 22 and 43 days 1 and 2 weekly days 1 4 and 22 25 1 4 22 25 and 43 46 and similar type regimens wherein the CDK4 6 replication dependent cells are G1 arrested during chemotherapeutic agent exposure and a significant portion of the cells reenter the cell cycle in between chemotherapeutic agent exposure.

In one embodiment the CDK4 6 inhibitor described herein is used to provide chemoprotection to a subject s CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells during a CDK4 6 replication independent triple negative breast cancer treatment protocol. In one embodiment the CDK4 6 inhibitor is administered to provide chemoprotection in a CDK4 6 replication independent triple negative breast cancer therapy protocol such as but not limited to dose dense doxorubicin adriamycin and cyclophosphamide cytoxan every two weeks for four cycles followed by dose dense paclitaxel Taxol every two weeks for four cycles adriamycin paclitaxel cyclophosphomide every three weeks for a total of four cycles adriamycin paclitaxel cyclophosphomide every two weeks for a total of four cycles adriamycin cyclophosphomide followed by paclitaxel Taxol every three weeks for four cycles each and adriamycin cyclophosphomide followed by paclitaxel Taxol every two weeks for four cycles each.

Triple negative breast cancer TNBC is defined as the absence of staining for estrogen receptor progesterone receptor and HER2 neu. TNBC is insensitive to some of the most effective therapies available for breast cancer treatment including HER2 directed therapy such as trastuzumab and endocrine therapies such as tamoxifen or the aromatase inhibitors. Combination cytotoxic chemotherapy administered in a dose dense or metronomic schedule remains the standard therapy for early stage TNBC. Platinum agents have recently emerged as drugs of interest for the treatment of TNBC with carboplatin added to paclitaxel and adriamycin plus cyclophosphamide chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting. The poly ADP ribose polymerase PARP inhibitors are emerging as promising therapeutics for the treatment of TNBC. PARPs are a family of enzymes involved in multiple cellular processes including DNA repair.

As a nonlimiting illustration the subject is exposed to chemotherapeutic agent at least 5 times a week at least 4 times a week at least 3 times a week at least 2 times a week at least 1 time a week at least 3 times a month at least 2 times a month or at least 1 time a month wherein the subject s CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells are G1 arrested during treatment and allowed to cycle in between chemotherapeutic agent exposure for example during a treatment break. In one embodiment the subject is undergoing 5 times a week chemotherapeutic treatment wherein the subject s CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells are G1 arrested during the chemotherapeutic agent exposure and allowed to reenter the cell cycle during the 2 day break for example over the weekend.

In one embodiment using a CDK4 6 inhibitor described herein the subject s CDK4 6 replicaton dependent healthy cells are arrested during the entirety of the chemotherapeutic agent exposure time period for example during a contiguous multi day regimens the cells are arrested over the time period that is required to complete the contiguous multi day course and then allowed to recycle at the end of the contiguous multi day course. In one embodiment using a CDK4 6 inhibitor described herein the subject s CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells are arrested during the entirety of the chemotherapeutic regimen for example in a daily chemotherapeutic exposure for three weeks and rapidly reenter the cell cycle following the completion of the therapeutic regimen.

In one embodiment the subject has been exposed to a chemotherapeutic agent and using a CDK4 6 inhibitor described herein the subject s CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells are placed in G1 arrest following exposure in order to mitigate for example DNA damage. In one embodiment the CDK4 6 inhibitor is administered at least hour at least 1 hour at least 2 hours at least 3 hours at least 4 hours at least 5 hours at least 6 hours at least 7 hours at least 8 hours at least 10 hours at least 12 hours at least 14 hours at least 16 hours at least 18 hours at least 20 hours or more post chemotherapeutic agent exposure.

In some embodiments the present invention provides methods for protection of mammals particularly humans from the acute and chronic toxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents by forcing CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells for example hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells HSPCs and or renal epithelial cells into a quiescent state by transient e.g. over a less than about 40 36 30 24 hour or less period treatment with a CDK4 6 inhibitor selected from the group consisting of Formula I Formula II Formula III Formula IV or Formula V or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition salt isotopic analog or prodrug thereof. In one embodiment the compound is selected from the compounds described in Table 1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition salt isotopic analog or prodrug thereof. In one embodiment the compound is selected from compounds T Q GG U or AAAA or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition salt isotopic analog or prodrug thereof. CDK4 6 replication dependent cells recover from this period of transient quiescence and then function normally after treatment with the inhibitor is stopped and its intra cellular effect dissipates. During the period of quiescence the CDK4 6 replication dependent cells are protected from the effects of chemotherapeutic agents.

In some embodiments the CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells can be arrested for longer periods for example over a period of hours days and or weeks through multiple time separated administrations of a CDK4 6 inhibitor described herein. Because of the rapid and synchronous reentry into the cell cycle by CDK4 6 replication dependent healthy cells for example HSPCs upon dissipation of the CDK4 6 inhibitors intra cellular effects the cells are capable of reconstituting the cell lineages faster than CDK4 6 inhibitors with longer G1 arresting profiles for example PD0332991.

The reduction in chemotoxicity afforded by the selective CDK4 6 inhibitors can allow for dose intensification e.g. more therapy can be given in a fixed period of time in medically related chemotherapies which will translate to better efficacy. Therefore the presently disclosed methods can result in chemotherapy regimens that are less toxic and more effective. Also in contrast to protective treatments with exogenous biological growth factors the selective CDK4 6 inhibitors described herein are orally available small molecules which can be formulated for administration via a number of different routes. When appropriate the small molecules can be formulated for oral topical intranasal inhalation intravenous or any other desired form of administration.

A CDK4 6 inhibitor useful in the methods described herein is a selective CDK4 6 inhibitor compound that selectively inhibit at least one of CDK4 and CDK6 or whose predominant mode of action is through inhibition of CDK4 and or CDK6. In one embodiment the selective CDK4 6 inhibitors have an ICfor CDK4 as measured in a CDK4 CycD1 ICphosphorylation assay that is at least 1500 2000 5000 or even 10 000 times or greater lower than the compound s ICs for CDK2 as measured in a CDK2 CycE ICphosphorylation assay. In one embodiment the CDK4 6 inhibitors are at least about 10 times or greater more potent i.e. have an ICin a CDK4 CycD1 phosphorylation assay that is at least 10 times or more lower than PD0332991.

The use of a selected CDK4 6 inhibitor as described herein can induce selective G1 arrest in CDK4 6 dependent cells e.g. as measured in a cell based in vitro assay . In one embodiment the CDK4 6 inhibitor is capable of increasing the percentage of CDK4 6 dependent cells in the G1 phase while decreasing the percentage of CDK4 6 dependent cells in the G2 M phase and S phase. In one embodiment the selective CDK4 6 inhibitor induces substantially pure i.e. clean G1 cell cycle arrest in the CDK4 6 dependent cells e.g. wherein treatment with the selective CDK4 6 inhibitor induces cell cycle arrest such that the majority of cells are arrested in G1 as defined by standard methods e.g. propidium iodide PI staining or others with the population of cells in the G2 M and S phases combined being less than about 30 about 25 about 20 about 15 about 10 about 5 about 3 or less of the total cell population. Methods of assessing the cell phase of a population of cells are known in the art see for example in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2002 0224522 and include cytometric analysis microscopic analysis gradient centrifugation elutriation fluorescence techniques including immunofluorescence and combinations thereof. Cytometric techniques include exposing the cell to a labeling agent or stain such as DNA binding dyes e.g. PI and analyzing cellular DNA content by flow cytometry. Immunofluorescence techniques include detection of specific cell cycle indicators such as for example thymidine analogs e.g. 5 bromo 2 deoxyuridine BrdU or an iododeoxyuridine with fluorescent antibodies.

In some embodiments the use of a selective CDK4 6 inhibitor described herein result in reduced or substantially free of off target effects particularly related to inhibition of kinases other than CDK4 and or CDK6 such as CDK2 as the selective CDK4 6 inhibitors described herein are poor inhibitors e.g. 1 uM IC of CDK2. Furthermore because of the high selectivity for CDK4 6 the use of the compounds described herein should not induce cell cycle arrest in CDK4 6 independent cells. In addition because of the short transient nature of the G1 arrest effect the CDK4 6 replication dependent cells more quickly reenter the cell cycle than comparatively use of PD0332991 provides resulting in the reduced risk of in one embodiment hematological toxicity development during long term treatment regimens due to the ability of HSPCs to replicate between chemotherapeutic treatments.

In some embodiments the use of a selective CDK4 6 inhibitor described herein reduces the risk of undesirable off target effects including but not limited to long term toxicity anti oxidant effects and estrogenic effects. Anti oxidant effects can be determined by standard assays known in the art. For example a compound with no significant anti oxidant effects is a compound that does not significantly scavenge free radicals such as oxygen radicals. The anti oxidant effects of a compound can be compared to a compound with known anti oxidant activity such as genistein. Thus a compound with no significant anti oxidant activity can be one that has less than about 2 3 5 10 30 or 100 fold anti oxidant activity relative to genistein. Estrogenic activities can also be determined via known assays. For instance a non estrogenic compound is one that does not significantly bind and activate the estrogen receptor. A compound that is substantially free of estrogenic effects can be one that has less than about 2 3 5 10 20 or 100 fold estrogenic activity relative to a compound with estrogenic activity e.g. genistein.

In one embodiment a lactam intermediate is treated with BOC anhydride in the presence of an organic base such as triethylamine in an organic solvent such as dichloromethane. The Boc protected lactam is treated with carbon dioxide in the presence of a nickel catalyst to generate a carboxylic acid. The carboxylic acid is reacted with thionyl chloride in the presence of an organic solvent such as toluene. The resulting acid chloride is treated with an amine to generate an amide that can be deprotected with a strong acid such as trifluoroacetic acid to generate the final target inhibitor compound.

Alternatively the lactam can be generated by reacting the carboxylic acid with a protected amine in the presence of a strong acid and a dehydrating agent which can be together in one moiety as a strong acid anhydride. Examples of strong acid anhydrides include but are not limited to trifluoroacetic acid anhydride tribromoacetic acid anhydride trichloroacetic acid anhydride or mixed anhydrides. The dehydrating agent can be a carbodiimide based compound such as but not limited to DCC N N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide EDC 1 ethyl 3 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide or DIC N N diisopropylcarbodiimide . An additional step may be necessary to take off the N protecting group and the methodologies are known to those skilled in the art

Alternatively the halogen moiety bonded to the pyrimidine ring can be substituted with any leaving group that can be displaced by a primary amine for example to create an intermediate for a final product such as Br I F SMe SOMe SOalkyl SOalkyl. See for Example PCT US2013 037878 to Tavares.

Other amine intermediates and final amine compounds can be synthesized by those skilled in the art. It will be appreciated that the chemistry can employ reagents that comprise reactive functionalities that can be protected and de protected and will be known to those skilled in the art at the time of the invention.

As used herein the term active compound refers to the selective CDK 4 6 inhibitor compounds described herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or isotopic analog thereof. The active compound can be administered to the subject through any suitable approach. The amount and timing of active compound administered can of course be dependent on the subject being treated on the dosage of chemotherapy to which the subject is anticipated of being exposed to on the time course of the chemotherapeutic agent exposure on the manner of administration on the pharmacokinetic properties of the particular active compound and on the judgment of the prescribing physician. Thus because of subject to subject variability the dosages given below are a guideline and the physician can titrate doses of the compound to achieve the treatment that the physician considers appropriate for the subject. In considering the degree of treatment desired the physician can balance a variety of factors such as age and weight of the subject presence of preexisting disease as well as presence of other diseases. Pharmaceutical formulations can be prepared for any desired route of administration including but not limited to oral intravenous or aerosol administration as discussed in greater detail below.

The therapeutically effective dosage of any active compound described herein will be determined by the health care practitioner depending on the condition size and age of the patient as well as the route of delivery. In one non limited embodiment a dosage from about 0.1 to about 200 mg kg has therapeutic efficacy with all weights being calculated based upon the weight of the active compound including the cases where a salt is employed. In some embodiments the dosage can be the amount of compound needed to provide a serum concentration of the active compound of up to between about 1 and 5 10 20 30 or 40 M. In some embodiments a dosage from about 10 mg kg to about 50 mg kg can be employed for oral administration. Typically a dosage from about 0.5 mg kg to 5 mg kg can be employed for intramuscular injection. In some embodiments dosages can be from about 1 mol kg to about 50 mol kg or optionally between about 22 mol kg and about 33 mol kg of the compound for intravenous or oral administration. An oral dosage form can include any appropriate amount of active material including for example from 5 mg to 50 100 200 or 500 mg per tablet or other solid dosage form.

The pharmaceutical formulations can comprise an active compound described herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in any pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. If a solution is desired water may be the carrier of choice for water soluble compounds or salts. With respect to the water soluble compounds or salts an organic vehicle such as glycerol propylene glycol polyethylene glycol or mixtures thereof can be suitable. In the latter instance the organic vehicle can contain a substantial amount of water. The solution in either instance can then be sterilized in a suitable manner known to those in the art and for illustration by filtration through a 0.22 micron filter. Subsequent to sterilization the solution can be dispensed into appropriate receptacles such as depyrogenated glass vials. The dispensing is optionally done by an aseptic method. Sterilized closures can then be placed on the vials and if desired the vial contents can be lyophilized.

In addition to the active compounds or their salts the pharmaceutical formulations can contain other additives such as pH adjusting additives. In particular useful pH adjusting agents include acids such as hydrochloric acid bases or buffers such as sodium lactate sodium acetate sodium phosphate sodium citrate sodium borate or sodium gluconate. Further the formulations can contain antimicrobial preservatives. Useful antimicrobial preservatives include methylparaben propylparaben and benzyl alcohol. An antimicrobial preservative is typically employed when the formulation is placed in a vial designed for multi dose use. The pharmaceutical formulations described herein can be lyophilized using techniques well known in the art.

For oral administration a pharmaceutical composition can take the form of solutions suspensions tablets pills capsules powders and the like. Tablets containing various excipients such as sodium citrate calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate may be employed along with various disintegrants such as starch e.g. potato or tapioca starch and certain complex silicates together with binding agents such as polyvinylpyrrolidone sucrose gelatin and acacia. Additionally lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often very useful for tableting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type may be employed as fillers in soft and hard filled gelatin capsules. Materials in this connection also include lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions and or elixirs are desired for oral administration the compounds of the presently disclosed subject matter can be combined with various sweetening agents flavoring agents coloring agents emulsifying agents and or suspending agents as well as such diluents as water ethanol propylene glycol glycerin and various like combinations thereof.

In yet another embodiment of the subject matter described herein there is provided an injectable stable sterile formulation comprising an active compound as described herein or a salt thereof in a unit dosage form in a sealed container. The compound or salt is provided in the form of a lyophilizate which is capable of being reconstituted with a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to form a liquid formulation suitable for injection thereof into a subject. When the compound or salt is substantially water insoluble a sufficient amount of emulsifying agent which is physiologically acceptable can be employed in sufficient quantity to emulsify the compound or salt in an aqueous carrier. Particularly useful emulsifying agents include phosphatidyl cholines and lecithin.

Additional embodiments provided herein include liposomal formulations of the active compounds disclosed herein. The technology for forming liposomal suspensions is well known in the art. When the compound is an aqueous soluble salt using conventional liposome technology the same can be incorporated into lipid vesicles. In such an instance due to the water solubility of the active compound the active compound can be substantially entrained within the hydrophilic center or core of the liposomes. The lipid layer employed can be of any conventional composition and can either contain cholesterol or can be cholesterol free. When the active compound of interest is water insoluble again employing conventional liposome formation technology the salt can be substantially entrained within the hydrophobic lipid bilayer that forms the structure of the liposome. In either instance the liposomes that are produced can be reduced in size as through the use of standard sonication and homogenization techniques. The liposomal formulations comprising the active compounds disclosed herein can be lyophilized to produce a lyophilizate which can be reconstituted with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as water to regenerate a liposomal suspension.

Pharmaceutical formulations also are provided which are suitable for administration as an aerosol by inhalation. These formulations comprise a solution or suspension of a desired compound described herein or a salt thereof or a plurality of solid particles of the compound or salt. The desired formulation can be placed in a small chamber and nebulized. Nebulization can be accomplished by compressed air or by ultrasonic energy to form a plurality of liquid droplets or solid particles comprising the compounds or salts. The liquid droplets or solid particles may for example have a particle size in the range of about 0.5 to about 10 microns and optionally from about 0.5 to about 5 microns. The solid particles can be obtained by processing the solid compound or a salt thereof in any appropriate manner known in the art such as by micronization. Optionally the size of the solid particles or droplets can be from about 1 to about 2 microns. In this respect commercial nebulizers are available to achieve this purpose. The compounds can be administered via an aerosol suspension of respirable particles in a manner set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 5 628 984 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

When the pharmaceutical formulation suitable for administration as an aerosol is in the form of a liquid the formulation can comprise a water soluble active compound in a carrier that comprises water. A surfactant can be present which lowers the surface tension of the formulation sufficiently to result in the formation of droplets within the desired size range when subjected to nebulization.

The term pharmaceutically acceptable salts as used herein refers to those salts which are within the scope of sound medical judgment suitable for use in contact with subjects e.g. human subjects without undue toxicity irritation allergic response and the like commensurate with a reasonable benefit risk ratio and effective for their intended use as well as the zwitterionic forms where possible of the compounds of the presently disclosed subject matter.

Thus the term salts refers to the relatively non toxic inorganic and organic acid addition salts of compounds of the presently disclosed subject matter. These salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the compounds or by separately reacting the purified compound in its free base form with a suitable organic or inorganic acid and isolating the salt thus formed. Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts may be formed with metals or amines such as alkali and alkaline earth metal hydroxides or of organic amines. Examples of metals used as cations include but are not limited to sodium potassium magnesium calcium and the like. Examples of suitable amines include but are not limited to N N dibenzylethylenediamine chloroprocaine choline diethanolamine ethylenediamine N methylglucamine and procaine.

Salts can be prepared from inorganic acids sulfate pyrosulfate bisulfate sulfite bisulfite nitrate phosphate monohydrogenphosphate dihydrogenphosphate metaphosphate pyrophosphate chloride bromide iodide such as hydrochloric nitric phosphoric sulfuric hydrobromic hydriodic phosphorus and the like. Representative salts include the hydrobromide hydrochloride sulfate bisulfate nitrate acetate oxalate valerate oleate palmitate stearate laurate borate benzoate lactate phosphate tosylate citrate maleate fumarate succinate tartrate naphthylate mesylate glucoheptonate lactobionate laurylsulphonate and isethionate salts and the like. Salts can also be prepared from organic acids such as aliphatic mono and dicarboxylic acids phenyl substituted alkanoic acids hydroxy alkanoic acids alkanedioic acids aromatic acids aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids etc. and the like. Representative salts include acetate propionate caprylate isobutyrate oxalate malonate succinate suberate sebacate fumarate maleate mandelate benzoate chlorobenzoate methylbenzoate dinitrobenzoate phthalate benzenesulfonate toluenesulfonate phenylacetate citrate lactate maleate tartrate methanesulfonate and the like. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts can include cations based on the alkali and alkaline earth metals such as sodium lithium potassium calcium magnesium and the like as well as non toxic ammonium quaternary ammonium and amine cations including but not limited to ammonium tetramethylammonium tetraethylammonium methylamine dimethylamine trimethylamine triethylamine ethylamine and the like. Also contemplated are the salts of amino acids such as arginate gluconate galacturonate and the like. See for example Berge et al. J. Pharm.

Selected compounds disclosed herein were tested in CDK4 cyclinD1 CDK6 CycD3 CDK2 CycA and CDK2 cyclinE kinase assays by Nanosyn Santa Clara Calif. to determine their inhibitory effect on these CDKs. The assays were performed using microfluidic kinase detection technology Caliper Assay Platform . The compounds were tested in 12 point dose response format in singlicate at Km for ATP. Phosphoacceptor substrate peptide concentration used was 1 M for all assays and Staurosporine was used as the reference compound for all assays. Specifics of each assay are as described below 

The inhibitory ICvalues for the compounds in Table 1 for CDK4 CycD1 CDK2 CycE CDK2 CycA as well as fold selectivity are presented in Table 2.

To further characterize its kinase activity Compound T was screened against 456 395 non mutant kinases using DiscoveRx s KINOMEscan profiling service. The compound was screened using a single concentration of 1000 nM 1000 times the 1050 on Cdk4 . Results from this screen confirmed the high potency against Cdk4 and high selectivity versus Cdk2. Additionally the kinome profiling showed that Compound T was relatively selective for Cdk4 and Cdk6 compared to the other kinases tested. Specifically when using an inhibitory threshold of 65 90 or 99 Compound T inhibited 92 23.3 31 7.8 or 6 1.5 of 395 non mutant kinases respectively.

In addition to CDK4 kinase activity several compounds were also tested against CDK6 kinase activity. The results of the CDK6 CycD3 kinase assays along with the CDK4 cyclinD1 CDK2 CycA and CDK2 cyclinE kinase assays are shown for PD0332991 Reference and the compounds T Q GG and U in Table 3. The ICof 10 nM for CDK4 cyclinD1 and 10 uM for CDK12 CyclinE agrees well with previously published reports for PD0332991 Fry et al. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics 2004 3 11 1427 1437 Toogood et al. Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 2005 48 2388 2406 . Compounds T Q GG and U are more potent lower IC with respect to the reference compound PD0332991 and demonstrate a higher fold selectivity with respect to the reference compound CDK2 CycE ICdivided by CDK4 CycD1 IC .

For determination of cellular fractions in various stages of the cell cycle following various treatments HS68 cells human skin fibroblast cell line Rb positive were stained with propidium iodide staining solution and run on Dako Cyan Flow Cytometer. The fraction of cells in G0 G1 DNA cell cycle versus the fraction in S phase DNA cell cycle was determined using FlowJo 7.2.2 analysis.

The compounds listed in Table 1 were tested for their ability to arrest HS68 cells at the G1 phase of the cell cycle. From the results of the cellular G1 arrest assay the range of the inhibitory ECvalues necessary for G1 arrest of HS68 cells was from 22 nM to 1500 nM see column titled Cellular G1 Arrest EC in Table 4 .

To test the ability of Cdk4 6 inhibitors to induce a clean G1 arrest a cell based screening method was used consisting of two Cdk4 6 dependent cell lines tHS68 and WM2664 Rb positive and one Cdk4 6 independent A2058 Rb negative cell line. Twenty four hours after plating each cell line was treated with Compound T in a dose dependent manner for 24 hours. At the conclusion of the experiment cells were harvested fixed and stained with propidium iodide a DNA intercalator which fluoresces strongly red emission maximum 637 nm when excited by 488 nm light. Samples were run on Dako Cyan flow cytometer and 10 000 events were collected for each sample. Data were analyzed using FlowJo 2.2 software developed by TreeStar Inc.

The Cdk4 6 cyclin D complex is essential for progression from G1 to the S phase of the DNA cell cycle. This complex phosphorylates the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein Rb . To demonstrate the impact of Cdk4 6 inhibition on Rb phosphorylation pRb Compound T was exposed to three cell lines two Cdk4 6 dependent tHS68 WM2664 Rb positive and one Cdk4 6 independent A2058 Rb negative . Twenty four hours after seeding cells were treated with Compound T at 300 nM final concentration for 4 8 16 and 24 hours. Samples were lysed and protein was assayed by western blot analysis. Rb phosphorylation was measured at two sites targeted by the Cdk4 6 cyclin D complex Ser780 and Ser807 811 using species specific antibodies. Results demonstrate that Compound T blocks Rb phosphorylation in Rb dependent cell lines by 16 hours post exposure while having no effect on Rb independent cells .

The retinoblastoma RB tumor suppressor is a major negative cell cycle regulator that is inactivated in approximately 11 of all human cancers. Functional loss of RB is an obligate event in small cell lung cancer SCLC development. In RB competent tumors activated Cdk2 4 6 promote G1 to S phase traversal by phosphorylating and inactivating RB and related family members . Conversely cancers with RB deletion or inactivation do not require Cdk4 6 activity for cell cycle progression. Since inactivation of RB is an obligate event in SCLC development this tumor type is highly resistant to Cdk4 6 inhibitors and co administration of Cdk4 6 inhibitors with DNA damaging chemotherapeutic agents such as those used in SCLC should not antagonize the efficacy of such agents.

Several compounds PD0332991 Compound GG and Compound T were tested for their ability to block cell proliferation in a panel of SCLC cell lines with known genetic loss of RB. SCLC cells were treated with DMSO or the indicated Cdk4 6 inhibitor for 24 hours. The effect of Cdk4 6 inhibition on proliferation was measured by EdU incorporation. An RB intact Cdk4 6 dependent cell line WM2664 or tHS68 and a panel of RB negative SCLC cell lines H69 H82 H209 H345 NCI417 or SHP 77 were analyzed for growth inhibition by the various CDK4 6 inhibitors.

As shown in Rb negative SCLC cells are resistant to Cdk4 6 inhibition. In PD0332991 inhibits the Rb positive cell line WM2664 but does not affect the growth of the Rb negative small cell lung cancer cell lines H345 H69 H209 SHP 77 NCI417 and H82 . In Compound GG inhibits the Rb positive cell line tHS68 but does not affect the growth of the Rb negative cell lines H345 H69 SHP 77 and H82 . In Compound T inhibits the Rb positive cell line tHS68 but does not affect the growth of the Rb negative cell lines H69 SHP 77 and H209 . This analysis demonstrated that RB null SCLC cell lines were resistant to Cdk4 6 inhibition as no change in the percent of cells in S phase were seen upon treatment with any of the Cdk4 6 inhibitors tested including Compound T and Compound GG while the RB proficient cell line in each experiment was highly sensitive to Cdk4 6 inhibition with almost no cells remaining in S phase after 24 hours of treatment.

Cellular proliferation assays were conducted using the following Rb negative cancer cell lines H69 human small cell lung cancer Rb negative cells or A2058 human metastatic melanoma cells Rb negative . These cells were seeded in Costar Tewksbury Mass. 3093 96 well tissue culture treated white walled clear bottom plates. Cells were treated with the compounds of Table 1 as nine point dose response dilution series from 10 uM to 1 nM. Cells were exposed to compounds and then cell viability was determined after either four H69 or six A2058 days as indicated using the CellTiter Glo luminescent cell viability assay CTG Promega Madison Wis. United States of America following the manufacturer s recommendations. Plates were read on BioTek Winooski Vt. Syngergy2 multi mode plate reader. The Relative Light Units RLU were plotted as a result of variable molar concentration and data was analyzed using Graphpad LaJolla Calif. Prism 5 statistical software to determine the ECfor each compound.

Select compounds disclosed herein were evaluated against a small cell lung cancer cell line H69 and a human metastatic melanoma cell line A2058 two Rb deficient Rb negative cell lines. The results of these cellular inhibition assays are shown in Table 4. The range of the inhibitory ECvalues necessary for inhibition of H69 small cell lung cancer cells was 2040 nM to 3000 nM. The range of the inhibitory ECvalues necessary for inhibition of A2058 malignant melanoma cell proliferation was 1313 nM to 3000 nM. In contrast to the significant inhibition seen on Rb positive cell lines it was found that the compounds tested were not significantly effective at inhibiting proliferation of the small cell lung cancer or melanoma cells.

The effect of PD0332991 on HSPCs has been previously demonstrated. shows the EdU incorporation of mice HSPC and myeloid progenitor cells following a single dose of 150 mg kg PD0332991 by oral gavage to assess the temporal effect of transient CDK4 6 inhibition on bone marrow arrest as reported in Roberts et al. Multiple Roles of Cyclin Dependent Kinase 4 6 Inhibitors in Cancer Therapy. JCNI 2012 104 6 476 487. As can be seen in a single oral dose of PD0332991 results in a sustained reduction in HSPC LKS and myeloid progenitor cells LKS for greater than 36 hours. Not until 48 hours post oral dosing do HSPC and myeloid progenitor cells return to baseline cell division.

For HSPC proliferation experiments young adult female FVB N mice were treated with a single dose as indicated of compound T compound Q compound GG or PD0332991 by oral gavage. Mice were then sacrificed at the indicated times 0 12 24 36 or 48 hours following compound administration and bone marrow was harvested n 3 mice per time point as previously described Johnson et al. J. Clin. Invest. 2010 120 7 2528 2536 . Four hours before the bone marrow was harvested mice were treated with 100 g of EdU by intraperitoneal injection Invitrogen . Bone marrow mononuclear cells were harvested and immunophenotyped using previously described methods and percent EdU positive cells were then determined Johnson et al. J. Clin. Invest. 2010 120 7 2528 2536 . In brief HSPCs were identified by expression of lineage markers Lin ScaI S and c Kit K .

Analysis in mice determined that Compound T Compound Q and Compound GG demonstrated dose dependent transient and reversible G1 arrest of bone marrow stem cells HSPC . Six mice per group were dosed by oral gavage at 150 mg kg of Compound T Compound Q Compound GG or vehicle only. Four hours before animals were sacrificed and the bone marrow was harvested mice were treated with 100 g of EdU by intraperitoneal injection. Three mice per group were sacrificed at 12 hours and the remaining three animals per group were sacrificed at 24 hours. Results are shown in as the ratio of EdU positive cells for treated animals at 12 or 24 hour time points compared to control. Compound T and GG demonstrated a reduction in EdU incorporation at 12 hours which was starting to return to normal at 24 hours. Compound Q also demonstrated some reduction at 12 hours and started to return to baseline at 24 hours despite the fact that oral bioavailability of Compound Q is low.

Further experiments were completed with Compound T examining dose response and longer periods of compound treatment. Compound T was dosed by oral gavage at 50 100 or 150 mg kg and EdU incorporation into bone marrow was determined at 12 and 24 hours as described above. Alternatively Compound T was dosed by oral gavage at 150 mg kg and EdU incorporation into bone marrow was determined at 12 24 36 and 48 hours. As can be seen in and similar to the cellular washout experiments bone marrow cells and in particular HSPCs were returning to normal cell division as determined by EdU incorporation in 24 hours following oral gavage at a number of doses. The 150 mg kg oral dose of Compound T in can be compared directly to the results of the same dose of PD0332991 shown in where cells were still non dividing as determined by low EdU incorporation at 24 and 36 hours only returning to normal values at 48 hours.

As seen in a single oral dose of PD0332991 results in a sustained reduction in HSPCs for greater than 36 hours. In contrast a single oral dose of Compound T results in an initial reduction of HSPC proliferation at 12 hours but proliferation of HSPCs resumes by 24 hours after dosage of Compound T.

HS68 cells were seeded out at 40 000 cells well in 60 mm dish on day 1 in DMEM containing 10 fetal bovine serum 100 U ml penicillin streptomycin and 1 Glutamax Invitrogen as described Brookes et al. EMBO J 21 12 2936 2945 2002 and Ruas et al. Mol Cell Biol 27 12 4273 4282 2007 . 24 hrs post seeding cells are treated with compound T compound Q compound GG compound U PD0332991 or DMSO vehicle alone at 300 nM final concentration of test compounds. On day 3 one set of treated cell samples were harvested in triplicate 0 Hour sample . Remaining cells were washed two times in PBS CMF and returned to culture media lacking test compound. Sets of samples were harvested in triplicate at 24 40 and 48 hours.

Alternatively the same experiment was done using normal Renal Proximal Tubule Epithelial Cells Rb positive obtained from American Type Culture Collection ATCC Manassas Va. . Cells were grown in an incubator at 37 C. in a humidified atmosphere of 5 CO2 in Renal Epithelial Cell Basal Media ATCC supplemented with Renal Epithelial Cell Growth Kit ATCC in 37 C. humidified incubator.

Upon harvesting cells samples were stained with propidium iodide staining solution and samples run on Dako Cyan Flow Cytometer. The fraction of cells in G0 G1 DNA cell cycle versus the fraction in S phase DNA cell cycle was determined using FlowJo 7.2.2 analysis.

As shown in and similar to results in vivo as shown in PD0332991 required greater than 48 hours post wash out for cells to return to normal baseline cell division. This is seen in and as values equivalent to those for the DMSO control for either the G0 G1 fraction or the S phase of cell division respectively were obtained. In contrast HS68 cells treated with compounds of the present invention returned to normal baseline cell division in as little as 24 hours or 40 hours distinct from PD0332991 at these same time points. The results using human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells also show that PD0332991 treated cells took significantly longer to return to baseline levels of cell division as compared to cells treated with compounds T Q GG or U.

Compounds of the present invention demonstrate good pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Compound T Q GG and U were dosed to mice at 30 mg kg by oral gavage or 10 mg kg by intravenous injection. Blood samples were taken at 0 0.25 0.5 1.0 2.0 4.0 and 8.0 hours post dosing and the plasma concentration of compound T Q GG or U were determined by HPLC. Compound T GG and U were demonstrated to have excellent oral pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties as shown in Table 5. This includes very high oral bioavailability F of 52 to 80 and a plasma half life of 3 to 5 hours following oral administration. Compound T Q GG and U were demonstrated to have excellent pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties when delivered by intravenous administration. Representative IV and oral PK curves for all four copounds are shown in .

The metabolic stability of Compound T in comparison to PD0332991 was determined in human dog rat monkey and mouse liver microsomes. Human mouse and dog liver microsomes were purchased from Xenotech and Sprague Dawley rat liver microsomes were prepared by Absorption Systems. The reaction mixture comprising 0.5 mg mL of liver microsomes 100 mM of potassium phosphate pH 7.4 5 mM of magnesium chloride and 1 uM of test compound was prepared. The test compound was added into the reaction mixture at a final concentration of 1 uM. An aliquot of the reaction mixture without cofactor was incubated in shaking water bath at 37 deg. C. for 3 minutes. The control compound testosterone was run simultaneously with the test compound in a separate reaction. The reaction was initiated by the addition of cofactor NADPH and the mixture was then incubated in a shaking water bath at 37 deg. C. Aliquots 100 L were withdrawn at 0 10 20 30 and 60 minutes for the test compound and 0 10 30 and 60 minutes for testosterone. Test compound samples were immediately combined with 100 L of ice cold acetonitrile containing internal standard to terminate the reaction. Testosterone samples were immediately combined with 800 L of ice cold 50 50 acetonitrile dH2O containing 0.1 formic acid and internal standard to terminate the reaction. The samples were assayed using a validated LC MS MS method. Test compound samples were analyzed using the Orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometer to quantify the disappearance of parent test compound and detect the appearance of metabolites. The peak area response ration PARR to internal standard was compared to the PARR at time 0 to determine the percent of test compound or positive control remaining at time point. Half lives were calculated using GraphPad software fitting to a single phase exponential decay equation.

Half life was calculated based on t1 2 0.693 k where k is the elimination rate constant based on the slope plot of natural logarithm percent remaining versus incubation time. When calculated half life was longer than the duration of the experiment the half life was expressed as the longest incubation time. The calculated half life is also listed in parentheses. If the calculated half life is 2 the duration of the experiment no half life was reported. The timely resumption of cellular proliferation is necessary for tissue repair and therefore an overly long period of arrest is undesirable in healthy cells such as HSPCs. The characteristics of a CDK4 6 inhibitor that dictate its arresting duration are its pharmacokinetic PK and enzymatic half lives. Once initiated a G1 arrest in vivo will be maintained as long as circulating compound remains at an inhibitory level and as long as the compound engages the enzyme. PD032991 for example possesses an overall long PK half life and a fairly slow enzymatic off rate. In humans PD0332991 exhibits a PK half life of 27 hours see Schwartz G K et al. 2011 BJC 104 1862 1868 . In humans a single administration of PD0332991 produces a cell cycle arrest of HSPC lasting approximately one week. This reflects the 6 days to clear the compound 5 half lives 27 hour half life as well as an additional 1.5 to 2 days of inhibition of enzymatic CDK4 6 function. This calculation suggests that it takes a total of 7 days for normal bone marrow function to return during which time new blood production is reduced. These observations may explain the severe granulocytopenia seen with PD0332991 in the clinic.

Further experiments were completed with Compound T and PD0332991 to compare the metabolic stability half life in human dog rat monkey and mouse liver microsomes. As shown in when analyzing the stability of the compounds in liver microsomes across species the determinable half life of Compound T is shorter in each species compared to that reported for PD0332991. Furthermore as previously described above and in it appears that PD0332991 also has an extended enzymatic half life as evidenced by the production of a pronounced cell cycle arrest in human cells lasting more than forty hours even after compound is removed from the cell culture media i.e. in an in vitro wash out experiment . As further shown in removal of the compounds described herein from the culture media leads to a rapid resumption of proliferation consistent with a rapid enzymatic off rate. These differences in enzymatic off rates translate into a marked difference in pharmacodynamic PD effect as shown in . As shown a single oral dose of PD0332991 produces a 36 hour growth arrest of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells HSPCs in murine bone marrow which is greater than would be explained by the 6 hour PK half life of PD0332991 in mice. In contrast the effect of Compound T is much shorter allowing a rapid re entry into the cell cycle providing exquisite in vivo control of HSPC proliferation.

In order to demonstrate that pharmacological quiescence induced by Compound T treatment affords resistance to chemotherapeutic agents with differing mechanisms of action an in vitro model was developed using telomerized human diploid fibroblasts tHDFs a human foreskin fibroblast line immortalized with expression of human telomerase . These cells are highly Cdk4 6 dependent for proliferation as demonstrated by their complete G1 arrest following treatment with Cdk4 6 inhibitors See Roberts P J et al. Multiple Roles of Cyclin Dependent Kinase 4 6 Inhibitors in Cancer Therapy. J Natl Cancer Inst 2012 Mar. 21 104 6 476 87 . Cell survival was determined by Cell TiterGlo assay per manufacturer s recommendations. For both H2AX and caspase 3 7 assays cells were plated and allowed to become adherent for 24 hours. Cells were then treated with Compound T at indicated concentrations or vehicle control for 16 hours at which time the indicated chemotherapy was added to the pretreated cells. For H2AX cells were harvested for analysis 8 hours after chemotherapy exposure. For the H2AX assay cells were fixed permeabilized and stained with anti H2AX as per the H2AX Flow Kit Millipore and quantitated by flow cytometry. Data was analyzed using FlowJo 2.2 software developed by TreeStar Inc. For the in vitro caspase 3 7 assay cells were harvested 24 hours post chemotherapy treatment. Caspase 3 7 activation was measured using the Caspase Glo 3 7 Assay System Promega per manufacturer s recommendations.

As shown in Compound T provides selective protection from carboplatin and etoposide induced cell death. Treatment of tHS68 human fibroblasts with increasing concentrations of Compound T in the presence of etoposide 5 M or carboplatin 100 M selectively induces a dose dependent cell survival as determined by Cell TiterGlo.

Treatment with Compound T prior to treatment with several DNA damaging agents e.g. carboplatin doxorubicin etoposide camptothecin or an anti mitotic paclitaxel attenuated DNA damage as measured by H2AX formation . Additionally treatment of tHDF cells with Compound T prior to carboplatin doxorubicin etoposide camptothecin and paclitaxel exposure elicited a robust decrease in caspase 3 7 activation in a dose dependent manner . These data show that a transient cell cycle arrest in G1 induced by Cdk4 6 inhibition decreases the toxicity of a variety of commonly used cytotoxic chemotherapy agents associated with myelosuppression in Cdk4 6 sensitive cells.

To characterize the effects of Compound T treatment on proliferation of the different mouse hematopoietic cells 8 week old female C57B1 6 mice were given a single dose of vehicle alone 20 Solutol or Compound T 150 mg kg by oral gavage. Ten hours later all mice were given a single i.p. injection of 100 mcg EdU 5 ethynyl 2 deoxyuridine to label cells in S phase of the cell cycle. All treated mice were euthanized 2 hours after EdU injection bone marrow cells were harvested and processed for flow cytometric analysis of EdU incorporation .

In representative contour plots show proliferation in WBM whole bone marrow top and HSPCs hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells LSK bottom as measured by EdU incorporation for cells with no treatment EdU treatment only or EdU plus Compound T treatment. Compound T was found to reduce proliferation of whole bone marrow and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.

Compared to vehicle treated mice Compound T treated mice showed significantly less EdU positive EdU cells in all hematopoietic lineages analyzed. The reduction in EdU cell frequency is most likely due to reduced S phase entry which is consistent with the fact that Compound T potently inhibits Cdk4 6 activity. Overall Compound T treatment caused 70 reduction of EdU cell frequency in unfractionated whole bone marrow cells See and . In the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells HSPC Compound T treatment resulted in potent cell cycle arrest of hematopoietic stem cells HSC 74 inhibition the most primitive cells in the entire hematopoietic lineage hierarchy as well as multipotent progenitors MPP 90 inhibition the immediate downstream progeny of HSCs .

As shown in further down the lineage differentiation hierarchy proliferation of the lineage restricted myeloid CMP GMP and MEP and lymphoid progenitors CLP were also significantly inhibited by Compound T showing between a 76 92 reduction in EdU cell frequency.

Using the same experimental protocol as discussed in Example X above and shown in the effects of Compound T on the proliferation of differentiated hematopoietic cells was investigated. The resulting effect of Compound T in differentiated hematopoietic cells was more variable than that seen in HSPCs. While T and B cell progenitors are highly sensitive to Compound T 99 and 80 reduction in EdU cell frequencies respectively proliferation of differentiated myeloerythroid cells are more resistant to Compound T with Mac1G1 myeloid cells showing 46 reduction in EdU cell frequency and Ter119 erythroid cells showing 58 reduction in EdU cell frequency . Together these data suggest that while all hematopoietic cells are sensitive to Compound T induced cell cycle arrest the degree of inhibition varies among different cell lineages with myeloid cells showing a smaller effect of Compound T on cell proliferation than seen in the other cell lineages.

To assess the effect of transient CDK4 6 inhibition by Compound GG on carboplatin induced cytotoxicity in the bone marrow FVB n mice n 3 per group were treated with vehicle control 90 mg kg carboplatin by intraperitoneal injection or 150 mg kg Compound GG by oral gavage plus 90 mg kg carboplatin by intraperitoneal injection. 24 hours after treatment bone marrow was harvested and the percent of cycling bone marrow progenitors was measured by EdU incorporation as explained earlier. As shown in administration of Compound GG at the same time as carboplatin administration results in a significant protection of bone marrow progenitors. EdU incorporation in control animals was normalized to 100 and compared to EdU incorporation for bone marrow from carboplatin treated animals or carboplatin and Compound GG treated animals.

To determine the ability of Compound T to modulate chemotherapy induced myelosuppression a well characterized single dose 5 fluorouracil 5FU regimen known to be highly myelosuppressive in mice was utilized. FVB n female mice were given single oral doses of vehicle or Compound T at 150 mg kg followed 30 minutes later by a single intraperitoneal dose of 5FU at 150 mg kg. Complete blood cell counts were measured every two days starting on day six.

Co administration of Compound T positively impacted recovery of all hematopoietic lineages from 5 FU induced myelosuppression. demonstrates the time course of recovery of different blood cell types in mice treated with Compound T or vehicle control prior to 5FU administration. It was determined that in each hematopoietic cell lineage tested whole blood cells neutrophils lymphocytes platelets and red blood cells Compound T provided a more rapid recovery of that cells treated only with 5FU. These data show that Compound T treatment likely decreases 5FU induced DNA damage in HSPCs leading to accelerated blood count recovery post chemotherapy.

To determine the ability of Compound T to modulate chemotherapy induced myelosuppression a well characterized 5 fluorouracil 5FU regimen known to be highly myelosuppressive in mice was utilized. 8 week old female C57B1 6 mice were given a single oral dose of vehicle 20 Solutol or Compound T at 150 mg kg followed 30 minutes later by an intraperitoneal dose of 5FU at 150 mg kg. This was repeated every 21 days for 3 cycles. Blood samples were taken for hematology analysis on Day 10 of Cycles 1 3.

Co administration of Compound T reduced the myelosuppression on Day 10 of the third cycle as well as other cycles data not shown . In accordance with the single dose study described above these data show that Compound T treatment likely decreases 5FU induced DNA damage in HSPCs leading to improved hematopoietic blood cell counts.

To test the ability of Cdk4 6 inhibitors to induce a clean G1 arrest in non hematopoietic cells G1 arrest was examined in human renal proximal tubule cells. The cells were treated with Compound T in a dose dependent manner for 24 hours. At the conclusion of the experiment cells were harvested fixed and stained with propidium iodide a DNA intercalator which fluoresces strongly red emission maximum 637 nm when excited by 488 nm light. Samples were run on Dako Cyan flow cytometer. Data were analyzed using FlowJo 2.2 software developed by TreeStar Inc. Assays were run in triplicate and error bars were not detectable. As seen in results show that Compound T induces a robust G1 cell cycle arrest in human renal proximal tubule cells as nearly all cells are found in the G0 G1 phase upon treatment with increasing amounts of Compound T.

The ability of Cdk4 6 inhibitors to protect human renal proximal tubule cells from chemotherapy induced DNA damage was analyzed using etoposide and cisplatin. The cells were treated with Compound T in a dose dependent manner 10 nM 30 nM 100 nM 300 nM or 1000 nM . At the conclusion of the experiment cells were harvested fixed and stained with propidium iodide a DNA intercalator which fluoresces strongly red emission maximum 637 nm when excited by 488 nm light. Samples were run on Dako Cyan flow cytometer. Data were analyzed using FlowJo 2.2 software developed by TreeStar Inc. As seen in results show that Compound T protects renal proximal tubule epithelial cells from chemotherapy induced DNA damage as increasing dosages of Compound T in combination with etoposide or cisplatin cause a decrease in the percentage of S phase cells with a corresponding rise in the percentage of cells in the G0 G1 phase.

In order to demonstrate that pharmacological quiescence induced by CDK4 6 inhibitor treatment affords resistance to chemotherapeutic agents in non hematopoietic cells the protective effect of Compound T on human renal proximal tubule cells was analyzed. Normal renal proximal tubule epithelial cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection ATCC Manassas Va. . Cells were grown in an incubator at 37 C. in a humidified atmosphere of 5 CO2 in Renal Epithelial Cell Basal Media ATCC supplemented with Renal Epithelial Cell Growth Kit ATCC in 37 C. humidified incubator. Cells were treated with either DMSO or 10 nM 30 nM 100 nM 300 nM or 1 uM Compound T in either the absence or presence of 25 uM cisplatin. For the H2AX assay cells were fixed permeabilized and stained with anti H2AX as per the H2AX Flow Kit Millipore and quantitated by flow cytometry. Data was analyzed using FlowJo 2.2 software developed by TreeStar Inc. Caspase 3 7 activation was measured using the Caspase Glo 3 7 Assay System Promega Madison Wis. by following the manufacturer s instructions.

Treatment of renal proximal tubule cells with Compound T in combination with cisplatin attenuated DNA damage as measured by H2AX formation . As seen in DNA damage caused by cisplatin decreased in a dose dependent manner after treatment with Compound T.

The ability of Compound T to protect renal proximal tubule epithelial cells against cisplatin induced apoptosis caspase 3 7 activation was also investigated. As shown in Compound T demonstrated a dose dependent reduction in caspase 3 7 activation in these cells. This reduction in caspase 3 7 activity was seen at all three levels of cisplatin tested 25 uM 50 uM or 100 uM . These data show that a transient cell cycle arrest in G1 induced by Cdk4 6 inhibition can protect renal proximal tubule cells from chemotherapy induced DNA damage.
