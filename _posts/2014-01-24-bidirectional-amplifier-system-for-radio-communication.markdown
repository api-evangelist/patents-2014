The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The present invention relates generally to amplifier systems and more particularly to a bi directional amplifier system supporting transmit and received signal amplification for half duplex mode operation.

In some satellite network communication systems a handset i.e. any microphone earpiece and receiver assembly can be coupled to an antenna via a cable. This is necessary to operate the handset indoors. Many such systems utilize the same frequency for transmit and receive paths in what is known as the half duplex mode of operation. This is true of the well known Iridium satellite telephone system. In these types of systems the length of the cable coupling the handset to the antenna in a half duplex system can be limited by cable losses. Thus physical constraints imposed by an installation configuration for a half duplex communication system places a heavy premium e.g. due to insertion loss limits on antenna and or handset placement in order to prevent losses related to cable length. Unfortunately optimal operational placement is not always compatible with optimal physical placement.

Accordingly it is an object of the present invention to provide a bi directional amplifier for use in a half duplex mode satellite network communications system.

Another object of the present invention is to provide a bi directional amplifier for use in cable coupling a handset to an antenna for half duplex operation that facilitates the use of longer length cables without sacrificing operational effectiveness.

Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become more obvious hereinafter in the specification and drawings.

In accordance with the present invention an amplifier system is provided that can be coupled between a handset and an antenna of a radio frequency RF satellite network communication system. The amplifier system includes a first signal path for amplifying an RF signal received at the antenna. The first signal path routes the RF signal so amplified to the handset when the amplifier system has power supplied thereto. A second signal path is created through the amplifier system when a transmission signal is generated at the handset. When this occurs the first signal path is disrupted and the second signal path amplifies the transmission signal. The second signal path also routes the transmission signal so amplified to the antenna when the amplifier system has power supplied thereto. A third signal path is created through the amplifier system when no power is supplied thereto. When the third signal path is created the first signal path and second signal path are disrupted while the third signal path couples the handset to the antenna.

Referring now to the drawings simultaneous reference will be made to where a bi directional amplifier system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is shown and is referenced generally by the elements contained within dashed line box . Amplifier system supports the coupling of a handset coupled to system at a port A thereof to an antenna coupled to system at a port B thereof of a radio frequency RF based satellite network communication system operating in a half duplex mode i.e. the same frequency being used for transmit and receive signal paths. Amplifier system also supports broadband signal throughput via a bypass mode.

As will be explained further below amplifier system is automatically configured to operate in one of three modes. illustrates amplifier system configured in its default or receive signal mode. illustrates amplifier system configured in its transmit signal mode. illustrates amplifier system in its non energized or bypass mode. The structure of amplifier system supports all three modes of operation.

Amplifier system includes two energizable fail safe switches FSS and that allow amplifier system to be in one of its receive or transmit signal modes when a power source is coupled to amplifier system to energize FSS and as shown in . At the same time FSS and will place amplifier system in its bypass mode when power source is uncoupled from amplifier system or is unavailable thereto.

In the illustrated embodiment each of FSS and can be a single pole double throw switch having a common C port a normally open NO port and a normally closed NC port. As is known in the art of such switches the ports identified by normally indicate the particular port s configuration when no power is applied to the switch. Accordingly the common port is connected to the normally open port when power is supplied to the switch i.e. as in and the common port is connected to the normally closed port when the switch is not energized i.e. as in .

Between FSS and amplifier system defines two signal amplification paths. One signal path referred to hereinafter as the receive signal path provides amplification of signals received by antenna for presentation to handset . The other signal path referenced hereinafter as the transmit signal path provides amplification of signals generated at handset that must be presented to antenna for transmission therefrom. When power is supplied to amplifier system one of these two signal amplification paths is completed while the other is disrupted.

Each of the receive signal path and transmit signal path extends between the normally open port of FSS and the normally open port of FSS . Each signal path includes a coupler circuit coupled to the normally open port of FSS a signal or threshold detector and controller coupled to coupler circuit a first RF circulator coupled to coupler circuit and a second RF circulator coupled to the normally open port of FSS . Detector and controller monitors signal passage through coupler circuit and uses the results of such monitoring to complete and disrupt the appropriate signal amplification paths. Briefly detector and controller has a default condition that completes the receive signal path and disrupts the transmit signal path at all times unless a transmit signal from handset is detected at coupler circuit . When such a transmit signal is detected e.g. via threshold detection the transmit signal path is completed and the receive signal path is disrupted.

RF circulators and are each three port devices operating in a clockwise manner . That is each of RF circulators and supports signal movement from ports to ports to and ports to while not supporting signal movement from ports to ports to and ports to . Such RF circulators and their connections in circuits systems are well understood in the art.

Completion and disruption of receive and transmit signal paths is accomplished by using detector and controller to control switches and disposed in the receive and transmit signal paths. More specifically a switch is disposed in the receive signal path and a switch is disposed in the transmit signal path. In the default receive mode when no transmit signal is present controller closes switch and opens switch . Thus when a signal is received at antenna and power is supplied to amplifier system as shown in the received signal is routed through ports to of RF circulator for amplification by for example a low noise amplifier LNA . The amplified received signal is passed through closed switch and is routed through ports to of RF circulator coupler circuit and FSS for presentation to handset . A power limiter can be disposed between the common port of FSS and handset in order to protect power amplifier from excessive power originating from any transmission device coupled to port A. For example when handset is coupled to port A input power fluctuations can be expected depending on the length of the cable used to connect handset to port A.

In the transmit mode when a transmit signal is detected at coupler circuit detector and controller opens switch and closes switch as illustrated in . Thus when a signal to be transmitted or transmit signal is generated at handset and power is supplied to amplifier system as shown in the transmit signal is routed through ports to of RF circulator for amplification by for example a power amplifier . The amplified transmit signal can be band pass limited by a bandpass filter that prevents unwanted harmonics that can be generated by power amplifier from radiating through amplifier system . The transmit signal is then passed through closed switch and is routed through ports to of RF circulator for presentation to antenna .

The third mode of operation for amplifier system is the bypass mode illustrated in . In this mode there is no power supplied to amplifier system . The removal or absence of such power can be intentional or accidental without departing from the scope of the present invention. The removal of power from FSS and causes each FSS s common port to be coupled to its normally closed port. When this occurs signal movement between ports A and B is supported only by FSS and and power limiter if present . The resulting bypass signal path is broadband in nature because there are no filters amplifiers etc. increasing the frequency range of operation. Accordingly amplifier system could remain in the loop between antenna and for example a receiver which can include a GPS receiver or any other device not requiring amplification coupled to port A.

The advantages of the present invention are numerous. The amplifier system re amplifies RF signals bi directionally to thereby reduce the impact of cable length used to couple a handset to an antenna for an RF based satellite network communication system operating in the half duplex mode. The amplifier system defaults to a receive signal state but additionally re configures to a transmit signal state when needed. The bypass mode allows the amplifier system to be used with broadband transmit receive devices.

It will be understood that many additional changes in the details materials steps and arrangement of parts which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.
