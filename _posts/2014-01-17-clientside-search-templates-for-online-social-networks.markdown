title: Client-side search templates for online social networks
abstract: In one embodiment, a method includes receiving an unstructured text query from a first user of an online social network; and accessing, from a data store of the mobile client system, a set of nodes of a social graph of the online social network. The social graph includes a number of nodes and edges connecting the nodes. The nodes include a first node corresponding to the first user and a number of second nodes that each correspond to a concept or a second user associated with the online social network. The method also includes accessing, from the data store of the mobile client system, a set of grammar templates. Each grammar template includes one or more non-terminal tokens and one or more query tokens. The query tokens include references to zero or more second nodes and one or more edges and each grammar template is based on a natural-language string.

This disclosure generally relates to social graphs and performing searches for objects within a social networking environment.

A social networking system which may include a social networking website may enable its users such as persons or organizations to interact with it and with each other through it. The social networking system may with input from a user create and store in the social networking system a user profile associated with the user. The user profile may include demographic information communication channel information and information on personal interests of the user. The social networking system may also with input from a user create and store a record of relationships of the user with other users of the social networking system as well as provide services e.g. wall posts photo sharing event organization messaging games or advertisements to facilitate social interaction between or among users.

The social networking system may transmit over one or more networks content or messages related to its services to a mobile or other computing device of a user. A user may also install software applications on a mobile or other computing device of the user for accessing a user profile of the user and other data within the social networking system. The social networking system may generate a personalized set of content objects to display to a user such as a newsfeed of aggregated stories of other users connected to the user.

Social graph analysis views social relationships in terms of network theory consisting of nodes and edges. Nodes represent the individual actors within the networks and edges represent the relationships between the actors. The resulting graph based structures are often very complex. There can be many types of nodes and many types of edges for connecting nodes. In its simplest form a social graph is a map of all of the relevant edges between all the nodes being studied.

In particular embodiments a method may parse a unstructured text query using grammar templates and entities stored client side. Instead of using a full grammar model to generate suggested queries client side the suggested queries can be generated using a set of pre defined templates and social graph entities stored on the client. A pre determined number of grammar templates and high coefficient entities can be stored client side so that suggested queries can be quickly generated client side in response to text inputs from a user. These stored templates and entities may cover 90 or more of the queries run by users. The stored grammar templates may be determined based on globally popular queries and or personalize templates based on queries that are popular with the user which may then be converted into templates. Popular queries templates may include for example Friends of user Photos of user or Friends who live near location . The stored entities may be determined by pre selecting particular entity types e.g. all the user s friends pages administered by the user groups the user belongs to events the user has signed up for and apps the user has loaded and or by selecting a threshold number of entities having the highest affinity.

In particular embodiments when a user enters a text string into a query field the client side app will align that text string against the stored templates and compute the cost for each template. Essentially cost is determined by penalizing each template for each deviation the text string makes from the template missing words word variations etc. . The lowest cost templates are then determined to be the best matches. The highest ranked templates may then displayed to the user as suggested queries. Similarly the text string may be parsed to identify entities that match portions of the text string. For example if a user types in the text query friends of f the client side app may access a stored grammar template for friends of user and match that up to the stored entity for the user Fred thus suggesting the structured query friends of Fred . Alternatively the client side app may match the text query to the grammar template friends of friends of user and suggest the partial structured query friends of friends of . . . which the user could select and then continue entering text.

In particular embodiments a user node may correspond to a first user of social networking system . As an example and not by way of limitation a user may be an individual human user an entity e.g. an enterprise business or third party application or a group e.g. of individuals or entities that interacts or communicates with or over social networking system . In particular embodiments when a first user registers for an account with social networking system social networking system may create a first user node corresponding to the user and store the user node in one or more data stores. Users and user nodes described herein may where appropriate refer to registered users and user nodes associated with registered users. In addition or as an alternative users and user nodes described herein may where appropriate refer to users that have not registered with social networking system .

As an example and not by way of limitation a user may provide his or her name profile picture contact information birth date sex marital status family status employment education background preferences interests or other demographic information. In particular embodiments a user node may be associated with one or more data objects corresponding to information associated with a user. In particular embodiments a user node may correspond to one or more webpages.

In particular embodiments a concept node may correspond to a concept. As an example and not by way of limitation a concept may correspond to a place such as for example a movie theater restaurant landmark or city a website such as for example a website associated with social network system or a third party website associated with a web application server an entity such as for example a person business group sports team or celebrity a resource such as for example an audio file video file digital photo text file structured document or application which may be located within social networking system or on an external server such as a web application server real or intellectual property such as for example a sculpture painting movie game song idea photograph or written work a game an activity an idea or theory another suitable concept or two or more such concepts. A concept node may be associated with information of a concept provided by a user or information gathered by various systems including social networking system . As an example and not by way of limitation information of a concept may include a name or a title one or more images e.g. an image of the cover page of a book a location e.g. an address or a geographical location a website which may be associated with a URL contact information e.g. a phone number or an email address other suitable concept information or any suitable combination of such information. In particular embodiments a concept node may be associated with one or more data objects corresponding to information associated with concept node . In particular embodiments a concept node may correspond to one or more webpages.

In particular embodiments a node in social graph may represent or be represented by a webpage which may be referred to as a profile page . Profile pages may be hosted by or accessible to social networking system . Profile pages may also be hosted on third party websites associated with a third party server . As an example and not by way of limitation a profile page corresponding to a particular external webpage may be the particular external webpage and the profile page may correspond to a particular concept node . Profile pages may be viewable by all or a selected subset of other users. As an example and not by way of limitation a user node may have a corresponding user profile page in which the corresponding user may add content make declarations or otherwise express himself or herself. As another example and not by way of limitation a concept node may have a corresponding concept profile page in which one or more users may add content make declarations or express themselves particularly in relation to the concept corresponding to concept node .

In particular embodiments a concept node may represent a third party webpage or resource hosted by a third party system . The third party webpage or resource may include among other elements content a selectable or other icon or other inter actable object which may be implemented for example in JavaScript AJAX or PHP codes representing an action or activity. As an example and not by way of limitation a third party webpage may include a selectable icon such as like check in eat recommend or another suitable action or activity. A user viewing the third party webpage may perform an action by selecting one of the icons e.g. eat causing a client system to transmit to social networking system a message indicating the user s action. In response to the message social networking system may create an edge e.g. an eat edge between a user node corresponding to the user and a concept node corresponding to the third party webpage or resource and store edge in one or more data stores.

In particular embodiments a pair of nodes in social graph may be connected to each other by one or more edges . An edge connecting a pair of nodes may represent a relationship between the pair of nodes. In particular embodiments an edge may include or represent one or more data objects or attributes corresponding to the relationship between a pair of nodes. As an example and not by way of limitation a first user may indicate that a second user is a friend of the first user. In response to this indication social networking system may transmit a friend request to the second user. If the second user confirms the friend request social networking system may create an edge connecting the first user s user node to the second user s user node in social graph and store edge as social graph information in one or more of data stores . In the example of social graph includes an edge indicating a friend relation between user nodes of user A and user B and an edge indicating a friend relation between user nodes of user C and user B. Although this disclosure describes or illustrates particular edges with particular attributes connecting particular user nodes this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges with any suitable attributes connecting user nodes . As an example and not by way of limitation an edge may represent a friendship family relationship business or employment relationship fan relationship follower relationship visitor relationship subscriber relationship superior subordinate relationship reciprocal relationship non reciprocal relationship another suitable type of relationship or two or more such relationships. Moreover although this disclosure generally describes nodes as being connected this disclosure also describes users or concepts as being connected. Herein references to users or concepts being connected may where appropriate refer to the nodes corresponding to those users or concepts being connected in social graph by one or more edges .

In particular embodiments an edge between a user node and a concept node may represent a particular action or activity performed by a user associated with user node toward a concept associated with a concept node . As an example and not by way of limitation as illustrated in a user may like attended played listened cooked worked at or watched a concept each of which may correspond to a edge type or subtype. A concept profile page corresponding to a concept node may include for example a selectable check in icon such as for example a clickable check in icon or a selectable add to favorites icon. Similarly after a user clicks these icons social networking system may create a favorite edge or a check in edge in response to a user s action corresponding to a respective action. As another example and not by way of limitation a user user C may listen to a particular song Imagine using a particular application SPOTIFY which is an online music application . In this case social networking system may create a listened edge and a used edge as illustrated in between user nodes corresponding to the user and concept nodes corresponding to the song and application to indicate that the user listened to the song and used the application. Moreover social networking system may create a played edge as illustrated in between concept nodes corresponding to the song and the application to indicate that the particular song was played by the particular application. In this case played edge corresponds to an action performed by an external application SPOTIFY on an external audio file the song Imagine . Although this disclosure describes particular edges with particular attributes connecting user nodes and concept nodes this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges with any suitable attributes connecting user nodes and concept nodes . Moreover although this disclosure describes edges between a user node and a concept node representing a single relationship this disclosure contemplates edges between a user node and a concept node representing one or more relationships. As an example and not by way of limitation an edge may represent both that a user likes and has used at a particular concept. Alternatively another edge may represent each type of relationship or multiples of a single relationship between a user node and a concept node as illustrated in between user node for user E and concept node for SPOTIFY .

In particular embodiments social networking system may create an edge between a user node and a concept node in social graph . As an example and not by way of limitation a user viewing a concept profile page such as for example by using a web browser or a special purpose application hosted by the user s client system may indicate that he or she likes the concept represented by the concept node by clicking or selecting a Like icon which may cause the user s client system to transmit to social networking system a message indicating the user s liking of the concept associated with the concept profile page. In response to the message social networking system may create an edge between user node associated with the user and concept node as illustrated by like edge between the user and concept node . In particular embodiments social networking system may store an edge in one or more data stores. In particular embodiments an edge may be automatically formed by social networking system in response to a particular user action. As an example and not by way of limitation if a first user uploads a picture watches a movie or listens to a song an edge may be formed between user node corresponding to the first user and concept nodes corresponding to those concepts. Although this disclosure describes forming particular edges in particular manners this disclosure contemplates forming any suitable edges in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments one or more client side and or backend server side processes may implement and utilize a typeahead feature that may automatically attempt to match social graph elements e.g. user nodes concept nodes or edges to information currently being entered by a user in an input form rendered in conjunction with a requested webpage such as for example a user profile page a concept profile page a search results webpage or another suitable page of the online social network which may be hosted by or accessible in the social networking system . In particular embodiments as a user is entering text to make a declaration the typeahead feature may attempt to match the string of textual characters being entered in the declaration to strings of characters e.g. names descriptions corresponding to user concepts or edges and their corresponding elements in the social graph . In particular embodiments when a match is found the typeahead feature may automatically populate the form with a reference to the social graph element such as for example the node name type node ID edge name type edge ID or another suitable reference or identifier of the existing social graph element.

In particular embodiments as a user types or otherwise enters text into a form used to add content or make declarations in various sections of the user s profile page home page or other page the typeahead process may work in conjunction with one or more frontend client side and or backend server side typeahead processes hereinafter referred to simply as typeahead process executing at or within the social networking system e.g. within servers to interactively and virtually instantaneously as appearing to the user attempt to auto populate the form with a term or terms corresponding to names of existing social graph elements or terms associated with existing social graph elements determined to be the most relevant or best match to the characters of text entered by the user as the user enters the characters of text. Utilizing the social graph information in a social graph database or information extracted and indexed from the social graph database including information associated with nodes and edges the typeahead processes in conjunction with the information from the social graph database as well as potentially in conjunction with various others processes applications or databases located within or executing within social networking system may be able to predict a user s intended declaration with a high degree of precision. However the social networking system can also provide users with the freedom to enter essentially any declaration they wish enabling users to express themselves freely.

In particular embodiments as a user enters text characters into a form box or other field the typeahead processes may attempt to identify existing social graph elements e.g. user nodes concept nodes or edges that match the string of characters entered in the user s declaration as the user is entering the characters. In particular embodiments as the user enters characters into a form box the typeahead process may read the string of entered textual characters. As each keystroke is made the frontend typeahead process may transmit the entered character string as a request or call to the backend typeahead process executing within social networking system . In particular embodiments the typeahead processes may communicate via AJAX Asynchronous JavaScript and XML or other suitable techniques and particularly asynchronous techniques. In particular embodiments the request may be or comprise an XMLHTTPRequest XHR enabling quick and dynamic sending and fetching of results. In particular embodiments the typeahead process may also transmit before after or with the request a section identifier section ID that identifies the particular section of the particular page in which the user is making the declaration. In particular embodiments a user ID parameter may also be sent but this may be unnecessary in some embodiments as the user may already be known based on the user having logged into or otherwise been authenticated by the social networking system .

In particular embodiments the typeahead process may use one or more matching algorithms to attempt to identify matching social graph elements. In particular embodiments when a match or matches are found the typeahead process may transmit a response which may utilize AJAX or other suitable techniques to the user s client system that may include for example the names name strings or descriptions of the matching social graph elements as well as potentially other metadata associated with the matching social graph elements. As an example and not by way of limitation if a user entering the characters pok into a query field the typeahead process may display a drop down menu that displays names of matching existing profile pages and respective user nodes or concept nodes such as a profile page named or devoted to poker or pokemon which the user can then click on or otherwise select thereby confirming the desire to declare the matched user or concept name corresponding to the selected node. As another example and not by way of limitation upon clicking poker the typeahead process may auto populate or causes the web browser to auto populate the query field with the declaration poker . In particular embodiments the typeahead process may simply auto populate the field with the name or other identifier of the top ranked match rather than display a drop down menu. The user may then confirm the auto populated declaration simply by keying enter on his or her keyboard or by clicking on the auto populated declaration.

More information on typeahead processes may be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 763 162 filed 19 Apr. 2010 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 556 072 filed 23 Jul. 2012 which are incorporated by reference.

In particular embodiments the typeahead processes described herein may be applied to search queries entered by a user. As an example and not by way of limitation as a user enters text characters into a search field a typeahead process may attempt to identify one or more user nodes concept nodes or edges that match the string of characters entered search field as the user is entering the characters. As the typeahead process receives requests or calls including a string or n gram from the text query the typeahead process may perform or causes to be performed a search to identify existing social graph elements i.e. user nodes concept nodes edges having respective names types categories or other identifiers matching the entered text. The typeahead process may use one or more matching algorithms to attempt to identify matching nodes or edges. When a match or matches are found the typeahead process may transmit a response to the user s client system that may include for example the names name strings of the matching nodes as well as potentially other metadata associated with the matching nodes. The typeahead process may then display a drop down menu that displays names of matching existing profile pages and respective user nodes or concept nodes and displays names of matching edges that may connect to the matching user nodes or concept nodes which the user can then click on or otherwise select thereby confirming the desire to search for the matched user or concept name corresponding to the selected node or to search for users or concepts connected to the matched users or concepts by the matching edges. Alternatively the typeahead process may simply auto populate the form with the name or other identifier of the top ranked match rather than display a drop down menu . The user may then confirm the auto populated declaration simply by keying enter on a keyboard or by clicking on the auto populated declaration. Upon user confirmation of the matching nodes and edges the typeahead process may transmit a request that informs the social networking system of the user s confirmation of a query containing the matching social graph elements. In response to the request transmitted the social networking system may automatically or alternately based on an instruction in the request call or otherwise search a social graph database for the matching social graph elements or for social graph elements connected to the matching social graph elements as appropriate. Although this disclosure describes applying the typeahead processes to search queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates applying the typeahead processes to search queries in any suitable manner.

In connection with search queries and search results particular embodiments may utilize one or more systems components elements functions methods operations or steps disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 503 093 filed 11 Aug. 2006 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 977 027 filed 22 Dec. 2010 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 978 265 filed 23 Dec. 2010 which are incorporated by reference.

In particular embodiments in response to a structured query received from a querying user the social networking system may generate one or more search results where each search result matches or substantially matches the terms of the structured query. The social networking system may receive a structured query from a querying user. In response to the structured query the social networking system may generate one or more search results corresponding to the structured query. Each search result may include link to a profile page and a description or summary of the profile page or the node corresponding to that page . The search results may be presented and transmitted to the querying user as a search results page. The structured query used to generate a particular search results page is shown in query field and the various search results generated in response to the structured query are illustrated in a field for presented search results. In particular embodiments the query field may also serve as the title bar for the page. In other words the title bar and query field may effectively be a unified field on the search results page. The search results page may also include a field for modifying search results and a field for providing suggested searches. When generating the search results the social networking system may generate one or more snippets for each search result where the snippets are contextual information about the target of the search result i.e. contextual information about the social graph entity profile page or other content corresponding to the particular search result . Although this disclosure describes and illustrates particular search results pages this disclosure contemplates any suitable search results pages.

More information on generating search results may be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 731 939 filed 31 Dec. 2012 which is incorporated by reference.

This disclosure contemplates any suitable network and any suitable communication component for it. As an example and not by way of limitation mobile client system may communicate with an ad hoc network a personal area network PAN a local area network LAN a wide area network WAN a metropolitan area network MAN or one or more portions of the Internet or a combination of two or more of these. One or more portions of one or more of these networks may be wired or wireless. As another example mobile client system may communicate with a wireless PAN WPAN such as for example a BLUETOOTH WPAN a WI FI network a WI MAX network a cellular telephone network such as for example a Global System for Mobile Communications GSM 3G or LTE network or other suitable wireless network or a combination of two or more of these. Mobile client system may include any suitable communication component for any of these networks where appropriate.

In particular embodiments in response to a text query received from a first user i.e. the querying user the mobile client system may generate one or more structured queries rendered in a natural language syntax where each structured query includes query tokens that correspond to one or more identified social graph elements. Structured queries may allow a querying user to search for content that is connected to particular users or concepts in the social graph by particular edge types. As an example and not by way of limitation the mobile client system may receive an unstructured text query from a first user. In response the mobile client system via for example a server side element detection process may access the social graph and then parse the text query to identify social graph elements that corresponded to n grams from the text query. The mobile client system may then access a grammar model such as a context free grammar model which includes a plurality of grammar templates described below. The identified social graph elements may be used as terminal tokens query tokens in the grammar templates. The selected grammar templates may then be used to generate one or more structured queries that include the query tokens referencing the identified social graph elements. These structured queries may be based on strings generated by the grammar templates such that they are rendered with references to the appropriate social graph elements using a natural language syntax. The structured queries may be displayed in a drop down menu via for example a client side typeahead process where the first user can then select an appropriate query to search for the desired content. Some of the advantages of using the structured queries described herein include finding users of the online social network based upon limited information bringing together virtual indexes of content from the online social network based on the relation of that content to various social graph elements or finding content related to you and or your friends. By using this process the output of the natural language rendering process may be efficiently parsed for example to generate modified or alternative structured queries. Furthermore since the rules used by this process are derived from the grammar model any modification to the rules of the grammar model can be immediately reflected in the rendering process. Although this disclosure describes and illustrates generating particular structured queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates generating any suitable structured queries in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments the mobile client system may receive from a querying first user corresponding to a first user node an unstructured text query. As an example and not by way of limitation a first user may want to search for other users who 1 are first degree friends of the first user and 2 are associated with Stanford University i.e. the user nodes are connected by an edge to the concept node corresponding to the school Stanford . The first user may then enter a text query friends stanford into search query field . As used herein reference to an unstructured text query may refer to a simple text string inputted by a user. The text query may of course be structured with respect to standard language grammar rules e.g. English language grammar . However the text query will ordinarily be unstructured with respect to social graph elements. In other words a simple text query will not ordinarily include embedded references to particular social graph elements. Thus as used herein a structured query refers to a query that contains references to particular social graph elements allowing the search engine to search based on the identified elements. Furthermore the text query may be unstructured with respect to formal query syntax. In other words a simple text query will not necessarily be in the format of a query command that is directly executable by a search engine. Although this disclosure describes receiving particular queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates receiving any suitable queries in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments mobile client system may parse the unstructured text query also simply referred to as a search query received from the first user i.e. the querying user to identify one or more n grams. In general an n gram is a contiguous sequence of n items from a given sequence of text or speech. The items may be characters phonemes syllables letters words base pairs prefixes or other identifiable items from the sequence of text or speech. The n gram may comprise one or more characters of text letters numbers punctuation etc. entered by the querying user. An n gram of size one can be referred to as a unigram of size two can be referred to as a bigram or digram of size three can be referred to as a trigram and so on. Each n gram may include one or more parts from the text query received from the querying user. In particular embodiments each n gram may comprise a character string e.g. one or more characters of text entered by the first user. As an example and not by way of limitation the mobile client system may parse the text query friends stanford to identify the following n grams friends stanford friends stanford. As another example and not by way of limitation the mobile client system may parse the text query friends in palo alto to identify the following n grams friends in palo alto friends in in palo palo alto friend in palo in palo also friends in palo alto. In particular embodiments each n gram may comprise a contiguous sequence of n items from the text query. Although this disclosure describes parsing particular queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates parsing any suitable queries in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments mobile client system may determine or calculate for each n gram identified in the text query a score to determine whether the n gram corresponds to a social graph element. The score may be for example a confidence score a probability a quality a ranking another suitable type of score or any combination thereof. As an example and not by way of limitation the mobile client system may determine a probability score also referred to simply as a probability that the n gram corresponds to a social graph element such as a user node a concept node or an edge of social graph . The probability score may indicate the level of similarity or relevance between the n gram and a particular social graph element. There may be many different ways to calculate the probability. The present disclosure contemplates any suitable method to calculate a probability score for an n gram identified in a search query. In particular embodiments the mobile client system may determine a probability p that an n gram corresponds to a particular social graph element. The probability p may be calculated as the probability of corresponding to a particular social graph element k given a particular search query X. In other words the probability may be calculated as p k X . As an example and not by way of limitation a probability that an n gram corresponds to a social graph element may calculated as an probability score denoted as p. The input may be a text query X x x . . . x and a set of classes. For each i j and a class k the mobile client system may compute p p class x k X . As an example and not by way of limitation the n gram stanford could be scored with respect to the following social graph elements as follows school Stanford University 0.7 location Stanford California 0.2 user Allen Stanford 0.1. As another example and not by way of limitation the n gram friends could be scored with respect to the following social graph elements as follows user friends 0.9 television show Friends 0.1. In particular embodiments the mobile client system may use a forward backward algorithm to determine the probability that a particular n gram corresponds to a particular social graph element. For a given n gram within a text query the mobile client system may use both the preceding and succeeding n grams to determine which particular social graph elements correspond to the given n gram. In particular embodiments the identified social graph elements may be used to generate a query command that is executable by a search engine. The query command may be a structured semantic query with defined functions that accept specific arguments. As an example and not by way of limitation the text query friend me mark could be parsed to form the query command intersect friend me friend Mark . In other words the query is looking for nodes in the social graph that intersect the querying user me and the user Mark i.e. those user nodes that are connected to both the user node of the querying user by a friend type edge and the user node for the user Mark by a friend type edge . Although this disclosure describes determining whether n grams correspond to social graph elements in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates determining whether n grams correspond to social graph elements in any suitable manner. Moreover although this disclosure describes determining whether an n gram corresponds to a social graph element using a particular type of score this disclosure contemplates determining whether an n gram corresponds to a social graph element using any suitable type of score.

In particular embodiments mobile client system may identify one or more edges having a probability greater than an edge threshold probability. Each of the identified edges may correspond to at least one of the n grams. As an example and not by way of limitation the n gram may only be identified as corresponding to an edge k if p p. Furthermore each of the identified edges may be connected to at least one of the identified nodes. In other words the mobile client system may only identify edges or edge types that are connected to user nodes or concept nodes that have previously been identified as corresponding to a particular n gram. Edges or edge types that are not connected to any previously identified node are typically unlikely to correspond to a particular n gram in a search query. By filtering out or ignoring these edges and edge types the mobile client system may more efficiently search the social graph for relevant social graph elements. As an example and not by way of limitation referencing for a text query containing went to Stanford where an identified concept node is the school Stanford the mobile client system may identify the edges corresponding to worked at and the edges corresponding to attended both of which are connected to the concept node for Stanford. Thus the n gram went to may be identified as corresponding to these edges . However for the same text query the mobile client system may not identify the edges corresponding to like or fan in the social graph because the Stanford node does not have any such edges connected to it. Although this disclosure describes identifying edges that correspond to n grams in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates identifying edges that correspond to n grams in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments mobile client system may identify one or more user nodes or concept nodes having a probability greater than a node threshold probability. Each of the identified nodes may correspond to at least one of the n grams. As an example and not by way of limitation the n gram may only be identified as corresponding to a node k if p p. Furthermore each of the identified user nodes or concept nodes may be connected to at least one of the identified edges . In other words the mobile client system may only identify nodes or nodes types that are connected to edges that have previously been identified as corresponding to a particular n gram. Nodes or node types that are not connected to any previously identified edges are typically unlikely to correspond to a particular n gram in a search query. By filtering out or ignoring these nodes and node types the mobile client system may more efficiently search the social graph for relevant social graph elements. As an example and not by way of limitation for a text query containing worked at Apple where an identified edge is worked at the mobile client system may identify the concept node corresponding to the company APPLE INC. which may have multiple edges of worked at connected to it. However for the same text query the mobile client system may not identify the concept node corresponding to the fruit type apple which may have multiple like or fan edges connected to it but no worked at edge connections. In particular embodiments the node threshold probability may differ for user nodes and concept nodes and may differ even among these nodes e.g. some concept nodes may have different node threshold probabilities than other concept nodes . As an example and not by way of limitation an n gram may be identified as corresponding to a user node k if p pwhile an n gram may be identified as corresponding to a concept node k if p p. In particular embodiments the mobile client system may only identify nodes that are within a threshold degree of separation of the user node corresponding to the first user i.e. the querying user . The threshold degree of separation may be for example one two three or all. Although this disclosure describes identifying nodes that correspond to n grams in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates identifying nodes that correspond to n grams in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments the mobile client system may access a plurality of grammar templates. Each grammar template may comprise one or more non terminal tokens or non terminal symbols and one or more terminal tokens or terminal symbols query tokens where particular non terminal tokens may be replaced by terminal tokens. A grammar model is a set of formation rules for strings in a formal language. Although this disclosure describes accessing particular grammar templates this disclosure contemplates any suitable grammars.

In particular embodiments the mobile client system may generate one or more strings using one or more grammar templates. The non terminal symbols may be replaced with terminal symbols i.e. terminal tokens or query tokens . Some of the query tokens may correspond to identified nodes or identified edges as described previously. A string generated by the grammar template may then be used as the basis for a structured query containing references to the identified nodes or identified edges. The string generated by the grammar may be rendered in a natural language syntax such that a structured query based on the string is also rendered in natural language. A context free grammar is a grammar in which the left hand side of each production rule consists of only a single non terminal symbol. A probabilistic context free grammar is a tuple N S P where the disjoint sets and N specify the terminal and non terminal symbols respectively with S N being the start symbol. P is the set of productions which take the form E p with E N N and p Pr E the probability that E will be expanded into the string . The sum of probabilities p over all expansions of a given non terminal E must be one. Although this disclosure describes generating strings in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates generating strings in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments the mobile client system may identify one or more query tokens corresponding to the previously identified nodes and edges. In other words if an identified node or identified edge may be used as a query token in a particular grammar template that query token may be identified by the mobile client system . As an example and not by way of limitation an example grammar template may be user user filter school . The non terminal tokens user user filter and school could then be determined based n grams in the received text query. For the text query friends stanford this query could be parsed by using the grammar template as for example friends who go to Stanford University or friends who work at Stanford University . As another example and not by way of limitation an example grammar template may be user user filter location . For the text query friends stanford this query could be parsed by using the grammar template for example friends who live in Stanford California . In both the example cases above if the n grams of the received text query could be used as query tokens then these query tokens may be identified by the mobile client system . Although this disclosure describes identifying particular query tokens in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates identifying any suitable query tokens in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments when the user inputs one or more text characters in search query field a program or application executed on mobile client system may match the text characters against grammar templates pre loaded on mobile client system . As described below mobile client system may then search a data store of mobile client system to access grammar templates to determine one or more matches the query. As an example and not by way of limitation the application executed on mobile client system may perform the matching of the inputted text characters to the grammar templates after each keystroke. As another example the inputted text may be parsed into one or more n grams described above. In particular embodiments the matching may be part of a client side typeahead process. In particular embodiments mobile client system may identify one or more structured queries based at least in part on matching input text to one or more grammar templates or data identifying social graph entities that are stored on mobile client system .

In particular embodiments the mobile client system may select one or more grammar templates having at least one query token corresponding to each of the previously identified nodes and edges. Only particular grammar templates may be used depending on the n grams identified in the text query. So the terminal tokens of all available grammar templates should be examined to find those that match the identified n grams from the text query. In other words if a particular grammar template can use all of the identified nodes and edges as query tokens that grammar template may be selected by the mobile client system as a possible grammar template to use for generating a structured query. This is effectively a type of bottom up parsing where the possible query tokens are used to determine the applicable grammar template to apply to the query. As an example and not by way of limitation for the text query friends stanford mobile client system may identify the query tokens of friends and Stanford University . Terminal tokens of the grammar templates may be identified as previously discussed. Any grammar template that is able to use both the friends and the Stanford University tokens may then be selected. For example the grammar template user user filter school may be selected because this grammar template could use the friends and the Stanford University tokens as query tokens such as by forming the strings friends who go to Stanford University or friends who work at Stanford University . Thus if the n grams of the received text query could be used as query tokens in the grammar templates then these grammar templates may be selected by the mobile client system . Similarly if the received text query comprises n grams that could not be used as query tokens in the grammar that grammar may not be selected. Although this disclosure describes selecting particular grammar templates in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates selecting any suitable grammar templates in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments the mobile client system may determine a score for each selected grammar template. The score may be for example a confidence score a probability a quality a ranking another suitable type of score or any combination thereof. The score may be based on the individual scores or probabilities associated with the query tokens used in the selected grammar. A grammar may have a higher relative score if it uses query tokens with relatively higher individual scores. As an example and not by way of limitation continuing with the prior examples the n gram stanford could be scored with respect to the following social graph elements as follows school Stanford University 0.7 location Stanford California 0.2 user Allen Stanford 0.1. The n gram friends could be scored with respect to the following social graph elements as follows user friends 0.9 television show Friends 0.1. Thus the grammar template user user filter may have a relatively high score if it uses the query tokens for the user friends and the school Stanford University generating for example the string friends who go to Stanford University both of which have relatively high individual scores. In contrast the grammar user user filter user may have relatively low score if it uses the query tokens for the user friends and the user Allen Stanford generating for example the string friends of Allen Stanford since the latter query token has a relatively low individual score. Although this disclosure describes determining particular scores for particular grammars in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates determining any suitable scores for any suitable grammars in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments the mobile client system may determine the score for a selected grammar template based on the relevance of the social graph elements corresponding to the query tokens of the grammar template to the querying user i.e. the first user corresponding to a first user node . User nodes and concept nodes that are connected to the first user node directly by an edge may be considered relevant to the first user. Thus grammar templates comprising query tokens corresponding to these relevant nodes and edges may be considered more relevant to the querying user. As an example and not by way of limitation a concept node connected by an edge to a first user node may be considered relevant to the first user node . As used herein when referencing a social graph the term connected means a path exists within the social graph between two nodes wherein the path may comprise one or more edges and zero or more intermediary nodes. In particular embodiments nodes that are connected to the first user node via one or more intervening nodes and therefore two or more edges may also be considered relevant to the first user. Furthermore in particular embodiments the closer the second node is to the first user node the more relevant the second node may be considered to the first user node. That is the fewer edges separating the first user node from a particular user node or concept node i.e. the fewer degrees of separation the more relevant that user node or concept node may be considered to the first user. As an example and not by way of limitation as illustrated in the concept node corresponding to the school Stanford is connected to the user node corresponding to User C and thus the concept Stanford may be considered relevant to User C. As another example and not by way of limitation the user node corresponding to User A is connected to the user node corresponding to User C via one intermediate node and two edges i.e. the intermediated user node corresponding to User B and thus User A may be considered relevant to User C but because the user node for User A is a second degree connection with respect to User C that particular concept node may be considered less relevant than a user node that is connected to the user node for User C by a single edge such as for example the user node corresponding to User B. As yet another example and not by way of limitation the concept node for Online Poker which may correspond to an online multiplayer game is not connected to the user node for User C by any pathway in social graph and thus the concept Online Poker may not be considered relevant to User C. In particular embodiments a second node may only be considered relevant to the first user if the second node is within a threshold degree of separation of the first user node . As an example and not by way of limitation if the threshold degree of separation is three then the user node corresponding to User D may be considered relevant to the concept node corresponding to the recipe Chicken Parmesan which are within three degrees of each other on social graph illustrated in . However continuing with this example the concept node corresponding to the application All About Recipes would not be considered relevant to the user node corresponding to User D because these nodes are four degrees apart in the social graph . Although this disclosure describes determining whether particular social graph elements and thus their corresponding query tokens are relevant to each other in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates determining whether any suitable social graph elements are relevant to each other in any suitable manner. Moreover although this disclosure describes determining whether particular query tokens corresponding to user nodes and concept nodes are relevant to a querying user this disclosure contemplates similarly determining whether any suitable query token and thus any suitable node is relevant to any other suitable user.

In particular embodiments the mobile client system may determine the score for a selected grammar template based social graph information corresponding to the query tokens of the grammar. As an example and not by way of limitation when determining a probability p that an n gram corresponds to a particular social graph element the calculation of the probability may also factor in social graph information. Thus the probability of corresponding to a particular social graph element k given a particular search query X and social graph information G may be calculated as p k X G . The individual probabilities for the identified nodes and edges may then be used to determine the score for a grammar template using those social graph elements as query tokens. In particular embodiments the score for a selected grammar may be based on the degree of separation between the first user node and the particular social graph element used as a query token in the grammar template. Grammar templates with query tokens corresponding to social graph elements that are closer in the social graph to the querying user i.e. fewer degrees of separation between the element and the first user node may be scored more highly than grammars using query tokens corresponding to social graph elements that are further from the user i.e. more degrees of separation . As an example and not by way of limitation referencing if user B inputs a text query of chicken a grammar with a query token corresponding to the concept node for the recipe Chicken Parmesan which is connected to user B by an edge may have a relatively higher score than a grammar template with a query token corresponding to other nodes associated with the n gram chicken e.g. concept nodes corresponding to chicken nuggets or funky chicken dance that are not connected to user B in the social graph . In particular embodiments the score for a selected grammar template may be based on the identified edges corresponding to the query tokens of the grammar template. If the mobile client system has already identified one or more edges that correspond to n grams in a received text query those identified edges may then be considered when determining the score for a particular parsing of the text query by the grammar template. If a particular grammar template comprises query tokens that correspond to both identified nodes and identified edges if the identified nodes are not actually connected to any of the identified edges that particular grammar template may be assigned a zero or null score. In particular embodiments the score for a selected grammar template may be based on the number of edges connected to the nodes corresponding to query tokens of the grammar template. Grammar templates comprising query tokens that corresponding to nodes with more connecting edges may be more popular and more likely to be a target of a search query. As an example and not by way of limitation if the concept node for Stanford California is only connected by five edges while the concept node for Stanford University is connected by five thousand edges when determining the score for grammars containing query tokens corresponding to either of these nodes the mobile client system may determine that the grammar template with a query token corresponding to the concept node for Stanford University has a relatively higher score than a grammar template referencing the concept node for Stanford California because of the greater number of edges connected to the former concept node . In particular embodiments the score for a selected grammar may be based on the search history associate with the first user i.e. the querying user . Grammar templates with query tokens corresponding to nodes that the first user has previously accessed or are relevant to the nodes the first user has previously accessed may be more likely to be the target of the first user s search query. Thus these grammar templates may be given a higher score. As an example and not by way of limitation if first user has previously visited the Stanford University profile page but has never visited the Stanford California profile page when determining the score for grammar templates with query tokens corresponding to these concepts the mobile client system may determine that the concept node for Stanford University has a relatively high score and thus the grammar template using the corresponding query token because the querying user has previously accessed the concept node for the school. As another example and not by way of limitation if the first user has previously visited the concept profile page for the television show Friends when determining the score for the grammar template with the query token corresponding to that concept the mobile client system may determine that the concept node corresponding to the television show Friends has a relatively high score and thus the grammar template using the corresponding query token because the querying user has previously accessed the concept node for that television show. Although this disclosure describes determining scores for particular grammar templates based on particular social graph information in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates determining scores for any suitable grammar templates based on any suitable social graph information in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments the social graph entities stored on mobile client system may be determined by pre selecting particular types of social graph entities e.g. popular entities . As an example the social graph entities of each user stored on mobile client system may correspond to friends of the user pages of the user groups of the user events of the user applications installed by the user on mobile client system or any combination thereof. For example pages of the user may include entities associated with the user such as for example the hometown alma mater employer etc. of the user. In particular embodiments the pre determined number of social graph entities may be first degree social graph entities e.g. concept nodes or user nodes connected to the user node of the user by an edge or high coefficient entities of each user.

In particular embodiments the grammar templates may be based on a natural language string such as for example friends of user or friends who live near city . One or more grammar templates stored in a data store of mobile client system may be identified constructed based at least in part on an analysis of search queries performed on social networking system e.g. through deconstruction of popular Graph Search queries . As an example and not by way of limitation a log of search queries on social networking system may be analyzed to identify a pre determined number of the most popular search queries. As another example a ranking of the identified search queries may be personalized for each user based at least in part on a search query history of each user. In particular embodiments the identified search queries may be converted into grammar templates as natural language strings without one or more social graph entities associated with the search queries which may instead by substituted with non terminal tokens in the grammar template.

In particular embodiments the type of each stored social graph entity may be used to determine the relevance of the stored social graph entity to a particular non terminal token of one or more grammar templates. As an example and not by way of limitation the type of stored social graph entity relevant to grammar template photos of user may be a type that corresponds to friends of the user. As another example the type of social graph entity relevant to a non terminal token location may be a type that corresponds to pages e.g. hometown of the user. Furthermore the grammar templates and data associated with social graph entities may be sent to and pre loaded on mobile client system prior to the user inputting text in search query field . In particular embodiments the pre defined grammar templates and social graph entities for each user may be re evaluated and updated by social networking system at pre determined intervals e.g. once a week . As an example and not by way of limitation social networking system may send the updated grammar templates or data identifying the social graph entities at the pre determined intervals to mobile client system .

In particular embodiments a client side typeahead process of mobile client system may identify one or more structured queries matching the text input based at least in part on calculating a cost associated with each stored grammar template. As an example and not by way of limitation each stored grammar template may have a base cost. Furthermore the base cost of each stored grammar template may be inversely proportional to the popularity of the search query that is the basis of each pre defined grammar templates. In other words grammar templates derived from more popular search queries may have a lower associated base cost. In particular embodiments each non terminal token of each grammar template may have an associated insertion cost. As an example and not by way of limitation the insertion cost of each non terminal token may be related to an amount of differentiation provided by the particular non terminal token to the associated pre defined grammar template. For example for a grammar template photos of my friends the terminal token that corresponds to friends may have a higher insertion cost while the tokens that correspond to of or my that may be considered to be more generic and have less of a contribution to identifying particular grammar templates. In particular embodiments n grams that are matched as a query token to a non terminal token may not incur the associated insertion cost in the cost calculation. However when a particular non terminal token of the grammar templates does not match any of the text characters the insertion cost associated with the particular non terminal token in the cost calculation is incurred. In particular embodiments one or more the social graph entities associated with particular non terminal tokens may each have an associated insertion cost.

As an example and not by way of limitation text input photo m in search query field may be partitioned into n grams photo and m and matched to grammar templates photos of my friends and photos of my friends who work at employer where employer is a non terminal token that may associated with one or more of the stored social graph entities as described below. Furthermore one or more social graph entities may be identified as being relevant to non terminal tokens based on the type of the social graph entity. As described above the client side typeahead process may parse text input photo m into a n grams photo and m. As illustrated in the example of grammar template photos of my friends may be evaluated with respect to n grams photo and m. As an example and not by way of limitation the pre defined grammar template photos of my friends when completely matched may have query tokens photos of my and friends or otherwise incur an insertion cost as described above. Initially n gram photo may be matched as a query token photo of grammar template that corresponds to a stored social graph entity and incurs no cost in the cost calculation as illustrated by . The modified typeahead process on the mobile client system may evaluate the remaining non terminal tokens of grammar template to the remainder of the inputted text characters. As illustrated by the n gram m does not match query token of . As a result the cost calculation incurs the insertion cost associated with not matching the query token of . As illustrated by the n gram m may be matched as a query token my and as a result does not incur any insertion cost. As an example and not by way of limitation n gram m may be matched to query token my based at least in part on at a partial character matching of the character m in n gram m to query token my . Although this disclosure describes determining a match between particular n grams and particular query tokens based on particular criterion this disclosure contemplates determining a match between any suitable n grams and any suitable query token based on any suitable criteria such as for example a confidence score a probability a quality a ranking or any combination thereof. Since there are no remaining text characters the insertion cost associated with the unmatched query token friends is incurred as illustrated by . Assuming the base cost of grammar template photos of my friends is 1.1 and the insertion costs of the unmatched query tokens photos of my friends are 2.2 0.5 0 and 1.5 respectively the calculated cost is 3.1 for structured search query photos of my friends. 

As illustrated in the example of a grammar template photos of my friends who work at employer may be evaluated with respect to inputted text photo m. As an example and not by way of limitation grammar template when completely matched may have query tokens photos of my friends who work at and non terminal token employer that is evaluated with the social graph entity Facebook that corresponds to the lowest cost stored social graph entity of type employer. Initially the n gram photo may be matched as a query token photo of grammar template and incurs no cost in the cost calculation as illustrated by . The remaining non terminal tokens of the pre defined grammar template may be evaluated against the remaining n gram. As illustrated by the n gram m does not match as a query token of . As a result the cost calculation incurs the insertion cost associated with the n gram not matching to query token of . As illustrated by the n gram m matches as a query token my and as a result does not incur any insertion cost. As described above n gram m may be matched to query token my based at least in part on at a partial character matching of the character m in n gram m to query token my . Since there are no remaining text characters the insertion cost associated with not matching query token friends who work and at are incurred as illustrated by . Assuming the base cost of grammar template photos of my friends who work at employer is 2.1 and the insertion costs of the non terminal tokens when not matched as query tokens photos of my friends who work at and employer are 2.2 0.5 0 1.5 0.1 0.3 0.5 and 1.0 respectively. And assuming the insertion cost of social graph entity Facebook is 0.03 the resultant calculated cost is 6.03 for structured search query photos of my friends who work at Facebook. 

As illustrated in the example of a grammar template photos of my friends who work at employer with social graph entity Microsoft may be evaluated with respect to inputted text photo m. As described above the n gram photo may be matched as a query token photo of grammar template and incurs no cost in the cost calculation as illustrated by . The remaining non terminal tokens of the pre defined grammar template may be evaluated against the remaining n gram. As illustrated by the n gram m does not match as a query token of . As a result the cost calculation incurs the insertion cost associated with not matching query token of . In particular embodiments when the client side typeahead process matches more than one query token the client side typeahead process may match the n gram to the higher insertion cost query token. As an example and not by way of limitation assuming non terminal token employer social graph entity Microsoft and query token my when unmatched have insertion costs of 1.0 0.04 and 0 respectively the client side typeahead process may match the n gram m to non terminal token employer and the social graph entity Microsoft while not matching as query token my as illustrated by and . As an example and not by way of limitation n gram m may be matched to non terminal token employer evaluated with social graph entity Microsoft based at least in part on at a partial character matching of the character m in n gram m to social graph entity Microsoft. Furthermore employer evaluated with social graph entity Microsoft is a non terminal token corresponding to a matched social graph entity e.g. Microsoft . As a result the cost calculation does not incur any insertion cost associated with the non terminal token employer or social graph entity Microsoft and incurs the insertion cost associated with not matching query token my . Since there are no remaining n grams the insertion cost associated with not matching query tokens friends who work and at are incurred as illustrated by . Assuming the base cost of grammar template photos of my friends who work at employer is 2.1 the insertion costs of not matching query tokens photos of my friends who work at and employer are 2.2 0.5 0 1.5 0.1 0.3 0.5 and 1.0 respectively. And assuming the insertion cost of social graph entity Microsoft is 0.04 the resultant calculated cost is 5.04 for structured search query photos of my friends who work at Microsoft. 

In particular embodiments mobile client system may generate one or more structured queries corresponding to the selected grammar templates e.g. those grammar templates having a score greater than a grammar threshold score . Each structured query may be based on a string generated by the corresponding selected grammar template. As an example and not by way of limitation in response to the text query photo m the grammar objects user filter user user may generate a string photos of my friends where the non terminal tokens objects user filter user of the grammar have been replaced by the query tokens photos of my and friends respectively to generate the string. In particular embodiments a string that is generated by grammar using a natural language syntax may be rendered as a structured query in natural language. As an example and not by way of limitation the structured query from the previous example uses the query token of which uses a natural language syntax so that the string rendered by grammar is in natural language. The natural language string generated by a grammar may then be rendered to form a structured query by modifying the query tokens corresponding to social graph element to include references to those social graph elements. As an example and not by way of limitation the string photos of my friends may be rendered so that the query token for friends appears in the structured query as a reference to one or more second user nodes corresponding to the friends of the user where the reference may be include highlighting an inline link a snippet another suitable reference or any combination thereof. Each structured query may comprise query tokens corresponding to the corresponding selected grammar where these query tokens correspond to one or more of the identified edges and one or more of the identified nodes.

As described below the client side typeahead process may identify one or more structured queries matching text input in search query field . In particular embodiments the identified structured queries may be ranked based at least in part on a calculated cost described above. As an example and not by way of limitation the identified structured queries may be ranked based at least in part on the lowest calculated cost. For example based on the cost calculations described above the structured queries identified for text input photo m may have an example ranking from highest ranked to lowest of photos of my friends photos of my friends who work at Microsoft and photos of my friends who work at Facebook. Although this disclosure describes matching and ranking particular text input to particular structured queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates matching and ranking any suitable text input to any suitable structured queries in any suitable manner. More information on using grammar models with search queries may be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 674 695 filed 12 Nov. 2012 which is incorporated by reference.

As described above the client side typeahead process may match the text input in search query field to the pre defined grammar templates after each keystroke. As a result the identified structured queries displayed in drop down menu may be updated after each keystroke. In the example illustrated in drop down menu may display the six highest ranked structured queries that match text input photos. As the user provides additional characters in search query field the client side typeahead process may evaluate the additional text to update the structured queries presented to the user in down down menu . In the example illustrated in drop down menu may display the six highest ranked structured queries that match text input photos of my. As an example and not by way of limitation 

In particular embodiments social networking system may receive from the querying user a selection of one of the structured queries in drop down menu from mobile client system . The nodes and edges referenced in the received structured query may be referred to as the selected nodes and selected edges respectively. As an example and not by way of limitation the web browser or UI on the querying user s mobile client system may display the identified structured queries in a drop down menu as described above which the user may then click on or otherwise select e.g. tapping on a selected structured query on a display of mobile client system to indicate the particular structured query the user wants the social networking system to execute. As an example and not by way of limitation referencing the querying user may modify the input subsequent unstructured text query photos of my into search query field . Mobile client system may modify the displayed structured queries based on the updated n grams and recalculated cost for each stored grammar template based on the update n grams. Upon selecting the particular identified structured query the user s mobile client system may call or otherwise instruct to the social networking system to execute the selected structured query. Although this disclosure describes receiving selections of particular structured queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates receiving selections of any suitable structured queries in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may determine the social graph affinity which may be referred to herein as affinity of various social graph entities for each other. Affinity may represent the strength of a relationship or level of interest between particular objects associated with the online social network such as users concepts content actions advertisements other objects associated with the online social network or any suitable combination thereof. Affinity may also be determined with respect to objects associated with third party systems or other suitable systems. An overall affinity for a social graph entity for each user subject matter or type of content may be established. The overall affinity may change based on continued monitoring of the actions or relationships associated with the social graph entity. Although this disclosure describes determining particular affinities in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates determining any suitable affinities in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may measure or quantify social graph affinity using an affinity coefficient which may be referred to herein as coefficient . The coefficient may represent or quantify the strength of a relationship between particular objects associated with the online social network. The coefficient may also represent a probability or function that measures a predicted probability that a user will perform a particular action based on the user s interest in the action. In this way a user s future actions may be predicted based on the user s prior actions where the coefficient may be calculated at least in part on a history of the user s actions. Coefficients may be used to predict any number of actions which may be within or outside of the online social network. As an example and not by way of limitation these actions may include various types of communications such as sending messages posting content or commenting on content various types of an observation actions such as accessing or viewing profile pages media or other suitable content various types of coincidence information about two or more social graph entities such as being in the same group tagged in the same photograph checked in at the same location or attending the same event or other suitable actions. Although this disclosure describes measuring affinity in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates measuring affinity in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may use a variety of factors to calculate a coefficient. These factors may include for example user actions types of relationships between objects location information other suitable factors or any combination thereof. In particular embodiments different factors may be weighted differently when calculating the coefficient. The weights for each factor may be static or the weights may change according to for example the user the type of relationship the type of action the user s location and so forth. Ratings for the factors may be combined according to their weights to determine an overall coefficient for the user. As an example and not by way of limitation particular user actions may be assigned both a rating and a weight while a relationship associated with the particular user action is assigned a rating and a correlating weight e.g. so the weights total 100 . To calculate the coefficient of a user towards a particular object the rating assigned to the user s actions may comprise for example 60 of the overall coefficient while the relationship between the user and the object may comprise 40 of the overall coefficient. In particular embodiments the social networking system may consider a variety of variables when determining weights for various factors used to calculate a coefficient such as for example the time since information was accessed decay factors frequency of access relationship to information or relationship to the object about which information was accessed relationship to social graph entities connected to the object short or long term averages of user actions user feedback other suitable variables or any combination thereof. As an example and not by way of limitation a coefficient may include a decay factor that causes the strength of the signal provided by particular actions to decay with time such that more recent actions are more relevant when calculating the coefficient. The ratings and weights may be continuously updated based on continued tracking of the actions upon which the coefficient is based. Any type of process or algorithm may be employed for assigning combining averaging and so forth the ratings for each factor and the weights assigned to the factors. In particular embodiments social networking system may determine coefficients using machine learning algorithms trained on historical actions and past user responses or data farmed from users by exposing them to various options and measuring responses. Although this disclosure describes calculating coefficients in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates calculating coefficients in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient based on a user s actions. Social networking system may monitor such actions on the online social network on a third party system on other suitable systems or any combination thereof. Any suitable type of user actions may be tracked or monitored. Typical user actions include viewing profile pages creating or posting content interacting with content tagging or being tagged in images joining groups listing and confirming attendance at events checking in at locations liking particular pages creating pages and performing other tasks that facilitate social action. In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient based on the user s actions with particular types of content. The content may be associated with the online social network a third party system or another suitable system. The content may include users profile pages posts news stories headlines instant messages chat room conversations emails advertisements pictures video music other suitable objects or any combination thereof. Social networking system may analyze a user s actions to determine whether one or more of the actions indicate an affinity for subject matter content other users and so forth. As an example and not by way of limitation if a user may make frequently posts content related to coffee or variants thereof social networking system may determine the user has a high coefficient with respect to the concept coffee . Particular actions or types of actions may be assigned a higher weight and or rating than other actions which may affect the overall calculated coefficient. As an example and not by way of limitation if a first user emails a second user the weight or the rating for the action may be higher than if the first user simply views the user profile page for the second user.

In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient based on the type of relationship between particular objects. Referencing the social graph social networking system may analyze the number and or type of edges connecting particular user nodes and concept nodes when calculating a coefficient. As an example and not by way of limitation user nodes that are connected by a spouse type edge representing that the two users are married may be assigned a higher coefficient than a user nodes that are connected by a friend type edge. In other words depending upon the weights assigned to the actions and relationships for the particular user the overall affinity may be determined to be higher for content about the user s spouse than for content about the user s friend. In particular embodiments the relationships a user has with another object may affect the weights and or the ratings of the user s actions with respect to calculating the coefficient for that object. As an example and not by way of limitation if a user is tagged in first photo but merely likes a second photo social networking system may determine that the user has a higher coefficient with respect to the first photo than the second photo because having a tagged in type relationship with content may be assigned a higher weight and or rating than having a like type relationship with content. In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient for a first user based on the relationship one or more second users have with a particular object. In other words the connections and coefficients other users have with an object may affect the first user s coefficient for the object. As an example and not by way of limitation if a first user is connected to or has a high coefficient for one or more second users and those second users are connected to or have a high coefficient for a particular object social networking system may determine that the first user should also have a relatively high coefficient for the particular object. In particular embodiments the coefficient may be based on the degree of separation between particular objects. The lower coefficient may represent the decreasing likelihood that the first user will share an interest in content objects of the user that is indirectly connected to the first user in the social graph . As an example and not by way of limitation social graph entities that are closer in the social graph i.e. fewer degrees of separation may have a higher coefficient than entities that are further apart in the social graph .

In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient based on location information. Objects that are geographically closer to each other may be considered to be more related or of more interest to each other than more distant objects. In particular embodiments the coefficient of a user towards a particular object may be based on the proximity of the object s location to a current location associated with the user or the location of a client system of the user . A first user may be more interested in other users or concepts that are closer to the first user. As an example and not by way of limitation if a user is one mile from an airport and two miles from a gas station social networking system may determine that the user has a higher coefficient for the airport than the gas station based on the proximity of the airport to the user.

In particular embodiments social networking system may perform particular actions with respect to a user based on coefficient information. Coefficients may be used to predict whether a user will perform a particular action based on the user s interest in the action. A coefficient may be used when generating or presenting any type of objects to a user such as advertisements search results news stories media messages notifications or other suitable objects. The coefficient may also be utilized to rank and order such objects as appropriate. In this way social networking system may provide information that is relevant to user s interests and current circumstances increasing the likelihood that they will find such information of interest. In particular embodiments social networking system may generate content based on coefficient information. Content objects may be provided or selected based on coefficients specific to a user. As an example and not by way of limitation the coefficient may be used to generate media for the user where the user may be presented with media for which the user has a high overall coefficient with respect to the media object. As another example and not by way of limitation the coefficient may be used to generate advertisements for the user where the user may be presented with advertisements for which the user has a high overall coefficient with respect to the advertised object. In particular embodiments social networking system may generate search results based on coefficient information. Search results for a particular user may be scored or ranked based on the coefficient associated with the search results with respect to the querying user. As an example and not by way of limitation search results corresponding to objects with higher coefficients may be ranked higher on a search results page than results corresponding to objects having lower coefficients.

In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient in response to a request for a coefficient from a particular system or process. To predict the likely actions a user may take or may be the subject of in a given situation any process may request a calculated coefficient for a user. The request may also include a set of weights to use for various factors used to calculate the coefficient. This request may come from a process running on the online social network from a third party system e.g. via an API or other communication channel or from another suitable system. In response to the request social networking system may calculate the coefficient or access the coefficient information if it has previously been calculated and stored . In particular embodiments social networking system may measure an affinity with respect to a particular process. Different processes both internal and external to the online social network may request a coefficient for a particular object or set of objects. Social networking system may provide a measure of affinity that is relevant to the particular process that requested the measure of affinity. In this way each process receives a measure of affinity that is tailored for the different context in which the process will use the measure of affinity.
