This application claims the benefit of the PCT Application No. PCT CN2014 071865 filed Feb. 6 2014 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

This invention pertains to compounds which inhibit the activity of CDK9 kinase compositions containing the compounds and methods of treating diseases during which CDK9 kinase is expressed.

Cyclin dependent kinases CDKs are serine threonine protein kinases whose activity depends on binding and activation by cyclin partners. These heterodimeric complexes can phosphorylate various substrates involved in the control of transcription and cell cycle progression in response to different stimuli. CDK8 and CDK9 have key roles in the control of transcription by RNA polymerase II. CDK9 responds specifically to several cytokines including tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 6 indicating that it might have special roles in the regulation of a variety of physiological processes especially immune responses inflammation cell activation and differentiation.

Deregulated CDK activity is a hallmark of human cancer and a variety of genetic and epigenetic events such as over expression of cyclins diminished levels of CDK inhibiting proteins or gain of function mutations in CDK have been described to cause increased activity of these enzymes and provide a selective growth advantage in tumor cells. CDK9 inhibition causes rapid depletion of short lived mRNA transcripts and their associated protein products. Many genes encoding proteins involved in cell growth proliferation and tumor development Myc Cyclin D1 and Mcl 1 are characterized by short lived mRNAs and proteins and hence the consequences of CDK9 inhibition include anti proliferative and pro apoptotic effects through loss of function at many cellular pathways. Tumor types that are dependent on labile pro survival proteins e.g. Mcl 1 which includes multiple myeloma CLL breast melanoma and pancreatic cancers as well as the MYC driven tumors multiple cancer types would be susceptible to CDK9 inhibition. CDK9 inhibitors might also be effective in combination with standard of care in tumors in which NF B is constitutively active and contributing to chemo resistance. This includes hematologic malignancies as well as solid tumors breast colorectal prostate melanoma and pancreatic . Thus CDK9 inhibition targets multiple cancer relevant pathways by inhibition of a single protein and thereby renders CDK9 as an attractive target for anti cancer therapy.

CDK9 inhibitors can also find therapeutic application in cardiology and virology as many viruses depend on the infected host for transcription of their genome. Cyclin dependent kinase 9 a key transcriptional regulator and potential drug target in oncology virology and cardiology. Trends in Pharmacol. Sci. 2009 29. 302 312 Pharmacological targeting of CDK9 in cardiac hypertrophy. Med Res. Rev. 2010 30 646 66 Novel HIV 1 therapeutics through targeting altered host cell pathways. Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2009 9 1369 82 .

CDK9 inhibitors have also been reported as potential therapeutics for the treatment of chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain WO2008 049856 WO2009 047359 .

In view of the above there is a need in the art for small molecule therapeutics that can inhibit the activity of CDK9. The present invention fulfills at least this need.

The term halogen or halo alone or in combination with another term s means a fluorine radical which may be depicted as F chlorine radical which may be depicted as Cl bromine radical which may be depicted as Br or iodine radical which may be depicted as I .

If a substituent is described as being substituted a non hydrogen radical is in the place of hydrogen radical on a carbon or nitrogen of the substituent. Thus for example a substituted alkyl substituent is an alkyl substituent in which at least one non hydrogen radical is in the place of a hydrogen radical on the alkyl substituent. To illustrate monofluoroalkyl is alkyl substituted with a fluoro radical and difluoroalkyl is alkyl substituted with two fluoro radicals. It should be recognized that if there are more than one substitution on a substituent each non hydrogen radical may be identical or different unless otherwise stated .

If a substituent is described as being optionally substituted the substituent may be either 1 not substituted or 2 substituted. If a substituent is described as being optionally substituted with up to a particular number of non hydrogen radicals that substituent may be either 1 not substituted or 2 substituted by up to that particular number of non hydrogen radicals or by up to the maximum number of substitutable positions on the substituent whichever is less. Thus for example if a substituent is described as a heteroaryl optionally substituted with up to 3 non hydrogen radicals then any heteroaryl with less than 3 substitutable positions would be optionally substituted by up to only as many non hydrogen radicals as the heteroaryl has substitutable positions. To illustrate tetrazolyl which has only one substitutable position would be optionally substituted with up to one non hydrogen radical. To illustrate further if an amino nitrogen is described as being optionally substituted with up to 2 non hydrogen radicals then a primary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to 2 non hydrogen radicals whereas a secondary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to only 1 non hydrogen radical. If a substituent is described as being optionally substituted with one or more non hydrogen radicals that substituent may be either 1 not substituted or 2 substituted by up to the maximum number of substitutable positions on the substituent. Thus for example if a substituent is described as a heteroaryl optionally substituted with one or more non hydrogen radicals then any heteroaryl with 3 substitutable positions would be optionally substituted by one two or three non hydrogen radicals. To illustrate tetrazolyl which has only one substitutable position would be optionally substituted with up to one non hydrogen radical.

The prefix halo indicates that the substituent to which the prefix is attached is substituted with one or more independently selected halogen radicals. For example haloalkyl means an alkyl substituent in which at least one hydrogen radical is replaced with a halogen radical. Examples of haloalkyls include chloromethyl 1 bromoethyl fluoromethyl difluoromethyl trifluoromethyl and 1 1 1 trifluoroethyl. It should be recognized that if a substituent is substituted by more than one halogen radical those halogen radicals may be identical or different unless otherwise stated .

A prefix attached to a multi component substituent only applies to the first component. To illustrate the term alkylcycloalkyl contains two components alkyl and cycloalkyl. Thus the C C prefix on C C alkylcycloalkyl means that the alkyl component of the alkylcycloalkyl contains from 1 to 6 carbon atoms the C C prefix does not describe the cycloalkyl component. To illustrate further the prefix halo on haloalkyloxyalkyl indicates that only the alkyloxy component of the alkyloxyalkyl substituent is substituted with one or more halogen radicals. If halogen substitution may alternatively or additionally occur on the alkyl component the substituent would instead be described as halogen substituted alkyloxyalkyl rather than haloalkyloxyalkyl. And finally if the halogen substitution may only occur on the alkyl component the substituent would instead be described as alkyloxyhaloalkyl. 

The terms treat treating and treatment refer to a method of alleviating or abrogating a disease and or its attendant symptoms.

The terms prevent preventing and prevention refer to a method of preventing the onset of a disease and or its attendant symptoms or barring a subject from acquiring a disease. As used herein prevent preventing and prevention also include delaying the onset of a disease and or its attendant symptoms and reducing a subject s risk of acquiring a disease.

Geometric isomers may exist in the present compounds. Compounds of this invention may contain carbon carbon double bonds or carbon nitrogen double bonds in the E or Z configuration wherein the term E represents higher order substituents on opposite sides of the carbon carbon or carbon nitrogen double bond and the term Z represents higher order substituents on the same side of the carbon carbon or carbon nitrogen double bond as determined by the Cahn Ingold Prelog Priority Rules. The compounds of this invention may also exist as a mixture of E and Z isomers. Substituents around a cycloalkyl or heterocycloalkyl may also be designated as being of cis or trans configuration.

Compounds of this invention may contain asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms in the R or S configuration in which the terms R and S are as defined by the IUPAC 1974 Recommendations for Section E Fundamental Stereochemistry Pure Appl. Chem. 1976 45 13 10. Compounds having asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms with equal amounts of R and S configurations are racemic at those carbon atoms. Atoms with an excess of one configuration over the other are assigned the configuration present in the higher amount preferably an excess of about 85 90 more preferably an excess of about 95 99 and still more preferably an excess greater than about 99 . Accordingly this invention includes racemic mixtures relative and absolute stereoisomers and mixtures of relative and absolute stereoisomers.

Compounds of the invention can exist in isotope labeled or enriched form containing one or more atoms having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number most abundantly found in nature. Isotopes can be radioactive or non radioactive isotopes. Isotopes of atoms such as hydrogen carbon phosphorous sulfur fluorine chlorine and iodine include but are not limited to H H C C N O P S F Cl and I. Compounds that contain other isotopes of these and or other atoms are within the scope of this invention.

In another embodiment the isotope labeled compounds contain deuterium H tritium H or C isotopes. Isotope labeled compounds of this invention can be prepared by the general methods well known to persons having ordinary skill in the art. Such isotope labeled compounds can be conveniently prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Examples disclosed herein and Schemes by substituting a readily available isotope labeled reagent for a non labeled reagent. In some instances compounds may be treated with isotope labeled reagents to exchange a normal atom with its isotope for example hydrogen for deuterium can be exchanged by the action of a deuteric acid such as DSO DO. In addition to the above relevant procedures and intermediates are disclosed for instance in Lizondo J et al. 21 11 1116 1996 Brickner S J et al. 39 3 673 1996 Mallesham B et al. 5 7 963 2003 PCT publications WO1997010223 WO2005099353 WO1995007271 WO2006008754 U.S. Pat. Nos. 7 538 189 7 534 814 7531685 7528131 7521421 7514068 7511013 and US Patent Application Publication Nos. 20090137457 20090131485 20090131363 20090118238 20090111840 20090105338 20090105307 20090105147 20090093422 20090088416 and 20090082471 the methods are hereby incorporated by reference.

The isotope labeled compounds of the invention may be used as standards to determine the effectiveness of CDK9 inhibitors in binding assays. Isotope containing compounds have been used in pharmaceutical research to investigate the in vivo metabolic fate of the compounds by evaluation of the mechanism of action and metabolic pathway of the nonisotope labeled parent compound Blake et al. 64 3 367 391 1975 . Such metabolic studies are important in the design of safe effective therapeutic drugs either because the in vivo active compound administered to the patient or because the metabolites produced from the parent compound prove to be toxic or carcinogenic Foster et al. Advances in Drug Research Vol. 14 pp. 2 36 Academic press London 1985 Kato et al. J. 36 10 927 932 1995 Kushner et al. 77 79 88 1999 .

In addition non radio active isotope containing drugs such as deuterated drugs called heavy drugs can be used for the treatment of diseases and conditions related to CDK9 activity. Increasing the amount of an isotope present in a compound above its natural abundance is called enrichment. Examples of the amount of enrichment include from about 0.5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 16 21 25 29 33 37 42 46 50 54 58 63 67 71 75 79 84 88 92 96 to about 100 mol . Replacement of up to about 15 of normal atom with a heavy isotope has been effected and maintained for a period of days to weeks in mammals including rodents and dogs with minimal observed adverse effects Czajka D M and Finkel A J Ann.

Stable isotope labeling of a drug can alter its physico chemical properties such as pKa and lipid solubility. These effects and alterations can affect the pharmacodynamic response of the drug molecule if the isotopic substitution affects a region involved in a ligand receptor interaction. While some of the physical properties of a stable isotope labeled molecule are different from those of the unlabeled one the chemical and biological properties are the same with one important exception because of the increased mass of the heavy isotope any bond involving the heavy isotope and another atom will be stronger than the same bond between the light isotope and that atom. Accordingly the incorporation of an isotope at a site of metabolism or enzymatic transformation will slow said reactions potentially altering the pharmacokinetic profile or efficacy relative to the non isotopic compound.

The term pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug or prodrug as used herein represents those prodrugs of the compounds of the present invention which are within the scope of sound medical judgement suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals without undue toxicity irritation allergic response and the like commensurate with a reasonable benefit risk ratio and effective for their intended use.

The present invention contemplates compounds of the invention formed by synthetic means or formed by in vivo biotransformation of a prodrug.

Compounds described herein can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms including hydrated forms such as hemi hydrates. In general the solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water and ethanol among others are equivalent to the unsolvated forms for the purposes of the invention.

This invention also provides for pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula Ia or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier diluent or excipient therefor. The phrase pharmaceutical composition refers to a composition suitable for administration in medical or veterinary use.

The pharmaceutical compositions that comprise a compound of Formula Ia alone or in combination with a second active pharmaceutical agent may be administered to the subjects orally rectally parenterally intracisternally intravaginally intraperitoneally topically as by powders ointments or drops bucally or as an oral or nasal spray. The term parenterally as used herein refers to modes of administration which include intravenous intramuscular intraperitoneal intrasternal subcutaneous and intraarticular injection and infusion.

The term pharmaceutically acceptable carrier as used herein means a non toxic inert solid semi solid or liquid filler diluent encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any type. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are sugars such as but not limited to lactose glucose and sucrose starches such as but not limited to corn starch and potato starch cellulose and its derivatives such as but not limited to sodium carboxymethyl cellulose ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate powdered tragacanth malt gelatin talc excipients such as but not limited to cocoa butter and suppository waxes oils such as but not limited to peanut oil cottonseed oil safflower oil sesame oil olive oil corn oil and soybean oil glycols such a propylene glycol esters such as but not limited to ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate agar buffering agents such as but not limited to magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide alginic acid pyrogen free water isotonic saline Ringer s solution ethyl alcohol and phosphate buffer solutions as well as other non toxic compatible lubricants such as but not limited to sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate as well as coloring agents releasing agents coating agents sweetening flavoring and perfuming agents preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition according to the judgment of the formulator.

Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral injection comprise pharmaceutically acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions dispersions suspensions or emulsions as well as sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers diluents solvents or vehicles include water ethanol polyols such as glycerol propylene glycol polyethylene glycol and the like vegetable oils such as olive oil injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate and suitable mixtures thereof. Proper fluidity can be maintained for example by the use of coating materials such as lecithin by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions and by the use of surfactants.

These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives wetting agents emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents for example paraben chlorobutanol phenol sorbic acid and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents such as sugars sodium chloride and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.

In some cases in order to prolong the effect of the drug it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which in turn may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form may be accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.

Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly orthoesters and poly anhydrides . Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues.

The injectable formulations can be sterilized for example by filtration through a bacterial retaining filter or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium just prior to use.

Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules tablets pills powders and granules. In certain embodiments solid dosage forms may contain from 1 to 95 w w of a compound of Formula Ia . In certain embodiments the compound of Formula Ia may be present in the solid dosage form in a range of from 5 to 70 w w .

In the case of capsules tablets and pills the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents.

The pharmaceutical composition may be a unit dosage form. In such form the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation the package containing discrete quantities of preparation such as packeted tablets capsules and powders in vials or ampules. Also the unit dosage form can be a capsule tablet cachet or lozenge itself or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form. The quantity of active component in a unit dose preparation may be varied or adjusted from 0.1 mg to 1000 mg from 1 mg to 100 mg or from 1 to 95 w w of a unit dose according to the particular application and the potency of the active component. The composition can if desired also contain other compatible therapeutic agents.

The dose to be administered to a subject may be determined by the efficacy of the particular compound employed and the condition of the subject as well as the body weight or surface area of the subject to be treated. The size of the dose also will be determined by the existence nature and extent of any adverse side effects that accompany the administration of a particular compound in a particular subject. In determining the effective amount of the compound to be administered in the treatment or prophylaxis of the disorder being treated the physician can evaluate factors such as the circulating plasma levels of the compound compound toxicities and or the progression of the disease etc. In general the dose equivalent of a compound is from about 1 g kg to 100 mg kg for a typical subject.

For administration compounds of the Formula Ia can be administered at a rate determined by factors that can include but are not limited to the LDof the compound the pharmacokinetic profile of the compound contraindicated drugs and the side effects of the compound at various concentrations as applied to the mass and overall health of the subject. Administration can be accomplished via single or divided doses.

The compounds utilized in the pharmaceutical method of the invention can be administered at the initial dosage of about 0.001 mg kg to about 100 mg kg daily. In certain embodiments the daily dose range is from about 0.1 mg kg to about 10 mg kg. The dosages however may be varied depending upon the requirements of the subject the severity of the condition being treated and the compound being employed. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the practitioner. Treatment may be initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under circumstances is reached. For convenience the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day if desired.

Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard filled gelatin capsules using such carriers as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like.

The solid dosage forms of tablets dragees capsules pills and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and may also be of a composition such that they release the active ingredient s only or preferentially in a certain part of the intestinal tract optionally in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes.

The active compounds can also be in micro encapsulated form if appropriate with one or more of the above mentioned carriers.

Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions solutions suspensions syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as for example water or other solvents solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol isopropyl alcohol ethyl carbonate ethyl acetate benzyl alcohol benzyl benzoate propylene glycol 1 3 butylene glycol dimethyl formamide oils in particular cottonseed groundnut corn germ olive castor and sesame oils glycerol tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan and mixtures thereof.

Besides inert diluents the oral compositions may also include adjuvants such as wetting agents emulsifying and suspending agents sweetening flavoring and perfuming agents.

Suspensions in addition to the active compounds may contain suspending agents as for example ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters microcrystalline cellulose aluminum metahydroxide bentonite agar agar tragacanth and mixtures thereof.

Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non irritating carriers or carriers such as cocoa butter polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at room temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.

Examples of BiTE antibodies include adecatumumab Micromet MT201 blinatumomab Micromet MT103 and the like. Without being limited by theory one of the mechanisms by which T cells elicit apoptosis of the target cancer cell is by exocytosis of cytolytic granule components which include perforin and granzyme B. In this regard Bcl 2 has been shown to attenuate the induction of apoptosis by both perforin and granzyme B. These data suggest that inhibition of Bcl 2 could enhance the cytotoxic effects elicited by T cells when targeted to cancer cells V. R. Sutton D. L. Vaux and J. A. Trapani 1997 158 12 5783 .
