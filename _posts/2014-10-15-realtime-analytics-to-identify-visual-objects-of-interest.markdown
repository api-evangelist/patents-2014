title: Real-time analytics to identify visual objects of interest
abstract: A method of identifying and suggesting objects for a user within a user's field of vision of a personal imaging system. A user's field of vision within the system is monitored. The personal imaging system captures biometric data of the user regarding objects that are focused on within the user's field of vision. The biometric data and any identified emotions regarding the objects being focused on from the user is associated with the user's profile which includes at least demographics. A real-time correlation of the user's profile and demographics with other users is performed to provide a correlation interest score. The interest score may be used to recommend and direct the user's attention to other objects within the user's field of vision that the user may be interested in.

Embodiments of the present invention are capable of being implemented in a cloud computing environment and in conjunction with any other type of computing environment now known or later developed.

The server computer and repository may be practiced in distributed cloud computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed cloud computing environment program modules may be located in both local and remote computer system storage media including memory storage devices. A computer system server computer may also communicate with one or more external devices such as device computer . The computer system server computer typically includes a variety of computer system readable media. Such media may be any available media that is accessible by computer system server computer and it includes both volatile and non volatile media removable and non removable media.

Cloud computing is a model of service delivery for enabling convenient on demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources e.g. networks network bandwidth servers processing memory storage applications virtual machines and services that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or interaction with a provider of the service. This cloud model may include at least five characteristics at least three service models and at least four deployment models.

On demand self service a cloud consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities such as server time and network storage as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with the service s provider.

Broad network access capabilities are available over a network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms e.g. mobile phones laptops and PDAs .

Resource pooling the provider s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi tenant model with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to demand. There is a sense of location independence in that the consumer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction e.g. country state or datacenter .

Rapid elasticity capabilities can be rapidly and elastically provisioned in some cases automatically to quickly scale out and rapidly released to quickly scale in. To the consumer the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be purchased in any quantity at any time.

Measured service cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service e.g. storage processing bandwidth and active user accounts . Resource usage can be monitored controlled and reported providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.

Software as a Service SaaS the capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider s applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client devices through a thin client interface such as a web browser e.g. web based e mail . The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network servers operating systems storage or even individual application capabilities with the possible exception of limited user specific application configuration settings.

Platform as a Service PaaS the capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer created or acquired applications created using programming languages and tools supported by the provider. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including networks servers operating systems or storage but has control over the deployed applications and possibly application hosting environment configurations.

Infrastructure as a Service IaaS the capability provided to the consumer is to provision processing storage networks and other fundamental computing resources where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software which can include operating systems and applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems storage deployed applications and possibly limited control of select networking components e.g. host firewalls .

Private cloud the cloud infrastructure is operated solely for an organization. It may be managed by the organization or a third party and may exist on premises or off premises.

Community cloud the cloud infrastructure is shared by several organizations and supports a specific community that has shared concerns e.g. mission security requirements policy and compliance considerations . It may be managed by the organizations or a third party and may exist on premises or off premises.

Public cloud the cloud infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group and is owned by an organization selling cloud services.

Hybrid cloud the cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more clouds private community or public that remain unique entities but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability e.g. cloud bursting for load balancing between clouds .

A cloud computing environment is service oriented with a focus on statelessness low coupling modularity and semantic interoperability. At the heart of cloud computing is an infrastructure comprising a network of interconnected nodes.

In a first step identification information is received regarding a user that is to use a personal imaging system step for example by the demographics program . The user may enter the identification information through an interface of the personal imaging system itself a web user interface WUI or alternatively on the server computer .

The identification information may include but is not limited to name address age telephone number e mail address and other similar information.

The system will also receive profile information from the user regarding the user s interests preferences likes or dislikes or other information that can be used to find other users with similar tastes step . This could be done by presenting the user with a questionnaire a form asking for ranking of activities or other methods.

Analytics are performed to match the profile information of the user to a database of predefined demographics step for example by the demographics program . The predefined demographics may include information on other users who might have similar tastes potential objects or fields of interest or other information.

The predefined demographics are provided to the user for verification step . The user may be presented with potential matches of people including some demographic information about them or perhaps an indication of some information which may be used to suggest objects for him to look at. The user may then select which of the predefined demographics he believes best describes his preferences.

Once verification of at least one predefined demographic is received from the user the verified demographics are stored with the identification of the user in a repository step for example repository and the method ends.

In a first step the visual field of the personal imaging system is monitored step for example by the visual field identification program .

If an object is identified in the visual field step and it is determined that the user of the personal imaging system is focusing on an object step the personal imaging system requests and obtains feedback regarding the object focused on by the user step for example through the visual field identification program . The feedback may be an indication of whether the user likes or dislikes the identified object an indication of whether a user would wish to purchase the object or visit the place if the user agrees with a price of the object if the user knows the object if the object can endanger or is dangerous to the user if the object could be recommended to another person on social media tagging bookmarking the object for later consideration by the user or other feedback.

If it is determined that the user of the personal imaging system is not focusing on an object step the method continues to step of determining whether information is present within the repository in the object.

Alternatively if the user has disabled providing feedback or feedback is already present from the user regarding the object in the field steps and may be bypassed and the method proceeds to step .

The personal imaging system receives feedback from the user regarding the identified object and stores the feedback in a repository step . The stored feedback may be associated with the user s profile and demographics for example through the demographics program . The feedback may be received from the user through buttons touchpad compatible devices for remote control speech recognition of commands gesture recognition eye tracking brain computer interface and or any other means. The repository may be repository or another repository associated with the personal imaging system.

After the feedback is stored in the repository the system determines whether data is present in the repository about the object step for example through the visual identification program . The data regarding the object may include but is not limited to characteristics of the object. Characteristics may include a correlation interest score hours a particular place is open a price for the object or fee for admission to the place reviews by other users and or historical information. The correlation interest score is a score of the object in which a user profile and associated demographics are correlated with other users with similar demographics in real time. The correlation interest score is calculated using correlation analysis for example by the demographics program . The correlation score may be impacted by the feedback provided by the user. The correlation interest score may also include fuzzy correlation analysis which determines the strength of a linear relationship between fuzzy attributes and the direction of the relationship.

If the correlation interest score exceeds a threshold score step the object is identified within the visual field of the personal imaging system step to the user for example through the visual field identification program . The identification could comprise highlighting the object. Some ways of highlighting the object include but are not limited to displaying an arrow pointing to the object or putting a box halo or other shape around the object emphasizing the object with a color or any other way of identifying to the user that a particular object has been recognized and information about the object is available. The threshold score is preferably predefined.

Information regarding the object is then displayed on the visual field of the personal imaging system to the user step for example by the visual field identification program and the method returns to step . The information may include but is not limited to characteristics of the at least one object. The information displayed or the identification of the object may distinguish whether the object being highlighted is a correlated interest based on demographics associated with the user s profile.

In another embodiment the personal imaging system would not display the information to the user regarding the highlighted object unless the user specifically requested the information regarding the highlighted object. The request may be received from the user through buttons touchpad compatible devices for remote control speech recognition of commands gesture recognition eye tracking a brain computer interface and or any other means.

If data regarding the object in the visual field of the personal imaging system is not present in the repository step the method returns to step .

If the correlation interest score of the object does not exceed a threshold score step the method returns to step .

Joe purchases a personal imaging system and sends his identification to the personal imaging system or through a computer to the personal imaging system to establish a profile that includes Joe s basic information and his preferences. The personal imaging system performs analytics to match at least some of Joe s information to at least one predefined demographic for example art history buff and historian. The predefined demographic is provided to Joe for verification along with a list of objects that may be of interest to Joe for example the Eiffel Tower and the Mona Lisa. Joe verifies that he is interested in the Eiffel Tower and is a historian.

Joe is touring Paris and notices the Eiffel Tower . Joe focuses on the Eiffel Tower and a halo forms around it and flashes within the field of vision of the personal imaging system . Joe submits his interest in the Eiffel Tower through nodding his head. The personal imaging system receives Joe s feedback regarding his interest in the Eiffel Tower and the feedback is sent to a cloud service through a connection . Due to Joe s interest and feedback additional information regarding the Eiffel Tower may be displayed to Joe through the personal imaging system.

Joe notices signage for a restaurant called La Restaurant that Joe has eaten at and did not like. He focuses on the signage and when the halo forms around the signage Joe shakes his head to indicate that he does not like the restaurant . The personal imaging system receives Joe s feedback regarding his disinterest in the restaurant and the feedback is sent to a cloud service through a connection .

Joe continues to walk around Paris and heads into a store and glances past an Eiffel Tower miniature but does not notice it. The system recognizes the miniature Eiffel Tower as an object and looks it up in the database. Since Joe has indicated that he is interested in the Eiffel Tower previously the system assigns a high score to the Eiffel Tower miniature object. An indicator is displayed by the system to direct Joe s attention to the Eiffel Tower miniature based on his interest in the real Eiffel Tower which he expressed earlier.

As Joe continues to walk around Paris another restaurant appears in the visual field. The personal imaging system looks up the restaurant in the database and finds some information on it which indicates that people having similar demographics to Joe s rated this new restaurant as being similar to La Restaurant . Based on Joe s disinterest or dislike of La Restaurant the system assigns a low score to the new restaurant and does not point it out to Joe.

Sally also travels to Paris as a tourist and has a personal imaging system . Sally is in the same age range as Joe and has verified an interest in some of the same objects as Joe. As she walks around Paris an Eiffel Tower miniature enters her field of vision. As with Joe the system looks up the Eiffel Tower discovers it in the database and assigns a higher score to the Tower because others having similar demographics i.e. Joe were interested in it. The system puts an indicator within Sally s field of vision to direct her attention to the Eiffel Tower miniatures in the Le Souvenir Shoppe . The indicator in her field of vision preferably indicates that this indication is based on correlated interest not her specific interest in the object. She likes the Eiffel Tower and decides to purchase the Eiffel Tower miniature .

In another example the personal imaging system may be used to train an individual for a new job based on demographics and feedback of objects associated with the demographic. In this example the personal imaging system utilizes a demographic such as a corporate role to determine suggestions for focusing on objects within the field of vision.

Within a company safety inspectors may wear a personal imaging system while carrying out their jobs as safety inspectors. The safety inspectors when wearing the personal imaging system indicate that their demographic information is to be equivalent to a job role for example safety inspector.

As the safety inspectors inspect various objects at plants within the company for each object they focus on the personal imaging system records any actions or feedback the safety inspector provides and the information is sent to a central server and stored.

When safety inspectors are newly hired by the company the newly hired safety inspectors wear the personal imaging system and the personal imaging system draws their attention to most often focused on objects by other safety inspectors that work for the company based on the demographic.

In another example the personal imaging system may be used to solve a problem that does not have explicit instructions such as solving a printer jam. In order to solve the printer jam the personal imaging system would utilize both the demographics and a record of an object focus sequence.

An object focus sequence includes the focusing on an object and storing of an object. Common focus sequences could be determined through a near real time or data mining algorithm looking for commonalities between object to object focus patterns by the user of the personal imaging system. The storing of the object focus sequence provides feedback for the user s profile. This sequence would take place continually when the user is wearing the personal imaging system. The object focus sequence may also be used to make recommendations of objects for the user to focus on through an algorithm and may alter a recommendation to a user to include a common object in a focus sequence instead another object to focus on.

A user receives a personal imaging system and provides user information and demographic information such as their job and skill set which in this case is an accountant. The personal imaging system associates a specific skill set with a specific job and therefore can provide assistance for certain tasks depending on the user s skill set.

For example for the user who is an accountant fixing a printer jam the personal imaging system identifies the printer and model number and the user focuses on the jammed error on the printer display. The personal imaging system considers the demographic and skill set associated with being an accountant and provides data for aiding the user in resolving the paper jam. The personal imaging system recognize the jammed error and as the user looks at the printer the personal imaging system highlights different parts of the printer with varying levels of intensity based on the number of times the parts of the printer were focused on after the printer displayed a jammed state. For this example the component of the printer that was most intensely highlighted was a lever that opens the access panel to the paper feeder.

It should be noted that if the user wearing the personal imaging system had the demographic or job role of printer specialist the personal imaging system may have instead highlighted an access port which is only accessible through specialized tools of a printer specialist.

The user uses the lever to release an access panel opening the panel. The personal imaging system recognizes that the user is manipulating the lever based on the increased focusing on the lever. The personal imaging system highlights the lever necessary to pull out the toner tray as this is the next object intensely highlighted and based on a sequence of the prior two objects observed the jammed display state and the access panel lever .

The user manipulates the toner lever. The personal imaging system then highlights the gap the paper travels through as it is a prominent feature in the visual field even though it is not an actual object itself. This gap is intensely highlighted and based on a sequence of the prior objects observed.

A jammed piece of paper is present in the gap and the user pulls out the paper. The personal imaging system highlights the levers necessary to lock the toner track pack in place and close the access panel through highlighting. The user then focuses on the printer display and determines that the error message has been cleared.

The personal imaging system can also be used by multiple experts in the same field to aid others in the same field who are not experts to locate problems and fix them. The above example could also apply to a user who is a printer specialist but not an expert.

Prior to obtaining a biometric baseline a user wears the personal imaging system and associated biometric sensors. The biometric sensors may be a dental implant that monitors salvation level and chemical makeup of a user s saliva. The biometric sensors may also be an armband that monitors heart rate blood pressure perspiration and galvanic skin conduction. The personal imaging system also monitors breathing rate for example through a microphone. The personal imaging system additionally monitors eye dilation through a back facing camera.

In a first step the personal imaging device monitors biometric data of the user to obtain a baseline of biometric data step for example through the sensors of the personal imaging device and the biometric program . The biometric data may include but is not limited to salvation level chemical makeup of the user s saliva heart rate blood pressure perspiration galvanic skin conduction breathing rate eye dilation micro facial expressions and other body reactions.

A biometric threshold level is selected for a user based on the baseline of biometric data step for example by the biometric program .

The biometric baseline and threshold of the user is then stored with identification information and demographics of the user in a repository step for example by the biometric program.

In a first step the visual field of the personal imaging system is monitored step for example by the visual field identification program .

If an object is identified in the visual field step and it is determined that the user of the personal imaging system is focusing on an object step the personal imaging system captures a user s current biometric data step through the personal imaging system for example through the biometric program .

The user s current biometric is compared to the user s baseline biometric level and if the user s current biometrics exceeds the threshold level of biometrics for the user step the user s facial expressions are captured step for example through a camera of the personal imaging system through the biometric program . Emotions of the user associated with the object being focused on are identified from the user s current biometrics and the user s facial expressions step . The identification of emotions takes into account physiological signals and their associations with emotions.

The user s current biometrics the user s facial expressions and the identified emotion in relation to an object being focused on are stored as biometric feedback in a repository step . The amount the user s biometrics exceed the threshold level may also be stored in the repository. Alternatively just the amount the user s biometrics exceed the threshold level and the identified emotion may be stored in the repository. The method then continues to step .

The stored biometric feedback may be associated with the user s profile and demographics for example through the demographics program . The repository may be repository or another repository associated with the personal imaging system.

If it is determined that the user of the personal imaging system is not focusing on an object step the method continues to step of determining whether information is present within the repository in the object.

Alternatively if the user has disabled providing their biometrics or their biometrics and emotional feedback is already present from the user regarding the object in the field steps and may be bypassed and the method proceeds to step .

After the biometric feedback is stored in the repository the system determines whether data is present in the repository about the object step for example through the visual identification program . The data regarding the object may include but is not limited to characteristics of the object. Characteristics may include a correlation interest score biometrics of a user in response to the object emotions of a user towards an object hours a particular place is open a price for the object or fee for admission to the place reviews by other users and or historical information. The correlation interest score is a score of the object in which a user profile and associated demographics are correlated with other users with similar demographics in real time. The correlation interest score is calculated using correlation analysis for example by the demographics program . The correlation score may be impacted by the biometric feedback provided by the user. The correlation interest score may also include fuzzy correlation analysis which determines the strength of a linear relationship between fuzzy attributes and the direction of the relationship.

If the correlation interest score exceeds a threshold score step the object is identified within the visual field of the personal imaging system step to the user for example through the visual field identification program . The identification could comprise highlighting the object. Some ways of highlighting the object include but are not limited to displaying an arrow pointing to the object or putting a box halo or other shape around the object emphasizing the object with a color or any other way of identifying to the user that a particular object has been recognized and information about the object is available. The threshold score is preferably predefined.

Information regarding the object is then displayed on the visual field of the personal imaging system to the user step for example by the visual field identification program and the method returns to step . The information may include but is not limited to characteristics of the at least one object. The information displayed or the identification of the object may distinguish whether the object being highlighted is a correlated interest based on demographics associated with the user s profile.

In another embodiment the personal imaging system would not display the information to the user regarding the highlighted object unless the user specifically requested the information regarding the highlighted object. The request may be received from the user through buttons touchpad compatible devices for remote control speech recognition of commands gesture recognition eye tracking a brain computer interface and or any other means.

If data regarding the object in the visual field of the personal imaging system is not present in the repository step the method returns to step .

If the correlation interest score of the object does not exceed a threshold score step the method returns to step .

In another embodiment step of of obtaining feedback from a user may include the steps and from to capture biometric data and facial expression to identify an emotion in response the object being focused on. Therefore in addition to obtaining feedback from the user including an indication of whether the user likes or dislikes the identified object an indication of whether a user would wish to purchase the object or visit the place if the user agrees with a price of the object if the user knows the object if the object can endanger or is dangerous to the user if the object could be recommended to another person on social media tagging bookmarking the object for later consideration by the user the user s biometrics and facial expression may also be used to identify emotions the user has associated with the object being focused on.

In an example a user wearing a personal imaging system is walking down the street and focuses on an infant being carried by their mother. The infant is smiling and giggling. The user of the personal imaging system smiles in response to the infant. Biometric data is captured while the user is focusing on the infant. The biometric data captured is compared to a threshold level of biometrics of the user and exceeds a positive emotion threshold level of the user. The biometric feedback is stored with the user s profile and associated demographics. The infant is highlighted within the field of vision of the personal imaging system for the user. Based on the user s biometric reaction and their profile with their associated demographics other smiling infants may be highlighted or suggested to the user for focusing on by the personal imaging system.

In another example a user wearing a personal imaging system is walking down the street and focuses on a cigarette butt in the gutter. The user of the personal imaging system frowns in dislike in response to the discarded cigarette. Biometric data is captured while the user is focusing on the discarded cigarette. The biometric data captured is compared to a threshold level of biometrics of the user and exceeds a negative emotion threshold level of the user. The biometric feedback is stored with the user s profile and associated demographics.

In yet another example a user wears the personal imaging system and associated sensors. The associated sensors include an armband to monitor the user s heart rate blood pressure perspiration and galvanic skin conduction through electrodes of the arm band and a dental implant for monitoring salivation level and chemical makeup of the user s saliva. The personal imaging system additionally uses the microphone to monitor the user s breathing rate and a back facing camera to monitor the user s eye dilation. The personal imaging system and the associated sensors capture biometric data to create a biometric baseline in which other captured biometric data can be compared to signify interest by the user. The baseline is stored with the user s profile and associated demographics.

After the user has established a baseline the user focuses on signage for a restaurant that the user very much likes. The personal imaging system identifies the signage as a contiguous object for example using object recognition algorithms. The personal imaging system captures the user s current biometric data. In this case the salivation of the user was increased as sensed by the dental implant and the user s eyes dilated as detected by the back facing camera of the personal imaging system. The current biometric data is compared to the user s biometric baseline to determine if the current biometric data exceeds a threshold for interest by the user. With the eye dilation and increased salivation the current biometric data exceeds the biometric baseline or a threshold. The back facing camera of the personal imaging system then captures current facial expressions. Based on the facial expressions and other biometrics any of the user s emotions towards the signage are identified. The like or dislike of the signage is correlated to the identified emotion and stored in a repository associated with the signage as well as the user s profile and associated demographics.

The user continues walking and comes to a wall with posting of various events in the area. The user quickly glances at the wall of postings and begins to walk away.
