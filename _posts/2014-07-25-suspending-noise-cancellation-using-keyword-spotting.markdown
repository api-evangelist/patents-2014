title: Suspending noise cancellation using keyword spotting
abstract: Aspects of the disclosure provide suspension of noise cancellation at a noise-cancelling device using keyword spotting. In one aspect, a predetermined word or phrase can be spotted within an utterance received at the noise-cancelling device, and in response, noise cancellation can be suspended or otherwise terminated. The predetermined word or phrase can be specific to an end-user that utilizes the noise-cancelling device and/or a person that interacts with the end-user. In another aspect, interaction between an operator and the noise-cancelling device can be monitored after noise cancellation is suspended, and based at least on such interaction, a model for keyword spotting can be refined. In certain aspects, noise cancellation at the noise-cancelling device can be suspended or otherwise terminated in response to receiving a suspension directive via an electronic non-audio signal, for example, from a peripheral device. In other aspects, the noise-cancelling device can resume noise cancellation in response to a control signal.

Noise cancelling headphones typically permit consuming audio in noise intensive or otherwise noise hostile environments such as a busy street or a vehicle having a noisy cabin. As such the operator of the noise cancelling headphones tends to be at least acoustically isolated from the environment and therefore including the operator in a discussion with another party or otherwise attracting the operator s attention can be difficult or otherwise inconvenient.

The disclosure recognizes and addresses in at least certain aspects the issue of acoustic isolation of an operator of a noise cancelling device. More particularly yet not exclusively the disclosure recognizes the difficulty or inconvenience associated with situations in which it may be necessary or otherwise desirable to attract the attention of such an operator. In accordance with aspects of this disclosure a noise cancelling device e.g. a noise cancelling headphone or earbud can include computing resources such as one or more processors and one or more memory devices and communication resources such as communication devices e.g. a system bus a memory bus or the like input output interface s and or a radio unit. Accordingly the noise cancelling devices disclosed herein can be embodied in wireless computing devices e.g. mobile computing devices including portable and or wearable computing devices or tethered computing devices. As described in greater detail below the disclosure provides embodiments for suspending noise cancellation in a noise cancelling device based at least on keyword recognition. In one aspect a keyword in an utterance received at a noise cancelling device can be recognized as a predetermined word or phrase and in response noise cancellation at the noise cancelling device can be suspended or otherwise terminated. In one example recognition of one or more keywords e.g. words or phrases in an utterance can leverage approaches or techniques specific to identification or spotting of keywords e.g. words or phrases as opposed to relying on full fledged speech recognition. Accordingly in at least certain embodiments keyword recognition may be referred to as keyword spotting. The utterance in accordance with aspects of the disclosure can contain a predetermined keyword e.g. a predetermined word or a predetermined phrase such as more than one predetermined words and can be specific to an end user that utilizes the noise cancelling device and or another person that interacts with the end user. As such in one aspect the disclosure contemplates speaker identification in addition to keyword spotting. In addition although an utterance may contain a predetermined keyword noise cancellation may not be suspended unless the predetermined keyword is uttered by a specific human speaker. It should be appreciated that in the present disclosure the term keyword can refer to a word such as Hey or a phrase e.g. Hey Ben and therefore keyword spotting as described herein is not limited to identification of a single word but it can contemplate identification of a phrase.

In another aspect interaction of an end user with the noise cancelling device can be monitored after noise cancellation is suspended. The interaction can convey a response of the end user to suspension of noise cancellation. For instance the end user may turn noise cancellation back on nearly immediately after suspension thereof. Such interaction may indicate a false positive detection of a predetermined keyword which can suggest that improvement to a model for keyword spotting may be desirable. Accordingly the model for keyword spotting can be refined based at least on the monitored interaction. In certain aspects noise cancellation at the noise cancelling device can be suspended or otherwise terminated in response to receiving a suspension directive via an electronic non audio signal for example from a peripheral device. In other aspects the noise cancelling device can resume noise cancellation in response to a control signal an audible signal an inaudible tone or an electronic non audio signal . In contrast with certain conventional technologies the disclosure can permit transitions between noise cancellation and passthrough operation without active engagement e.g. actuation of an on off switch of the operator of the noise cancelling device. In addition by relying upon or otherwise leveraging user defined keywords or phrases the need for active engagement with or input from the operator of the noise cancelling device can be largely mitigated or otherwise avoided therefore rendering the noise cancelling device more useful in environments where it is desirable to include the operator in discussions or otherwise attract the operator s attention.

With reference to the drawings illustrates an example operational environment for noise cancellation management in accordance with one or more aspects of the disclosure. A noise cancelling device which is represented for the sake of illustration with a noise cancelling headphone can receive an input signal that can contain ambient sound represented as sound in and can perform noise cancellation on such a signal in order to provide an output signal that substantially removes at least a portion of the ambient sound. In addition in certain scenarios the input signal can include input audio such as music or other type of audio recording in either digital or analog format intended for consumption via the noise cancelling device . As such in one aspect the noise cancelling device can generate a first audio signal represented as ambient audio in representative of at least a portion of the input signal received at the noise cancelling device and a second audio signal represented as device audio in representative of the input audio received at the noise cancelling device . The noise cancelling device can provide or otherwise communicate the first and second audio signals to a noise cancellation stage which also may be referred to as a noise cancellation loop in order to remove at least a portion of the ambient sound conveyed in the input signal . In one example the noise cancellation stage can reverse at least a portion of the ambient audio e.g. the frequency dependent phase of the audio signal can be shifted by a magnitude substantially equal to and can generate or otherwise compose an output audio signal that can include the reversed ambient audio the ambient audio and the device audio . Accordingly in one aspect the output audio signal can convey audio that substantially lacks the ambient sound received via the input signal . Such an output signal may be herein referred to as noise cancelled device audio and can have small amplitudes at respective frequencies of the ambient sound depending on the performance also referred to as spectral quality of the noise cancellation stage .

Based at least on the performance of the noise cancellation stage certain ambient sound that may be intended to elicit a response from an operator of the noise cancelling device may be cancelled in the noise cancellation stage and thereby the operator may not respond as expected or otherwise desired. In at least certain scenarios ambient sounds that may be intended to elicit a response can include specific keywords such as specific words or phrases such as greetings hey hello Ben hello Ben hey Ben lunch time meeting time or the like that can be directed to attract the attention of an end user of the noise cancelling device . Accordingly in one aspect the noise cancelling device can generate an audio signal represented as ambient audio in that can be provided to a keyword spotting stage . In one aspect the keyword spotting stage can analyze the ambient audio and may identify or otherwise determine the presence of a specific keyword such as a specific word e.g. Hey or a specific phrase e.g. Hey Ben within the ambient audio . In response to such identification or determination the keyword spotting stage can signal or otherwise instruct the noise cancellation loop to cease e.g. suspend or cease noise cancellation of the ambient audio and termination of delivery of the device audio when supplied to the noise cancelling device . Accordingly the noise cancelling device can permit communication e.g. output or delivery of ambient sound received at the noise cancelling device . In the illustrated operational environment the signaling that conveys a directive to suspend noise cancellation is represented with an arrow connecting the keyword spotting stage to the noise cancellation stage . In addition the ambient sound that can pass through the noise cancellation stage in response to a predetermined keyword s being present in the input signal is referred to as ambient audio .

Therefore in the illustrated operational environment the noise cancelling device can switch between noise cancellation and operation as a sound passthrough element which herein may be referred to as passthrough operation in response to determination herein also referred to as detection or identification of a predetermined keyword or a predetermined phrase in the ambient sound that is received at the noise cancelling device . As such the predetermined keyword e.g. a predetermined word or phrase may be referred to respectively as a sleepword or a sleephrase for noise cancellation in that presence of the predetermined keyword e.g. a predetermined word or phrase can cause the noise cancelling device to suspend or otherwise terminate noise cancellation.

After a transition to passthrough operation the noise cancelling device can monitor interaction of an end user with the noise cancelling device . The interaction can include for example communication of aural cues or non aural indications from the end user to the noise cancelling device . In one aspect an aural cue can be embodied or can include a specific keyword s intended to cause the noise cancelling device to resume noise cancellation. As such in one aspect the aural cue or the keyword s associated therewith e.g. resume cancelling cancel or continue may be referred to as a wakeword or a wakephrase for noise cancelling in that the noise cancelling device can transition from passthrough operation to noise cancellation in response to the aural cue or the associated keyword s . Accordingly in one aspect the keyword spotting stage can continue to analyze or otherwise monitor the sound that is received within the input signal in order to determine or otherwise identify the presence of a wakeword or a wakephrase.

In addition the keyword spotting unit can process the at least one second audio signal e.g. ambient audio in order to identify or otherwise detect the presence of a predetermined keyword or a predetermined phrase e.g. more than one predetermined keywords in certain order . As such in one aspect the keyword spotting unit can apply a keyword model to the at least one second audio signal. As described herein in one aspect the keyword model e.g. a hidden Markov model HMM and or a Gaussian mixture model is directed to representing one or more predetermined keywords such as Hey Ben and predicting or otherwise providing a likelihood that observed audio input e.g. audio collected by a microphone included in the audio input unit s contains or otherwise conveys the one or more predetermined keywords. In one example implementation the keyword model can be contained e.g. stored or otherwise encoded in the keyword spotting unit . Therefore in one aspect the keyword spotting unit can determine a likelihood that the at least one second audio signal conveys a predetermined keyword or predetermined phrase such as Hey Ben. Based at least on such likelihood the keyword spotting unit can determine or otherwise establish with certain confidence whether or not the predetermined keyword or predetermined phrase is conveyed in such signal s .

A determination that a predetermined keyword is not conveyed in the external audio signal can cause the noise cancelling device to continue noise cancellation. More specifically in such scenario the noise cancelation unit can generate a noise cancellation signal e.g. a off phase replica of the external audio signal in order to cancel the external audio signal . Further the noise cancellation unit can combine the noise cancellation signal with at least a portion of the external audio signal and can communicate the combined signal to at least one audio output unit of the audio output unit s . In response to the received combined signal the at least one audio output unit e.g. at least one speaker can generate an audible signal or audio that can be delivered as output audio . In the alternative a satisfactory affirmative determination that the predetermined keyword is conveyed in the received external audio signal can cause a noise cancellation switching unit which may also be referred to as noise cancellation switch to signal or otherwise direct e.g. communicate a control instruction to the noise cancellation unit to suspend or otherwise terminate noise cancellation on the audible signal that is received at the noise cancelling device . Accordingly as described herein the predetermined keyword e.g. Ben can function as a sleepword for noise cancellation by the noise cancelling device . In response to the sleepword at least one of the audio output unit s e.g. at least one speaker can communicate output audio that is substantially the same as the received external audio signal . As an example the output audio can be embodied in or can include an audible signal generated by a speaker included in the audio output unit s . In certain embodiments the noise cancellation switch can constitute a control unit not depicted in .

In addition the keyword spotting unit can continue to analyze or otherwise monitor the external audio signal in order to determine or otherwise identify the presence of a wakeword or a wakephrase that can direct the noise cancelling device to transition from passthrough operation to noise cancellation. Further or as an alternative as described herein the keyword spotting unit or a monitoring unit not depicted in can monitor interaction between an end user with the noise cancelling device after or upon transitioning to passthrough operation. The noise cancelling device via such a monitoring unit for example can retain information representative of the monitored interaction in one or more memory devices which is represented as memory . In one example at least a portion of such information can be acquired from the noise cancelling device via at least one of the input output I O interface s for example in order to improve a keyword model relied upon or otherwise utilized by the noise cancelling device for detection of a wakeword or a sleepword. The I O interface s can include at least one port serial parallel or both at least one Ethernet port at least one pin and can permit communication of information between the noise cancelling device and an external device such as another computing device e.g. a remote network device or an end user device .

In certain implementations the at least one of the I O interface s can receive or otherwise access information which herein may be referred to as configuration input that can configure one or more aspects of a keyword model in accordance with aspects of this disclosure. In one aspect at least a portion of such information can configure the keyword spotting unit to detect keywords with a specific sensitivity. For instance the noise cancelling device can be configured to detect with higher sensitivity keywords associated with a first person e.g. a work colleague of an end user operating the noise cancelling device than keywords associated with a second person e.g. a second work colleague . Therefore in one aspect the keyword model can be specific to a human speaker or a person which the noise cancelling device can recognize. To at least such an end in one example the keyword spotting unit can perform spectral analysis on at least a portion of the external audio signal in order to identify a group of frequencies characteristic of sound uttered by certain speaker. More specifically in one embodiment the keyword model can include a predetermined set of frequencies associated with the human speaker or a speaker profile or other information structure not depicted in of the human speaker. In one example the speaker profile or an information structure indicative or representative thereof can be retained in the memory . In addition the keyword spotting unit can compare the outcome of the spectral analysis of at least a portion of the external input signal with such a set of frequencies in order to recognize the human speaker. As such the keyword spotting unit can determine the human speaker that utters at least a portion of the external audio signal in addition to determining whether or not at least the portion of the external audio signal includes a predetermined keyword e.g. a predetermined word or a predetermined phrase . It should be appreciated that in certain embodiments the spectral analysis of at least a portion of the external audio signal can be performed by the noise cancellation unit and results of the analysis can supplied or otherwise communicated to the keyword spotting unit .

In certain embodiments switching from noise cancellation to passthrough operation in a noise cancelling device in accordance with aspects of this disclosure may be accomplished via a secondary electronic device functionally coupled e.g. communicatively coupled to the noise cancelling device. In such embodiments the secondary electronic device may utilize or otherwise leverage contextual information associated with the noise cancelling device in order to generate a control instruction that can cause the noise cancelling device to suspend noise cancellation. More specifically illustrates an example of an operational environment for suspension of noise cancellation in which a noise cancelling device can switch between noise cancellation and passthrough operation via at least one of a sensor a server or an electronic device . As illustrated the sensor the server and the electronic device can be remote to the noise cancelling device . In one scenario the sensor e.g. a photodetector or camera a motion sensor a microphone or the like can probe an environment in which the noise cancelling device can operate. For instance the sensor can detect motion within the environment illumination changes in the vicinity of the noise cancelling device and or ambient sound in such an environment. As such the sensor can probe a condition of the environment or change in conditions thereof e.g. opening of a door into the environment alarm sound s light intensity or changes thereof in proximity of the noise cancelling device and or presence of specific keywords in the environment. In response to a specific detected condition in the environment the sensor can convey a control signal to a network of a group of networks which can include wireless and or wired communication networks having various footprints e.g. a wide area network WAN a metropolitan area network MAN a local area network LAN a home area network HAN and or a personal area network PAN . The control signal can convey a control instruction for the noise cancelling device to suspend or terminate noise cancellation.

The noise cancelling device can receive wirelessly or otherwise the control signal and in response can suspend or otherwise terminate noise cancellation. The control signals and can be embodied in or can include for example an electronic non audio signal.

In certain embodiments the sensor can probe the environment of the noise cancelling device and instead of detecting specific conditions of the environment the sensor can communicate information digital or analog indicative or otherwise representative of a condition of the environment to the server . The server can receive the information and can analyze at least a portion of the received information. Based on an outcome of the analysis such as presence of a predetermined keyword in ambient sound the server can communicate the control signal to the noise cancelling device via a network of the network s .

Similarly in one embodiment an electronic device that can be functionally coupled to the noise cancelling device via link s wireless link s or otherwise can detect a predetermined keyword in accordance with aspects described herein and in response can communicate a control signal that can convey to the noise cancelling device a control instruction to suspend or otherwise terminate noise cancellation. In one example the control signal can be embodied in or can include an inaudible tone. In addition or in the alternative the electronic device can utilize or leverage context information such as a calendar event associated with an end user operating the noise cancelling device or a likely activity of the end user in order to determine that noise cancellation is to cease at the noise cancelling device . In another embodiment instead of relying upon direct communication e.g. point to point wireless communication or tethered communication with the noise cancelling device the electronic device can leverage connectivity with a network of the network s in order to convey the control signal . To at least such an end in one aspect the device can communicate via a link wireless or wireline not depicted in with such a network and in response to detection of the predetermined keyword the device can communicate the control signal to the network or a component thereof which can communicate the control signal to the noise cancelling device .

It can be appreciated that the noise cancelling device can have less complexity than the noise cancelling device and or the noise cancelling device in view that the an external device e.g. the sensor the device the server and or a component within one or more of the network s can implement the processing associated with determining that a transition from noise cancellation to passthrough operation is to be performed. Yet in certain implementations the noise cancelling device may include or may be otherwise fitted with a radio unit and or a network adapter in order to receive a control signal that can direct the noise cancelling device to suspend noise cancellation. As described herein in at least certain aspects the determination to suspend noise cancellation can be based on predetermined change s in the condition of an environment in proximity of the noise cancelling device and or a predetermined keyword present in ambient sound within the environment. In addition it should be understood and appreciated that in certain embodiments the control signal s that can direct the noise cancelling device to suspend or otherwise terminate noise cancellation may be electronic non audio signals and or inaudible tones.

In view of the aspects described herein example methods that can be implemented in accordance with the disclosure can be better appreciated with reference for example to the flowcharts in . For purposes of simplicity of explanation the example methods disclosed herein are presented and described as a series of blocks with each block representing an action or an operation in a method for example . However it is to be understood and appreciated that the disclosed methods are not limited by the order of blocks and associated actions or operations as some blocks may occur in different orders and or concurrently with other blocks from those that are shown and described herein. For example the various methods or processes or techniques in accordance with this disclosure can be alternatively represented as a series of interrelated states or events such as in a state diagram. Furthermore not all illustrated blocks and associated action s may be required to implement a method in accordance with one or more aspects of the disclosure. Further yet two or more of the disclosed methods or processes can be implemented in combination with each other to accomplish one or more features or advantages described herein.

It should be appreciated that the methods in accordance with this disclosure can be retained on an article of manufacture or computer readable medium to permit or facilitate transporting and transferring such methods to a computing device such as a noise cancelling device a blade computer a programmable logic controller and the like for execution and thus implementation by a processor of the computing device or for storage in a memory thereof or functionally coupled thereto. In one aspect one or more processors such as processor s that implement e.g. execute one or more of the disclosed methods can be employed to execute code instructions retained in a memory or any computer or machine readable medium to implement one or more of the disclosed methods. The code instructions can provide a computer executable or machine executable framework to implement the methods described herein.

With reference to the example method a signal can be received at a noise cancelling device at block . The signal can be analog or digital and in one example can be audible and can convey sounds such as speech music or a combination thereof. At block noise cancellation can be performed on the signal. In one example a first audio signal representative of the signal can be generated and can be injected into or otherwise provided to a noise cancellation unit e.g. noise cancellation circuitry that may be integrated into the noise cancelling device. In addition or in the alternative the first audio signal can be communicated e.g. transmitted to a remote computing device such as a server that can implement noise cancellation on the first audio signal. At block the signal can be analyzed for the presence of a predetermined keyword. Accordingly in one example a second audio signal representative of the signal can be generated and can be injected into or otherwise provided to a recognition unit such as a keyword spotting unit e.g. keyword spotting circuitry that may be integrated into the noise cancelling device see e.g. example embodiment in . In addition or in the alternative the second audio signal can be communicated e.g. transmitted to a remote computing device such as a server that can implement keyword spotting on the second audio signal. As described herein as an illustration a predetermined keyword may be embodied in terms such as greetings hey hello Ben or the like and a predetermined phrase may be embodied in terms such as hello Ben hey Ben lunch time meeting time or the like. In one example analyzing the second audio signal can include applying a keyword model to the second audio signal where such a model can evaluate and or provide the likelihood that the predetermined keyword is present within such a signal. As described herein in certain implementations the keyword model can include at least one of a hidden Markov model or a Gaussian mixture model. It should be appreciated that in certain embodiments the noise cancelling device via a unit therein such as one of the audio input unit s for example can generate one or more of the first audio signal or the second audio signal. The first audio signal and or the second audio signal can be embodied in or can include an analog signal or a digital signal.

At block it can be determined if the predetermined keyword is present in the signal that is analyzed at block . In response to ascertaining or otherwise establishing a positive determination that the predetermined keyword is not present in the second audio signal the analysis of received signal can be continued at block . In the alternative in response to ascertaining or otherwise establishing a positive determination that the predetermined keyword is present in the second audio signal noise cancellation can be suspended or otherwise terminated at block . Therefore in one aspect implementation of block on the received signal can be suspended or otherwise terminated. In one embodiment a noise cancellation switch integrated into or otherwise functionally coupled to the noise cancelling device e.g. noise cancelling device or that implements the subject example method can signal to the noise cancellation unit of such a device that noise cancellation is to be suspended or otherwise terminated.

It should be appreciated that blocks and may collectively embody a determination act or determination operation that permits establishing whether or not at least a portion of the received signal at block includes the predetermined keyword. In addition in certain embodiments one or more human speakers or persons associated with the received signal can be recognized at block . Accordingly at block the noise cancelling device that implements the subject example method can perform spectral analysis of at least a portion of the received signal in order to identify one or more frequencies associated with or otherwise pertaining to a specific speaker. It should be appreciated that in certain embodiments a human speaker associated with the signal received at block can be recognized before after or concurrently with the implementation of blocks and . Further in one or more of such embodiments determination can be made as to whether or not the predetermined keyword has been uttered by a predetermined speaker prior to implementing block .

In connection with the example method blocks and their implementation are respectively similar or identical to blocks which are described herein. At block interaction with the noise cancelling device e.g. noise cancelling device or that implements the subject example method can be monitored. For instance the interaction of an operator with the noise cancelling device in response to suspension or termination of noise cancellation can be monitored. More specifically yet not exclusively the time elapsed since suspension or termination of noise cancellation can be monitored. In one aspect short times e.g. about 500 ms can indicate or otherwise convey a false positive in which the predetermined keyword may have been unsatisfactorily e.g. erroneously determined to be present in the received signal. At block a keyword model e.g. an HMM of a specific phrase such as Hey Ben may be updated based at least on the monitored interaction. In certain embodiments the noise cancelling device that implements the subject example method can update the keyword model. In other embodiments a computing device such as a server that is remote to the noise cancelling device can update the keyword model.
