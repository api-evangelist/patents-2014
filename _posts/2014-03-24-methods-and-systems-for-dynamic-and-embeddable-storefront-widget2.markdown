This application claims benefit to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 805 295 filed on Mar. 26 2013 which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The present disclosure relates generally to an online storefront and more particularly to a virtual storefront embedded into a topical online community web page providing an easy accessible shopping experience to various community members.

A topical online community comprises a group of people interacting and sharing their views towards a topic of common interest. It may be a local or a worldwide community providing a platform to people from different geographical locations to interact. A topical online community may be a blog a web forum a social networking website a video sharing website and the like. A topical online community generally contains a plurality of topical community web pages also known as a fan page a group or channel that contain data related to a particular topic. A member or user of the topical online community may access such a fan page group or channel and thereon may access to data posted on the same. A popular example of a topical online community is Facebook where friends acquaintances and the like may interact share pictures videos like fan pages subscribe to groups of their interest and a lot like it. Another example of a topical online community is YouTube which provides a worldwide platform for people to share their videos wherein community members are free to watch or comment on the various videos posted by various people and may also subscribe to a channel related to a topic such as cricket rock music and the like. Yet another example is Twitter where the registered users can read post short messages and comment on short messages. People can thus use such sites to interact with people globally and browse information relating to specific topics.

Online shopping is a form of e commerce which allows customers to purchase available products without having to go out of their homes to buy products of their choice. Online shopping also provides geographically distributed vendors to connect with their potentials customers without having to be physically located near them. At present a large number of websites are available that are creating a global platform for online shopping. These websites allow their users to view entire lists of products they wish to buy providing them with a wide variety of options to choose. The transactions also are made through secure encrypted communication pipes thus making it secure and comfortable for the customers to shop. In a scenario a website may be a storefront for a particular brand or a particular merchant. In another scenario a website may be a marketplace containing a collection of products aggregated across multiple merchants.

Such an online storefront may allow the customers to select and pay for an online product of their choice including providing information about the product features specifications appearance pricing availability and the like. A major limitation of this system is that the products being displayed on the storefront may not be required by the users or may not be of any interest to the users. Another limitation of the systems and methods available at present is that a typical online storefront is located in a specific web address that a user needs to know and visit for making a purchase. Moreover the storefront owner needs to expend money in order to advertise such a web address so that the potential customers know the web location of the storefront.

Though there exist a mechanism for contextual online ads providing a means for promotion of products or services that may be displayed to the customers based on their interests however such promotions may not necessarily lead to a sale. Online ads upon being clicked direct the user to a web page where a sale may be closed however a contextual online ad does not get the user to directly purchase an item. Moreover the contextual ad may direct the user to a storefront that may not have the full context hence the products displayed at the storefront may not be context relevant. There exists a need for combining the benefits of a contextual advertisement with that of a topical online community for providing a contextual sales experience. Moreover there exists a need for conveniently embedding a virtual storefront in a community web page that dynamically provides relevant product suggestions to community members thus helping a community web page fan page group or channel administrator to monetize his efforts.

It will be understood that this disclosure in not limited to the particular systems and methodologies described as there can be multiple possible embodiments of the present disclosure which are not expressly illustrated in the present disclosure. It is also to be understood that the terminology used in the description is for the purpose of describing the particular versions or embodiments only and is not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.

The topical community web page is a constituent web page of a topical online community that enables a plurality of users to create an account and share information and media based on personal interest. The community web page is related to a particular interest or a context and hosts information or media related to that particular context. The systems and methods described herein may facilitate the community web page administrator community web page owner or any other person in similar capacity to either select one or more products statically or the products are dynamically extracted from one or more of a connected storefront or a marketplace or both. Such a system and method enhances the possibility of sales as the product is based on the context of the community web page on which it is displayed and the product may be purchased at the community web page itself thereby providing a seamless interaction for the user.

While for purposes of simplicity of explanation the illustrated methodologies are shown and described as a series of blocks steps it is to be appreciated that the methodologies are not limited by the order of the blocks as some blocks can occur in different orders and or concurrently with other blocks from that shown and described. Moreover less than all the illustrated blocks may be required to implement an example methodology. Blocks may be combined or separated into multiple components. Furthermore additional and or alternative methodologies can employ additional not illustrated blocks.

Software embodiments which comprise an ordered listing of executable instructions for implementing logical functions can be embodied in any computer readable medium for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system apparatus or device such as a computer based system processor containing system or other system that can fetch the instructions from the instruction execution system apparatus or device and execute the instructions. In the context of this document a computer readable medium can be any means that can contain store or communicate the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system apparatus or device. The computer readable medium can be for example but not limited to an electronic magnetic optical electromagnetic infrared or semiconductor system apparatus or device. More specific examples a non exhaustive list of the computer readable medium would include the following a portable computer diskette magnetic a random access memory RAM electronic a read only memory ROM electronic an erasable programmable read only memory EPROM or Flash memory electronic and a portable compact disc read only memory CDROM optical . In addition the scope of the present disclosure includes embodying the functionality of the example embodiments of the present disclosure in logic embodied in hardware or software configured mediums.

The preceding description has been presented with reference to various embodiments. Persons skilled in the art and technology to which this application pertains will appreciate that alterations and changes in the described structures and methods of operation can be practiced without meaningfully departing from the principle spirit and scope.
