Modern communication systems have an array of capabilities including integration of various communication modalities with different services. For example instant messaging voice video communications data application sharing white boarding and other forms of communication may be combined with presence and availability information for subscribers. Such systems may provide subscribers with the enhanced capabilities such as providing instructions to callers for various status categories alternate contacts calendar information and comparable features. Furthermore collaboration systems enabling users to share and collaborate in creating and modifying various types of documents and content may be integrated with multimodal communication systems providing different kinds of communication and collaboration capabilities. Such integrated systems are sometimes referred to as Unified Communication and Collaboration UC C systems.

While UC C systems provide for increased flexibility in communications they also present a number of implementation challenges. For instance a UC C system typically utilizes multiple interconnected networks to route various communications. Since different networks may be managed by different entities challenges thus arise in managing communications quality for communications that are routed among independently managed networks. Further UC C is typically implemented via software that can be loaded on mobile devices e.g. tablets smartphones laptops and so forth. Thus techniques for managing UC C communication traffic typically have to be fluid and dynamic to accommodate changing connection scenarios.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.

Techniques for propagating communication awareness for communication sessions are described. In at least some embodiments a communication session refers to an exchange of communication media between different communication endpoints. According to various embodiments communication awareness of a communication session is propagated among various autonomous networks involved in routing the communication session. Communication awareness for instance is propagated out of band from a data stream that carries the communication session.

Techniques for propagating communication awareness for communication sessions are described. In at least some embodiments a communication session refers to a real time exchange of communication media between different communication endpoints. Examples of a communication session include a Voice over Internet Protocol VoIP call a video call text messaging a file transfer content sharing and or combinations thereof. In at least some embodiments a communication session represents a Unified Communication and Collaboration UC C session.

According to various implementations communication awareness of a communication session is propagated among various autonomous networks involved in routing the communication session. Generally communication awareness includes attributes of the communication session such as identifiers for endpoints involved in the communication session identifiers for different autonomous networks involved in routing the communication session performance attributes e.g. session quality across the different autonomous networks and so forth. Communication awareness for instance is propagated out of band from a data stream that carries the communication session. Thus propagation of communication awareness for a communication session is independent from the communication session itself.

According to various implementations communication awareness for a communication session can be aggregated from different autonomous networks and propagated among the autonomous networks. For instance logic based network advisers are deployed in individual autonomous networks. The network advisers can interface with one another across the different autonomous networks to share and accumulate communication awareness for a communication session. For instance inter network communication between different autonomous networks can be leveraged to aggregate and propagate communication awareness. Alternatively or additionally a network adviser system can be employed that represents an integrated functionality with which different autonomous networks can interface to communicate and receive communication awareness.

Thus techniques discussed herein provide diverse scenarios for enlightening different autonomous networks with communication awareness. Such communication awareness enables entities involved in routing communication sessions to make informed decisions regarding routing and handling of communication session data.

The client network is representative of a network that provides the client device with connectivity to various networks and or services such as the Internet. The client network may be provided and or managed by a particular enterprise entity such as an Internet Service Provider ISP . For instance the client network represents a local access provider LAP network that provides the client device with network connectivity. The client access network may provide the client device with connectivity via a variety of different connectivity technologies such as broadband cable digital subscriber line DSL wireless cellular wireless data connectivity e.g. WiFi T carrier e.g. T1 Ethernet and so forth.

The client network includes client network components which are representative of different infrastructure components of the client network such as hardware and logic for implementing and maintaining the client network .

The client gateways are representative of functionality for routing data from the client network to other networks. Examples of the client gateways include a border router a customer premises equipment CPE router and or other device that interfaces with other networks to exchange data.

According to various implementations the client network controller maintains state awareness of the various client network components . For example the client network controller maintains a mapping of the client network components e.g. in terms of location and performance attributes of the client network controller such as signal quality for the different client network controller quality of service QoS attributes of the client network controller and so forth.

The client network controller for instance includes connectivity and logic that accesses routing information for the client network components . For example the client network controller can access an Interior Gateway Protocol IGP and or spanning tree switching topology for client the network components . This enables the client network controller to identify different data routing paths within the client network and to map and remap the different routing paths.

Connected to the client network are intermediate networks which in turn are connected to an endpoint network . The intermediate networks and the endpoint network are representative of different types and instances of wired and wireless networks that may be implemented and managed by different respective entities and according to a variety of different networking technologies such as such as broadband cable digital subscriber line DSL wireless cellular wireless data connectivity e.g. WiFi T carrier e.g. T1 Ethernet and so forth.

According to various implementations connectivity between the client network the intermediate networks and the endpoint network provide different communication paths between the client device and an endpoint .

Example attributes and aspects of the endpoint network components are discussed above with reference to the client network components .

According to various implementations communication between the client device and the endpoint is facilitated via a communication client of the client device and a communication client of the endpoint . Generally the communication clients are representative of functionalities to enable different forms of communication via the client device and the endpoint . Examples of the communication clients include a voice communication application e.g. a VoIP client a video communication application a messaging application a content sharing application and combinations thereof. The communication clients for instance enable different communication modalities to be combined to provide diverse communication scenarios.

In at least some implementations the communication clients represent interfaces to a communication service . Generally the communication service is representative of a service to perform various tasks for management of communication between the client device and the endpoint . The communication service for instance can manage initiation moderation and termination of communication sessions between the communication clients .

The communication service maintains a presence across many different networks and can be implemented according to a variety of different architectures such as a cloud based service a distributed service a web based service and so forth.

In at least some embodiments the communication service may be implemented as or be connected to a private branch exchange PBX in communication with a Public Switched Telephone Network PSTN to enable voice communication between the client device and other endpoints such as the endpoint .

Further to techniques for propagating communication awareness for communication sessions discussed herein the environment includes a network adviser system . Generally the network adviser system is representative of functionality propagate communication awareness to different entities. Communication awareness for instance refers to information pertaining to specific instances of communication sessions networks involved in routing communication sessions users that participate in communication sessions and so forth.

According to various implementations the network adviser system interfaces with a client network adviser of the client network intermediate network advisers of the intermediate networks and an endpoint network adviser of the endpoint network . The network adviser system can receive communication awareness from the different network advisers and can propagate communication awareness among the different network advisers to enable the individual networks to maintain state awareness of attributes of a communication session and thus make intelligent decisions to optimize communication session performance. In at least some implementations the network advisers can be deployed in the different networks as agents of the network adviser system . Alternatively the network advisors may be deployed and or implemented independently of the network adviser system .

According to various implementations the network advisers are representative of functionality to propagate communication awareness to network components of their respective networks and to maintain state awareness of attributes of their respective networks. The client network adviser for instance is representative of functionality to interface with the client network controller and or other client network components and serve as an information portal between the client network components and other entities such as the network adviser system and or other network advisers.

The intermediate network advisers are representative of functionalities to interface with the intermediate network controllers and or other intermediate network components and serve as information portals between the intermediate network components and other entities such as the network adviser system and or other network advisers. According to various implementations individual of the intermediate networks each include a different respective instance of the intermediate network advisers .

The endpoint network adviser is representative of functionality to interface with the endpoint network controller and or other endpoint network components and serve as an information portal between the endpoint network components and other entities such as the network adviser system and or other network advisers. Unless one of the client network adviser the intermediate network advisers or the endpoint network adviser is specifically referenced the term network adviser as used herein may refer to one or all of the client network adviser the intermediate network advisers or the endpoint network adviser .

According to one or more implementations the network adviser system may be implemented and or maintained by the communication service such as to propagate communication awareness for communication sessions managed by the communication service . Alternatively the network adviser system may be implemented separately and or independently from the communication service . The network adviser system for instance may aggregate and propagate communication awareness for different entities and or systems involved in communication sessions such as different communication clients and communication services.

A client network database DB is maintained for the client network and is representative of functionality to track various types of information for the client network . For instance the client network DB may be employed to track state information for various client network components such as performance attributes and statistics for the client network components . The client network controller for example can communicate state information for the client network components to the client network adviser which stores the state information as part of the client network DB . Alternatively or additionally the client network controller may interact with the client network DB directly such as to populate information to and retrieve information from the client network DB . According to various implementations information from the client network DB can be employed to make various decisions such as for determining routing paths for communication sessions of the client device .

Intermediate network databases DBs are maintained for the intermediate networks and are representative of functionalities to track various types of information for the intermediate networks . According to various implementations individual of the intermediate networks each include different a respective instance of the intermediate network DBs . For instance individual the intermediate network DBs may be employed to track state information for respective intermediate network components such as performance attributes and statistics for the intermediate network components for a respective intermediate network . Further aspects and functionalities of the intermediate network DBs are discussed above with reference to the client network DB .

An endpoint network database DB is maintained for the endpoint network and is representative of functionality to track various types of information for the endpoint network . For instance the endpoint network DB may be employed to track state information for various endpoint network components such as performance attributes and statistics for the endpoint network components . Further aspects and functionalities of the endpoint network DB are discussed above with reference to the client network DB .

According to one or more implementations the network adviser system maintains a system network database DB which is representative of functionality to track various information pertaining to the different networks of the environment . For example the system network DB maintains active state awareness of network attributes of the client network the intermediate networks and the endpoint network . Examples of such network attributes include performance attributes such as current and historical performance attributes of communication sessions across the different networks.

The system network DB may also track communication awareness for various current and historical communication sessions such as identifiers for individual communication sessions endpoints involved in individual communication sessions networks through which individual communication sessions are routed and so forth. As further detailed herein communication awareness pertaining to a communication session can be propagated out of band from data of the communication session itself. Thus decisions concerning handling and routing of communication session data may be made without processing and or handling the actual communication session data.

In at least some implementations communication awareness pertaining to communication sessions and network conditions can be propagated among the different network advisers to provide end to end awareness of conditions affecting a communication session. For instance the network advisers may communicate with one another to share information and independent of the network adviser system . Alternatively or additionally communication awareness pertaining to communication sessions may be propagated from the individual network advisers to the network adviser system which may aggregate the information as part of the system network DB . The network adviser system may share communication awareness among the different networks to enable communication awareness to be propagated to entities involved in routing and handling communication sessions. As yet another implementation the individual network controllers may communicate directly with the network adviser system to send and receive communication awareness pertaining to communication sessions.

Generally the client network the individual intermediate networks and the endpoint network each represent individual autonomous networks that connect with each other via their respective peering points e.g. gateways edge routers and so forth. The different networks for instance may be implemented and managed by different entities such as different infrastructure and service providers. Thus implementations discussed herein provide for a variety of different environments in which communication awareness may be propagated among different autonomous networks involved in routing and or handling communication sessions.

Having described an example environment in which the techniques described herein may operate consider now a discussion of example ways of propagating various attributes of communication sessions in communication systems in accordance with one or more embodiments.

According to various embodiments techniques can be employed to dynamically enlighten various entities with communication awareness such as information about communication sessions information about network conditions and so forth. For instance notification events can be generated that include various attributes of communication sessions and network conditions. The notification events can be propagated to different entities further to techniques for propagating communication awareness for communication sessions discussed herein.

In at least some embodiments notification events can be configured using a communication application programming interface API that can be leveraged to configure and communicate communication awareness to various entities involved in communication sessions. For example the communication API can identify dialogue events and session events for which attributes of a communication session and or network conditions can be identified. Consider for instance the following events and attributes that may be conveyed via a notification event generated using the communication API 

These events apply to various portions of a communication session such as the start update and end of a communication session. A dialogue event can include one or more of the following example attributes.

 1 Network Identifier This attributes can be leveraged to identify a network such as a network from which a dialogue event is received. In at least some implementations the network identifier may include an autonomous system AS number that identifies a particular network. With reference to the environment for instance the network identifier may identify the client network an intermediate network and or the endpoint network .

 2 Timestamp This attribute can be leveraged to specify timestamps for a start of a communication session updates that occur during a communication session and an end e.g. termination of a communication session.

 3 Source IP Address This attribute can be leveraged to specify an IP address for a device that is a source of media during a communication session e.g. a device that initiates a communication session. With reference to the environment for instance the source IP address may be for the client device or the endpoint .

 4 Destination IP Address This attribute can be leveraged to specify an IP address for a device that is to receive media as part of a communication session. With reference to the environment for instance the destination IP address may be for the client device or the endpoint .

 5 Transport Type This attribute can be leveraged to specify a transport type or combination of transport types for a communication session. Examples of transport types include Transmission Control Protocol TCP User Datagram Protocol UDP and so forth.

 6 Source Port this attribute can be leveraged to specify an identifier for a port at a source device e.g. a source device identified by the Source IP Address referenced above.

 7 Destination Port This attribute can be leveraged to specify an identifier for a port at a destination device e.g. a destination device identified by the Destination IP Address referenced above.

 8 Media Type This attribute can be leveraged to specify a media type and or types that are to be transmitted and or are being transmitted as part of a communication session. As discussed elsewhere herein the communication session can involve multiple different types of media. Thus the Media Type attribute can be employed to identify media types in a communication session such as for applying the service policies discussed herein.

 9 Bandwidth Estimation This attribute can be leveraged to specify an estimated bandwidth that is to be allocated for a communication session. The estimated bandwidth for instance can be based on various factors such as a privilege level associated with a user type and or types of media included in a communication session and so forth.

 10 To This attribute can be leveraged to identify a user to which media in a communication session is to be transmitted.

 11 From This attribute can be leveraged to identify a user from which media in a communication session is transmitted.

 12 Codec This attribute can be leveraged to specify a codec or codecs utilized as part of a communication session.

 13 Error Code This attribute can be leveraged to specify various error codes for errors that may occur as part of a communication session. For example errors can include errors that occur during initiation the communication session errors that occurred during a communication session errors that occur when a communication session is terminated and so forth.

These events can be generated and applied when a communication session experiences errors performance degradation and so forth. A session problem event may include one or more of the attributes discussed above with reference to Dialogue Events and may also include one or more of the following attributes.

 1 Mean Opinion Score MOS Degradation This attribute can be leveraged to specify a MOS for a communication session. The attribute for instance can be used to indicate that an overall quality of a communication session has decreased.

 2 Jitter Inter Arrival Time This attribute can be leveraged to specify jitter values for a communication session. The attribute for instance can be used to indicate that a jitter value or values have increased e.g. have exceeded a specified jitter value threshold.

 3 Packet Loss Rate This attribute can be leveraged to specify a packet loss rate for a communication session. The attribute for instance can be used to indicate that a packet loss rate has increased e.g. has exceeded a specified packet loss rate value threshold.

 4 Round Trip Delay RTD This attribute can be leveraged to specify RTD values for packets in communication sessions. The attribute for instance can be used to indicate that RTD values for packets have increased e.g. have exceeded a specified RTD value threshold.

 5 Concealment Ratio This attribute can be leveraged to specify a cumulative ratio of concealment time over speech time observed after starting a communication session. The attribute for instance can be used to specify that a concealment ratio has increased e.g. has exceeded a specified concealment ratio value threshold.

Thus various notifications discussed herein can include one or more of the attributes discussed above and can be used to propagate communication awareness to various entities. In at least some implementations attributes can be linked to particular networks and or network components to characterize performance attributes of the networks and or network components.

Having described an example ways of propagating communication awareness consider now some example implementation scenarios for propagating communication awareness for communication sessions in accordance with one or more embodiments.

The following section describes example implementation scenarios for propagating communication awareness for communication sessions in accordance with one or more implementations. The implementation scenarios may be implemented in the environment discussed above and or any other suitable environment.

In the scenario a user authenticates the client device with the communication service via the communication client . The user then enters a request to initiate a communication session with the endpoint . For instance the user selects an indicia indicating a request to initiate a communication session such as by entering a phone number for the endpoint selecting a contact from a contact list selecting a hyperlink and so forth.

In response to the request to initiate the communication session a communication session is established between the communication client of the client device and the communication client of the endpoint . According to various implementations a routing path for routing the communication session is selected using any suitable algorithm such as a shortest path algorithm applied by the client network controller the intermediate network controllers and or the endpoint network controller . In at least some embodiments the routing path is derived based on a particular routing protocol such as Border Gateway Protocol BGP .

Further in response to the request to initiate the communication session the communication client sends a start dialogue event to the client network adviser . The start dialogue event includes information to uniquely identify the communication session . For instance the notification event referenced above can be used to communicate attributes of the communication session such as Source and Destination identifiers Port numbers Session type codec and so forth.

Based on the start dialogue event the client network adviser communicates a session query the client network controller for information about the communication session . Generally the session query includes information from the start dialogue event such as to identify the communication session . The session query also requests routing information for the communication session .

In response to the session query the client network controller determines routing path information for the communication session within the client network such as an identifier for a particular client gateway via which the communication session is exiting the client network to the intermediate networks . The client network controller generates a session response that includes the routing information. The session response may also be populated with other information such as performance attributes of the routing path in the client network . Examples of such performance attributes include available bandwidth packet error rate jitter packet loss rate and so forth observed across the routing path. The client network controller then communicates the session response to the client network adviser .

Further to the scenario the client network adviser generates a client session notification that is populated with information from the start dialogue event and the session response such as identifiers for endpoints involved in the communication session routing information e.g. a client gateway from which the communication session is exiting the client network performance attributes of the routing path and so forth. The client network adviser communicates the client session notification to an intermediate network adviser for an intermediate network that is the next network along the routing path of the communication session . For instance the client network adviser communicates the client session notification through the client gateway that is identified by the client network controller as being the exit gateway for the communication session .

Accordingly the intermediate network adviser receives the client session notification and parses the notification to determine the various information included therein. The intermediate network adviser for instance identifies the client device and the endpoint from the client session notification . According to various implementations the intermediate network adviser stores information from the client session notification in the intermediate network DB . For instance a session record for the communication session is created in the intermediate network DB and the information from the client session notification is stored as part of the session record.

Continuing with the scenario the intermediate network adviser generates a session query that includes information from the client session notification such as identifiers for the client device and the endpoint performance attributes of the client network and so forth. The intermediate network adviser communicates the session query the intermediate network controller for the respective intermediate network . Generally the session query requests routing information for the communication session within the intermediate network .

The intermediate network controller receives the session query and determines a routing path for the communication session within the intermediate network such as based on the identification of the endpoint e.g. the IP address and or other identifier and utilizing any suitable routing path algorithm and or protocol. The intermediate network controller returns a session response to the intermediate network adviser that identifies a routing path of the communication session within the intermediate network .

The session response for instance identifies intermediate network components through which the communication session is routed and an edge router via which the communication session exits the intermediate network on its way to the endpoint . The session response further includes performance attributes of the routing path.

Further to the scenario the intermediate network adviser generates an intermediate session notification which includes routing information for the communication session from the session response . The intermediate network adviser also populates the intermediate session notification with routing information from the client session notification . Thus according to various implementations the intermediate session notification includes cumulative path routing information for the communication session that starts at the client device up to the edge router via which the communication session exits the intermediate network and enters the endpoint network .

In addition to being used to generate the intermediate session notification such cumulative path routing information may be stored in the intermediate network DB . For instance the cumulative path routing information may be stored as part of a session record for the communication session as part of a network record for the client network and the intermediate network and so forth.

While the scenario is discussed with reference to the communication session being communicated through a single intermediate network it is to be appreciated that in at least some implementations the communication session may travel through multiple intermediate networks between the client network and the endpoint network . Thus the process described above for ascertaining and communication routing path information may be performed multiple times e.g. iteratively across multiple different intermediate networks to cumulatively aggregate routing path information for the communication session across multiple different intermediate networks . According in one or more implementations the intermediate session notification includes path routing information for the client network and multiple intermediate networks .

Continuing with the scenario the intermediate network adviser communicates the intermediate session notification to the endpoint network adviser . For instance the intermediate network adviser transmits the intermediate session notification through an edge router that is identified by the intermediate network controller as being the exit router for the communication session .

The endpoint network adviser receives the intermediate session notification and parses the notification to determine the various information included therein. The endpoint network adviser for instance identifies the client device and the endpoint from the intermediate session notification . The endpoint network adviser generates a session query that includes information from the intermediate session notification such as identifiers for the client device and the endpoint performance attributes of the client network and or the intermediate network and so forth. The endpoint network adviser communicates the session query the endpoint network controller . Generally the session query requests routing information for the communication session within the endpoint network .

According to various implementations the endpoint network adviser stores information from the intermediate session notification in the endpoint network DB such as part of a session record for the communication session .

Further to the scenario the endpoint network controller receives the session query and determines a routing path for the communication session within the endpoint network such as based on the identification of the endpoint e.g. the IP address and or other identifier and utilizing any suitable routing path algorithm and or protocol. The endpoint network controller returns a session response to the endpoint network adviser that identifies a routing path of the communication session within the endpoint network .

The session response for instance identifies endpoint network components through which the communication session is routed to from the endpoint gateway to the endpoint . The session response further includes performance attributes of the routing path.

The endpoint network adviser stores information from the session response in the endpoint network DB . For instance the information is stored in a session record for the communication session a network record and so forth.

Accordingly the endpoint network adviser aggregates cumulative path route information for the communication session starting with the client network through intermediate network s and within the endpoint network up to the endpoint . The endpoint network adviser may store this information in the endpoint network DB such as part of a session record for the communication session network records for different networks involved in communicating the communication session and so forth.

According to various implementations the endpoint network adviser may communicate the cumulative path route information to other entities such as back to the intermediate network adviser and or the client network adviser . Thus communication awareness of conditions pertaining to the communication session can be shared among autonomous networks involved in routing and or handling the communication session.

In the scenario a communication session is initiated or scheduled to be initiated between the client device and the endpoint . Accordingly the client network adviser ascertains path routing information for the communication session across the client network . Example ways of ascertaining path routing information are discussed above and may include querying the client network controller for the path routing information.

The client network adviser generates a client session notification that includes the path routing information and communicates the client session notification to the network adviser system . The network adviser system ascertains path routing information from the client session notification such as identifiers for the client device and the endpoint client network components through which the communication session is routed performance attributes of the communication session across the client network and so forth. The network adviser system stores the path routing information in the system network DB such as part of a session record for the communication session a network record for the client network and so forth.

Continuing with the scenario the intermediate network adviser ascertains path routing information for the communication session across the intermediate network . Example ways of ascertaining path routing information are discussed above and may include querying the intermediate network controller for the path routing information.

The intermediate network adviser generates an intermediate session notification that includes the path routing information and communicates the intermediate session notification to the network adviser system . The network adviser system ascertains path routing information from the intermediate session notification such as identifiers for the client device and the endpoint intermediate network components through which the communication session is routed performance attributes of the communication session across the intermediate network and so forth. The network adviser system stores the path routing information in the system network DB such as part of a session record for the communication session a network record for the intermediate network and so forth.

Further to the scenario the endpoint network adviser ascertains path routing information for the communication session across the endpoint network . Example ways of ascertaining path routing information are discussed above and may include querying the endpoint network controller for the path routing information.

The endpoint network adviser generates an endpoint session notification that includes the path routing information and communicates the endpoint session notification to the network adviser system . The network adviser system ascertains path routing information from the endpoint session notification such as identifiers for the client device and the endpoint endpoint network components through which the communication session is routed performance attributes of the communication session across the endpoint network and so forth. The network adviser system stores the path routing information in the system network DB such as part of a session record for the communication session a network record for the endpoint network and so forth.

Continuing with the scenario the network adviser system communicates communication awareness to the client network adviser communication awareness to the intermediate network adviser and communication awareness to the endpoint network adviser . According to various implementations the communication awareness represent aggregations of path routing and other information received from the different network advisers. The communication awareness for instance may be duplicates of one another and may identify end to end path routing information for the communication session . Alternatively the communication awareness may each include different sets of information that are individually tailored to the specific network and or network adviser to which they are communicated.

Thus the scenario illustrates that in at least some implementations the network adviser system can serve to aggregate communication awareness from different networks. The network adviser system for instance serves as a centralized service that can receive aggregate and propagate communication awareness.

As referenced above the scenario may represent an alternative or addition to the scenario . For instance in an alternative scenario communication awareness may be aggregated and propagated by the network adviser system but not via inter network communication between the different network advisers. In an additional scenario communication awareness can be aggregated and propagated between the different network advisors as well as being aggregated and propagated by the network adviser system . Thus techniques discussed herein provide for diverse scenarios for propagating communication awareness among entities involved in communication sessions.

In at least some implementations the various notifications queries and responses discussed in the scenarios above may be configured using the example notification events discussed above such as via the communication API detailed above. For instance values for the various attributes discussed with reference to the communication API can be used to propagate the various information discussed with reference to the scenarios . Thus the communication API may be leveraged to propagate communication awareness among different entities involved in communication sessions.

As illustrated in the scenarios communication awareness of the communication sessions is propagated out of band from the communication sessions e.g. using data streams that are independent of the communication session and the communication session . For instance the various notifications and responses represent instances of communication awareness that may be propagated among entities involved in communication sessions.

While the scenarios are discussed with reference to a communication session between the client device and the endpoint it is to be appreciated that the techniques discussed herein may be employed to propagate communication awareness for multiple communication sessions e.g. multiple concurrent communication sessions. For instance the various queries responses and notifications may be employed to determine and propagate communication awareness for multiple concurrent communication sessions that include the communication session and or the communication session such as part of a conference call that involves the client device the endpoint and other endpoints not expressly illustrated. As another example the communication session and or the communication session may be part of a multicast communication event from the client device to multiple other endpoints including the endpoint . Thus communication awareness may be propagated along multiple different routing paths and for individual communication sessions that are concurrently occurring or scheduled to be implemented concurrently.

While the scenarios are discussed with reference to communication awareness being propagated in conjunction with and or after the communication sessions are initiated this is not intended to be limiting. For instance the various queries responses and notifications may be generated and communicated prior to initiating the communication sessions . In at least some implementations for instance the scenarios may be performed in response to detecting that the communication session and or the communication session are scheduled to be initiated. A calendar event for instance may indicate that the communication session and or the communication session is scheduled to be initiated at a scheduled future date and time.

Thus the scenarios may be performed to propagate communication awareness of the communication session and or the communication session prior to the schedule date and time. Such proactive communication awareness may be employed for various purposes such as enable individual networks to set aside resources to handle the scheduled communication sessions .

In at least some implementations the scenarios may be performed while a communication session is in progress such as multiple times during a communication session. For instance the scenarios may be performed periodically during a communication session to maintain active state awareness of communication session conditions. Alternatively or additionally the scenarios may be performed in response to a trigger event such as an indication of session problems and or of network problems within a particular network. Thus communication awareness propagated according to the scenarios may be leveraged for various purposes such as for session initiation session diagnostics and repair session termination post session analytics and so forth.

Accordingly communication awareness of conditions pertaining to communication sessions can be shared among entities involved in routing and or handling the communication sessions. Such communication awareness can be leveraged in various ways such as for optimizing performance of the communication sessions mitigating errors that occur and or may occur in the communication sessions and so forth.

Having discussed some example implementation scenarios consider now a discussion of some example procedures in accordance with one or more embodiments.

The following discussion describes some example procedures for propagating communication awareness for communication sessions in accordance with one or more embodiments. The example procedures may be employed in the environment of the system of and or any other suitable environment. The procedures for instance represent example procedures for implementing the implementation scenarios described above. In at least some embodiments the steps described for the various procedures can be implemented automatically and independent of user interaction.

Step ascertains that a communication session is initiated or scheduled to be initiated. Generally a communication session refers to an exchange of communication media between different communication endpoints. With reference to the environment for example one or more of the network advisers receives an indication of a communication session that involves one or more of the networks. The indication can be received in various ways such as via a notification from a communication client e.g. the communication client from a network controller from the network adviser system and so forth.

In at least some implementations a scheduled communication session can be detected such as based on a calendar event that includes a scheduled communication session. For instance a user can leverage a calendar application to schedule a calendar event for a future date and time such as a web meeting a conference call a multicast session and so forth. The user can specify parameters for the calendar event such as a date and time users to be invited types of communication media involved and so forth. Thus ascertaining that a communication session is scheduled to be initiated can be based on detecting a calendar event that includes the communication session.

Step aggregates communication awareness for multiple autonomous networks along a routing path of the communication session. Example ways of aggregating communication awareness are discussed above such as with reference to the scenarios . For instance communication awareness can be aggregated based on communication of routing path attributes between different networks e.g. between different network advisers.

Alternatively or additionally communication awareness can be received and aggregated by a system that is implemented separately from the autonomous networks such as the network adviser system . For example the network adviser system can receive routing path attributes from the individual autonomous networks and can aggregate the routing path attributes to generate communication awareness.

Generally communication awareness includes various types of information that pertains to a communication session as well as networks and entities involved in the communication session. Example attributes that may be included in communication awareness are detailed above with reference to the notification events and or the communication API. Communication awareness for instance identifies endpoints involved in a communication session media type s for a communication session attributes e.g. performance attributes of autonomous networks through which the communication session is routed or will be routed and so forth.

Step propagates the communication awareness of the communication session among the multiple autonomous networks. The communication awareness for instance is communicated out of band from a data stream of the communication session.

In at least some implementations the communication awareness is communicated between the autonomous networks themselves such as via network to network communications. For instance network advisers for the different autonomous networks can engage in direct communication with one another to exchange communication awareness.

Alternatively or additionally communication awareness can be propagated by a service and or system that is implemented separately from the autonomous networks such as the network adviser system .

Step receives an indication of a communication session that is initiated or scheduled to be initiated. A network adviser for a particular autonomous network for instance receives a notification that a communication session is initiated such as from a communication client. Alternatively or additionally a separate system or service e.g. the network adviser system receives an indication that a communication session is initiated. The network adviser system for instance may be notified of the communication session such as by a network adviser the communication service and so forth.

Step ascertains routing path attributes for the communication session within an autonomous network through which the communication session is routed. With reference to the environment for instance a network adviser can ascertain routing path attributes via a query to a respective network controller. Alternatively or additionally the network adviser system can ascertain the routing path attributes such as via a notification from a respective network adviser and or network controller. Examples of various routing path attributes are detailed above.

Step communicates communication awareness of the communication session including the routing path attributes to a different autonomous network involved in routing the communication session. The communication awareness for instance is communicated out of band from a data stream of the communication session. For example a network adviser for the autonomous network can communicate the communication awareness to a network adviser for the different autonomous network. Alternatively or additionally the network adviser system can communicate the communication awareness to a network adviser for the different autonomous network.

In at least some implementations the communication awareness may represent cumulative routing path attributes for multiple different autonomous networks. As discussed above with reference to the example implementation scenarios communication awareness may be cumulatively aggregated via communication of routing path attributes between different autonomous networks. Alternatively or additionally portions of communication awareness may be communicated from different autonomous networks to the network adviser system which may aggregate and propagate the communication awareness.

Step receives communication awareness of a communication session from an autonomous network along a routing path of the communication session. According to various implementations the communication awareness includes attributes of the routing path within the autonomous network and is received out of band from a data stream of the communication session. The communication awareness may be received by various entities such as a network adviser for a respective network the network adviser system and so forth.

Step augments the communication awareness with attributes of the routing path within a different autonomous network along the routing path of the communication session. A network adviser for the different autonomous network for instance receives the communication awareness from another autonomous network and augments the communication awareness with routing path attributes of its respective autonomous network. Alternatively or additionally the network adviser system augments the communication awareness with routing path attributes of the different autonomous network.

Step communicates the augmented communication awareness to a further autonomous network along the routing path of the communication session. According to various implementations the augmented communication awareness is communicated out of band from the communication session e.g. from a data stream of the communication session. The different autonomous network for instance communicates the augmented communication awareness to a next network e.g. a next network adviser along the routing path of the communication session.

Alternatively or additionally the network adviser system communicates the augmented communication awareness to a next network e.g. a next network adviser along the routing path of the communication session. In at least some implementations responsive to the communication awareness being augmented the network adviser system may communicate the augmented communication awareness to multiple different autonomous networks and or network advisers along the routing path of the communication session.

Step receives an indication of a change in routing path attributes for a portion of a routing path for a communication session. According to various implementations the indication of the change is received while the communication session is in progress. The portion of the routing path for instance occurs within an autonomous network of a group of autonomous networks that make up the total routing path. For example the portion of the routing path corresponds to a set of network components along a portion of the routing path within a particular autonomous network.

Examples of different routing path attributes that may change are discussed above with reference to the example notification events and the example communication API. The change in routing path attributes for instance may be based on an indication of a decrease in session quality and or an increase in session errors that occurs in the communication session across the portion of the routing path. Examples of such indicia include an increase in jitter packet loss rate packet error rate and so forth. In at least some implementations the change in routing path attributes may be indicated based on user input specifying that the quality of the communication session has decreased.

The change in routing path attributes may be based on changes in network conditions within an autonomous network that hosts the portion of the routing path such as an increase in network congestion a failure of one or more network components a decrease in available bandwidth and so forth.

According to various implementations the indication of the change may be received by an entity associated with an autonomous network that hosts the portion of the routing path such as a network adviser for the autonomous network. Additionally or alternatively the indication of the change may be received by another entity such as a network adviser for an autonomous network that hosts a different portion of the routing path the network adviser system and so forth.

Step propagates communication awareness of the change in routing path attributes to an autonomous network that hosts a different portion of the routing path for the communication session. According to various implementations the communication awareness of the change is propagated while the communication session is in progress. For instance a network adviser for a network that hosts the portion of the routing path generates a notification of the change in the portion of the routing path. The network adviser then communicates the notification to a network adviser for a different autonomous network that hosts a different portion of the routing path such as an adjacent network along the routing path.

Alternatively or additionally the network advisor can communicate the notification to the network adviser system which can propagate communication awareness of the change in routing path attributes to one or more network advisers for other autonomous networks along the routing path.

In at least some implementations communication awareness of a change in routing path attributes can enable the routing path to be reconfigured. For instance if the change indicates errors and or problems in the communication session across the portion of the routing path the routing path can be recalculated around that portion of the routing path. For instance a network adviser that detects the change in routing path attributes can notify a respective network controller which can recalculate the routing path around the portion of the routing path. The routing path for example can be recalculated to include a different autonomous network such that the problematic portion of the routing path is avoided.

According to various implementations the methods described above may be performed multiple times at various stages of a communication session such as prior to session initiation concurrent with session initiation during a communication session at session termination and post communication session. For instance communication awareness of a communication session can be propagated and updated in real time while the communication session is in progress to maintain dynamic and active state awareness of conditions that may affect the communication session.

Communication awareness of a communication session may also be proactively communicated prior to initiation of the communication session such as to enlighten autonomous networks of the upcoming communication session and enable the autonomous networks to make adjustments and or preparations to accommodate the communication session. Communication awareness of a communication session may be communicated after termination of the communication session such as for system diagnostics and statistical analysis of network performance that occurred during the communication session.

Thus techniques discussed herein provide a wide variety of scenarios and implementations for propagating communication awareness to different entities involved in routing communication sessions. Communication awareness enables such entities to make informed decisions regarding routing and handling of communication session data.
