Aspects of the disclosure relate generally to a system and method for generating authentication tokens. Specifically aspects of the disclosure relate to an authentication server that generates authentication tokens signed with a device ID.

Within a typical authenticated website when a customer successfully authenticates into the website s server the server generates an authentication token for that customer s session. This authentication token bears the proof that the customer has been successfully authenticated within the session. Any subsequent requests to the server for protected resources must include the token so that the server may validate that the customer is indeed authenticated prior to serving the request. The authentication token is typically carried through browser cookies. Most authenticated websites use this authentication token as the sole means for determining whether the customer is authenticated. One significant disadvantage of this approach is that once the token is stolen the token thief will be able to replay the customer s session from any device before the token expires. Thus there is a need for an additional level of security added to authentication tokens.

Having described an example of a computing device that can be used in implementing various aspects of the disclosure and an operating environment in which various aspects of the disclosure can be implemented several embodiments will now be discussed in greater detail.

A user may access protected resources via a computing device such as computing device . In some aspects the user may launch a browser stored at the computing device and enter a website hosted by authentication server to access protected resources. In some other aspects the computing device may comprise a mobile device such as a mobile phone. The user may launch a mobile application stored on the mobile phone to access the protected resources from authentication server . In either aspect upon first entering the website via the browser or upon first launching the mobile application authentication server may output a prompt requiring the user to enter log in information. The log in information may comprise one or more of a username password challenge question and answer pin number and the like.

After the user has entered his her log in information the user may select an option to submit the information to authentication server in the form of an authentication request. In certain aspects the user may transmit the authentication request from a browser stored at computing device . The browser may comprise computer programming script such as JavaScript. The script may be configured to retrieve device attributes from computing device . The device attributes may uniquely identify the device from which the user is submitting the authentication request. Device attributes may comprise at least one of a device operating system a device type and a device serial number. The script may retrieve the device attributes from the operating system running on computing device . For example the script may perform application calls or interact with an application programming interface to retrieve the device attributes. In some aspects the script may retrieve the device attributes after the user has selected the option to submit the authentication request. The script may retrieve the device attributes at other times.

In some aspects the user may submit an authentication request from a mobile application stored at a mobile computing device . The mobile application may comprise a client side software development kit SDK . Similar to the script stored at a browser the client side SDK may retrieve device attributes of the mobile computing device after the user has selected the option to submit the authentication request. The client side SDK may also retrieve the device attributes at other times. When the user selects the option to submit the authentication request the computing device may also transmit the device attributes to authentication server . Thus the authentication request may comprise the user s log in information and device attributes.

At step authentication server may receive the authentication request including the device attributes. Authentication server may comprise one or more application components such as an authentication component and a protected resources component. The authentication component may be used to receive authentication requests generate authentication tokens and device IDs and transmit authentication tokens. Protected resources component may be used to receive and validate tokens and to output protected resources.

After receiving the authentication request and device attributes at step authentication server may generate a device ID at step . Authentication server may generate a device ID using the received device attributes. The device ID may comprise a string of randomly generated characters that uniquely and persistently identify the device from which the user submitted the authentication request such as computing device or computing device . In some aspects the authentication server may only generate a device ID after determining that the user s log in information is valid. For instance authentication server may compare the log in information included in the authentication request with log in information stored at memory . If the received log in information matches the stored log in information authentication server may generate the device ID at step . If authentication server determines that the log in information is invalid authentication server may output an authentication landing web page where the user may once again be prompted to log in.

After generating the device ID at step authentication server may create an authentication token signed with the device ID at step . The authentication server may create an authentication token using one of the many known methods in the art. However in order to uniquely identify the user s computing device authentication server may sign the authentication token with the generated device ID. In other words the authentication token may be encrypted with the device ID such that the authentication token comprises the device ID. Authentication server may store the device ID at database . Authentication server may also associate the device ID with other customer information such as the customer s name account information device attributes customer ID and the like. Therefore the authentication server may be able to quickly identify a customer based on a device ID or authentication token signed with a device ID.

At step authentication server may transmit the authentication token to the computing device that transmitted the authentication request such as computing device or computing device . For instance a financial institution customer may transmit an authentication request from computing device . After authentication server reviews the log in information in the authentication request it may generate a device ID used to sign an authentication token for the customer. Authentication server may then transmit the authentication token to the computing device at step . If the authentication request was received from a browser stored on computing device authentication server may transmit the authentication token in the form of a cookie. The cookie may comprise the device ID generated at step . Computing device may receive the cookie at step and store the cookie within the browser. The browser may store the cookie encrypted with the device ID for an extended period of time such as days weeks months or years.

In some aspects the authentication server may receive an authentication request from a mobile application stored on a mobile computing device . In response authentication server after validating that the log in information provided within the authentication request is valid may generate a device ID used to sign an authentication token. Authentication server may then transmit the authentication token to the mobile application as a token that may be stored in the mobile application s current session. The authentication token may be stored at the mobile application s session for the length of the current session or in some cases for an extended period of time.

After the customer s computing device has received and stored the authentication token from authentication server the computing device may transmit the authentication token to authentication server in conjunction with subsequent requests to access protected resources from authentication server . Each subsequent time a customer submits a request to access protected resources such as bank account information from the authentication server the customer s computing device may submit an authentication token along with the request for protected resources.

At step authentication server may receive a request to access protected resources that includes the authentication token and device attributes. The device attributes may be received from the client s device using script or client side SDK as described above for step . In some cases an authentication token may be received from a separate device from the device for which the authentication token and device ID were generated. For example a token thief may attempt to access a customer s protected resources by stealing an authentication token from the customer and using the authentication token to access protected resources on the thief s device. In some other cases an authentication token may be an attempt to mimic a previously generated authentication token. However if the request to access protected resources is made from the device for which the authentication token and device ID were generated such as computing device and computing device in the examples above the device attributes should be the same as those received at step . In either case authentication server may receive a request to access protected resources wherein the request includes an authentication token and device attributes at step .

At step authentication server may generate a comparison device ID based on the device attributes included in the request received at step . The authentication server may generate the comparison device ID similar to how it generated the device ID at step . For example memory may store one or more algorithms or instructions for generating device ID s and comparison device ID s based on received device attributes. The algorithms or instructions stored in memory may ensure that a single device ID or comparison device ID is generated for a single set of device attributes. In other words when authentication server receives a set of device attributes authentication server may generate a device ID. Then when authentication server later receives the same set of device attributes authentication server may generate a comparison device ID that is identical to the device ID. Thus the device ID and comparison device ID may be identical when generated using identical device attributes.

Conversely if authentication server receives a first set of device attributes it may generate a device ID. If authentication server later receives a second set of device attributes it may generate a comparison device ID that is different from the device ID. In other words the device ID and comparison device ID may be different when generated using device attributes that are not identical.

At step authentication server may decrypt the authentication token it received at step and retrieve the device ID generated from the decrypted authentication token. Authentication server may use one or more well known decryption methods to decrypt the authentication token. After decrypting the authentication token authentication server may be able to retrieve the device ID that was previously encrypted in the authentication token. Recall that authentication server generated the device ID at step using device attributes included in an authentication request at step . Now at step the device ID is retrieved from a decrypted authentication token included in a user s request from a device to access protected resources.

At step authentication server may validate the authentication token by determining whether the device ID retrieved from the authentication token matches the comparison device ID. Authentication server may perform this step at the protected resources component after first decrypting the received authentication token. Authentication server may compare the device ID retrieved at step with the comparison device ID generated at step . By comparing the device ID with the comparison device ID authentication server may be able to determine whether the request to access protected resources at step is coming from the same device at submitted an authentication request at step and for which the authentication toked signed with the device ID was created at step . Because both the device ID and comparison ID were created using attributes of the device transmitting an authentication request and a request to access protected resources respectively an identical device ID and comparison device ID may indicate that the requests were submitted from the same device. Likewise when the device ID is not the same as the comparison device ID authentication server may determine that the request to access protected resources comes from a device that was not validated to use the authentication token.

After authentication server validates the authentication token authentication server may output a response. If at step authentication server determines that the authentication token does not include the device ID the response may comprise outputting an authentication landing page at step . The authentication landing page may comprise a prompt requesting the customer to input log in information such as a username and password. The authentication landing page may comprise a web page displayed at a browser or may be displayed at a mobile application.

If instead authentication server determines that the authentication token includes the device ID or in other words the authentication token consists of a valid authentication token at step authentication server may output a response that includes the protected resources for which a request was received at step . The protected resources may be displayed at a web page on a browser or may be displayed at a mobile application. The customer may view and enter further commands after receiving the protected resources. Subsequent requests to view protected resources may comprise the steps shown at beginning at step .
