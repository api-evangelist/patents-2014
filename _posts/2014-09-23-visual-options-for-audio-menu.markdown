Businesses and other organizations generally rely on automated response telephony systems in order to serve a large segment of customers while containing costs. Such systems usually utilize automated audio menus or scripts that can be played back when a call is established between a calling device such as a mobile phone and an automated response telephony system. Playback of the automated audio menus typically provides the available menu options relatively slowly and sequentially. In addition automated audio menus are sometimes altered so a previously familiar selection via a touch tone telephone e.g. pressing number 1 directs the caller to a different branch of an automated menu tree than it did last time it was selected.

The disclosure recognizes and addresses in at least certain aspects the limited utility and lack of convenience of automated audio menus presented by automated response telephony systems. More particularly yet not exclusively the disclosure recognizes the difficulty or inconvenience associated with interacting with a typical automated attendant or an interactive voice response IVR system via an automated audio menu. In accordance with certain aspects of this disclosure interactive digital menus can provide visual options that can replace and or augment automated audio menus of automated communication platforms. A digital menu of options associated with an automated communication platform may be provided in response to a call from a communication device to the automated communication platform having an automated audio menu for interaction with such a platform. The digital menu can include options that correspond to options in the automated audio menu. The options can be displayed at the communication device via interactive buttons or other actionable indicia. The digital menu also can include options customized to the communication device. For example in addition or in the alternative the digital menu of options can include options associated with shortcuts for specific responses to the automated communication platform and or options for responses customized to the communication device and the automated communication platform. Shortcut options and or customized options can be displayed at the communication device with indicia distinctive from other options corresponding to the automated audio menu. Actuation or selection of an option displayed at the communication device can cause the communication device to generate and or transmit one or more tones such as dual tone multi frequency DTMF signals . Other type of code information besides the one or more tones also can be utilized or leveraged where actuation or selection of an option displayed at the communication device can cause the communication device to generate code information e.g. numeric data alphanumeric data or the like . As such actuation or selection of a displayed option can cause the communication to generate code information e.g. a sequence of one or more tones numeric data alphanumeric data or the like. The code information e.g. tone s numeric data alphanumeric data or the like so generated can correspond to the selected or actuated option.

In accordance with the present disclosure communication devices that can utilize or otherwise leverage the interactive digital menus can generally include one or more processors and one or more memory devices communication devices e.g. a system bus a memory bus or the like input output interface s that can include display device s and or a radio unit for wireless communication. More specifically in one example a communication device in accordance with this disclosure can be embodied in a tethered computing device or a portable computing device such as a mobile tablet computer an electronic book reader also referred to as an e reader a mobile telephone e.g. a smartphone and the like. In another example the communication device can be embodied in or can comprise a wearable computing device such as a watch goggles or head mounted visors or the like. In yet another example the communication device can be embodied in or can comprise portable consumer electronics equipment such as a camera a media reproduction device a portable television set a gaming console a navigation device a voice over internet protocol VoIP telephone or two way communication device and the like. In additional or alternative embodiments a combination of a communication device e.g. a VoIP telephone and a second device e.g. a television set can utilize the interactive digital menus of this disclosure where the communication device and the second device can be synchronized so as to display or otherwise present a digital menu options at the second device which may be referred to as a second screen .

With reference to the drawings illustrates an example operational environment that can leverage digital menus that provide visual options for replacement and or augmentation of automated audio menus of automated response telephony systems in accordance with one or more aspects of the disclosure. As illustrated a communication device which is represented for the sake of illustration with a wireless smartphone can establish a call session with an automated communication platform via a first communication pathway herein referred to as pathway I . The call session can be embodied in or can include a voice call or a data session implemented using a cellular radio telecommunication protocol VoIP protocols or protocols suitable for videotelephony. The automated communication platform can be embodied in or can include an interactive voice response IVR system and or an automated attendant. As part of the communication call established between the communication device and the automated communication platform the automated communication platform can communicate information indicative or otherwise representative of an automated audio menu of options associated with the available functionality of the automated communication platform . The communication device can receive the information and can provide sound representative of the automated audio menu. The first communication pathway can be established via at least one network of a group of one or more networks and can utilize one or more telecommunication protocols packet switched circuit switched or a combination thereof that can exchange of voice natural and or simulated data and or signaling e.g. tones numeric codes alphanumeric codes . As an example the at least one network can include a cellular network or a portion thereof and an internet protocol IP multimedia subsystem IMS platform. The network s can include wireless and or wired communication networks having various footprints e.g. a wide area network WAN a metropolitan area network MAN a local area network LAN a home area network HAN and or a personal area network PAN .

In addition the communication device also can communicate via a second communication pathway herein referred to as pathway II with a digital menu server . For example the second communication pathway may be embodied in one or more out of band channels available for communication within the communication protocol utilized to establish the call between the communication device and the digital menu server . In one embodiment the communication device can communicate or otherwise provide via the second communication pathway a telephone number which is exemplified as 1 555 123 4567 in associated with the automated communication platform . The communication device can communicate e.g. transmit the telephone number to the digital menu server at any time in relation to establishing the call with the automated communication platform . More specifically the communication device can transmit such a telephone number before after or substantially concurrently with initiating or otherwise establishing the call with the automated communication platform . It should be appreciated that while reference is made to a telephone number in the embodiments illustrated herein the present disclosure is not so limited and other types of communication addresses are contemplated. As such a communication address in accordance with this disclosure can be embodied in or can include a telephone number a subscriber number an international mobile subscriber identity IMSI an electronic serial number ESN an internet protocol IP address a session initiation protocol SIP address a media access control MAC address and or any other information that can be utilized or otherwise leveraged to identify a communication device and or system with which to establish a communication link for the exchange of audio data audio metadata video data video metadata and or signaling associated with such exchange.

The digital menu server can receive the telephone number or other type of communication address associated with the automated communication platform . The telephone number may be compared with a set of one or more telephone numbers available e.g. retained or otherwise stored in one or more memory devices which may be referred to as storage that can be functionally coupled e.g. communicatively coupled to the digital menu server . In one scenario the outcome of such a comparison can determine that the telephone number associated with the automated communication platform is available in the storage and in response the digital menu server can query the storage for a digital menu of options associated with the telephone number. As illustrated the storage can include one or more memory elements such as register s file s database s or the like that can contain one or more digital menus of options for known automated communication platforms IVR systems automated attendants etc. . As such the one or more memory elements may be referred to as menu s and can include information such as data and or metadata indicative or otherwise representative of a digital menu of options associated with an automated audio menu of the automated communication platform . In certain implementations the menu s also can include a tone or a sequence of tones associated with each option in the digital menu of options. In other implementations the menu s also can include code information e.g. numeric data or alphanumeric data associated with each option in the digital menu of options. It should be appreciated that a sequence of tones can be associated with a deep option within the automated audio menu. Therefore in response to the query the digital menu server can receive information indicative or otherwise representative of the digital menu of options which also may be referred to as digital menu for the automated communication platform . The digital menu server can communicate e.g. transmit the information indicative or otherwise representative of such a digital menu to the communication device via the second communication pathway.

In response to transmission of the telephone number or other type of communication address associated with the automated communication platform and the availability of a digital menu for such a platform the communication device can receive the digital menu. The digital menu can be received as information e.g. data metadata and or signaling that can be processed or otherwise consumed by the communication device . In one aspect the communication device can validate the received digital menu. An invalid digital menu can cause the communication device to present a message indicating the invalidity of the menu. In addition when the received digital menu is valid the communication device can display or otherwise present the received digital menu for the automated communication platform . In certain embodiments the communication device can utilize the received information indicative or otherwise representative of the digital menu to render the digital menu without augmenting or otherwise modifying such information. The received information so rendered can be displayed by the communication device. In other embodiments in order to display the digital menu the communication device can arrange or otherwise allocate the information indicative of the digital menu according to a template for displaying the digital menu at the communication device .

As described herein the digital menu can include one or more options that are specific to the automated communication platform . Accordingly in one example the communication device can present at least one e.g. one two more than two each of the one or more options. One or more of the presented options can be displayed as actionable indicia such as a soft button that can be actuated e.g. touched swiped clicked pressed or the like . Therefore the digital menu may be referred to as an interactive digital menu. In addition one or more of the menu options that are displayed such as options and can be highlighted or otherwise presented differently from the other menu options that are displayed. A menu option can be highlighted by displaying the menu option in a font that is different than the font utilized to display other menu option s . In addition or in the alternative the menu option can be highlighted by displaying the menu option via graphical elements e.g. color images such as icons a combination thereof or the like that are different from the graphical elements utilized to display other menu option s . Further or as another alternative the menu option can be highlighted by including aural elements during or at certain times during the display of the highlighted menu option. For instance the communication device can playback a sound for a predetermined period which may be short to convey the availability of a particular menu options. The sound also may be played when an end user interacts with the menu option e.g. hovers pointing indicia over the menu option. It should be appreciated that a menu option may be highlighted in any fashion that permits emphasizing visually or otherwise the menu option relative to other displayed menu option s .

Highlighted options can be associated for example with popular or otherwise special options or a combination of options available in the automated communication platform . A highlighted option can correspond to a popular option such as a number 9 or a combination of a number and a sign e.g. 9 to reach a live attendant such as a representative and or operator. In certain embodiments the communication device can parse information representative of the digital menu associated with the automated communication platform for a keyword or phrase indicative of a live attendant option to reach at least one of a representative or an operator. After or upon identifying such a keyword or phrase the communication device can determine numeric information e.g. the digit 9 or alphanumeric information e.g. the combination of the and the digit 9 in 9 representative or otherwise indicative of the live attendant option. In addition or in the alternative the communication device can display distinctively or otherwise highlight indicia actionable or otherwise to represent the live attendant option.

In addition or in the alternative a highlighted option can correspond to option macro associated with a combination of numbers and or signs that can provide certain information e.g. date of birth and last four digits of a social security number and or can permit accessing certain chain of options e.g. Service and Parts and Tire Specialist available in the automated communication platform e.g. an automated attendant for a car dealership . As described herein an option macro can include an option customized to the communication device and the automated communication platform .

The communication device also can display a greetings message associated with the automated communication platform . For instance the greetings message can include indicia representative of a message such as Welcome to Acme Inc. If you know your party s three digit extension you can enter it at any time. In certain embodiments the greetings message can be embodied in or can include a form having one or more input fields for inputting certain information such as a telephone extension number.

It should be appreciated that in one example the portion of the automated audio menu that is received within the call between the communication device and the automated communication platform is presented via the sound substantially concurrently or concurrently with the greetings message and the options . The digital menu can provide more and or different interactive options than those conveyed in the received portion of the automated audio menu. In addition or in the alternative the digital menu can provide fewer and or different interactive options than those conveyed in the received portion of the digital menu. As described herein in certain embodiments each of such options can be presented as actionable indicia or other selectable display options. Therefore interaction with a displayed option can cause the communication device to generate and or transmit or otherwise communicate one tone e.g. a DTMF tone or a sequence of two or more tones e.g. several DTMF tones corresponding to the option that is actuated. In one example actuation of the displayed option can cause the communication device to communicate such one tone or sequence to the automated communication platform via the communication pathway between the communication device and the automated communication platform . In addition or in the alternative as described herein interaction with the displayed option can cause the communication device to transmit or otherwise communicate other type of code information e.g. numeric code s or alphanumeric code s as digital signaling e.g. digital packets other than one or more tones. At least a portion of the code information can correspond to the displayed option and such signaling can be encoded or otherwise formatted according to a protocol suitable for the automated communication platform to decode or otherwise interpret. As such regardless of the specific signaling tone s or digital packets interaction of an end user of the communication device with the automated communication platform can be greatly simplified with respect to the typical interaction that relies on the automated audio menu presented as sound . As described in greater detail hereinafter the options available in a digital menu can include forms or can be configured to receive information e.g. data and or metadata associated with an option.

The communication device can include one or more audio input units and one or more audio output units . At least one of the audio input unit s can include a microphone that can receive sound such as an utterance from an end user of the communication device . At least one of the audio output unit s can present the end user with one or more options of the automated audio menu for the automated communication platform . To at least such an end in one example the audio output unit s can include at least one piezoelectric speaker that can transmit audio e.g. sound to an end user of the communication device .

In addition the communication device can include a display unit that can present or otherwise display the information representative or otherwise indicative of the digital menu that can be received at the communication device . As described herein the communication device can validate the digital menu prior to rendering or displaying it. To at least such an end the communication device can include a digital to audio option unit that can validate the digital menu in a number of ways. In one example the digital to audio option unit can compare audio input signal from the automated communication platform with a reference audio signal e.g. a segment of a few seconds of digitized audio that is expected to be received from such a platform. More specifically the digital menu server described herein can communicate the reference audio signal in addition to the digital menu. The reference audio signal can correspond to the audio signal that is expected to be received from the automated communication platform after a certain time interval has elapsed since the communication device has initiated a call therewith. In addition the digital to audio option unit can compare one or more frequencies of the audio input signal with one or more frequencies of the reference audio signal. A comparison that establishes that both such signals have the same or substantially the same frequency or frequencies can indicate that the digital menu is valid. In other embodiments the digital to audio option unit can include a speech to text unit that can convert to text a portion of audio input signal from the automated communication platform. The text so generated can be compared with at least a portion of the digital menu in order to establish that the digital menu is consistent with an automated audio menu of the automated communication platform. In a scenario in which the digital menu is invalid the display unit can present a message accordingly. For instance the display unit can display the following messages Digital Menu is Outdated Audio to Digital Menu Service is Currently Unavailable or any other suitable message.

In a scenario in which the digital menu is valid the display unit can present for example the indicia representative of the greetings message and the options in . In additional or alternative embodiments the communication device can utilize or otherwise leverage a display device of another device such as a television or a wireless tethered or wearable electronic device. The interactive options that can be presented by the display unit and or such a display device which may be referred to as a second screen can include actionable indicia. As described herein it should be appreciated that certain options also can be presented or otherwise displayed without actionable indicia. In addition in certain implementations in order to display highlighted options the digital to audio option unit can parse the information indicative of otherwise representative of the digital menu for a predetermined keyword or phrase indicative of a popular option e.g. a live attendant option a popular option or a customized option. After or upon identifying such a keyword or phrase the digital to audio option unit can determine specific information e.g. numeric information or alphanumeric information representative or otherwise indicative of the option to be highlighted. The specific information can be rendered or otherwise processed in order to include graphical elements and or aural elements that permit the display unit to display such option distinctively from other displayed options.

In certain implementations the digital to audio option unit can receive a selection of an option displayed by the communication device and in response can cause the communication unit to transmit a sequence of one or more tones or other type of code information corresponding to the selected option. In certain embodiments the display unit can include an input interface such as a capacitive touchscreen or a resistive touchscreen combined with an input interface module that can permit receiving input information indicative of the selection. The input interface module can be included in the one or more input output I O interface s . In addition the I O interface s can include at least one port serial parallel or both at least one Ethernet port at least one pin and can permit communication of information between the communication device and an external electronic device such as another computing device e.g. a remote network device or an end user device . In one example the communication device can present an example digital menu as shown in . The digital menu can be a digital menu associated with a financial institution and can include actionable indicia conveying that the number 1 corresponds to Account Details. The digital menu also can include actionable indicia that convey that the number 2 corresponds to Payments and actionable indicia that conveys that the number 3 corresponds to the option to Report Fraud. Actuation of any of the indicia or indicates selection of the respective option and the digital to audio option unit can cause or otherwise instruct the communication unit to transmit a tone corresponding to the selected option.

In addition the example digital menu also includes actionable indicia that corresponds to a specific sequence of tones that correspond to an option to reach a live attendant which is represented as Representative. In response to the selection of such indicia the digital to audio option unit can cause or otherwise instruct the communication unit to transmit such specific sequence of tones. In certain embodiments such as in the example digital menu shown in the indicia associated with the option to reach a live attendant e.g. representative or an operator may not be actionable. Instead the indicia can include a timer that can convey a waiting period e.g. a 45 second period is illustrated in prior to the called automated communication platform routing the call to the representative.

The digital to audio option unit also can cause the display unit to display options that can include forms with fillable fields in order to permit input of information pertinent to a selected option. As illustrated in such options can be related to another option and can be presented as concatenated options in which a parent option illustrated with the actionable indicia can include one or more child options and . In the example options each of the child options Routing No. and Checking No. include respective fillable fields and each of which can permit inputting financial information for example. It should be appreciated that for certain parent options child options can permit inputting location information membership information identifying information a combination thereof or the like. In addition child options can include actionable indicia that in response to actuation can instruct or otherwise direct the digital to audio option unit to cause the communication device to generate and or transmit a sequence of tones corresponding to the option and the information conveyed in the options and . It should be appreciated that the sequence of tones also can include pauses and or any trailing tones such as the tone corresponding to a . In certain embodiments actuation of the actionable indicia can cause the communication device via the digital to audio option unit for example to generate other type of code information e.g. numeric code s or alphanumeric code s instead of a sequence of tones corresponding to the option and the information conveyed in the options and . At least a portion of the code information can be encoded or otherwise formatted according to a protocol suitable for transmission with an automated communication platform in communication with the communication device . While reference is made to parent child relationships it should be appreciated that such a relationship also can be represented a tree structure determined by first node associated with a first option e.g. the option represented by indicia and one or more second nodes related to the first node where each of the one or more second nodes are associated with respective second options related to the first option. For instance options and can embody two of such second options where the first option is embodied in the option represented by indicia .

In certain embodiments a digital menu can include one or more custom options that can be specific to an end user and the automated communication platform e.g. an automated attendant of a financial institution that is called by the communication device . In one example a custom option such as option in the example digital menu shown in can represent a specific sequence of selections that an end user has historically chosen. As such custom options can be included in a digital menu based on a learned behavior of a specific end user. More specifically in one example the digital to audio option unit can cause the communication device to communicate one or more selections or information indicative or representative thereof to a digital menu server such as the digital menu server . The digital menu server can accumulate historical information for a specific end user and the automated communication platform and can apply one or more machine learning techniques in order to learn a behavior or option preference of the end user. After an option preference is determined using the machine learning technique s a customized digital menu associated with the automated communication platform can be generated to include one or more custom options for the end user. Such a customized digital menu can be retained in an information storage integrated into or functionally coupled to the digital menu server.

The menu collection unit can initiate communication with an automated communication platform at predetermined times e.g. according to a schedule or periodically and or in response to certain events. In certain embodiments the menu collection unit can utilize session initiation protocol SIP or other packet switched communication protocols in order to initiate automatically a call session with the automated communication platform. In one aspect after the communication is established other communication may be utilized to receive menu information.

At least a portion of the menu information that can be received at the digital menu server can be provided to a menu composition unit that can configure data and or metadata indicative or otherwise representative of an option in an automated audio menu made available by an automated communication platform. Therefore the menu composition unit can generate a digital menu of options corresponding to the options in the automated audio menu. Digital menus so generated can be retained in one or more memory elements referred to as menu s in one or more memory devices referred to as storage .

Each of the menu s retained in the storage can be indexed or otherwise catalogued according to the telephone number or other type of communication address of the automated communication platform corresponding to a menu. Therefore in one aspect the digital menu server can receive a telephone number or other type of communication address and can determine if a corresponding digital menu is available. As described herein in response to the corresponding digital menu being available the digital menu server can communicate such a menu to a device that provided the telephone number or other type of communication address.

Such a signal can be received by a microphone and or other audio input unit s at the communication device in response to a speaker of the communication device generating audio representative of the audible option. At the digital menu server the menu collection unit can receive at least a portion of the input audio signal and can recognize speech indicative of the audible option. Therefore in one aspect the digital menu server can identify the option in the automated audio menu and one or more tones associated with the option. As such the menu composition unit can generate data and or metadata indicative of the option and or the tone s and assign such data and or metadata to a digital menu option corresponding to the audible option.

In connection with generation of a customized option the response collection unit also can acquire information indicative of a response to available options in a digital menu e.g. digital menu displayed at a communication device e.g. communication device . The digital menu can correspond to an automated audio menu for an automated communication platform. The communication device can be in communication or otherwise functionally coupled to the digital menu server . The acquired information can be retained in the storage and can be categorized according to identifying information e.g. telephone number subscriber number IMSI ESN or the like of the communication device. As such the information can be categorized based at least on the communication device. The retained information so acquired can be utilized to generate an option macro for the communication device. More specifically in one aspect the digital menu server can include a machine learning unit that can apply one or more machine learning techniques in order to learn a selection behavior of the communication device e.g. the communication device . After the selection behavior is determined the menu composition unit can generate a customized digital menu associated with the automated communication platform and with the communication device that communicates with the automated communication platform. In one example the customized digital menu can include one or more custom options to access a service and or information from the automated communication platform. Customized digital menus can be retained in one or more memory elements referred to as menu s within the storage .

At block a call with the automated communication platform can be initiated by the communication device. In one example initiating the call can include receiving a request to connect with the automated communication platform where the request can be received at the communication device. The request to connect can be associated with numerous types of call sessions either voice calls or data calls that may be established or otherwise performed at least in part via the communication device. The types of call sessions can include for example calls implemented using a cellular radio telecommunication protocol such as voice calls over cellular telecommunication networks calls implemented using VoIP protocols and videotelephony calls implemented using suitable protocols for call initiation and media stream communication e.g. transmission and or reception . The automated communication platform e.g. an IVR system an automated attendant or the like can utilize an automated audio menu of options for interaction with the automated communication platform. At block a communication address e.g. a telephone number a subscriber number an IMSI an ESN an IP address a SIP address a MAC address or the like of the automated communication platform can be communicated or otherwise sent e.g. transmitted to a remote computing device e.g. a digital menu server as described herein . The communication address can be included or otherwise conveyed in the request to connect and can be transmitted by the communication device. In one aspect the remote computing device can determine that a digital menu of options for interaction with the automated communication platform is available. To at least such an end in one example the remote computing device can query a database or other data storage for the digital menu of options where a search query can include the communication address. In response to the query the remote computing device can receive the digital menu of options thus establishing that such a menu is available. As such in one aspect at block the digital menu of options can be received at the communication device. In one aspect the digital menu of options is received as option information indicative of each of the options included in the digital menu of options.

At block the communication device that initiated the call at block can determine if the received digital menu of options is valid. In certain embodiments the communication device can compare audio input signal from the automated communication platform with a reference audio signal e.g. a segment of a few seconds of digitized audio that is expected to be received from such a platform. More specifically the remote computing device that can communicate the digital menu also can provide the reference audio signal which may correspond to the audio signal that is expected to be received from the automated communication platform after a certain time interval has elapsed since the call is initiated. In addition the communication device can compare a sequence of frequencies of the audio input signal with a sequence of frequencies of the reference audio signal. A comparison that establishes that both such signals have the same or substantially the same sequences can indicate the validity of the digital menu. In other embodiments the communication device can include a speech to text unit that can convert to text a portion of audio input signal from the automated communication platform. The text so generated can be compared with at least a portion of the digital menu in order to establish that the digital menu is consistent with an automated audio menu of the automated communication platform. A determination that the digital menu is invalid can result in implementing exception handling at block . For instance the communication device can display or otherwise present a message indicating that the received digital menu is invalid. For instance as described herein the message Digital Menu is Outdated or the message Audio to Digital Menu Service is Currently Unavailable may be displayed at the communication device.

A determination at block that the digital menu is valid can direct the flow of the subject example method to block at which multiple actionable indicia such as clickable buttons or other selectable display options can be displayed at the communication device. At least one of the multiple actionable indicia can correspond to a respective option in the automated audio menu. In addition or in the alternative one or more of the multiple actionable indicia can represent shortcuts for specific responses to the automated communication platform and or options for responses customized to the communication device and the automated communication platform. In addition or in the alternative in certain embodiments of the subject example certain non actionable indicia can displayed at the communication device. For instance indicia representative of a timer indicative of an time interval remaining to transfer the call to a live attendant. As described herein one or more of the displayed indicia actionable or otherwise can be highlighted or otherwise visually emphasized in order to present such indicia distinctively to convey a popular or otherwise special option s customized option s or live attendant option s .

In certain embodiments presenting or otherwise displaying certain visually emphasized options can include parsing the option information indicative or otherwise representative of the digital menu options for a keyword or a phrase indicative of a live attendant option to reach at least one of a representative or an operator. After one or more of such keywords or phrases are identified or otherwise selected displaying the multiple actionable indicia can include visually emphasizing at least one of the multiple actionable indicia to represent the live attendant option.

In addition in certain embodiments displaying the multiple actionable indicia can include displaying second actionable indicia representative of concatenated options in the digital menu and wherein the second actionable indicia represents a tree structure of options having a first node associated with a first option and a second node associated with a second option the second actionable indicia comprising one or more fillable fields to input information associated with the first option. In addition or in the alternative displaying the multiple actionable indicia can include displaying a second actionable indicia representative of a customized option for the automated communication platform and wherein the customized option is representative of historical selections.

At block a selection of one of the multiple actionable indicia can be received at the communication device. At block the communication device can generate code information according to the received selection. The code information can be embodied in or can include one or more tones e.g. one or more DTMF tones numeric data alphanumeric data or the like. At least a portion of the code information can be encoded or otherwise formatted for example according to a protocol for digital signaling suitable for communication with the automated communication platform. At block the communication device can communicate e.g. send or transmit the generated code information e.g. a generated sequence of tones to the automated communication platform.

While not illustrated in in certain embodiments the subject example method can include receiving from the automated communication platform an audio input signal representative of at least one option of the automated audio menu of options for interaction with the automated communication platform and causing a speaker of the communication device to generate audio corresponding to at least a portion of the audio input signal. As such an aural representation of the automated audio menu can be presented to an end user of the communication device. In certain implementations the audio input signal can permit determining accuracy of the digital menu in accordance with aspects described herein in connection with block .

In response to the digital menu being unavailable at block an audio input signal representative of one or more audible options of the automated audio menu of options can be received at the communication device. At block a textual representation of at least a portion of the received audio input signal can be determined. In one embodiment the communication device can recognize speech conveyed in at least the portion of the audio input signal and can convert the recognized speech to text. For instance a speech to text unit integrated into or functionally coupled to the communication device can apply one or more models of speech e.g. hidden Markov model s to at least the portion of the audio input signal in order to generate speech associated with the audio input signal where the generated speech can represent at least a portion of the one or more audible options. The speech to text unit can determine the textual representation using the generated speech. At block one or more digital options can be generated using the textual representation of the one or more audible options. Each of the one or more digital options can correspond to the one or more audible options. At block a digital menu associated with the automated audio menu can be generated using at least one of the one or more digital non audio options.

At block it can be determined if an audible option of the one or more audible options is selected. For instance the communication device that received the audio input signal at block can determine that input information e.g. signaling indicative of interaction with a user interface of the communication device is received. When the input information does not terminate the call between the communication device and the automated communication platform the input information can represent the selection of an audible option. In response to ascertaining that the audible option is not selected the subject example method can end. In the alternative in response to ascertaining that the audible option is selected the flow of the example method can be directed to block . Such redirection of the flow can permit receiving additional audible options associated with the automated audio menu and thus a tree or other tier s of audible option s can be received and incorporated into the digital menu via the implementation of blocks .

While not shown in certain embodiments digital menu generated by implementing the example method can be communicated or otherwise provided to the remote computing device e.g. a digital menu server that provided the indication received at block . The remote computing device can retain the digital menu in a repository e.g. storage or other storage and can associate the digital menu to the communication address of the automated communication platform. Therefore the digital menu may be available in other instances when the communication device initiates a call with the automated communication platform.

It should be appreciated that in certain embodiments one or more of blocks through can be implemented by a computing device remote to the communication device that initiates the call with the automated communication platform. In one example the computing device can be embodied in or can include the remote computing device e.g. the digital menu server that provided the indication received at block . In another example the computing device can include a speech to text server that can be functionally coupled to the remote computing device e.g. the digital menu server that provided the indication received at block . In any instance in such embodiments the communication device e.g. communication device can communicate audio signal received from the automated communication platform to the computing device for implementation of one or more of the blocks . In addition in response to receiving an audible selection at block the communication device can communicate information indicative or otherwise representative of such a selection to the computing device which can continue implementing one or more of the blocks in order to develop the digital menu as described herein.

As an illustration of generation of digital menus by a computing device remote to a communication device presents a flowchart of an example method for producing a digital menu corresponding to an automated audio menu of options for an automated communication platform in accordance with one or more aspects of the disclosure. A computing device such as a digital menu server in accordance with this disclosure can implement the subject example method in its entirety or in part. The computing device can include one or more processors or can be functionally coupled to at least one processor where at least one of the one or more processors can be functionally coupled to one or more memory devices where the memory device s can have encoded thereon computer accessible instructions that when executed can permit implementation of one or more blocks of the subject example method. At block a call with the automated communication platform can be established via the computing device. The call session can established at predetermined times e.g. according to a schedule or periodically and or in response to certain events. In one embodiment the computing device can include an autodialer device which also may be referred to as autodialer and or other communication unit that can permit automatically or semi automatically calling the automated communication platform. In certain implementations the computing device can utilize or otherwise leverage SIP or other packet switched communication protocols in order to establish such a call session.

At block an audio input signal representative of one or more audible options of the automated audio menu of options for the called automated communication platform can be received at the communication device. At block a textual representation of at least a portion of the received audio input signal can be determined. In one embodiment the computing device e.g. the digital menu server can recognize speech conveyed in at least the portion of the audio input signal and can convert the recognized speech to text. For instance a speech to text unit integrated into or functionally coupled to the computing device can apply one or more models of speech e.g. hidden Markov model s to at least the portion of the audio input signal in order to generate speech associated with the audio input signal where the generated speech can represent at least a portion of the one or more audible options. The speech to text unit can determine the textual representation using the generated speech. At block one or more digital non audio options can be generated using the textual representation of the one or more audible options. Each of the one or more digital non audio options can correspond to the one or more audible options. At block a digital menu associated with the automated audio menu can be generated using at least one of the one or more digital non audio options.

At block it can be determined if the computing device that implements the subject example method is to select an audible option of the one or more audible options in block . A determination that the audible option is not to be selected can result in the termination of the subject example method. In the alternative a determination that the audible option is to be selected can lead to block at which the computing device can generate code information according to the selected audible option. The code information can be embodied in or can include a sequence of tones e.g. one or more DTMF tones numeric data alphanumeric data or the like. At least a portion of the code information can be encoded or otherwise formatted for example according to a protocol for digital signaling suitable for communication with the automated communication platform. In one example the computing device can parse a digital option associated with the selected audible option and can determine a combination of digit s e.g. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and or 9 symbol and symbol for the selected audible option. An autodialer device that may be integrated into the computing device can generate the sequence of tones for such a combination e.g. 3 . At block the computing device can communicate the generated sequence of tones or the other type of code information to the automated communication platform and flow can be directed to block . It should be appreciated that in one aspect selection of the audible option and implementation of at least blocks and can permit traversing at least in part the automated audio menu by causing the automated communication platform to communicate additional audio signal representative or otherwise indicative of other audible options in the automated audio menu. Therefore a tree or other tier s of audible option s can be received and incorporated into the digital menu via the implementation of blocks .

At block one or more audio menu options in the automated audio menu of the automated communication platform can be determined using the content that can be access in response to implementation of the block . In one implementation the audio menu option s can be determined by searching for strings of characters words or phrases the typically are included in automated audio menus e.g. 1 for 2 for 3 for 4 for 5 for 6 for 7 for 8 for 9 for 0 for for payment representative or the like. At block one or more digital menu options corresponding to the one or more audio menu options can be generated. At block a digital menu of options associated with the automated audio menu can be generated.

At block a call with an automated communication platform can be initiated by the communication device. As described herein in one example initiating the call can include receiving a request to connect with the automated communication platform where the request can be received at the communication device. The request to connect can be associated with numerous types of call sessions either voice calls or data calls that may be established or otherwise performed at least in part via the communication device. The types of call sessions can include for example calls implemented using a cellular radio telecommunication protocol calls implemented using VoIP protocols and videotelephony calls implemented using suitable protocols for call initiation and media stream communication. At block it can be determined if the automated communication platform has been previously called. In one example the communication device can search for a telephone number of the automated communication platform in records of previous calls e.g. a history or log of recent calls performed by the communication device. Such a search can be performed locally at the communication device or the communication device can query historical records of calls at a remote computing device. A negative determination at block can lead to block at which exception handling is implemented. Implementing exception handling can include for example proceeding with the call without utilizing or leveraging historical information as described in greater hereafter.

A positive determination at block can lead to block at which one or more historical options selected for interaction with the automation communication platform can be determined or otherwise identified. Such historical option s can include an option that may have been selected from an automated audio menu or a digital menu associated with the automated communication platform. In certain embodiments the communication platform that initiates the call with the automated communication platform can query a remote computing device and or remote information storage for the one or more historical options associated with previous selections in previous interactions calls or communications with the automated communication platform. Such historical options may be referred to as historical selections or more simply as historical options. In response to the query the remote computing device and or the information storage can provide e.g. transmit information indicative of the one or more historical options. As such in one aspect the communication device can determine or otherwise identify previously selected options for interaction with the automated communication platform. At block the communication device can present e.g. display an option to select at least one of the one or more historical options. For example the communication device can prompt an end user of the communication device to select the one or more historical options. Prompting the end user can include displaying indicia indicative of a prior selection and or indicia indicative of a request for confirmation of such a selection as a newly selected option to interact with the automated communication platform. More specifically in one example the communication device can display a banner or other graphical object conveying the following The last time you called this number you selected 9 to reach a live attendant would you like it to be your current selection and that it be entered again automatically when appropriate It should be appreciated that other information can be conveyed when prompting the end user to confirm a previously selected option.

At block it can be determined if the one or more historical options are selected or otherwise confirmed. A negative determination e.g. the previous selection is not confirmed can lead to block in which exception handling is implemented. An affirmative determination e.g. the previous selection is confirmed can lead to block at which code information is generated according to the confirmed selection. In the one example the code information can be embodied in or can include a sequence of one or more tones e.g. one or more DTMF tones a sequence of one or more numeric codes or a sequence of one or more alphanumeric codes where at least one of such sequences can be representative of the confirmed historical selection s . At block the generated code information e.g. sequence of tone s sequence of numeric code s or sequence of alphanumeric tone s can be communicated e.g. transmitted to the automated communication platform.

It should be appreciated that in certain implementations the subject example method can be carried out in combination with one or more other methods described herein such as example method . It also should be appreciated that in certain implementations the example method can include other blocks related to receiving and or validating a digital menu in response to initiating or establishing a connection with an automated communication platform. For instance blocks may be included in the example method .
