Portable electronic devices such as smart phones tablets notebooks and other electronic devices have become an everyday need in the way we communicate and interact with others. The frequent use of these devices may require a significant amount of power which may easily deplete the batteries attached to these devices. Therefore a user is frequently needed to plug in the device to a power source and recharge such device. This may require having to charge electronic equipment at least once a day or in high demand electronic devices more than once a day.

Such an activity may be tedious and may represent a burden to users. For example a user may be required to carry chargers in case his electronic equipment is lacking power. In addition users have to find available power sources to connect to. Lastly users must plugin to a wall or other power supply to be able to charge his or her electronic device. However such an activity may render electronic devices inoperable during charging.

Current solutions to this problem may include devices having rechargeable batteries. However the aforementioned approach requires a user to carry around extra batteries and also make sure that the extra set of batteries is charged. Solar powered battery chargers are also known however solar cells are expensive and a large array of solar cells may be required to charge a battery of any significant capacity. Other approaches involve a mat or pad that allows charging of a device without physically connecting a plug of the device to an electrical outlet by using electromagnetic signals. In this case the device still requires to be placed in a certain location for a period of time in order to be charged. Assuming a single source power transmission of electro magnetic EM signal an EM signal gets reduced by a factor proportional to 1 r2 in magnitude over a distance r in other words it is attenuated proportional to the square of the distance. Thus the received power at a large distance from the EM transmitter is a small fraction of the power transmitted. To increase the power of the received signal the transmission power would have to be boosted. Assuming that the transmitted signal has an efficient reception at three centimeters from the EM transmitter receiving the same signal power over a useful distance of three meters would entail boosting the transmitted power by 10 000 times. Such power transmission is wasteful as most of the energy would be transmitted and not received by the intended devices it could be hazardous to living tissue it would most likely interfere with most electronic devices in the immediate vicinity and it may be dissipated as heat.

In yet another approach such as directional power transmission it would generally require knowing the location of the device to be able to point the signal in the right direction to enhance the power transmission efficiency. However even when the device is located efficient transmission is not guaranteed due to reflections and interference of objects in the path or vicinity of the receiving device.

The ability to charge electronic devices wirelessly has great benefits. However it may be necessary to manage the access of users to the network to prevent the abuse of the system resources. For example if many devices are connected to a wireless power network different failures can affect the network therefore interrupting the power transfer. Failures may include a loss of power a failure in the hardware or software of a wireless power transmitter manager overload of the wireless power transmitter manager and malfunctioning in a wireless power transmitter manager among others. For the foregoing reasons there is a need for a system and method that may allow the smart registration of wireless power receivers within a wireless power network so as to prevent the abuse of the system resources which may eventually result in a breakdown of the system.

The embodiments described herein include a transmitter that transmits a power transmission signal e.g. radio frequency RF signal waves to create a three dimensional pocket of energy. At least one receiver can be connected to or integrated into electronic devices and receive power from the pocket of energy. The transmitter can locate the at least one receiver in a three dimensional space using a communication medium e.g. Bluetooth technology . The transmitter generates a waveform to create a pocket of energy around each of the at least one receiver. The transmitter uses an algorithm to direct focus and control the waveform in three dimensions. The receiver can convert the transmission signals e.g. RF signals into electricity for powering an electronic device. Accordingly the embodiments for wireless power transmission can allow powering and charging a plurality of electrical devices without wires.

A wireless power network may include wireless power transmitters each with an embedded wireless power transmitter manager. The wireless power transmitter manager may include a wireless power manager application which may be a software application hosted in a computing device. The wireless power transmitter manager may include a GUI which may be used by a user to perform management tasks.

The wireless power network may include a plurality of client devices with wireless power receivers built in as part of the device or adapted externally.

In another embodiment a method for operating a wireless power system configured to provide pocket forming energy in three dimensional space comprises receiving in a power transmitter manager of a transmitter authorization data for a device determining in the transmitter an authorization state for the device based at least in part on the received authorization data and controlling in the transmitter the generation by an antenna manager of the transmitter of pocket forming energy in three dimensional space based on the authorization state.

In another embodiment a method for operating a wireless power system configured to provide pocket forming energy in three dimensional space comprises establishing in a transmitter a communications link with a device via a power transmitter manager receiving in the transmitter authorization data for the device via the communications link determining in the transmitter an authorization state for the device based at least in part on the received authorization data and controlling in the transmitter the generation of pocket forming energy in three dimensional space via the power transmitter manager based on the authorization state.

In a further embodiment an apparatus for wirelessly receiving power comprises a processor communication links operatively coupled to the processor a memory operatively coupled to the processor and a receiver operatively coupled to the processor the receiver being configured to wirelessly extract power from three dimensional pockets of energy present in power transmission signals from one or more transmitter wherein the processor is configured to determine if an identification value for the apparatus is stored in the memory and if no identification value is stored generate an identification value for the apparatus and wherein the processor is configured to transmit to the communication links one of i the stored identification value and ii the generated identification value and wherein the receiver is configured to begin wirelessly extract power after the processor has transmitted the stored or generated identification value to the communication links.

In yet another embodiment a method for enabling receipt and extraction of wireless power in an apparatus comprises determining by a processor if an identification value for the apparatus is stored in a memory generating by the processor an identification value for the apparatus if the determining step determines that no identification value is stored and transmitting by the processor one of i the stored identification value and ii the generated identification value wherein after transmitting the stored or generated identification value a receiver in the apparatus receives and extracts power from three dimensional pockets of energy present in power transmission signals.

Additional features and advantages of an embodiment will be set forth in the description which follows and in part will be apparent from the description. The objectives and other advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the exemplary embodiments in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.

It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.

The present disclosure is here described in detail with reference to embodiments illustrated in the drawings which form a part here. Other embodiments may be used and or other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present disclosure. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description are not meant to be limiting of the subject matter presented here. Furthermore the various components and embodiments described herein may be combined to form additional embodiments not expressly described without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.

Reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments illustrated in the drawings and specific language will be used here to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended. Alterations and further modifications of the inventive features illustrated here and additional applications of the principles of the inventions as illustrated here which would occur to one skilled in the relevant art and having possession of this disclosure are to be considered within the scope of the invention.

The transmitter may transmit or broadcast power transmission signals to a receiver associated with a device . Although several of the embodiments mentioned below describe the power transmission signals as radio frequency RF waves it should be appreciated that the power transmission may be physical media that is capable of being propagated through space and that is capable of being converted into a source of electrical energy . The transmitter may transmit the power transmission signals as a single beam directed at the receivers . In some cases one or more transmitters may transmit a plurality of power transmission signals that are propagated in a multiple directions and may deflect off of physical obstructions e.g. walls . The plurality of power transmission signals may converge at a location in a three dimensional space forming a pocket of energy . Receivers within the boundaries of an energy pocket may capture and covert the power transmission signals into a useable source of energy. The transmitter may control pocket forming based on phase and or relative amplitude adjustments of power transmission signals to form constructive interference patterns.

Although the exemplary embodiment recites the use of RF wave transmission techniques the wireless charging techniques should not be limited to RF wave transmission techniques. Rather it should be appreciated that possible wireless charging techniques may include any number of alternative or additional techniques for transmitting energy to a receiver converting the transmitted energy to electrical power. Non limiting exemplary transmission techniques for energy that can be converted by a receiving device into electrical power may include ultrasound microwave resonant and inductive magnetic fields laser light infrared or other forms of electromagnetic energy. In the case of ultrasound for example one or more transducer elements may be disposed so as to form a transducer array that transmits ultrasound waves toward a receiving device that receives the ultrasound waves and converts them to electrical power. In the case of resonant or inductive magnetic fields magnetic fields are created in a transmitter coil and converted by a receiver coil into electrical power. In addition although the exemplary transmitter is shown as a single unit comprising potentially multiple transmitters transmit array both for RF transmission of power and for other power transmission methods mentioned in this paragraph the transmit arrays can comprise multiple transmitters that are physically spread around a room rather than being in a compact regular structure. The transmitter includes an antenna array where the antennas are used for sending the power transmission signal. Each antenna sends power transmission waves where the transmitter applies a different phase and amplitude to the signal transmitted from different antennas. Similar to the formation of pockets of energy the transmitter can form a phased array of delayed versions of the signal to be transmitted then applies different amplitudes to the delayed versions of the signal and then sends the signals from appropriate antennas. For a sinusoidal waveform such as an RF signal ultrasound microwave or others delaying the signal is similar to applying a phase shift to the signal.

A pocket of energy may be formed at locations of constructive interference patterns of power transmission signals transmitted by the transmitter . The pockets of energy may manifest as a three dimensional field where energy may be harvested by receivers located within the pocket of energy . The pocket of energy produced by transmitters during pocket forming may be harvested by a receiver converted to an electrical charge and then provided to electronic client device associated with the receiver e.g. laptop computer smartphone rechargeable battery . In some embodiments there may be multiple transmitters and or multiple receivers powering various client devices . In some embodiments adaptive pocket forming may adjust transmission of the power transmission signals in order to regulate power levels and or identify movement of the devices .

A receiver may be used for powering or charging an associated client device which may be an electrical device coupled to or integrated with the receiver . The receiver may receive power transmission waves from one or more power transmission signals originating from one or more transmitters . The receiver may receive the power transmission signals as a single beam produced by the transmitter or the receiver may harvest power transmission waves from a pocket of energy which may be a three dimensional field in space resulting from the convergence of a plurality of power transmission waves produced by one or more transmitters . The receiver may comprise an array of antennas configured to receive power transmission waves from a power transmission signal and harvest the energy from the power transmission signals of the single beam or pocket of energy . The receiver may comprise circuitry that then converts the energy of the power transmission signals e.g. the radio frequency electromagnetic radiation to electrical energy. A rectifier of the receiver may translate the electrical energy from AC to DC. Other types of conditioning may be applied as well. For example a voltage conditioning circuit may increase or decrease the voltage of the electrical energy as required by the client device . An electrical relay may then convey the electrical energy from the receiver to the client device .

In some embodiments the receiver may comprise a communications component that transmits control signals to the transmitter in order to exchange data in real time or near real time. The control signals may contain status information about the client device the receiver or the power transmission signals. Status information may include for example present location information of the device amount of charge received amount of charged used and user account information among other types of information. Further in some applications the receiver including the rectifier that it contains may be integrated into the client device . For practical purposes the receiver wire and client device may be a single unit contained in a single packaging.

In some embodiments control signals may serve as data inputs used by the various antenna elements responsible for controlling production of power transmission signals and or pocket forming. Control signals may be produced by the receiver or the transmitter using an external power supply not shown and a local oscillator chip not shown which in some cases may include using a piezoelectric material. Control signals may be RF waves or any other communication medium or protocol capable of communicating data between processors such as Bluetooth RFID infrared near field communication NFC . As detailed later control signals may be used to convey information between the transmitter and the receiver used to adjust the power transmission signals as well as contain information related to status efficiency user data power consumption billing geo location and other types of information.

A detector may comprise hardware similar to receivers which may allow the detector to receive power transmission signals originating from one or more transmitters . The detector may be used by users to identify the location of pockets of energy so that users may determine the preferable placement of a receiver . In some embodiments the detector may comprise an indicator light that indicates when the detector is placed within the pocket of energy . As an example in detectors are located within the pocket of energy generated by the transmitter which may trigger the detectors to turn on their respective indicator lights because the detectors are receiving power transmission signals of the pocket of energy whereas the indicator light of a third detector located outside of the pockets of energy is turned off because the third detector is not receiving the power transmission signals from the transmitter . It should be appreciated that the functions of a detector such as the indicator light may be integrated into a receiver or into a client device in alternative embodiments as well.

A client device may be any electrical device that requires continuous electrical energy or that requires power from a battery. Non limiting examples of client devices may include laptops mobile phones smartphones tablets music players toys batteries flashlights lamps electronic watches cameras gaming consoles appliances GPS devices and wearable devices or so called wearables e.g. fitness bracelets pedometers smartwatch among other types of electrical devices.

In some embodiments the client device may be a physical device distinct from the receiver associated with the client device . In such embodiments the client device may be connected to the receiver over a wire that conveys converted electrical energy from the receiver to the client device . In some cases other types of data may be transported over the wire such as power consumption status power usage metrics device identifiers and other types of data.

In some embodiments the client device may be permanently integrated or detachably coupled to the receiver thereby forming a single integrated product or unit. As an example the client device may be placed into a sleeve that has embedded receivers and that may detachably couple to the device s power supply input which may be typically used to charge the device s battery. In this example the device may be decoupled from the receiver but may remain in the sleeve regardless of whether or not the device requires an electrical charge or is being used. In another example in lieu of having a battery that holds a charge for the device the device may comprise an integrated receiver which may be permanently integrated into the device so as to form an indistinct product device or unit. In this example the device may rely almost entirely on the integrated receiver to produce electrical energy by harvesting pockets of energy . It should be clear to someone skilled in the art that the connection between the receiver and the client device may be a wire or may be an electrical connection on a circuit board or an integrated circuit or even a wireless connection such as inductive or magnetic.

In a first step a transmitter TX establishes a connection or otherwise associates with a receiver RX . That is in some embodiments transmitters and receivers may communicate control data over using a wireless communication protocol capable of transmitting information between two processors of electrical devices e.g. Bluetooth Bluetooth Low Energy BLE Wi Fi NFC ZigBee . For example in embodiments implementing Bluetooth or Bluetooth variants the transmitter may scan for receiver s broadcasting advertisement signals or a receiver may transmit an advertisement signal to the transmitter. The advertisement signal may announce the receiver s presence to the transmitter and may trigger an association between the transmitter and the receiver. As described herein in some embodiments the advertisement signal may communicate information that may be used by various devices e.g. transmitters client devices sever computers other receivers to execute and manage pocket forming procedures. Information contained within the advertisement signal may include a device identifier e.g. MAC address IP address UUID the voltage of electrical energy received client device power consumption and other types of data related to power transmission. The transmitter may use the advertisement signal transmitted to identify the receiver and in some cases locate the receiver in a two dimensional space or in a three dimensional space. Once the transmitter identifies the receiver the transmitter may establish the connection associated in the transmitter with the receiver allowing the transmitter and receiver to communicate control signals over a second channel.

In a next step the transmitter may use the advertisement signal to determine a set of power transmission signal features for transmitting the power transmission signals to then establish the pockets of energy. Non limiting examples of features of power transmission signals may include phase gain amplitude magnitude and direction among others. The transmitter may use information contained in the receiver s advertisement signal or in subsequent control signals received from the receiver to determine how to produce and transmit the power transmission signals so that the receiver may receive the power transmission signals. In some cases the transmitter may transmit power transmission signals in a way that establishes a pocket of energy from which the receiver may harvest electrical energy. In some embodiments the transmitter may comprise a processor executing software modules capable of automatically identifying the power transmission signal features needed to establish a pocket of energy based on information received from the receiver such as the voltage of the electrical energy harvested by the receiver from the power transmission signals. It should be appreciated that in some embodiments the functions of the processor and or the software modules may be implemented in an Application Specific Integrated Circuit ASIC .

Additionally or alternatively in some embodiments the advertisement signal or subsequent signal transmitted by the receiver over a second communications channel may indicate one or more power transmission signals features which the transmitter may then use to produce and transmit power transmission signals to establish a pocket of energy. For example in some cases the transmitter may automatically identify the phase and gain necessary for transmitting the power transmission signals based on the location of the device and the type of device or receiver and in some cases the receiver may inform the transmitter the phase and gain for effectively transmitting the power transmission signals.

In a next step after the transmitter determines the appropriate features to use when transmitting the power transmission signals the transmitter may begin transmitting power transmission signals over a separate channel from the control signals. Power transmission signals may be transmitted to establish a pocket of energy. The transmitter s antenna elements may transmit the power transmission signals such that the power transmission signals converge in a two dimensional or three dimensional space around the receiver. The resulting field around the receiver forms a pocket of energy from which the receiver may harvest electrical energy. One antenna element may be used to transmit power transmission signals to establish two dimensional energy transmissions and in some cases a second or additional antenna element may be used to transmit power transmission signals in order to establish a three dimensional pocket of energy. In some cases a plurality of antenna elements may be used to transmit power transmission signals in order to establish the pocket of energy. Moreover in some cases the plurality of antennas may include all of the antennas in the transmitter and in some cases the plurality of antennas may include a number of the antennas in the transmitter but fewer than all of the antennas of the transmitter.

As previously mentioned the transmitter may produce and transmit power transmission signals according to a determined set of power transmission signal features which may be produced and transmitted using an external power source and a local oscillator chip comprising a piezoelectric material. The transmitter may comprise an RFIC that controls production and transmission of the power transmission signals based on information related to power transmission and pocket forming received from the receiver. This control data may be communicated over a different channel from the power transmission signals using wireless communications protocols such as BLE NFC or ZigBee . The RFIC of the transmitter may automatically adjust the phase and or relative magnitudes of the power transmission signals as needed. Pocket forming is accomplished by the transmitter transmitting the power transmission signals in a manner that forms constructive interference patterns.

Antenna elements of the transmitter may use concepts of wave interference to determine certain power transmission signals features e.g. direction of transmission phase of power transmission signal wave when transmitting the power transmission signals during pocket forming. The antenna elements may also use concepts of constructive interference to generate a pocket of energy but may also utilize concepts of deconstructive interference to generate a transmission null in a particular physical location.

In some embodiments the transmitter may provide power to a plurality of receivers using pocket forming which may require the transmitter to execute a procedure for multiple pocket forming. A transmitter comprising a plurality of antenna elements may accomplish multiple pocket forming by automatically computing the phase and gain of power transmission signal waves for each antenna element of the transmitter tasked with transmitting power transmission signals the respective receivers. The transmitter may compute the phase and gains independently because multiple wave paths for each power transmission signal may be generated by the transmitter s antenna elements to transmit the power transmission signals to the respective antenna elements of the receiver.

As an example of the computation of phase gain adjustments for two antenna elements of the transmitter transmitting two signals say X and Y where Y is 180 degree phase shifted version of X Y X . At a physical location where the cumulative received waveform is X Y a receiver receives X Y X X 2X whereas at a physical location where the cumulative received waveform is X Y a receiver receives X Y X X 0.

In a next step the receiver may harvest or otherwise receive electrical energy from power transmission signals of a single beam or a pocket of energy. The receiver may comprise a rectifier and AC DC converter which may convert the electrical energy from AC current to DC current and a rectifier of the receiver may then rectify the electrical energy resulting in useable electrical energy for a client device associated with the receiver such as a laptop computer smartphone battery toy or other electrical device. The receiver may utilize the pocket of energy produced by the transmitter during pocket forming to charge or otherwise power the electronic device.

In next step the receiver may generate control data containing information indicating the effectiveness of the single beam or energy pockets providing the receiver power transmission signals. The receiver may then transmit control signals containing the control data to the transmitter. The control signals may be transmitted intermittently depending on whether the transmitter and receiver are communicating synchronously i.e. the transmitter is expecting to receive control data from the receiver . Additionally the transmitter may continuously transmit the power transmission signals to the receiver irrespective of whether the transmitter and receiver are communicating control signals. The control data may contain information related to transmitting power transmission signals and or establishing effective pockets of energy. Some of the information in the control data may inform the transmitter how to effectively produce and transmit and in some cases adjust the features of the power transmission signals. Control signals may be transmitted and received over a second channel independent from the power transmission signals using a wireless protocol capable of transmitting control data related to power transmission signals and or pocket forming such as BLE NFC Wi Fi or the like.

As mentioned the control data may contain information indicating the effectiveness of the power transmission signals of the single beam or establishing the pocket of energy. The control data may be generated by a processor of the receiver monitoring various aspects of receiver and or the client device associated with the receiver. The control data may be based on various types of information such as the voltage of electrical energy received from the power transmission signals the quality of the power transmission signals reception the quality of the battery charge or quality of the power reception and location or motion of the receiver among other types of information useful for adjusting the power transmission signals and or pocket forming.

In some embodiments a receiver may determine the amount of power being received from power transmission signals transmitted from the transmitter and may then indicate that the transmitter should split or segment the power transmission signals into less powerful power transmission signals. The less powerful power transmission signals may be bounced off objects or walls nearby the device thereby reducing the amount of power being transmitted directly from the transmitter to the receiver.

In a next step the transmitter may calibrate the antennas transmitting the power transmission signals so that the antennas transmit power transmission signals having a more effective set of feature e.g. direction phase gain amplitude . In some embodiments a processor of the transmitter may automatically determine more effective features for producing and transmitting the power transmission signals based on a control signal received from the receiver. The control signal may contain control data and may be transmitted by the receiver using any number of wireless communication protocols e.g. BLE Wi Fi ZigBee . The control data may contain information expressly indicating the more effective features for the power transmission waves or the transmitter may automatically determine the more effective features based on the waveform features of the control signal e.g. shape frequency amplitude . The transmitter may then automatically reconfigure the antennas to transmit recalibrated power transmission signals according to the newly determined more effective features. For example the processor of the transmitter may adjust gain and or phase of the power transmission signals among other features of power transmission feature to adjust for a change in location of the receiver after a user moved the receiver outside of the three dimensional space where the pocket of energy is established.

Antenna elements of the transmitter may operate in single array pair array quad array or any other suitable arrangement that may be designed in accordance with the desired application. Pockets of energy may be formed at constructive interference patterns where the power transmission waves accumulate to form a three dimensional field of energy around which one or more corresponding transmission null in a particular physical location may be generated by destructive interference patterns. Transmission null in a particular physical location may refer to areas or regions of space where pockets of energy do not form because of destructive interference patterns of power transmission waves .

A receiver may then utilize power transmission waves emitted by the transmitter to establish a pocket of energy for charging or powering an electronic device thus effectively providing wireless power transmission. Pockets of energy may refer to areas or regions of space where energy or power may accumulate in the form of constructive interference patterns of power transmission waves . In other situations there can be multiple transmitters and or multiple receivers for powering various electronic equipment for example smartphones tablets music players toys and others at the same time. In other embodiments adaptive pocket forming may be used to regulate power on electronic devices. Adaptive pocket forming may refer to dynamically adjusting pocket forming to regulate power on one or more targeted receivers.

Receiver may communicate with transmitter by generating a short signal through antenna elements in order to indicate its position with respect to the transmitter . In some embodiments receiver may additionally utilize a network interface card not shown or similar computer networking component to communicate through a network with other devices or components of the system such as a cloud computing service that manages several collections of transmitters . The receiver may comprise circuitry for converting the power transmission signals captured by the antenna elements into electrical energy that may be provided to and electric device and or a battery of the device . In some embodiments the circuitry may provide electrical energy to a battery of receiver which may store energy without the electrical device being communicatively coupled to the receiver .

Communications components may enable receiver to communicate with the transmitter by transmitting control signals over a wireless protocol. The wireless protocol can be a proprietary protocol or use a conventional wireless protocol such as Bluetooth BLE Wi Fi NFC ZigBee and the like. Communications component may then be used to transfer information such as an identifier for the electronic device as well as battery level information geographic location data or other information that may be of use for transmitter in determining when to send power to receiver as well as the location to deliver power transmission waves creating pockets of energy. In other embodiments adaptive pocket forming may be used to regulate power provided to electronic devices . In such embodiments the communications components of the receiver may transmit voltage data indicating the amount of power received at the receiver and or the amount of voltage provided to an electronic device or battery .

Once transmitter identifies and locates receiver a channel or path for the control signals can be established through which the transmitter may know the gain and phases of the control signals coming from receiver . Antenna elements of the transmitter may start to transmit or broadcast controlled power transmission waves e.g. radio frequency waves ultrasound waves which may converge in three dimensional space by using at least two antenna elements to manipulate the power transmission waves emitted from the respective antenna element . These power transmission waves may be produced by using an external power source and a local oscillator chip using a suitable piezoelectric material. The power transmission waves may be controlled by transmitter circuitry which may include a proprietary chip for adjusting phase and or relative magnitudes of power transmission waves . The phase gain amplitude and other waveform features of the power transmission waves may serve as inputs for antenna element to form constructive and destructive interference patterns pocket forming . In some implementations a micro controller or other circuit of the transmitter may produce a power transmission signal which comprises power transmission waves and that may be may split into multiple outputs by transmitter circuitry depending on the number of antenna elements connected to the transmitter circuitry . For example if four antenna elements are connected to one transmitter circuit the power transmission signal will be split into four different outputs each output going to an antenna element to be transmitted as power transmission waves originating from the respective antenna elements .

Pocket forming may take advantage of interference to change the directionality of the antenna element where constructive interference generates a pocket of energy and destructive interference generates a transmission null. Receiver may then utilize pocket of energy produced by pocket forming for charging or powering an electronic device and therefore effectively providing wireless power transmission.

Multiple pocket forming may be achieved by computing the phase and gain from each antenna of transmitter to each receiver .

Transmitters may be any device capable of broadcasting wireless power transmission signals which may be RF waves for wireless power transmission as described herein. Transmitters may be responsible for performing tasks related to transmitting power transmission signals which may include pocket forming adaptive pocket forming and multiple pocket forming. In some implementations transmitters may transmit wireless power transmissions to receivers in the form of RF waves which may include any radio signal having any frequency or wavelength. A transmitter may include one or more antenna elements one or more RFICs one or more microcontrollers one or more communication components a power source and a housing that may allocate all the requested components for the transmitter . The various components of transmitters may comprise and or may be manufactured using meta materials micro printing of circuits nano materials and the like.

In the exemplary system the transmitter may transmit or otherwise broadcast controlled RF waves that converge at a location in three dimensional space thereby forming a pocket of energy . These RF waves may be controlled through phase and or relative amplitude adjustments to form constructive or destructive interference patterns i.e. pocket forming . Pockets of energy may be fields formed at constructive interference patterns and may be three dimensional in shape whereas transmission null in a particular physical location may be generated at destructive interference patterns. Receivers may harvest electrical energy from the pockets of energy produced by pocket forming for charging or powering an electronic client device e.g. a laptop computer a cell phone . In some embodiments the system may comprise multiple transmitters and or multiple receivers for powering various electronic equipment. Non limiting examples of client devices may include smartphones tablets music players toys and others at the same time. In some embodiments adaptive pocket forming may be used to regulate power on electronic devices.

Receivers may include a housing where at least one antenna element one rectifier one power converter and a communications component may be included.

Housing of the receiver can be made of any material capable of facilitating signal or wave transmission and or reception for example plastic or hard rubber. Housing may be an external hardware that may be added to different electronic equipment for example in the form of cases or can be embedded within electronic equipment as well.

Antenna elements of the receiver may comprise any type of antenna capable of transmitting and or receiving signals in frequency bands used by the transmitter A. Antenna elements may include vertical or horizontal polarization right hand or left hand polarization elliptical polarization or other polarizations as well as any number of polarization combinations. Using multiple polarizations can be beneficial in devices where there may not be a preferred orientation during usage or whose orientation may vary continuously through time for example a smartphone or portable gaming system. For devices having a well defined expected orientation e.g. a two handed video game controller there might be a preferred polarization for antennas which may dictate a ratio for the number of antennas of a given polarization. Types of antennas in antenna elements of the receiver may include patch antennas which may have heights from about inch to about 6 inches and widths from about inch to about 6 inches. Patch antennas may preferably have polarization that depends upon connectivity i.e. the polarization may vary depending on from which side the patch is fed. In some embodiments the type of antenna may be any type of antenna such as patch antennas capable of dynamically varying the antenna polarization to optimize wireless power transmission.

Rectifiers of the receiver may include diodes resistors inductors and or capacitors to rectify alternating current AC voltage generated by antenna elements to direct current DC voltage. Rectifiers may be placed as close as is technically possible to antenna elements AB to minimize losses in electrical energy gathered from power transmission signals. After rectifying AC voltage the resulting DC voltage may be regulated using power converters . Power converters can be a DC to DC converter that may help provide a constant voltage output regardless of input to an electronic device or as in this exemplary system to a battery. Typical voltage outputs can be from about 5 volts to about 10 volts. In some embodiments power converter may include electronic switched mode DC DC converters which can provide high efficiency. In such embodiments the receiver may comprise a capacitor not shown that is situated to receive the electrical energy before power converters . The capacitor may ensure sufficient current is provided to an electronic switching device e.g. switch mode DC DC converter so it may operate effectively. When charging an electronic device for example a phone or laptop computer initial high currents that can exceed the minimum voltage needed to activate operation of an electronic switched mode DC DC converter may be required. In such a case a capacitor not shown may be added at the output of receivers to provide the extra energy required. Afterwards lower power can be provided. For example 1 80 of the total initial power that may be used while having the phone or laptop still build up charge.

A communications component of a receiver may communicate with one or more other devices of the system such as other receivers client devices and or transmitters . Different antenna rectifier or power converter arrangements are possible for a receiver as will be explained in following embodiments.

In a first step a transmitter TX establishes a connection or otherwise associates with a receiver RX . That is in some embodiments transmitters and receivers may communicate control data over using a wireless communication protocol capable of transmitting information between two processors of electrical devices e.g. Bluetooth BLE Wi Fi NFC ZigBee . For example in embodiments implement Bluetooth or Bluetooth variants the transmitter may scan for receiver s broadcasting advertisement signals or a receiver may transmit an advertisement signal to the transmitter. The advertisement signal may announce the receiver s presence to the transmitter and may trigger an association between the transmitter and the receiver. As described later in some embodiments the advertisement signal may communicate information that may be used by various devices e.g. transmitters client devices sever computers other receivers to execute and manage pocket forming procedures. Information contained within the advertisement signal may include a device identifier e.g. MAC address IP address UUID the voltage of electrical energy received client device power consumption and other types of data related to power transmission waves. The transmitter may use the advertisement signal transmitted to identify the receiver and in some cases locate the receiver in a two dimensional space or in a three dimensional space. Once the transmitter identifies the receiver the transmitter may establish the connection associated in the transmitter with the receiver allowing the transmitter and receiver to communicate control signals over a second channel.

As an example when a receiver comprising a Bluetooth processor is powered up or is brought within a detection range of the transmitter the Bluetooth processor may begin advertising the receiver according to Bluetooth standards. The transmitter may recognize the advertisement and begin establishing connection for communicating control signals and power transmission signals. In some embodiments the advertisement signal may contain unique identifiers so that the transmitter may distinguish that advertisement and ultimately that receiver from all the other Bluetooth devices nearby within range.

In a next step when the transmitter detects the advertisement signal the transmitter may automatically form a communication connection with that receiver which may allow the transmitter and receiver to communicate control signals and power transmission signals. The transmitter may then command that receiver to begin transmitting real time sample data or control data. The transmitter may also begin transmitting power transmission signals from antennas of the transmitter s antenna array.

In a next step the receiver may then measure the voltage among other metrics related to effectiveness of the power transmission signals based on the electrical energy received by the receiver s antennas. The receiver may generate control data containing the measured information and then transmit control signals containing the control data to the transmitter. For example the receiver may sample the voltage measurements of received electrical energy for example at a rate of 100 times per second. The receiver may transmit the voltage sample measurement back to the transmitter 100 times a second in the form of control signals.

In a next step the transmitter may execute one or more software modules monitoring the metrics such as voltage measurements received from the receiver. Algorithms may vary production and transmission of power transmission signals by the transmitter s antennas to maximize the effectiveness of the pockets of energy around the receiver. For example the transmitter may adjust the phase at which the transmitter s antenna transmit the power transmission signals until that power received by the receiver indicates an effectively established pocket energy around the receiver. When an optimal configuration for the antennas is identified memory of the transmitter may store the configurations to keep the transmitter broadcasting at that highest level.

In a next step algorithms of the transmitter may determine when it is necessary to adjust the power transmission signals and may also vary the configuration of the transmit antennas in response to determining such adjustments are necessary. For example the transmitter may determine the power received at a receiver is less than maximal based on the data received from the receiver. The transmitter may then automatically adjust the phase of the power transmission signals but may also simultaneously continues to receive and monitor the voltage being reported back from receiver.

In a next step after a determined period of time for communicating with a particular receiver the transmitter may scan and or automatically detect advertisements from other receivers that may be in range of the transmitter. The transmitters may establish a connection to the second receiver responsive to Bluetooth advertisements from a second receiver.

In a next step after establishing a second communication connection with the second receiver the transmitter may proceed to adjust one or more antennas in the transmitter s antenna array. In some embodiments the transmitter may identify a subset of antennas to service the second receiver thereby parsing the array into subsets of arrays that are associated with a receiver. In some embodiments the entire antenna array may service a first receiver for a given period of time and then the entire array may service the second receiver for that period of time.

Manual or automated processes performed by the transmitter may select a subset of arrays to service the second receiver. In this example the transmitter s array may be split in half forming two subsets. As a result half of the antennas may be configured to transmit power transmission signals to the first receiver and half of the antennas may be configured for the second receiver. In the current step the transmitter may apply similar techniques discussed above to configure or optimize the subset of antennas for the second receiver. While selecting a subset of an array for transmitting power transmission signals the transmitter and second receiver may be communicating control data. As a result by the time that the transmitter alternates back to communicating with the first receiver and or scan for new receivers the transmitter has already received a sufficient amount of sample data to adjust the phases of the waves transmitted by second subset of the transmitter s antenna array to transmit power transmission waves to the second receiver effectively.

In a next step after adjusting the second subset to transmit power transmission signals to the second receiver the transmitter may alternate back to communicating control data with the first receiver or scanning for additional receivers. The transmitter may reconfigure the antennas of the first subset and then alternate between the first and second receivers at a predetermined interval.

In a next step the transmitter may continue to alternate between receivers and scanning for new receivers at a predetermined interval. As each new receiver is detected the transmitter may establish a connection and begin transmitting power transmission signals accordingly.

In one exemplary embodiment the receiver may be electrically connected to a device like a smart phone. The transmitter s processor would scan for any Bluetooth devices. The receiver may begin advertising that it s a Bluetooth device through the Bluetooth chip. Inside the advertisement there may be unique identifiers so that the transmitter when it scanned that advertisement could distinguish that advertisement and ultimately that receiver from all the other Bluetooth devices nearby within range. When the transmitter detects that advertisement and notices it is a receiver then the transmitter may immediately form a communication connection with that receiver and command that receiver to begin sending real time sample data.

The receiver would then measure the voltage at its receiving antennas send that voltage sample measurement back to the transmitter e.g. 100 times a second . The transmitter may start to vary the configuration of the transmit antennas by adjusting the phase. As the transmitter adjusts the phase the transmitter monitors the voltage being sent back from the receiver. In some implementations the higher the voltage the more energy may be in the pocket. The antenna phases may be altered until the voltage is at the highest level and there is a maximum pocket of energy around the receiver. The transmitter may keep the antennas at the particular phase so the voltage is at the highest level.

The transmitter may vary each individual antenna one at a time. For example if there are 32 antennas in the transmitter and each antenna has 8 phases the transmitter may begin with the first antenna and would step the first antenna through all 8 phases. The receiver may then send back the power level for each of the 8 phases of the first antenna. The transmitter may then store the highest phase for the first antenna. The transmitter may repeat this process for the second antenna and step it through 8 phases. The receiver may again send back the power levels from each phase and the transmitter may store the highest level. Next the transmitter may repeat the process for the third antenna and continue to repeat the process until all 32 antennas have stepped through the 8 phases. At the end of the process the transmitter may transmit the maximum voltage in the most efficient manner to the receiver.

In another exemplary embodiment the transmitter may detect a second receiver s advertisement and form a communication connection with the second receiver. When the transmitter forms the communication with the second receiver the transmitter may aim the original 32 antennas towards the second receiver and repeat the phase process for each of the 32 antennas aimed at the second receiver. Once the process is completed the second receiver may getting as much power as possible from the transmitter. The transmitter may communicate with the second receiver for a second and then alternate back to the first receiver for a predetermined period of time e.g. a second and the transmitter may continue to alternate back and forth between the first receiver and the second receiver at the predetermined time intervals.

In yet another implementation the transmitter may detect a second receiver s advertisement and form a communication connection with the second receiver. First the transmitter may communicate with the first receiver and re assign half of the exemplary the antennas aimed at the first receiver dedicating only 16 towards the first receiver. The transmitter may then assign the second half of the antennas to the second receiver dedicating 16 antennas to the second receiver. The transmitter may adjust the phases for the second half of the antennas. Once the 16 antennas have gone through each of the 8 phases the second receiver may be obtaining the maximum voltage in the most efficient manner to the receiver.

Continuing with a receiver may receive multiple power transmission signals each comprising power transmission waves from multiple antenna elements of a transmitter the composite of these power transmission signals may be essentially zero because in this example the power transmission waves add together destructively. That is antenna elements of the transmitter may transmit the exact same power transmission signal i.e. comprising power transmission waves having the same features such as phase and amplitude and as such when the power transmission waves of the respective power transmission signals arrive at the receiver they are offset from each other by 180 degrees. Consequently the power transmission waves of these power transmission signals cancel one another. Generally signals offsetting one another in this way may be referred to as destructive and thus result in destructive interference. 

In contrast as shown in for so called constructive interference signals comprising power transmission waves that arrive at the receiver exactly in phase with one another combine to increase the amplitude of the each signal resulting in a composite that is stronger than each of the constituent signals. In the illustrative example in note that the phase of the power transmission waves in the transmit signals are the same at the location of transmission and then eventually add up destructively at the location of the receiver . In contrast in the phase of the power transmission waves of the transmit signals are adjusted at the location of transmission such that they arrive at the receiver in phase alignment and consequently they add constructively. In this illustrative example there will be a resulting pocket of energy located around the receiver in and there will be a transmission null located around receiver in .

As user may seem to be obstructing the path between receivers A B and transmitters A B RF waves may not be easily aimed to the receivers A B in a linear direction. However since the short signals generated from receivers A B may be omni directional for the type of antenna element used these signals may bounce over the walls A B until they reach transmitters A B. A hot spot A B may be any item in the room which will reflect the RF waves. For example a large metal clock on the wall may be used to reflect the RF waves to a user s cell phone.

A micro controller in the transmitter adjusts the transmitted signal from each antenna based on the signal received from the receiver. Adjustment may include forming conjugates of the signal phases received from the receivers and further adjustment of transmit antenna phases taking into account the built in phase of antenna elements. The antenna element may be controlled simultaneously to steer energy in a given direction. The transmitter A B may scan the room and look for hot spots A B. Once calibration is performed transmitters A B may focus RF waves in a channel following a path that may be the most efficient paths. Subsequently RF signals A B may form a pocket of energy on a first electronic device and another pocket of energy in a second electronic device while avoiding obstacles such as user and furniture.

When scanning the service area the room in the transmitter A B may employ different methods. As an illustrative example but without limiting the possible methods that can be used the transmitter A B may detect the phases and magnitudes of the signal coming from the receiver and use those to form the set of transmit phases and magnitudes for example by calculating conjugates of them and applying them at transmit. As another illustrative example the transmitter may apply all possible phases of transmit antennas in subsequent transmissions one at a time and detect the strength of the pocket of energy formed by each combination by observing information related to the signal from the receiver A B. Then the transmitter A B repeats this calibration periodically. In some implementations the transmitter A B does not have to search through all possible phases and can search through a set of phases that are more likely to result in strong pockets of energy based on prior calibration values. In yet another illustrative example the transmitter A B may use preset values of transmit phases for the antennas to form pockets of energy directed to different locations in the room. The transmitter may for example scan the physical space in the room from top to bottom and left to right by using preset phase values for antennas in subsequent transmissions. The transmitter A B then detects the phase values that result in the strongest pocket of energy around the receiver by observing the signal from the receiver . It should be appreciated that there are other possible methods for scanning a service area for heat mapping that may be employed without deviating from the scope or spirit of the embodiments described herein. The result of a scan whichever method is used is a heat map of the service area e.g. room store from which the transmitter A B may identify the hot spots that indicate the best phase and magnitude values to use for transmit antennas in order to maximize the pocket of energy around the receiver.

The transmitters A B may use the Bluetooth connection to determine the location of the receivers A B and may use different non overlapping parts of the RF band to channel the RF waves to different receivers A B. In some implementations the transmitters A B may conduct a scan of the room to determine the location of the receivers A B and forms pockets of energy that are orthogonal to each other by virtue of non overlapping RF transmission bands. Using multiple pockets of energy to direct energy to receivers may inherently be safer than some alternative power transmission methods since no single transmission is very strong while the aggregate power transmission signal received at the receiver is strong.

Multiple pocket forming A may be achieved by computing the phase and gain from each antenna of transmitter A to each receiver A. The computation may be calculated independently because multiple paths may be generated by antenna element from transmitter A to antenna element from receivers A.

Once transmitter B identities and locates receiver a channel or path can be established by knowing the gain and phases coming from receiver. Transmitter B may start to transmit controlled RF waves B that may converge in three dimensional space by using a minimum of two antenna elements. These RF waves B may be produced using an external power source and a local oscillator chip using a suitable piezoelectric material. RF waves B may be controlled by RFIC that may include a proprietary chip for adjusting phase and or relative magnitudes of RF signals which may serve as inputs for antenna elements to form constructive and destructive interference patterns pocket forming . Pocket forming may take advantage of interference to change the directionality of the antenna elements where constructive interference generates a pocket of energy and deconstructive interference generates a null in a particular physical location. Receiver may then utilize pocket of energy produced by pocket forming for charging or powering an electronic device for example a laptop computer and a smartphone and thus effectively providing wireless power transmission.

Multiple pocket forming B may be achieved by computing the phase and gain from each antenna of transmitter to each receiver. The computation may be calculated independently because multiple paths may be generated by antenna elements from transmitter to antenna elements from receiver.

An example of the computation for at least two antenna elements may include determining the phase of the signal from the receiver and applying the conjugate of the receive parameters to the antenna elements for transmission.

In some embodiments two or more receivers may operate at different frequencies to avoid power losses during wireless power transmission. This may be achieved by including an array of multiple embedded antenna elements in transmitter B. In one embodiment a single frequency may be transmitted by each antenna in the array. In other embodiments some of the antennas in the array may be used to transmit at a different frequency. For example of the antennas in the array may operate at 2.4 GHz while the other may operate at 5.8 GHz. In another example of the antennas in the array may operate at 900 MHz another may operate at 2.4 GHz and the remaining antennas in the array may operate at 5.8 GHz.

In another embodiment each array of antenna elements may be virtually divided into one or more antenna elements during wireless power transmission where each set of antenna elements in the array can transmit at a different frequency. For example an antenna element of the transmitter may transmit power transmission signals at 2.4 GHz but a corresponding antenna element of a receiver may be configured to receive power transmission signals at 5.8 GHz. In this example a processor of the transmitter may adjust the antenna element of the transmitter to virtually or logically divide the antenna elements in the array into a plurality patches that may be fed independently. As a result of the array of antenna elements may be able to transmit the 5.8 GHz needed for the receiver while another set of antenna elements may transmit at 2.4 GHz. Therefore by virtually dividing an array of antenna elements electronic devices coupled to receivers can continue to receive wireless power transmission. The foregoing may be beneficial because for example one set of antenna elements may transmit at about 2.4 GHz and other antenna elements may transmit at 5.8 GHz and thus adjusting a number of antenna elements in a given array when working with receivers operating at different frequencies. In this example the array is divided into equal sets of antenna elements e.g. four antenna elements but the array may be divided into sets of different amounts of antenna elements. In an alternative embodiment each antenna element may alternate between select frequencies.

The efficiency of wireless power transmission as well as the amount of power that can be delivered using pocket forming may be a function of the total number of antenna elements used in a given receivers and transmitters system. For example for delivering about one watt at about 15 feet a receiver may include about 80 antenna elements while a transmitter may include about 256 antenna elements. Another identical wireless power transmission system about 1 watt at about 15 feet may include a receiver with about 40 antenna elements and a transmitter with about 512 antenna elements. Reducing in half the number of antenna elements in a receiver may require doubling the number of antenna elements in a transmitter. In some embodiments it may be beneficial to put a greater number of antenna elements in transmitters than in a receivers because of cost because there will be much fewer transmitters than receivers in a system wide deployment. However the opposite can be achieved e.g. by placing more antenna elements on a receiver than on a transmitter as long as there are at least two antenna elements in a transmitter B.
