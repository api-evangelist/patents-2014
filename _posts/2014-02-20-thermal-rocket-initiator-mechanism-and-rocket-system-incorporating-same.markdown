The present invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.

The present disclosure relates generally to weapons systems and methods and more specifically rocket systems and methods. More particularly the present disclosure relates to a thermal rocket initiator mechanism TRIM that preemptively ignites a rocket motor undergoing slow heating before the propellant can auto ignite resulting in the propellant burning as designed instead of exploding.

When a rocket motor undergoes slow heating i.e. slow cook off such as in a fire onboard a naval vessel or the like the propellant is gradually energized from the outer case wall inward. Slow cook off is defined as ambient air temperature rising at about 6 degrees F. per hour. Heating proceeds until the propellant near the case wall auto ignites. Problematically when the propellant near the case wall auto ignites a high pressure gas bubble generated inside the case wall collapses the propellant grain blocking the associated nozzle and any vents causing the pressure within the rocket motor to increase and resulting in the explosion of the rocket which is likely still housed in the related storage launch assembly.

Therefore it is desirable that a TRIM be provided that preemptively ignites a rocket motor undergoing slow heating before the propellant can auto ignite resulting in the propellant burning as designed along the proper burning interfaces instead of exploding. This mode of operation keeps the propellant grain intact and the venting channels open. If the rocket chamber is robust enough to contain the increase in pressure that results from burning the propellant at elevated temperature then no further changes to conventional rocket systems would be necessary. If the rocket chamber is not robust enough to contain the increase in pressure that results from burning the propellant at elevated temperature then larger venting channels or a stronger rocket chamber would be necessary. In any case a controlled burn of a stored rocket is desirable as compared to an uncontrolled explosion of a stored rocket.

Several TRIMs based on a Nickel titanium NiTiNOL shape memory alloy SMA have been built to demonstrate SMA technology in the past. Such SMAs recover their unstrained shape when heated above a transition temperature. All have been unsuitable for application in a service environment. The first holds a percussion primer in line with an igniter passage which is problematic in all but testing applications because in an operational application the accidental ignition of the percussion primer would fire the rocket motor. The second holds a percussion primer out of line from an igniter passage but does not isolate the percussion primer from the environment. This structure and related situation could lead to injury if a person were handling the rocket. Thus neither demonstration TRIM is acceptable for use in operational ordnance. A refined solution is still required.

In various exemplary embodiments the present disclosure provides a TRIM that preemptively ignites a rocket motor undergoing slow heating before the propellant can auto ignite resulting in the propellant burning as designed along the proper burning interfaces instead of exploding. This mode of operation keeps the propellant grain intact and the venting channels open. The TRIM utilizes a NiTiNOL SMA with a safety interlock mechanism that ensures rocket user handler safety to the greatest extent possible.

In one exemplary embodiment the present disclosure provides a thermal rocket initiator mechanism including a housing a primer carriage translatable within the housing a percussion primer disposed within the primer carriage and a pair of actuator rods disposed within the housing where one of the pair of actuator rods is coupled to the primer carriage and the other pair of actuator rods is coupled to the housing. The present disclosure also includes a rocker arm coupling the pair of actuator rods to one another where the pair of actuator rods are manufactured from a shape memory alloy that changes dimensions upon heating thereby translating the primer carriage within the housing and correspondingly actuating the percussion primer. The pair of actuator rods includes one actuator rod that is relatively longer and one actuator rod that is relatively shorter. Optionally the shape memory alloy is NiTiNOL. The percussion primer is actuated through a ramp structure coupled to the primer carriage and a spring structure coupled to the housing. The spring structure actuates a detent ball disposed adjacent to the percussion primer. The thermal rocket initiator mechanism also includes a safety interlock mechanism actuated by an actuation material such as wax or the like disposed in a cavity adjacent to the percussion primer. The percussion primer when actuated actuates a rocket motor igniter.

The percussion primer is actuated through a ramp structure coupled to the primer carriage and a spring structure coupled to the housing. The spring structure actuates a detent ball disposed adjacent to the percussion primer. The method for providing a thermal rocket initiator mechanism also includes providing a safety interlock mechanism actuated by an actuation material such as wax or the like disposed in a cavity adjacent to the percussion primer. The percussion primer when actuated actuates a rocket motor igniter.

In a further exemplary embodiment the present disclosure provides a rocket system including a thermal rocket initiator mechanism including a housing a primer carriage translatable within the housing a percussion primer disposed within the primer carriage a pair of actuator rods disposed within the housing where one of the pair of actuator rods is coupled to the primer carriage and the other pair of actuator rods is coupled to the housing and a rocker arm coupling the pair of actuator rods to one another where the pair of actuator rods are manufactured from a shape memory alloy that changes dimensions upon heating thereby translating the primer carriage within the housing and correspondingly actuating the percussion primer.

In various exemplary embodiments the present disclosure provides a TRIM that preemptively ignites a rocket motor undergoing slow heating before the propellant can auto ignite resulting in the propellant burning as designed along the proper burning interfaces instead of exploding. This mode of operation keeps the propellant grain intact and the venting channels open. The TRIM utilizes a NiTiNOL SMA with a safety interlock mechanism that ensures rocket user handler safety to the greatest extent possible.

Referring to illustrating one exemplary embodiment of the TRIM of the present disclosure in a safe configuration the TRIM includes a housing that is integrated with the conventional onboard firing device of a rocket motor. The TRIM is positioned external to the rocket motor chamber astride the igniter body such that the output port of the TRIM is aligned with a passage in the igniter which passage is isolated from other internal passages of the igniter. The housing has an overall length on the order of about 6 inches and an overall width diameter on the order of about 1.75 inches and in an exemplary embodiment is manufactured from steel or the like. Two NiTiNOL actuator rods are disposed within the housing including a long NiTiNOL actuator rod having an overall length of between about 5 inches and about 6 inches and an overall thickness of between about 0.075 inches and about 0.125 inches and a short NiTiNOL actuator rod having an overall length of between about 2 inches and about 3 inches and an overall thickness of between about 0.075 inches and about 0.125 inches. The actuator rods and are each coupled to a rocker arm or the like at one end by a pivot head or the like. The rocker arm is coupled to the housing by a fulcrum pin or the like. Collectively the rocker arm the pivot heads and the fulcrum pin allow relatively free movement of the ends of the actuator rods and and provide a mechanism for transferring the movement of one actuator rod to the other actuator rod such as when the actuator rods and change dimensions. The opposite end of the long actuator rod is coupled to the housing by an adjustment screw thread. A spring clamp plate includes a dowel pin . The opposite end of the short actuator rod is coupled to a primer carriage secured within the housing by a detent ball safety interlock and including a pair of o ring seals . The spring clamp plate and a corresponding firing spring assembly are secured within the housing by a rivet nut and spring assembly anchor screw including the dowel pin .

The percussion primer and primer carriage detent piston are disposed at the end of the primer carriage and a primer safety reservoir including a primer safety reservoir plug screw are disposed adjacent to the percussion primer . In general the percussion primer and associated firing mechanism act as they do in conventional weapons systems. The percussion primer is acted upon by a primer carriage detent ball disposed within a primer carriage detent ball retainer which is acted upon by a firing pin . The firing pin is coupled to the firing spring assembly . In this case the firing mechanism is cocked and actuated by translation of the primer carriage dictated by dimensional changes associated with the actuator rods and .

A ramp plate and carriage seal pads are disposed adjacent to the primer carriage with the ramp plate secured to the primer carriage by a ramp plate retainer screw .

Finally and as referring to piston actuation material such as wax or the like is disposed within a cavity in one end of the primer carriage and contained by the primer carriage detent piston . With the TRIM in the safe configuration the wax or the like secures the primer detent piston inside the cavity of the primer carriage and correspondingly secures the detent ball safety interlock.

Referring to illustrating one exemplary embodiment of the TRIM of the present disclosure in a fired configuration when the TRIM is exposed to heating conditions the temperature of the actuator rods and increases through a narrow transition temperature range of the NiTiNOL alloy and the actuator rods shorten by as much as 6 thereby exerting a force large enough to overcome the friction holding the primer carriage in place due in part to the pair of o ring seals and the carriage seal pads . The rocker arm transmits the shortening of the long actuator rod to the short actuator rod thereby moving the primer carriage into firing position while simultaneously cocking and releasing the firing spring assembly along the ramp plate . Two ramps on the ramp plate are coupled to two corresponding cam surfaces disposed within the leaf of the firing spring assembly . Actuator rods and translate the primer carriage and the ramp plate correspondingly. The two ramps on the ramp plate slide on the two cam surfaces in the firing spring assembly cocking the firing spring assembly until the end of the firing spring assembly disengages from the ends of the ramps and snaps the firing pin into the primer carriage detent ball which fires the percussion primer and correspondingly initiates the rocket motor s stock igniter.

The TRIM of the present disclosure has several advantages over previous developmental preemptive ignition mechanisms. First the TRIM isolates the percussion primer from the igniter charge and the environment such that accidental initiation poses no threat to the rocket motor or its payload. Second the TRIM has a thermally activated locking detent feature absent in previous developmental preemptive ignition mechanisms. Third the thermally activated locking detent feature uses wax or the like for thermal actuation not SMA providing two independent actuation environments as required by guidelines promulgated by the Weapon Systems Engineering Safety Review Board WSESRB responsible for ensuring the operational safety of all ordnance deployed aboard vessels of the U.S. Navy. Fourth the TRIM uses thinner actuator rods and than its predecessors having overall thicknesses of between about 0.075 inches and about 0.125 inches such that thermal gradients in the actuator rods and are smaller than those of its predecessors making the transition of the actuator rods and to an unstrained state more uniform and actuation more reliable than with the few preemptive ignition mechanisms that have been built to demonstrate SMA technology in the past.

Although the present disclosure has been illustrated and described herein with reference to exemplary embodiments and specific examples thereof it will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that other exemplary embodiments may perform similar functions and or achieve like results. All such equivalent embodiments and examples are within the spirit and scope of the present disclosure are contemplated thereby and are intended to be covered by the following claims.

Finally any numerical parameters set forth in this Specification and the attached Claims are approximations for example by using the term about that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the Claims each numerical parameter should be construed in light of the number of significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding.
