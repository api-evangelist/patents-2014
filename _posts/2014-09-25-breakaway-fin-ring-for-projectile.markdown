title: Breakaway fin ring for projectile
abstract: A frangible fin ring for a low velocity, gun-launched projectile includes a circular base with a plurality of trunnions extending radially outward from the circular base. Fins are mounted to the trunnions. A line of frangibility between adjacent trunnions includes a rear notch, a circular opening and a front notch, preferably all axially aligned. Upon impact of the projectile with a target, the fin ring breaks apart at the lines of frangibility and separates from the projectile.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

The invention relates in general to gun launched projectiles and in particular to stabilizing fins for gun launched projectiles.

Some gun launched projectiles are stabilized in flight by fins. Fins come in many designs. In some designs a fin ring is attached to the projectile body and the fins are attached to the fin ring with pins and springs. Known fin rings survive gun launch projectile flight and projectile impact with a target.

Projectiles must have large amounts of kinetic energy to penetrate targets such as triple brick walls and double reinforced concrete. The fin rings and fins on a projectile consume a portion of the available target penetrating kinetic energy in the process of breaking the fin ring and or fins during target penetration by the projectile. The fin ring may also have a step up in diameter compared to the warhead body which impedes penetration. In addition the fins that are attached to the fin ring may have a hooking effect when they contact the target surface. Projectiles with a relatively low velocity such as those fired from multi target shoulder fired weapons have less kinetic energy than higher velocity projectiles. The consumption of kinetic energy by the fin ring and fins on a low kinetic energy projectile can inhibit the complete penetration of a target.

A need exists for a fin ring that survives gun tube launch and projectile flight but fails upon target impact to enable a low velocity projectile to penetrate a target with less resistance.

One aspect of the invention is a fin ring for a gun launched projectile. The fin ring includes a circular base centered on a central longitudinal axis of the fin ring. A plurality of trunnions are equally circumferentially spaced around the circular base. Each trunnion extends radially outward from the circular base and includes fin mounting holes therein. A plurality of axially extending rear notches are formed in the circular base. The rear notches begin at a rear perimeter of the circular base and extend axially forward. A plurality of axially extending front notches are formed in the circular base. The front notches begin at a front perimeter of the circular base and extend axially rearward. A plurality of circular openings are formed in the circular base.

The fin ring may include a plurality of fins. Each fin may be mounted to a respective one of the plurality of trunnions.

The plurality of rear notches may be circumferentially equally spaced around the circular base. The plurality of front notches may be circumferentially equally spaced around the circular base. The plurality of circular openings may be circumferentially equally spaced around the circular base.

Each rear notch may be axially aligned with a front notch. One of the plurality of circular openings may be disposed between each rear notch and front notch. The plurality of rear notches may be circumferentially equally spaced between the plurality of trunnions.

In another aspect the invention includes a method. The method includes launching a projectile having a novel fin ring. Upon impact of the projectile with a target the fin ring is broken into a plurality of pieces.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

A novel fin ring with fins is fixed to a projectile. When the projectile impacts a target the fin ring breaks up. When the fin rings breaks up it snaps off the projectile body and eliminates the stepped up diameter transition that hampers penetration of the projectile into the target. Further the grappling hook effect of the fins is eliminated because the fins are discarded when the fin ring breaks off the projectile.

A plurality of axially extending rear notches are formed in the circular base . The rear notches begin at a rear perimeter of the circular base and extend axially forward. A plurality of axially extending front notches are formed in the circular base . The front notches begin at a front perimeter of the circular base and extending axially rearward. A plurality of circular openings are also formed in the circular base . The rear perimeter of the circular base may include a chamfer .

The plurality of rear notches may be circumferentially equally spaced around the circular base . The plurality of front notches may be circumferentially equally spaced around the circular base . The plurality of circular openings may be circumferentially equally spaced around the circular base . Each rear notch may be axially aligned with a front notch . Each of the plurality of circular openings may be disposed between a rear notch and a front notch . Preferably the number of rear notches the number of front notches and the number of openings equal the number of trunnions or fins . The rear notches may be circumferentially equally spaced between the plurality of trunnions .

In one embodiment the axial length B of each rear notch is more than twice the axial length C of each front notch . In some embodiments the combined axial length B plus C plus E of a rear notch a circular opening and a front notch is more than one half of the axial width D of the circular base .

To mount fin ring to the rear of projectile pins not shown may be inserted through circular openings in base and press fit into openings not shown in projectile . In addition to being part of the mounting assembly openings function as stress risers that facilitate the breakup of ring along the longitudinal axis of aligned notches .

Upon impact of projectile with a target notches create a moment in the target impact direction. The larger rear notch allows more deformation of material. The moment of inertia of the trunnion fin and fin mounting spring not shown creates forces to break the ring . The fin ring conserves kinetic energy because the impact of fins is not used the break the fin ring . In addition breakup of the fin ring removes the stepped up diameter of the fin ring which results in a smoother more continuous projectile surface for target penetration. The fin ring remains robust and structurally sound during gun launch and fin opening.

During testing the fin ring was intact after gun launch and remained together during fin deployment and projectile flight. After target impact fin ring broke into a plurality of pieces at respective aligned pairs of notches .

While the invention has been described with reference to certain embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof
