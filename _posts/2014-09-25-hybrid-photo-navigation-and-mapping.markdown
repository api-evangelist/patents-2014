title: Hybrid photo navigation and mapping
abstract: Embodiments disclosed obtain a plurality of measurement sets from a plurality of sensors in conjunction with the capture of a sequence of exterior and interior images of a structure while traversing locations in and around the structure. Each measurement set may be associated with at least one image. An external structural envelope of the structure is determined from exterior images of the structure and the corresponding outdoor trajectory of a UE. The position and orientation of the structure and the structural envelope is determined in absolute coordinates. Further, an indoor map of the structure in absolute coordinates may be obtained based on interior images of the structure, a structural envelope in absolute coordinates, and measurements associated with the indoor trajectory of the UE during traversal of the indoor area to capture the interior images.
