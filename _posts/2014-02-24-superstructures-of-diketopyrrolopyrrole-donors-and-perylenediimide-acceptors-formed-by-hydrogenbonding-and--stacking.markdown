This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application 61 768 973 filed Feb. 25 2013 and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The United States Government has rights in the invention described herein pursuant to an Army Research Office Short Term Innovative Research Award Number W911NF 12 1 0125.

The field of the certain embodiments of invention generally relates. More specifically the field of certain embodiments of invention relates to.

Small molecules that self assemble into well ordered hierarchical superstructures direct the most complex tasks in biology. To create synthetic structures with similar functionality chemists have employed noncovalent interactions to organize chromophores into large well defined structures including systems that utilize both hydrogen bonding H bonding and interactions. Examples include homoaggregates such as oligo p phenylenevinylenes OPVs or substituted perylenediimides PDI where H bonding precedes aggregation into stacked helices or heteroaggregates that assemble into superstructures via multiple noncovalent interactions such as a system consisting of either melamine or OPVs H bonding with PDIs. In self assembling systems where one dimensional aggregates form models have been developed to obtain association constants Ks thermodynamic parameters H and S and degrees of polymerization by attributing assembly to a single dominant noncovalent interaction. For heteroaggregation however models that consider two or more components are rare and most simplify their description of assembly by only considering a single noncovalent interaction. This inability to model how different noncovalent recognition events work in concert to create superstructures limits the ability of scientists to create systems with the functional complexity found in natural systems.

One embodiment of the invention relates to a method of assembling heteroaggregates. A first component is interacted with a second component via a first noncovalent interaction to form a substructure. A plurality of substructures are assembled via a second noncovalent interaction to form a superstructure.

One embodiment of the invention relates to a method of assemblying heteroaggregates. A plurality of first components are interacted to form a disordered aggregation. A plurality of second components are interacted with the disordered aggregation. A superstructure is assembled comprising first components hetereoaggregated with second components and first components homoaggregated with first components.

One embodiment of the invention related to a self assemblying composition. The composition comprises a plurality of diketopyrrole donors and a plurality of perylendiimide acceptors. Each of the plurality of diketopyrrole donors interacts with another of the plurality of diketopyrrole donors via stacking and noncovalently interacts with one of the plurality of perylendiimide acceptors.

To develop new quantitative models that describe how multiple noncovalent interactions bring together different components into well defined superstructures the aggregation of chiral and achiral diketopyrrolopyrrole based DPP donors with a 1 7 substituted PDI acceptor were studied. Upon mixing in solution the PDI and DPPs assemble into well ordered three dimensional superstructures because of 1 complementary triple H bonds along one spatial axis x 2 large aromatic surfaces that drive aggregation via stacking along an orthogonal axis z and 3 solubilizing alkyl chains appended to each aromatic core that can interact along the third orthogonal axis y . Variable temperature VT UV Vis and circular dichroism CD spectroscopic measurements revealed that the PDIs associate to disordered DPP aggregates which subsequently reorganize into helical heteroaggregates of a single chirality. The resulting thermodynamic model quantifies the thermodynamic binding parameters H and S associated with each interaction and elucidates the subtle supramolecular cues that induce the transition from disordered aggregates into well defined helices.

DPP donor and DPP donor have diamidopyridine DAP groups which can form triple H bonds with the diimide groups of PDI acceptor . The donors differ only by their N alkyl chains DPP donor possesses homochiral S 2 methylbutyl side chains and 2 has racemic 2 ethyloctyl chains. Initially the aggregation of DPP donor and PDI acceptor was analyzed by UV Vis spectroscopy because of the necessity to understand how the propensity to homoaggregate contributes to the formation and structure of heteroaggregates. The UV Vis spectra of DPP donor in toluene has absorption maxima at 538 and 580 nm at 25 C. which are the result of dipole allowed S Selectronic transitions.

These bands undergo bathochromic shifts with increasing sharpness upon cooling which are spectral signatures of J type aggregation . Although stacked chromophores with chiral side chains often form chiral superstructures the absorbance intensities exhibit a sigmoidal dependence with temperature and no observable signal was found in VT CD experiments. These observations indicate isodesmic stacking is occurring where the binding constant describing the stacking is constant regardless of aggregate size. By fitting the changes in absorbance to an isodesmic model H and S were determined to be 7.4 0.5 kcal moland 3.0 2.0 e.u. respectively indicating the stacking is enthalpically driven . DFT calculations B3LYP 6 31G d p on homoaggregates of a DPP that has methyl side chains to simplify the calculation revealed a slip stacked binding geometry with thiophenes overlapping the diketopyrolopyrolle core which has been observed in a previously reported X ray crystal structure of DPP thiophene oligomers. The energy of binding E 10.5 kcal mol from the density functional theory DFT calculations agrees well with the H derived from the fitting. Interestingly intermolecular H bonding between the DAP groups was observed in the calculated structure.

The ability to H bond is known to affect the supramolecular assembly of 1 7 substituted PDIs so the homoaggregation of PDI acceptor was also investigated by VT UV Vis spectroscopy. The UV Vis spectra of 1 7 substituted PDIs typically display characteristic peaks arising from the S Stransition that are broadened because of twisting in the perylene ring system that inhibits aggregation beyond stacked dimers. Previously studied PDIs without N substituents display a sharp peak that is attributed to the J aggregation of stacked dimers interconnected by H bonding. Alternatively mono N substituted PDIs possessing complementary melamine moieties H aggregate into helical superstructures as a result of intermolecular H bonding. For PDI acceptor the UV Vis spectra revealed a sharp absorbance maximum at 520 nm in toluene with pronounced vibronic fine structure. Upon cooling these peaks decrease with a concomitant increase of a broad band with a maximum at 592 nm . These spectral changes are similar to PDIs whose aggregation is intermediate between J or H type. It is believed that the new absorption peak is attributable to a similar stacking geometry. A plot of the absorbance at 592 nm versus temperature reveals negligible aggregation above 37 C. and below which absorption increases quickly suggesting nucleation growth assembly in which an initial disfavored binding event precludes the formation of long stacks prior to the critical temperature after which a new thermodynamically favored equilibrium arises that governs the assembly into stacked superstructures . Suspecting intermolecular H bonding plays a key role in assembly the VT UV Vis experiment was repeated with a bis N cyclohexyl derivative of PDI acceptor or in 3 DMSO in toluene both of which inhibit H bonding. No spectral changes that indicate stacking were observed in either control experiment confirming that H bonding promotes the stacking of PDI acceptor .

Heteroaggregate formation was investigated by VT UV Vis spectroscopy on a 2 1 mixture of DPP donor and PDI acceptor respectively in toluene. At 40 C. the spectrum is a linear composite of the individual spectra indicating that mixed aggregates are not present at high temperature. Upon cooling the absorbance bands corresponding to PDI acceptor decrease and two new bands arise at 563 and 615 nm which are assigned to a S Stransition from the stacking of PDI acceptor . Several aspects of the spectrum indicate heteroaggregate formation 1 the absorbance at 615 nm begins to increase in the mixture at 21 C. which is a much lower temperature than was observed for the onset of homoaggregates of PDI acceptor 39 C. 2 the new bands at 563 and 615 nm are much sharper than the broad peaks formed by homoaggregates of PDI acceptor suggesting J type aggregation meaning the stacked PDIs adopt a different geometry in the heteroaggregates and 3 the change in the absorption at 615 nm for the mixture of DPP donor and PDI acceptor is more gradual than for the homoaggregates of PDI acceptor suggesting that homoaggregation pathways are suppressed and a different assembly mechanism is operating that is driven by the triple H bonding between DPP donor and PDI acceptor . Prior to the appearance of the PDI stacking bands 563 and 615 nm the transitions previously assigned to stacking of DPP donor 538 and 580 nm increase steadily with decreasing temperature suggesting extensive homoaggregation of DPP donor precedes heteroaggregate formation. A bisignated Cotton effect with peaks at 563 and 615 nm matching the stacking peaks of the achiral PDI appeared in the VT CD spectra. The bisignated effect is a consequence of electronic coupling between conjugated segments in a helical array . Notably the transition temperature in the VT CD spectrum of the heteroaggregates is 5 lower than in the UV Vis measurements suggesting several molecules of PDI acceptor need to be associated onto disordered aggregates of DPP donor to induce rearrangement into chiral helices .

The VT UV Vis experiments were repeated in a mixture of DPP donor and PDI acceptor and while the same trends were observed in the VT UV Vis spectra no Cotton effect arose in the CD spectrum of DPP donor and PDI acceptor . The structure of the heteroaggregate of DPP donor and PDI acceptor was modeled by DFT calculations using methyl and ethyl solubilizing chains on DPP and PDI respectively. The overlap between the DPPs remains almost unchanged compared to DPP homoaggregates whereas the PDI relative orientations did change compared to PDI homoaggregates indicating that the preferred conformation of the DPPs dictates the stacking angle in the heteroaggregate superstructure. Furthermore the assessment of PDI J aggregation from the VT UV Vis spectrum of the heteroaggregate is supported by the skewed orientation of the PDIs in the calculated structure .

The spectroscopic data were used to derive a new assembly model that describes formation of heteroaggregates that arise from both H bonding and stacking. The corresponding thermodynamic parameters for each interaction were obtained by fitting to the changes in absorption with temperature to this model. The data indicate that PDIs bind to disordered stacks of DPPs to produce chiral superstructures which leaves an available H bonding site on each PDI that can potentially be occupied by an additional DPP at higher concentrations. In the model disordered homoaggregates of DPP donor assemble isodesmically according to microscopic binding constant K. Since there are four identical pathways by which this process can occur Kis one fourth the experimentally observed macroscopic K. The initial association event of one molecule of PDI acceptor to a stack of DPP donor of any size is governed by microscopic association constant K . As there are two positions where H bonding takes place in PDI acceptor and n points on a stack of DPP donor where n denotes the number of residues the macroscopic Kis 2nK. Further association of PDI acceptor to the stacks are described by Kand K where Kis a dimensionless Kthat includes the energy contributions from stacking and any chelate cooperativity effects associated with the aggregation of PDI acceptor within the DPP donor stacks. The resulting mass balance equations can be written as an infinite series that describes the total concentration of each species PDI and DPP as a function of n 

Equations 1 and 2 are both convergent and can be solved to obtain PDI and DPP for any value of K K K PDI and DPP . H and S corresponding to Kwere fixed to the values previously obtained by studying the homoaggregation of DPP donor and held invariant. By generating K values from the van t Hoff equation the concentration of all species at each temperature can be obtained by fitting the experimental VT data. When both VT UV Vis and CD measurements were simultaneously fit to the same parameter set the H and S for K 24.1 0.1 kcal moland 70 2 e.u. and K 13.5 0.1 kcal moland 40 1 e.u. were obtained. These values indicate Kis enthalpically driven which is typical for H bonded dimers. Interestingly Kis also enthalpically driven but an entropic penalty is associated with the rearrangement of PDI acceptor into J aggregates presumably because the contorted perylene rings disfavor this stacking geometry. Nevertheless the enthalpy associated with aggregation overcomes the disfavorable entropy below room temperature which drives heterosuperstructure formation upon cooling.

In one embodiment the self assembly of heteroaggregates comprised of conjugated donors and acceptors provides synthetic hierarchical structures with functional complexity comparable to their biological counterparts but models are needed that can describe the complex milieu of interactions involved in superstructure formation. By studying the heteroaggregation of a DPP donor and PDI acceptor a new model was elucidates the subtle structural cues that induce the transition from a disordered aggregate into a chiral helix. Using this new model all thermodynamic parameters could be quantitatively determined and both H bonding and the subsequent helix formation process were found to be enthalpically favored but entropically disfavored. This new model could be used to create ordered superstructures of donors and acceptors which are increasingly investigated in the context of photovoltaics and for understanding fundamental aspects of charge and energy transport in self assembled systems.

Changes in the UV Vis or CD spectra of DPPs PDIs or mixtures thereof were induced by changes in the sample temperature or concentration. This is the result of the formation or disassembly of aggregates of varying size composed of DPPs and or PDIs in differing local environments with differing propensity to absorb light at various wavelengths. Accordingly equilibrium constants Ks can be quantified by first defining a model that includes the appropriate set of equilibria calculating the hypothetical concentrations of equilibrium species at each temperature or concentration and finally fitting the resulting data to the spectra and their changes. Fittings were conducted in Microsoft Excel 2010 using the Evolutionary Solving method within the Solver feature by minimizing the total sum of squared residuals SSR Equation 1 where w are the weights assigned to each absorbance.

To model the homoaggregation of DPP donor a two state system was assumed where the fully monomeric DPP donor and fully aggregated DPP donor each have a unique temperature independent extinction coefficient. The observed absorbance changes in a variable temperature UVN is experiment was found to fit well to the simplest infinite association model the isodesmic model which assumes the association by stacking between aromatic moieties are equivalent regardless of length of the stack 

A commonly overlooked aspect is that the value of Kderived from the fitting process is typically a macroscopic Kthat does not take into account that there are two faces to which each DPP donor molecule can associate. While a technicality in terms of reporting Ks within the literature it is of crucial importance when comparing the experimentally derived thermodynamic parameters to those obtained by computational chemistry which describe the microscopic association process. Since there are a total of four identical pathways by which two DPP molecules can associate the microscopic association constant K can be defined as 

To fit the variable temperature UV Vis spectrum Ks are generated from the van t Hoff equation Equation 12 and are then used to calculate the hypothetical absorbance at each temperature Equation 13 . The theoretical data is then fit to the experimental spectroscopic data by minimizing the SSR Equation 3 using the thermodynamic parameters H and S and the extinction coefficients as fitting parameters.

Because the ratio of 1 3 in solution 2 1 and the higher number of H bonds resulting from complementary imides and diamidopyridines it was assumed that homoaggregation of PDI acceptor does not occur to an appreciable extent under the experimental conditions and is thus not included in our model. Since strong homoaggregation of PDI acceptor occurs without a resulting signal in the CD spectra the model presumes the DPP donor molecules are present in a broad distribution of chain lengths as a result of isodesmic stacking as dictated by a macroscopic K 4K determined previously. The binding of PDI Acceptor to each of these stacks can be described by two Ks Kand K. The former describes the strength of association of one 3 molecule to a DPP donor stack of any length that does not already contain PDI acceptor . As there are two points by which H bonding takes place in PDI acceptor and n points on a stack of DPP donor where n denotes the number of residues the macroscopic Kdescribing this event is 2nK.Kdescribes binding strength of additional PDI acceptor molecules to DPP donor stacks already containing PDI acceptor molecules and includes 1 the additional binding energy yielded as a result of stacking between two PDI moieties and 2 the benefit of chelate cooperativity. For the variable temperature experiments of DPP donor and PDI acceptor precipitation of heteroaggregates occurred below 10 C. which prevented the assessment of any new bands at low temperatures.

The components included in the mass balance equation that defines the total concentration of DPP DPP for this particular system consist of a series of equations defined by the length of the DPP chain n 

Thus at any given value of K K K DPP and PDI equations 28 and 29 can be iteratively converged unto f PDI DPP g PDI DPP 0 giving PDI and DPP . Accordingly Newton s Method was implemented in Microsoft Excel with each two columns corresponding to an iteration of Equation 28 and 29 

To calculate the theoretical UV Vis and CD data for the fitting it was assumed that any two or more molecules of PDI acceptor in the stacks will contribute to the absorbance band at 615 nm with each residue exhibiting a temperature independent extinction coefficient . All molecules of PDI acceptor in any other state including monomers and heteroaggregates with only one molecule of PDI acceptor exhibits a different extinction coefficient which is equivalent to the initial absorbance observed at 615 nm prior to the onset of hetero aggregation.

All heteroaggregates with one molecule of PDI acceptor can be expressed by equation 30 which can be solved using equation 7 to yield equation 31 

Since the transition temperature for CD is significantly less than that observed by UV Vis it was assumed that monomers and heteroaggregates containing either one or two molecules of PDI acceptor yield no signal. That is at the very minimum three molecules of 3 need to be stacked to obtain an ordered aggregate. The total concentration of all aggregates containing two bound PDI molecules can be expressed as 

To fit the variable temperature UV Vis and CD spectra Ks are generated from the van t Hoff equation Equation 10 and are then used to calculate the hypothetical absorbance and CD at each temperature Equation 19 . The theoretical data is then fitted to the experimental UV Vis and CD data simultaneously by minimizing the SSR Equation 1 using the thermodynamic parameters H and S the extinction coefficients and CD proportionality constant as fitting parameters.

UV Vis measurements were performed on an Agilent 8453 spectrophotometer equipped with a temperature control accessory. For all measurements the temperatures were corrected using an external digital thermometer with a microprobe accessory. Quartz cuvettes with 1 cm path lengths were used. All samples were prepared with dried solvents in volumetric glassware and were heated within the cell holder at the highest measured temperature e.g. 50 or 90 C. for 30 min prior to cooling measurement to ensure disaggregation. For each variable temperature experiment increments of 1 or 2 C. were performed with a 10 minute equilibration time between each measurement. illustrates variable temperature UV Vis of an 18.0 M solution of DPP donor in toluene. illustrates the absorbance at 584 nm of a 18.0 M solution of DPP donor in toluene versus sample temperature.

DFT Calculations of geometries energies and structural properties were performed with Gaussian 09. Donor and acceptor geometries were optimized using Becke s three parameter exchange functional combined with the Lee Yang Parr correlation functional B3LYP and the 6 31G d p basis set on an ultrafine grid using tight convergence criteria. Minimization of structure was confirmed via frequency calculations and all structures were found to be minimum energy structures. Enthalpies of H bonding and stacking were calculated from converged fragments at the B3LYP 6 31G d p level of theory with identical grid and convergence criteria. The length of the alkyl chains within 1 and 3 were reduced for speed of calculation.
