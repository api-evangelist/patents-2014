This application is a non provisional application claiming benefit of the filing date of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 814 982 filed Apr. 23 2013 and titled Gaming Machine Having Transparent Display .

A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material that is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.

The invention generally relates to gaming machines and more particularly to placement of a shared video display between two facing players for common play of a shared game feature.

Playing gaming machines is an enjoyable pastime for many people. Gaming machines include machines that are typically operated by a user by inserting coins tokens credit cards smart cards tickets or coupons with monetary value. The machines may include e.g. slot machines pinball machines video games and computer stations for playing games alone or with other users such as bingo card games and the like. The machines may operate based on both luck and the user s skill. Such gaming machines may be located in casinos video arcades gas stations bars or any other location. The gaming machines may be used for gambling where the user receives a monetary or other prize when the machine pays off or simply for amusement.

In today s video based gaming machines display placement and viewing limits the gaming machine to a single user platform. Side by side game platforms have been deployed but have limitations and provide a shared user experience rather than an individual gaming experience.

Accordingly there is a need for and the present invention provides a system to overcome the above limitations.

This invention applies new transparent display technology to wagering machines. Using a transparent OLED e ink or other emissive display technology allows the placement of a single display between two players facing each other for example. In accordance with one or more embodiments this display may be a display disposed between two players and is used to play a head to head competitive bonus. The bonus game could alternatively be a cooperative game where both players work toward a common goal. One advantage of such a gaming platform is that players can see each other which will enhance the game play through player emotion.

In accordance with one or more embodiments the transparent display may be the main game display with a player always seeing the opponent.

Yet other embodiments use the transparent display as a shared outcome display between two head to head players and use a lower individual display to allow each player to make selections or game actions without the opponent knowing their choices in game such as Texas Hold em poker or Battleship for example. For Battleship the outcome of each player s action could be displayed with video animation on the shared transparent display a Hit or Miss of the opponent s ship .

In accordance with one or more embodiments the transparent display may include a mechanism such as an electronic shutter to make the display opaque during single player use and then transparent during head to head play.

The invention further relates to machine readable media on which are stored embodiments of the present invention. It is contemplated that any media suitable for retrieving instructions is within the scope of the present invention. By way of example such media may take the form of magnetic optical or semiconductor media. The invention also relates to data structures that contain embodiments of the present invention and to the transmission of data structures containing embodiments of the present invention.

In accordance with one or more embodiments transparent OLED e ink or other emissive display technology allows the placement of a single shared display between two players facing each other as in illustrate embodiments including an upper transparent shared feature display disposed to be shared by back to back arranged gaming terminals each terminal configured to present a base game to each of two players. In accordance with one or more embodiments the transparent shared display is a shared outcome display between two head to head players with a lower individual terminal display on each of their gaming terminals used to allow each player to make selections or game actions without the opponent seeing some of their information cards game pieces etc. and their choices related to this information.

Yet another embodiment is to have the transparent shared feature display be the main game display that incorporates a mechanism such as an electronic shutter to make the display opaque during single player use and then transparent during head to head play. Alternately certain areas of each player s shared display may be dedicated to their individual game information while a larger central portion for example may be shared by both players. illustrate examples of this style of presentation for games similar to Connect4 and Battleship respectively. In still other embodiments portions of the shared display may be permanently masked on one side or the other to allow individual player displays while retaining a common transparent portion for display of common information.

Some or all of the displays discussed above may include touchscreen input capability. In particular the shared transparent display may have a touchscreen on both sides of the display to allow each of the players in interact with the game.

In an embodiment the gaming terminals of may be under control of a single or separate processors described below and are configured to control the terminal displays to display individual base games to the two players playing the terminals . For example the base games may be video slot games electro mechanical stepper type slot machine games or other wagering types of games. As shown in the gaming terminals may take the form of low profile slant type gaming machines the form type of which is well known in the art and which receive their designation since the primary game displays are slanted from the vertical. In another embodiment the terminals primary game displays may be arranged horizontally or may be embodied as a single large horizontal table display spanning both gaming terminals . The terminals are disposed back to back such that the transparent shared display up stands between the gaming terminals as shown such that the players of the gaming terminals when seated at the gaming terminals face each other through the transparent shared display .

Each gaming terminal is provided with player input interfaces which may be buttons disposed on a button deck and or the terminal displays include a touch screen interface. The operation of an example of the utility of the arrangement of the gaming terminals and shared display will now be described. It should be understood that the following description is but one example.

With reference to at the players play their individual games on their respective gaming terminals . The play of the games results in winning and losing outcomes and for winning outcomes of the base game the players receive awards such as game credits. At a game feature is triggered by for example a symbol based trigger where one or both players obtains a triggering outcome from the play of the base games or from a terminal terminal bank or a random non symbol based game level mystery feature trigger of the type for example described in for example Torango U.S. Pat. No. 6 592 460 issued Jul. 15 2003 and titled Progressive Wagering System or Olive U.S. Pat. No. 8 663 000 issued Mar. 4 2014 and titled Slot Machine Game and System with Improved Jackpot Feature or a system based mystery trigger such as various embodiments of Torango and Olive above as well as Acres et al U.S. Pat. No. RE 38 812 re issued Oct. 4 2005 and titled Method and Apparatus for Operating Networked Gaming Devices the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference. In response to the triggering of the feature at a feature game is presented at the shared transparent display for either competitive or collaborative play by the players at For example as shown in the play may be alternate move games such as Poker Backgammon or the well known Battleship game . The game may also be a shared slot machine game presentation or a dice rolling game such as Monopoly . At the players play the game at the shared feature display which by virtue of its transparency or semi transparency enables the players to see each other through the display as the various moves are made. Game features characters pieces cards die and game boards are displayed that the shared feature display to show game progress. As stated above the shared feature display may include a touch screen player interfaces so the players can provide input for the play of the feature game solely or in addition to the use of buttons . In an embodiment the base games are disabled during the play of the feature game. In another embodiment the base games played on the player s game terminals in the arrangement are played either in a base game mode or a feature mode to drive the progress of the feature game toward its conclusion. For example in a feature game players serially play their base games to move either competitive collaborative game pieces such as race cars horses Greyhounds or the like with base game outcomes. At the feature game is played to completion and at any feature game awards are issued and the feature is concluded returning the players to the play of their base games.

In an embodiment where content either game related content or non game related content is displayed on the shared display the content may be opaque so as to obscure the view of the player on the other gaming terminal or some or all of the content may be semi opaque or translucent so that the content can be viewed but the player at the opposing gaming terminal can still be at least partially seen.

In a first state where no feature is presented on the shared feature display it may be controlled to be greyed out or otherwise to obscure the view of an opposing player or may display advertising or a pleasing scene for the players. It may also assume the first state when no other player is playing the opposite gaming terminal The transparent shared display then assumes a second state to display the feature game when the same is triggered.

Note that two audio channels are used to provide a stereo effect in the present example but fewer or more channels may be used according to the audio quality or effect that is desired. For example multiple channels of audio may be used to provide multiple sounds such as stereo music and the like.

Referring to electronic gaming machine is shown in accordance with one or more embodiments. Electronic gaming machine includes base game integrated circuit board EGM Processor Board connected through serial bus line to game monitoring unit GMU such as a Bally MC300 or ACSC NT and player interface integrated circuit board PIB connected to player interface devices over bus lines . Printer is connected to PIB and GMU over bus lines . Base game integrated circuit board PIB and GMU connect to Ethernet switch over bus lines . Ethernet switch connects to a slot management system SMS and a casino management system CMS network over bus line . GMU also may connect to the SMS and CMS network over bus line . Speakers connect through audio mixer and bus lines to base game integrated circuit board and PIB . The proximity and biometric devices and circuitry may be installed by upgrading a commercially available PIB such as a Bally iView unit. Coding executed on base game integrated circuit board PIB and or GMU may be upgraded to integrate a game having adjustable multi part indicia as is more fully described herein.

Peripherals connect through I O board to base game integrated circuit board . For example a bill ticket acceptor is typically connected to a game input output board which is in turn connected to a conventional central processing unit CPU base game integrated circuit board such as an Intel Pentium microprocessor mounted on a gaming motherboard. I O board may be connected to base game integrated circuit board by a serial connection such as RS 232 or USB or may be attached to the processor by a bus such as but not limited to an ISA bus. The gaming motherboard may be mounted with other conventional components such as are found on conventional personal computer motherboards and loaded with a game program which may include a gaming machine operating system OS such as a Bally Alpha OS. Base game integrated circuit board executes a game program that causes base game integrated circuit board to play a game. In one embodiment the game program provides a slot machine game having adjustable multi part indicia. The various components and included devices may be installed with conventionally and or commercially available components devices and circuitry into a conventional and or commercially available gaming machine cabinet examples of which are described above.

When a player has inserted a form of currency such as for example and without limitation paper currency coins or tokens cashless tickets or vouchers electronic funds transfers or the like into the currency acceptor a signal is sent by way of I O board to base game integrated circuit board which in turn assigns an appropriate number of credits for play in accordance with the game program. The player may further control the operation of the gaming machine by way of other peripherals for example to select the amount to wager via electromechanical or touch screen buttons. The game starts in response to the player operating a start mechanism such as a handle or touch screen icon including the icons described above with respect to the Bally iDeck . The game program includes a random number generator to provide a display of randomly selected indicia on one or more displays. In some embodiments the random generator may be physically separate from gaming machine for example it may be part of a central determination host system which provides random game outcomes to the game program. Thereafter the player may or may not interact with the game through electromechanical or touch screen buttons to change the displayed indicia. Finally base game integrated circuit board under control of the game program and OS compares the final display of indicia to a pay table. The set of possible game outcomes may include a subset of outcomes related to the triggering of a feature game. In the event the displayed outcome is a member of this subset base game integrated circuit board under control of the game program and by way of I O Board may cause feature game play to be presented on a feature display.

Predetermined pay out amounts for certain outcomes including feature game outcomes are stored as part of the game program. Such pay out amounts are in response to instructions from base game integrated circuit board provided to the player in the form of coins credits or currency via I O board and a pay mechanism which may be one or more of a credit meter a coin hopper a voucher printer an electronic funds transfer protocol or any other payout means known or developed in the art.

In various embodiments the game program is stored in a memory device not shown connected to or mounted on the gaming motherboard. By way of example but not by limitation such memory devices include external memory devices hard drives CD ROMs DVDs and flash memory cards. In an alternative embodiment the game programs are stored in a remote storage device. In one embodiment the remote storage device is housed in a remote server. The gaming machine may access the remote storage device via a network connection including but not limited to a local area network connection a TCP IP connection a wireless connection or any other means for operatively networking components together. Optionally other data including graphics sound files and other media data for use with the EGM are stored in the same or a separate memory device not shown . Some or all of the game program and its associated data may be loaded from one memory device into another for example from flash memory to random access memory RAM .

In one or more embodiments peripherals may be connected to the system over Ethernet connections directly to the appropriate server or tied to the system controller inside the EGM using USB serial or Ethernet connections. Each of the respective devices may have upgrades to their firmware utilizing these connections.

GMU includes an integrated circuit board and GMU processor and memory including coding for network communications such as the G2S game to system protocol from the Gaming Standards Association Las Vegas Nev. used for system communications over the network. As shown GMU may connect to card reader through bus and may thereby obtain player card information and transmit the information over the network through bus . Gaming activity information may be transferred by the base game integrated circuit board to GMU where the information may be translated into a network protocol such as S2S for transmission to a server such as a player tracking server where information about a player s playing activity may be stored in a designated server database.

PIB includes an integrated circuit board PID processor and memory which includes an operating system such as Windows CE a player interface program which may be executable by the PID processor together with various input output I O drivers for respective devices which connect to PIB such as player interface devices and which may further include various games or game components playable on PIB or playable on a connected network server and PIB is operable as the player interface. PIB connects to card reader through bus display through video decoder and bus such as an LVDS or VGA bus.

As part of its programming the PID processor executes coding to drive display and provide messages and information to a player. Touch screen circuitry interactively connects display and video decoder to PIB such that a player may input information and cause the information to be transmitted to PIB either on the player s initiative or responsive to a query by PIB . Additionally soft keys connect through bus to PIB and operate together with display to provide information or queries to a player and receive responses or queries from the player. PIB in turn communicates over the CMS SMS network through Ethernet switch and busses and with respective servers such as a player tracking server.

Player interface devices are linked into the virtual private network of the system components in gaming machine . The system components include the iView processing board and game monitoring unit GMU processing board. These system components may connect over a network to the slot management system such as a commercially available Bally SDS SMS and or casino management system such as a commercially available Bally CMP CMS .

The GMU system component has a connection to the base game through a serial SAS connection and is connected to various servers using for example HTTPs over Ethernet. Through this connection firmware media operating system software gaming machine configurations can be downloaded to the system components from the servers. This data is authenticated prior to install on the system components.

The system components include the iView processing board and game monitoring unit GMU processing board. The GMU and iView can combined into one like the commercially available Bally GTM iView device. This device may have a video mixing technology to mix the EGM processor s video signals with the iView display onto the top box monitor or any monitor on the gaming device.

In accordance with one or more embodiments is a functional block diagram of a gaming kernel of a game program under control of base game integrated circuit board . The game program uses gaming kernel by calling into application programming interface API which is part of game manager . The components of game kernel as shown in are only illustrative and should not be considered limiting. For example the number of managers may be changed additional managers may be added or some managers may be removed without deviating from the scope and spirit of the invention.

As shown in the example there are three layers a hardware layer an operating system layer such as but not limited to Linux and a game kernel layer having game manager therein. In one or more embodiments the use of a standard operating system such a UNIX based or Windows based operating system allows game developers interfacing to the gaming kernel to use any of a number of standard development tools and environments available for the operating systems. This is in contrast to the use of proprietary low level interfaces which may require significant time and engineering investments for each game upgrade hardware upgrade or feature upgrade. The game kernel layer executes at the user level of the operating system and itself contains a major component called the I O Board Server . To properly set the bounds of game application software making integrity checking easier all game applications interact with gaming kernel using a single API in game manager . This enables game applications to make use of a well defined consistent interface as well as making access points to gaming kernel controlled where overall access is controlled using separate processes.

For example game manager parses an incoming command stream and when a command dealing with I O comes in arrow the command is sent to an applicable library routine . Library routine decides what it needs from a device and sends commands to I O Board Server see arrow . A few specific drivers remain in operating system s kernel shown as those below line . These are built in primitive or privileged drivers that are i general ii kept to a minimum and iii are easier to leave than extract. In such cases the low level communications is handled within operating system and the contents passed to library routines .

Thus in a few cases library routines may interact with drivers inside operating system which is why arrow is shown as having three directions between library utilities and I O Board Server or between library utilities and certain drivers in operating system . No matter which path is taken the logic needed to work with each device is coded into modules in the user layer of the diagram. Operating system is kept as simple stripped down and common across as many hardware platforms as possible. The library utilities and user level drivers change as dictated by the game cabinet or game machine in which it will run. Thus each game cabinet or game machine may have an base game integrated circuit board connected to a unique relatively dumb and as inexpensive as possible I O adapter board plus a gaming kernel which will have the game machine unique library routines and I O Board Server components needed to enable game applications to interact with the gaming machine cabinet. Note that these differences are invisible to the game application software with the exception of certain functional differences i.e. if a gaming cabinet has stereo sound the game application will be able make use of API to use the capability over that of a cabinet having traditional monaural sound .

Game manager provides an interface into game kernel providing consistent predictable and backwards compatible calling methods syntax and capabilities by way of game application API . This enables the game developer to be free of dealing directly with the hardware including the freedom to not have to deal with low level drivers as well as the freedom to not have to program lower level managers although lower level managers may be accessible through game manager s interface if a programmer has the need. In addition to the freedom derived from not having to deal with the hardware level drivers and the freedom of having consistent callable object oriented interfaces to software managers of those components drivers game manager provides access to a set of upper level managers also having the advantages of consistent callable object oriented interfaces and further providing the types and kinds of base functionality required in casino type games. Game manager providing all the advantages of its consistent and richly functional interface as supported by the rest of game kernel thus provides a game developer with a multitude of advantages.

Game manager may have several objects within itself including an initialization object not shown . The initialization object performs the initialization of the entire game machine including other objects after game manager has started its internal objects and servers in appropriate order. In order to carry out this function the kernel s configuration manager is among the first objects to be started configuration manager has data needed to initialize and correctly configure other objects or servers.

The upper level managers of game kernel may include game event log manager which provides at the least a logging or logger base class enabling other logging objects to be derived from this base object. The logger object is a generic logger that is it is not aware of the contents of logged messages and events. The log manager s job is to log events in non volatile event log space. The size of the space may be fixed although the size of the logged event is typically not. When the event space or log space fills up one embodiment will delete the oldest logged event each logged event will have a time date stamp as well as other needed information such as length providing space to record the new event. In this embodiment the most recent events will thus be found in the log space regardless of their relative importance. Further provided is the capability to read the stored logs for event review.

In accordance with one embodiment meter manager manages the various meters embodied in the game kernel . This includes the accounting information for the game machine and game play. There are hard meters counters and soft meters the soft meters may be stored in non volatile storage such as non volatile battery backed RAM to prevent loss. Further a backup copy of the soft meters may be stored in a separate non volatile storage such as EEPROM. In one embodiment meter manager receives its initialization data for the meters during start up from configuration manager . While running the cash in and cash out managers call the meter manager s update functions to update the meters. Meter manager will on occasion create backup copies of the soft meters by storing the soft meters readings in EEPROM. This is accomplished by calling and using EEPROM manager .

In accordance with still other embodiments progressive manager manages progressive games playable from the game machine. Event manager is generic like log manager and is used to manage various gaming machine events. Focus manager correlates which process has control of various focus items. Tilt manager is an object that receives a list of errors if any from configuration manager at initialization and during game play from processes managers drivers etc. that may generate errors. Random number generator manager is provided to allow easy programming access to a random number generator RNG as a RNG is required in virtually all casino style gambling games. RNG manager includes the capability of using multiple seeds.

In accordance with one or more embodiments a credit manager object not shown manages the current state of credits cash value or cash equivalent in the game machine including any available winnings and further provides denomination conversion services. Cash out manager has the responsibility of configuring and managing monetary output devices. During initialization cash out manager using data from configuration manager sets the cash out devices correctly and selects any selectable cash out denominations. During play a game application may post a cash out event through the event manager the same way all events are handled and using a call back posted by cash out manager cash out manager is informed of the event. Cash out manager updates the credit object updates its state in non volatile memory and sends an appropriate control message to the device manager that corresponds to the dispensing device. As the device dispenses dispensable media there will typically be event messages being sent back and forth between the device and cash out manager until the dispensing finishes after which cash out manager having updated the credit manager and any other game state such as some associated with meter manager that needs to be updated for this set of actions sends a cash out completion event to event manager and to the game application thereby. Cash in manager functions similarly to cash out manager only controlling interfacing with and taking care of actions associated with cashing in events cash in devices and associated meters and crediting.

In a further example in accordance with one or more embodiments I O server may write data to the gaming machine EEPROM memory which is located in the gaming machine cabinet and holds meter storage that must be kept even in the event of power failure. Game manager calls the I O library functions to write data to the EEPROM. The I O server receives the request and starts a low priority EEPROM thread within I O server to write the data. This thread uses a sequence of 8 bit command and data writes to the EEPROM device to write the appropriate data in the proper location within the device. Any errors detected will be sent as IPC messages to game manager . All of this processing is asynchronous.

In accordance with one embodiment button module within I O server polls or is sent the state of buttons every 2 ms. These inputs are debounced by keeping a history of input samples. Certain sequences of samples are required to detect a button was pressed in which case the I O server sends an inter process communication event to game manager that a button was pressed or released. In some embodiments the gaming machine may have intelligent distributed I O which debounces the buttons in which case button module may be able to communicate with the remote intelligent button processor to get the button events and simply relay them to game manager via IPC messages. In still another embodiment the I O library may be used for pay out requests from the game application. For example hopper module must start the hopper motor constantly monitor the coin sensing lines of the hopper debounce them and send an IPC message to the game manager when each coin is paid.
