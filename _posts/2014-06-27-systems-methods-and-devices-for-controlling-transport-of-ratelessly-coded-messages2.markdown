title: Systems, methods, and devices for controlling transport of ratelessly coded messages
abstract: Systems, methods, and devices for controlling transport of ratelessly coded messages are disclosed herein. User equipment (UE) may be configured to receive a data object using a plurality of radios having distinct radio protocols. The data object may divided into a plurality of segments, and the segments may be encoded with a random linear network code before transmission. The random linear network code may permit the UE to reassemble each segment from any large enough set of encoded packets. The UE may use delivery control messages with very low overhead to control the flow of packets for each radio. The UE may control the number of packets received for each segment without specifying which particular packets should be sent. The transmitters may transmit the packets with very little overhead, and encoding information for the packets may be included in the packets in a compact form.

This application claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 909 938 filed Nov. 27 2013 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

The present disclosure relates to a protocol for controlling transport of ratelessly coded messages and to a protocol for encoding messages.

Wireless mobile communication technology uses various standards and protocols to transmit data between a base station and a wireless communication device. Wireless communication system standards and protocols can include for example the 3rd Generation Partnership Project 3GPP long term evolution LTE the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE 802.16 standard which is commonly known to industry groups as worldwide interoperability for microwave access WiMAX and the IEEE 802.11 standard which is commonly known to industry groups as Wi Fi. In 3GPP radio access networks RANs in LTE systems a base station may include Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network E UTRAN Node Bs also commonly denoted as evolved Node Bs enhanced Node Bs eNodeBs or eNBs and or Radio Network Controllers RNCs in an E UTRAN which communicate with a wireless communication device known as user equipment UE . An evolved packet core EPC may communicatively couple the E UTRAN to an external network such as the Internet. LTE networks include radio access technology and core radio network architecture that provide high data rate low latency packet optimization and improved system capacity and coverage. In LTE networks an E UTRAN may include a plurality of eNodeBs and may communicate with a plurality of UEs.

UEs may be communicatively coupled to the Internet via a plurality of radios and each radio may be using a distinct radio protocol. For example a UE may be simultaneously connected to the Internet via the E UTRAN according to the LTE protocol and via a Wi Fi base station according to the 802.11 protocol. In alternate embodiments the UE may be coupled by one or more wired connections. The UE may be able to stream data from a source server using the plurality of radios which may allow for faster downloading than if the radios were used separately. Traditionally the UE would have to coordinate which packets were received by each radio to prevent duplicate packets being received. The UE may be required to use significant processing and communication overhead to track which packets were received and to delegate not yet received packets among the radios.

A linear network code may be used to encode packets prior to transmission to the UE. The linear network code may be a random linear network code a fountain code and or the like. A random linear network code may allow a segment of data to be decoded from any large enough set of received packets without the particular packets received and or lost being important. Encoding the packets prior to transmission to each radio of the UE may obviate the need to coordinate which packets are transmitted. As long as each transmitter is sending distinct packets the UE only needs to ensure that it received enough packets to decode the data segment. Thus the UE may save processing and or communication resources if the transmitters use random linear network codes. Initial seeds used by each transmitter for the random linear network code may be determined randomly to attempt to avoid the transmission of identical packets.

The UE may use a lightweight protocol for controlling transmission of packets by the transmitters. The lightweight protocol may include only three types of messages from transmission from the UE to the transmitters transmission control messages semi termination messages e.g. segment completion messages and termination messages e.g. connection termination messages . The UE may transmit transmission control messages to each transmitter to instruct the transmitters as to what should be transmitted. For example a transmission control message may indicate the maximum number of packets that should be sent from which segment the packets should be derived how the packets should be encoded a sequence number identifying the order in which the transmission control messages were transmitted and or the like. The sequence number can be generated with the status of the decoder in the receiver. By specifying in advance the maximum number of packets the UE may avoid having large numbers of packets en route when it decides that no more packets are needed and may thus reduce bandwidth usage. The transmitters may be able to send packets from more than one segment at the same time. Accordingly the UE may send a plurality of transmission control messages that specify a plurality of segments from which packets should be derived. Different transmitters may send packets derived from different segments and or derived from the same segments.

Once the UE has received sufficient packets to decode a segment it may send a semi termination message indicating that no additional packets derived from that segment should be transmitted. For example a transmitter may not have reached the maximum number of packets specified in the transmission control message when the UE is able to decode the segment so the UE may send the semi termination message to prevent the transmitter from using additional resources by continuing to transmit packets until the maximum number is reached. The transmitter may continue transmitting packets for any other segments when the semi termination message is received. If the UE is unable to decode the segment but all transmitters have reached the maximum number of packets to be transmitted the UE may send one or more additional transmission control messages to the transmitter s . Based on the sequence numbers of the transmission control messages the transmitter s may determine the most recent transmission control message and thereby resolve conflicts between multiple received messages. Accordingly the UE may also be able to send transmission control messages even before the transmitters have transmitted the maximum number previously specified.

When the UE is able to decode all segments and or no longer wishes to receive packets from a transmitter the UE may transmit a termination message. The transmitter may cease transmission of all packets from any of the segments in response to the termination message. Because the UE sends a limited number of feedback messages and each feedback message includes few parameters the processing and communication overhead of the UE may be reduced. For example the UE does not need to send an acknowledgement for every packet received or even any packet received so the overhead will be much lower than in schemes where acknowledgements are required. In some embodiments only two to three response packets per transmitter will be needed for each segment decoded.

The transmitters may also require little overhead for their transmissions to the UE. At least one transmitter may initially transmit an indication of the size of a data object to be transmitted e.g. a data file a streaming file etc. . The transmitters may be configured to break the data object up into a plurality of segments and each segment into a plurality of source blocks. The source blocks may equal the size of the payload for the packets in some embodiments. The segment and or source block size may be predetermined so the UE may be able to compute the number of segments the size of a last segment the size of a last source block and or the like from the size of the data object. Accordingly little other information may need to be sent for the UE to begin determining which segments to request.

Each packet sent by the transmitters may include a segment index indicative of a segment from which the packet was derived. The UE may use the segment index to determine which segment each packet should be associated with for decoding. In an embodiment the segment index may be only two bytes. Each packet may also include an encoding indicator indicative of the parameters used with the random linear network code to encode the packet payload from the segment. For example the encoding indicator may be used to determine an initial seed for a pseudorandom number generator. The pseudorandom number generator may generate one or more pseudorandom numbers for the payload of each packet and one or more encoding coefficients for each payload may be derived from the corresponding pseudorandom number s . The encoding indicators may be randomly selected by the UE and or by each transmitter so that the transmitters are unlikely to have identical encoding coefficients for their transmitted packets. The packets may not require further overhead for successful transmission and decoding of packets.

In an embodiment the pseudorandom number generator may compute pseudorandom numbers according to the equation 4 1 0 1 1 where xis a next pseudorandom number and xis a previous pseudorandom number. The initial seed for the pseudorandom number generator may be computed from the encoding indicator according to the equation 

The UE may decode a segment by resolving a decoding matrix. Each element of the decoding matrix may be calculated based on the pseudorandom number generator. In an embodiment for segments other than the last segment the decoding matrix may be of size 256 256. For the last segment each row vector may include the same number of elements as the number of source blocks in the last segment. The recovered segment with the lowest index should be delivered to the destination operating system persistent storage device application and or the like.

The transmitters may deliver packets encoded by a random linear network code to the UE using a protocol with low overhead. In an embodiment the source server may deliver the data object and or portions of the data object to the transmitters . The transmitters may control encoding of segments for delivery to the UE . The transmitters may determine which and how many packets to transmit based on the feedback received from the UE . Alternatively or in addition the source server may encode the packets and may determine which packets to transmit based on the feedback from the UE .

The receive buffer may include buffers for each segment being received from the transmitters and or for already decoded segments. The receive buffer may monitor how many packets have been received and how many more will be needed to decode the segment. The receive buffer may also include codecs for decoding each segment. The receive buffer may determine the codecs based on the encoding indicators received from the transmitters. When the receive buffer has received enough packets for a particular segment it may decode the segment. For example the receive buffer may attempt to decode the segment when a predetermined number of packets have been received. If decoding fails the receive buffer may wait for and or request additional packets and try again. Alternatively or in addition the receive buffer may perform whatever decoding is possible each time a new packet is received.

The receive buffer may decode the segment by resolving a matrix for the segment. Each element in the decoding matrix may be calculated by the receive buffer based on the pseudorandom numbers generated from the encoding indicators. Once a segment has been decoded or the entire data object has been decoded the receive buffer may use a local communication interface to provide the segment and or data object to an operating system persistent storage device application and or. In an embodiment the receive buffer may deliver a recovered segment with a lowest index during decoding.

The transmit buffer may be responsible buffering and encoding the segments for delivery to the UE. The transmit buffer may receive the data object to be transferred via a local communication interface . The transmit buffer may divide the data object into a plurality of segments and may store each segment or each segment currently being transmitted in its own buffer . The transmit buffer may determine a codec for each buffer for encoding the segment. The transmit buffer may encode the segments using the codec for that segment. The transmit buffer may determine how many encoded packets to generate based on instructions received from the state machine . The transmit buffer may have the buffered segments ready for additional encoding until a semi termination message is received.

The encoding indicator may allow the receiver to determine one or more encoding coefficients used to encode the payload in each packet. In an embodiment the encoding indicator may be randomly selected by each transmitter for each packet being transmitted. The encoding indicator may be used to determine an initial seed for a pseudorandom number generator for example according to equation 2. From the initial seed a plurality of pseudorandom numbers may be generated for example according to equation 1. The pseudorandom numbers may be used to compute encoding coefficients for example according to equation 3. As long as the transmitters and the UE use the same equations the encoding coefficients can all be derived from just the encoding indicator. Thus the transmitters and receiver may use the same encoding coefficient for encoding and decoding but in the illustrated embodiment only two bytes are needed to convey all the encoding coefficients. In alternate embodiments the encoding indicator may comprise more or fewer bits.

The encoded payload may be computed from the segment based on the encoding coefficients. In the illustrated embodiment the encoded payload is the same size as the source blocks. In other embodiments the encoded payload and or the entire packet may include additional error correction bits and thus may be larger than the source blocks. The packet may be encapsulated in packets containing additional fields by lower layer protocols. The packet may otherwise not require any fields other than the ones illustrated. Accordingly the packet may include very little overhead and thus may maximize communication resources during transmission of the packet .

Once the segment parameters are determined a transmission control message for a first segment may be transmitted to a transmitter. The transmission control message may indicate inter alia a maximum number of packets that should be transmitted the segment for which the packets should be transmitted and or the like. Additional transmission control message for the first segment may be transmitted to other transmitters as well. Encoded packets derived from the first segment may be received in response to the transmission control message.

If the transmitter and or the receiver have the capacity to transmit receive packets from additional segments a transmission control message for a second segment may be transmitted to the transmitter. Additional transmission control messages may also or instead be sent to the other transmitters as well. The transmission control message may indicate that packets derived from the second segment should be sent and may indicate a maximum number of packets that should be sent. Encoded packets from the first and second segments may continue to be received.

The transmitter may reach the maximum number of packets for the first segment and so may stop transmitting packets. However there may not have been enough packets received to decode the first segment. Accordingly another transmission control message for the first segment may be transmitted to the transmitter. The transmission control message may again indicate a maximum number of packets to be transmitted . For example the number of packets believed necessary for successful decoding may be indicated.

A sufficient number of packets to decode the second segment may be received. A semi termination message for the second segment may be transmitted to the transmitter. The semi termination may be understood by the transmitter to indicate that no additional packets are needed for the second segment. In some embodiments the method may additionally include determining that the second segment is able to be decoded before the semi termination message is transmitted. The second segment may then be decoded from the encoded packets that have been received.

A sufficient number of packets may be received to decode the first segment. Additionally all segments may have been received no more segments may be needed from this transmitter and or the transfer may have been aborted. A termination message may be transmitted to the transmitter. The termination message be understood by the transmitter to indicate that no more packets are needed for any segment. In some embodiments the method may additionally include determining that the first segment is able to be decoded and or that no additional packets are needed before the termination message is transmitted. The first segment may be decoded from the received packets and the decoded first and second segments may be provided to operating system persistent storage device application and or the like. The decoded segments may be provided all at once and or as they are decoded.

Based on the transmission control message a segment may be selected and an encoding indicator for a packet derived from the segment may be determined . The encoding indicator may be determined by randomly selecting a number between for example 0 and 65535 inclusive. Source blocks from the data object may be encoded into packets. The source blocks may be derived from the segment specified in the transmission control message. Encoding coefficients for the source blocks may be determined from the encoding indicator. For example the encoding indicator may be used to determine an initial seed for a pseudorandom number generator. The pseudorandom number generator may produce a plurality of pseudorandom numbers from which a corresponding plurality of encoding coefficients may be derived. A predetermined number of encoding coefficients may be used to encode each the payload for each packet. The encoded packet may be transmitted to the UE. The encoded packet may include a segment index an encoding indicator an encoded payload and or the like. Additional encoding indicators may be determined additional packets encoded and additional packets transmitted until the maximum number of packets have been transmitted and or a semi termination or termination message has been received.

The maximum number of packets for the segment may be transmitted but the UE may need additional packets to decode the segment. Accordingly an additional transmission control message may be received from the UE. The additional transmission control message may specify the number of additional packets that the UE would like transmitted e.g. the number of additional packets the UE will need transmitted in order to decode the segment . In response an additional packet may be encoded from the source blocks which may include selecting an additional encoding indicator for the additional packet. The additional encoded packet may be transmitted to the UE. Additional packets may continue to be encoded and transmitted to the UE until the maximum number of additional packets have been transmitted and or a semi termination or termination message has been received.

In the illustrated embodiment the UE may receive enough packets to decode the segment before the maximum number of additional packets have been transmitted. Accordingly a semi termination message may be received from the UE. The semi termination may indicate that no more packets are needed to decode the segment. In response transmission of encoded data blocks may be ceased even if the maximum number of additional packets have not been transmitted. In some embodiments the UE may transmit semi termination messages even if the maximum number of additional packets have been transmitted for example so a transmission buffer can be cleared of unnecessary segments and or codecs. If additional segments are being encoded and transmitted the transmission of those segments may continue even though transmission of the packet specified in the semi termination message has been stopped.

A termination message may eventually be received from the UE. The termination message may indicate that transmission of all segments should be stopped. In response transmission of all segments may be stopped and in some embodiments the connection with the UE may be ended . Any remaining segments and or codecs in the transmission buffer may be removed and or the data object be deleted. Alternatively or in addition the data object and or some segments and or codecs may be maintained for delivery to other UEs.
