The present application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 911 972 filed Dec. 4 2013 and entitled Automatic Delivery Channel Determination which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The specification relates to delivering messages to users that are open to interactions. In particular the specification relates to delivering messages via a channel based on a time and a context of the message.

Users of social networks can be notified in many different ways. For example users can receive text messages electronic messages updates within the social network etc. These notifications can easily become overwhelming especially for users that are connected to more than a few other users. Current technology allows users to configure preferences to notify the user about certain types of updates. For example a user can specify a preference for receiving an update when another user mentions the user in a post. However these preferences are often too broad to be useful.

In some embodiments the specification describes a computer implemented method comprising determining habits of a user to identify when the use is available for interactions determining a group of contexts for activities that the user performs when the user is available for interactions categorizing user consumption of information as being a channel including push queue or pull identifying a first context and a time of a message and providing the message to the user based on the time corresponding to the user s habits the first context corresponding to one of the contexts in the group of contexts and the channel.

In some embodiments the specification describes a system comprising one or more processors and a memory storing instructions that when executed by the one or more processors cause the system to determine habits of a user to identify when the user is available for interactions determine a group of contexts for activities the user performs when the user is available for interactions categorize user consumption of information as being a channel including push queue or pull identifying a first context and a time of a message and provide the message to the user based on the time corresponding to the user s habits the first context corresponding to one of the contexts in the group of contexts and the channel.

In some embodiments the operations further include receiving a search query from the user that includes search terms corresponding to the first context generating search results including the message and providing the search results including the message to the user. The operations further include determining which channels the user prefers to use and wherein providing the message to the user is based on which channels the user prefers to use. The operations further include responsive to providing the message to the user receiving feedback from the user that the user dislikes receiving notifications from one of the channels and modifying settings based on the feedback.

In some embodiments the features further include the push channel comprising notifications from an application that alerts a user device associated with the user the queue channel comprising notifications from an application that creates a list of notifications for the user to review when the user accesses the application the pull channel notifying the user about the message responsive to the user requesting information with the first context the user being a first user a second user is connected to the first user in a social network and the message including a request from the second user for the first user to join the second user in performing one of the activities and the user being a first user a second user is connected to the first user in a social network and the message including information about one of the activities performed by the second user.

The specification describes a channel application delivering messages from a sender to one or more recipients through a proper channel and at an appropriate time which advantageously optimizes the interaction between the sender and the one or more recipients. The channel application determines a real time context associated with the recipient an importance of the message to a context relating to the activity that the recipient finds interesting and delivers the message to the recipient through a channel and time that best matches the real time context of the recipient and the importance of the message.

The specification describes a channel application for delivering a message to a user via a channel based on a time of delivery and a context of the message. The channel application determines habits of a user to identify when the user is available for interactions. For example a user may take short breaks throughout the day or the user may spend three hours a night participating in social activities. The channel application determines a group of contexts for activities when the user is available for interactions. For example the user participates in viewing of photographs commenting on posts gaming and participating in multi user communication sessions about show dogs. The channel application combines the habits and group of contexts to determine when the user is available for interactions with a specific context. For example the user may be interested in reading posts on a social network but may be uninterested in gaming unless it is Saturday afternoon.

The channel application categorizes user consumption of information as being push queue or pull. A push channel comprises notifications from an application that alert a user device associated with the user. For example texts that buzz on a user s mobile device when the user receives a message are one type of notification received on a push channel. A queue channel comprises notifications from an application that creates a list of notifications for the user to review when the user accesses the application. For example an email application can be considered a queue channel as long as receiving electronic mail does not cause a mobile device to chime when the electronic mail is delivered. A pull channel notifies the user about the message responsive to the user requesting information that corresponds to a message. For example the user is generally uninterested in a friend s post about a steak restaurant unless the user is searching for information about steak restaurants.

The channel application identifies a first context and a time of a message. The channel application provides the message to the user based on the time corresponding to the user s habits the first context corresponding to one of the contexts in the group of contexts and the channel. For example when the user is in a time when he is open to interactions and wants to look at photos the channel application sends the user text messages about new photos posted to the social network. In some embodiments the channel application will also modify the deliver based on the user s preferences. For example if the user generally finds the push channel to be annoying the channel application transmits messages via the queue channel unless the notification is important such as if the user is close to a bar where the user s friend just checked in. In another example the notification settings could be overridden for an exceptional situation such as a health emergency notification from a medical application.

The network may be a conventional type network wired or wireless and may have any number of configurations for example a star configuration token ring configuration or other configurations known to those skilled in the art. Furthermore the network may comprise a local area network LAN a wide area network WAN e.g. the Internet and or any other interconnected data path across which multiple devices may communicate. In some embodiments the network may be a peer to peer network. The network may also be coupled to or includes portions of a telecommunications network for sending data in a variety of different communication protocols. In some other embodiments the network includes Bluetooth communication networks or a cellular communications network for sending and receiving data for example via SMS MMS hypertext transfer protocol HTTP direct data connection WAP e mail etc. While only one network is illustrated persons with ordinary skill in the art will recognize that any number of networks may be coupled to the above mentioned entities.

In some embodiments a channel application may be operable on the social network server which is coupled to the network via signal line . The social network server can be a hardware server that includes a processor a memory and network communication capabilities. The social network server sends and receives data to and from one or more of the user devices and the third party server via the network . The social network server also includes a social network application not pictured that can be part of the channel application or a standalone application. A social network can be any type of social structure where the users are connected by a common feature. The common feature includes relationships connections e.g. friendship family work an interest etc. The common features are provided by one or more social networking systems such as those included in the architecture including explicitly defined relationships and relationships implied by social connections with other online users where the relationships form a social graph. In some examples the social graph can reflect a mapping of these users and how they are related. Furthermore it should be understood that the social network server may be representative of one social network and that there may be multiple social networks coupled to the network each having its own server application and social graph. For example a first social network may be more directed to business networking a second may be more directed to or centered on academics a third may be more directed to local business a fourth is directed to dating and others are of general interest or a specific focus.

In some embodiments a snippet can be stored on a third party server which is communicatively connected to the network via signal line . The third party server includes an application for generating a third party website not shown . The snippet can be code or routines configured to enable the software included in the third party server to communicate with the channel application so that the software can use the service provided by the channel application . For example the snippet communicates with the channel application to generate a send message icon or button for sending messages to social connections within a social network and to incorporate it within the third party website. The third party website can be based on specific services such as online multi player games fitness calorie counting reviews traveling etc. The users visiting the third party website or users authenticated through the social network server can send messages to their connections i.e. user recipients within their respective social networks about at least one aspect of the service offered by the third party website hosted by the third party website. For example an authenticated user sends messages such as invitations turn based notifications challenge notification etc. through a turn based multiplayer game website to recipients on the social network with whom the sender is connected. In some embodiments the snippet includes HyperText Markup Language code HTML code that can be configured to communicate with the channel application to exchange data information and or commands. In some other embodiments the snippet includes code from a group of C C Java CSS and PHP. Furthermore while only one snippet is shown in the third party server the third party server could include one or more snippets . Similarly while only one third party server is shown the system can include one or more third party servers .

In either of the embodiments the controller may be adapted for cooperation and communication with the processor and other components of the computing device via signal line .

In some embodiments the controller identifies the type of data being received and transmits the data to the appropriate engine or module of the channel application . For example the controller receives information from the social network server for rendering a user interface of the social network and transmits the information to the user interface engine . In another example the controller receives information from the third party server for rendering a user interface of an online service e.g. multi player game website review website etc. hosted by the third party server and transmits the information to the user interface engine . In some other embodiments the controller receives user inputs and user actions submitted by the user from the user device . The controller sends the user actions and the user inputs to the appropriate engine or module of the channel application . For example the controller receives a request query from the user device and forwards the request query to the search engine .

In some embodiments the controller receives information from other components of the channel application and transmits the information to the appropriate component in the system via the communication unit . For example the controller receives graphical data for generating a user interface displaying a message from the user interface engine . The controller transmits the graphical data associated with displaying the message to a display device not shown that is part of the user device . In another example the controller receives information including real time context data associated with a user recipient from the context engine .

In either of the embodiments the social network engine can be adapted for cooperation and communication with the processor the controller the user interface engine and other components of the channel application via signal line .

A social network can be a type of social structure where the relationships between the users are included in a social graph. In some embodiments the social graph includes a social affinity between users. For example when a first user follows a second user they have a first degree relationship. When the second user follows a third user that the first user does not follow the first user has a second degree relationship with the third user. The lower the degree of separation between users the more they share social affinity. In some embodiments social affinity is also a measure of how many people are connected between users. For example two users that are associated with the same five people could have a higher social affinity than two users that are both associated with only one person.

The social network engine manages the social network by handling registration of users publication of content e.g. posts comments photos links check ins etc. hosting multi user communication sessions managing of groups managing different sharing levels updating the social graph etc. The social network engine registers a user by receiving information such as a username and password and generates a user profile that is associated with the user and stored as part of the social graph. In one embodiment the user profile includes additional information about the user including interests e.g. soccer reading food subscriptions gaming etc. activities e.g. search history indications of approval posts comments multi player online gaming etc. work e.g. doctor engineer lawyer research scientist etc. education e.g. engineering medicine law business etc. and demographics e.g. age ethnicity location etc. etc. The social network engine stores the user profile in the storage device .

In some embodiments users are connected in the social network by being friends. For example users A and B can have reciprocal friendships with each other. In other embodiments the relationships can be single directional for example when user A chooses to followed updates posted by user B. If user B chooses to follow user A the relationship can be described as bi directional or multi directional. User B can choose to share updates with the public which results in user A being able to view the update or user B can share the updates with only people that user B follows. In some embodiments these relationships can be divided into groups on the social network based on context. Some areas of this disclosure refer to such groups as social groups. The groups can be used by the user to share information or send messages within the social network that is directed to that group. For example user A can create an acquaintance group of users that user A wants to view updates from but that user A does not know very well. In another example user A can create a group of students taking the same class e.g. a study group or people helpful for networking. In such examples user A can use the created group to share information with or send messages directly to the members of the group.

In some embodiments the social network engine receives a request including login information for authentication. For example the social network engine receives a login request including a username and password from a user for logging into a social network. The social network engine identifies the requesting user based on the login information associated with the login. In some other embodiments the social network engine communicates with the snippet stored in the third party server and authenticates the user logging into the third party website using the same credentials. For example a user logs into a gaming website using the same user credentials used for logging into the social network. In some embodiments the social network engine receives Application Programming Interface API requests generated by the snippet stored on the third party server . The API requests retrieve information about the user for e.g. profile photo and name and connect the user with his or her social connections on the social network. In some other embodiments the social network engine receives a message from the snippet on the third party server . The message is sent to specific recipients on the social network from a sender logged into the third party website. For example a sender is connected to the specific recipients on the social network and sends an in game message from a turn based multiplayer website. The social network engine transmits instructions to the user interface engine to generate a user interface that includes information associated with the message including a picture or a thumbnail a title and a body of the message.

In some embodiments the social network engine transmits messages received from a sender to the context engine . In some other embodiments the social network engine stores the messages in the storage device .

The habit engine can be software including routines for identifying habits of one or more users of a social network. In some embodiments the habit engine can be a set of instructions executable by the processor to provide the functionality described below for identifying habits of one or more users of a social network. In some other embodiments the habit engine can be stored in the memory of the computing device and can be accessible and executable by the processor . In either of the embodiments the habit engine can be adapted for cooperation and communication with the processor the social network engine the channel suggestion module and other components of the channel application via signal line .

In some embodiments the habit engine identifies habits of one or more users in day to day life. The one or more users can be recipients of a message e.g. status update restaurant review multi player game invitation etc. sent by a sender connected to the one or more users on the social network. In some embodiments the habit engine determines a time when and a location from where the user habitually checks to see new messages of the day. For example the user habitually checks new messages in the electronic mail inbox towards the end of the day at 6 PM in his or her home. In another example the user habitually logs into his or her social network profile to see new streams including messages after 9 PM in his or her home. In a different example the user habitually checks new text messages received on the mobile device within a short window of time ranging from one minute to 30 minutes while at work.

In some embodiments the habit engine determines a habit of a user based on a client device associated with the user. For example the habit engine determines that a user works between 9 00 am and 5 00 pm because the user is using a work computer during this time interval. The habit engine also determines that the user enjoys leisure time at home after 6 30 pm since the user s home computer is on.

In some embodiments the habit engine determines a habit of a user based on determining a location of a client device associated with the user. The habit engine determines a location of a client device based on an internet protocol IP address associated with the client device triangulation of signals from the client device a global positioning system GPS installed on the client device or an application used in the client device . For example the habit engine identifies that a user is working during 8 00 am 5 00 pm because an IP address of a computer associated with the user belongs to a company triangulating signals or GPS signals from a tablet associated with the user indicate that the user is in a work place or a cookie from a web browser on a computer associated with the user shows that the user is at work. In some other embodiments the habit engine determines a habit of a user based on a location history of a client device associated with the user. For example at the first time the habit engine receives a user login request from a computer identifies an IP address associated with the login request compares the IP address with a list of IP addresses determines that the IP address was assigned to a company and determines that the computer is a work computer. Later when the habit engine receives the same IP address the habit engine identifies that this IP address is associated with a work computer based on the location history and determines that the user is working.

In some embodiments the habit engine determines daily activities of the one or more users based on a combination of location and user device activities. For example the habit engine determines that the user works habitually every weekday between 9 and 5 PM based on the IP address associated with the user device and the online browsing activity on the user device indicating predominantly business related browsing. In another example the habit engine determines that the user habitually waits at a subway station between 5 PM and 5 30 PM based on the GPS coordinates associated with the user device . In a different example the user is at home after 7 PM based on the internet protocol address of the user device and online browsing activity indicating leisurely browsing of social networks micro blogs discussion forums etc.

In some embodiments the habit engine monitors consumption of information associated with the one or more users on the user device . The habit engine categorizes the user consumption of information as being on one or more channels. The one or more channels can include a push or interrupt channel b queue channel and c pull channel. An example of a push or interrupt channel of information consumption is text messaging on the mobile device and obtaining information through text messaging. An example of a queue channel of information consumption is electronic mail and obtaining information through electronic mail. Another example of a queue channel of user consumption is profile stream on a social network and obtaining information through the profile stream. An example of a pull channel of information consumption is through a search results page when the user seeks out a particular piece of information by searching for it.

In some embodiments the habit engine determines a channel that the one or more users most commonly prefer for obtaining information. For example the habit engine determines that a first user is responsive to a push channel of information exchange and so the first user s preference is for text messaging. In another example the habit engine determines that a second user is not responsive preferring to use the queue channel of information exchange and so the second user s preference is for electronic mail or a profile stream on a social network. In a third example the habit engine determines that a third user is passive preferring to pull information when needed and so the third user s preference is through search results page.

In some embodiments the habit engine transmits the data including determined habits and activities of the one or more users to the channel suggestion module . In some other embodiments the habit engine stores the data including habits and activities in the storage device .

The context engine can be software including routines for determining context for activities performed by users when the one or more users are available for interactions. In some embodiments the context engine can be a set of instructions executable by the processor to provide the functionality described below for determining context for activities of the one or more users. In some other embodiments the context engine can be stored in the memory of the computing device and can be accessible and executable by the processor . In either of the embodiments the context engine can be adapted for cooperation and communication with the processor the social network engine the channel suggestion module and other components of the channel application via signal line .

In some embodiments the context engine receives data including daily habits and activities associated with a user and determines a group of contexts relating to activities that the user finds interesting. The context engine therefore determines the user s appetite to engage during the available time periods. The user engages in interactions with his or her connections on the social network while participating in the activities that interest him or her. For example a first context relating to an activity that interests the user is eating or trying a certain type of dish such as steak sushi etc. In another example a second context relating to an activity that interests the user is participating in extreme sports such as sky diving skiing mountain biking etc. In yet another example a third context relating to an activity that the user enjoys is gaming on the social network such as turn based multiplayer online games etc. Examples of other contexts could include playing contact sports watching movies discussing books tracking trends in fashion learning new fitness routines etc.

In some embodiments the context engine ranks the group of contexts relating to the activities that a user finds interesting. The group of contexts is ranked based on how important the context relates to the activities and how much they matter to the user. For example the context engine determines a group of contexts relating to the activities that the user engages in such as playing soccer watching action movies eating sushi practicing yoga and reading autobiographies. The context engine ranks the group of contexts based on the number of times the user performed an activity relating to the context. For example the context engine ranks sushi as the highest context because the user checked in at a sushi restaurant posted an article about sushi approved of a picture of another user s sushi and purchased a sushi making kit. Conversely the context engine ranked yoga as the lowest context in the group of contexts because the user only performed one activity relating to the context.

In some embodiments the context engine determines a real time context associated with the one or more users that receive a message from a sender on the social network. For example the context engine determines that a first user is currently driving in Cupertino a second user is currently at work researching a work related topic online a third user is currently waiting at a subway metro reading news article online a fourth user is currently at home posting comments on a social network a fifth user is currently searching online for a steak house to have dinner at etc.

In some embodiments the context engine transmits the data including groups of context relating to activities determined for a user to the channel suggestion module . In some other embodiments the context engine transmits the data including real time context associated with the user to the channel suggestion module . In yet other embodiments the context engine stores the data including groups of context and real time context associated with the users in the storage device .

The channel suggestion module can be software including routines for determining a channel for forwarding a message to the one or more users from a sender. In some embodiments the channel suggestion module can be a set of instructions executable by the processor to provide the functionality described below for forwarding a message to the one or more users from a sender. In some other embodiments the channel suggestion module can be stored in the memory of the computing device and can be accessible and executable by the processor . In either of the embodiments the channel suggestion module can be adapted for cooperation and communication with the processor the social network engine habit engine the context engine and other components of the channel application via signal line .

In some embodiments the channel suggestion module receives daily habits and activities associated with the each one of the users recipients of a message from a sender from the habit engine . The channel suggestion module receives a group of contexts relating to activities for each one of the users from the context engine . In some other embodiments the channel suggestion module receives a real time context associated with each one of the users from the context engine .

In some embodiments the channel suggestion module receives a message sent by a sender from the social network engine . In some embodiments the channel suggestion module identifies a context and a time associated with the message. For example a sender sends a message from a turn based multi player online game to one or more users on the social network and challenges them to counter his or her move in the online game. The channel suggestion module identifies a context relating to playing online games with friends. In another example the sender sends a message reviewing a mountain bike to one or more users on the social network. The channel suggestion module identifies a context relating to liking and using mountain bikes. In yet another example the sender sends a message indicating number of calories spent exercising during a particular gym routine. The channel suggestion module identifies a context relating to working out and fitness regime.

In some embodiments the channel suggestion module determines whether the context of the message matches one from the group of contexts relating to activities that a user finds interesting. For example the channel suggestion module determines that a message about a game challenge matches a context relating to playing online games associated with the user. In another example if the message is a review of a steakhouse and it matches a context relating to liking steaks associated with the user. In yet another example if the message is a video of skydiving and it matches a context relating to liking extreme sports associated with the user.

In some embodiments the channel suggestion module determines an appropriate channel and time to deliver the message individually to each one of the users from the sender. The channel suggestion module determines an appropriate channel and time based on matching the context of the message with a group of contexts and a real time context associated with each one of the users. For example a first user lives in San Francisco. The first user is associated with a second user in the social network e.g. they are friends the first user placed the second user in a group they belong to the same community etc. . The second user lives in Denver but he generates a message about how he is in San Francisco for the day. The channel suggestion module selects a push channel for delivering the message because the message has a time sensitive nature.

In another example the message is a review of a steak house in Palo Alto posted by the sender at 1 PM. For a first user the channel suggestion module identifies that the review of the steak house matches a context relating to liking steaks associated with the first user and that the real time context of the first user is that he or she is in Cupertino. The channel suggestion module delivers the review through text messaging i.e. push channel to the first user. The text message is delivered to the first user right after the sender posts the review because the first user is currently within proximity to the steak restaurant.

For a second user the channel suggestion module identifies that the review matches a context relating to liking steaks for the second user. The real time context of the second user indicates that the second user is currently at work. As a result the channel suggestion module delivers the review through electronic mail i.e. the queue channel to the second user. The electronic mail is sent right after the sender posts the review or the electronic mail is sent when the second user habitually checks the inbox of the electronic mail at 7 PM. In another example the channel suggestion module delivers the review to the second user through the profile stream i.e. the queue channel on the social network when the second user habitually checks to see the profile stream.

For a third user the channel suggestion module identifies that the review does not match any context in the group of contexts associated with the third user because he or she is a vegetarian. In such a case the channel suggestion module uses a pull channel and provides the review to the search engine i.e. the pull channel so as to make it available to the third user when he or she does an online search for steak houses in the future.

In some embodiments the channel suggestion module determines how important the message is for each one of the users who are recipients of the message from the sender. The channel suggestion module determines an appropriate channel and time to deliver the message based on the importance of the message. For example consider the message as a game invitation on a multi player online game sent on the social network. For a first user the channel suggestion module receives the high ranking of the context of the game invitation in the group of contexts because the first user is an active gamer relating to the activities that the first user finds interesting. The channel suggestion module delivers the game invitation through text messaging i.e. the push channel to the first user. The text message is delivered to the first user right after the game invitation is issued by the sender. For a second user the channel suggestion module determines that the context of the game invitation is present on the group of contexts relating to the activities that the second user finds interesting but not as high as on the first user s group of contexts because the second user is a moderately active gamer . The channel suggestion module delivers the game invitation through electronic mail i.e. the queue channel to the second user. In one example the channel suggestion module delivers the game invitation through the profile stream notification on the social network of the second user. For a third user the channel suggestion module determines that the context of the game invitation does not match the group of contexts because the third user is an inactive gamer relating to the activities that the third user finds interesting. The channel suggestion module sends the invitation to the search engine i.e. pull channel so as to make it available to the third user when he or she does an online search for multi player games in the future.

In some embodiments the channel suggestion module identifies a channel that each one of the users receiving the message prefer from the data sent by the habit engine . The channel suggestion module determines a channel for delivering the message based on the channel preference associated with each one of the users. For example a first user is responsive to text messaging and prefers the push channel of information exchange so the channel suggestion module delivers the message from the sender through text messaging. In another example a second user is not responsive dislikes the push channel method of information exchange and rather prefers to receive message from the sender through the queue channel of information exchange so the channel suggestion module delivers the message through electronic mail or a profile stream of the second user on the social network. In yet another example a third user is passive and rather prefers to pull the message when needed through the pull channel method of information exchange so the channel suggestion module delivers the message through the search results page when the third user enters search terms relating to a context of the message sent by the sender. Because the pull method relies on the user entering search terms into a search engine that are similar to the message content in some embodiments the channel suggestion module can aggregate the messages that are relegated to the pull channel and notify the user of the messages via the push or queue channels. For example where the messages for the pull channel exceed a threshold e.g. 20 messages the channel suggestion module sends the user an email with a list of the messages.

In some embodiments the channel suggestion module stores the message intended for the recipients in the storage device . In some other embodiments the channels suggestion module sends the message to the user interface engine to generate a user interface for displaying the message and to the search engine to deliver the message to users through pull channel of information exchange.

The search engine can be software including routines for retrieving information based on a query input by a user. In some embodiments the search engine can be a set of instructions executable by the processor to provide the functionality described below for retrieving information. In some other embodiments the search engine can be stored in the memory of the computing device and can be accessible and executable by the processor . In either of the embodiments the search engine can be adapted for cooperation and communication with the processor the channel suggestion module and other components of the computing device via signal line . Persons of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the search engine can be stored on a separate server from the social network server for example a server that is dedicated to performing tasks for the search engine.

In some embodiments the search engine searches for information on World Wide Web and file transfer protocol FTP servers that correspond to a keyword identified in a query submitted by the user. In some embodiments the search engine searches queries submitted as audio or as an image query. For example the user speaks into a microphone on the user device and the audio is submitted to the search engine which includes a speech to text algorithm for converting the audio to text. The retrieved information is generally presented as a list of best matching results on a search engine results page corresponding to at least one identified keyword in the query and includes web pages images maps video and audio links.

In some embodiments the search engine receives a message intended for delivery to a user from the channel suggestion module . The search engine delivers the message responsive to the user searching for results relating to a context of the message sent by the sender. For example when the user inputs a search query for multi player online games the search engine retrieves a page of results including the game invitation message from a sender inviting the user to play a specific multi player game. In another example when the user who is a vegetarian searches for a steak house to plan a dinner party the search engine retrieves a page of results including a review of a steak house in Palo Alto that the sender shared with the user.

The user interface engine can be software including routines for generating graphical data for providing user interfaces to users. In some embodiments the user interface engine can be a set of instructions executable by the processor to provide the functionality described below for generating graphical data for providing user interfaces that includes messages from a sender. In some other embodiments the user interface engine can be stored in the memory of the computing device and is accessible and executable by the processor . In either of the embodiments the user interface engine can be adapted for cooperation and communication with the processor and other components of the channel application via signal line .

In some embodiments the user interface engine receives instructions from the social network engine to generate graphical data that depicts a user interface for displaying a message from a sender. The message includes a picture or a thumbnail a title and a body of the message. In some other embodiments the user interface engine generates graphical data for social network content based at least in part on instructions from the social network engine . For example the user interface engine generates graphical data for displaying a user profile photo name text messages videos etc. The user interface engine sends the graphical data to an application e.g. a browser in the user device via the communication unit causing the application to display the data in a user interface. The communication unit transmits the message using the channel determined by the channel suggestion module .

Turning now to one example of a graphical representation of a user interface for sending a message from a sender to one or more user recipients on a social network is illustrated. The user interface displays a web page for a game played by the user Sara . The user Sara is authenticated using the login credentials for the social network in order to play the game . The game is a turn based multi player game and the graphics of the game is displayed inside the game window . The user Sara chooses an action from either one of the Attack or Defend and confirms the action by clicking on the button Confirm Action button . The user Sara can send a message to her friends Bill Joe and Tim notifying them that she played her turn in the game . The user Sara sends them the message by clicking on the button Notify Opponents button . In some embodiments the user Sara can send a custom message to her friends on the social network relating to the game . In some other embodiments the user Sara can send an invitation to a friend to join the game .

The context engine determines a group of contexts for activities that the user performs when the user is available for interactions. For example a first context relating to an activity that interests the user is eating or trying a certain type of dish such as steak sushi etc. In another example a second context relating to an activity that interests the user is participating in extreme sports such as sky diving skiing mountain biking etc. with one or more friends. In yet another example a third context relating to an activity that the user enjoys is gaming on the social network such as turn based multiplayer online games etc. with one or more friends.

The habit engine categorizes user consumption of information as being a channel including push queue or pull. An example of a push or interrupt channel of information consumption is text messaging on the mobile device and obtaining information through text messaging. An example of a queue channel of information consumption is electronic mail and obtaining information through electronic mail. Another example of a queue channel of user consumption is a profile stream on a social network and obtaining information through the profile stream. An example of a pull channel of information consumption is through a search results web page when the user seeks out a particular piece of information by searching for it.

The channel suggestion module identifies a first context and a time of a message. For example a sender sends a message from a turn based multi player online game to one or more users on the social network and challenging them to counter his or her move in the online game. The channel suggestion module identifies a context relating to playing online games with friends. The channel suggestion module provides the message to the user based on the time corresponding to the user s habits the first context corresponding to one of the contexts in the group of contexts and the channel. For example if the message is a game invitation then it matches a context relating to playing online games associated with the user. The channel suggestion module delivers the game invitation through text messaging i.e. the push channel to the user.

The context engine determines a group of contexts for activities that the first user performs when the first user is available for interactions. An example of group of contexts determined for the first user could include playing contact sports watching movies discussing books tracking trends in fashion learning new fitness routines etc.

The habit engine categorizes user consumption of information as being a channel including push queue or pull and determines which channels the first user prefers to use. For example the habit engine determines that a first user is responsive to a push channel method of information exchange and so the first user s preference is text messaging. In another example the habit engine determines that the first user is not responsive preferring to use a queue channel of information exchange and so the first user s preference is electronic mail or a profile stream on a social network. In a third example the habit engine determines that the first user is passive preferring to pull information when needed and so the first user s preference is through a search results page.

The channel suggestion module identifies a first context and a first time of a message associated with a second user the second user being connected to the first user in a social network. In one example the second user sends a message reviewing a steak house at Palo Alto and rating their beef steak to the first user on the social network. The channel suggestion module identifies a context relating to liking and eating steaks associated with the review.

The channel suggestion module determines based on the first time of the message the first context corresponding to one of the contexts of the group of contexts and the channel preferred by the first user a delivery channel for the message. For example the message including a review of a steakhouse matches a context relating to liking steaks associated with the review. The channel suggestion module provides the message to the first user via the delivery channel. For example the channel suggestion module identifies that the review matches a context relating to liking steaks for the first user. The real time context of the first user indicates that the first user is currently at work. In one example the channel suggestion module delivers the review through electronic mail i.e. the queue channel to the first user. In another example the channel suggestion module delivers the review through the profile stream i.e. the queue channel of the first user on the social network.
