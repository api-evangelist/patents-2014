The present invention generally relates to systems and methods for estimating wait time at lines or queues.

Public venues such as airports amusement parks and the like sometimes require customers to wait in line to receive services or for access to certain facilities. Operators of public venues may estimate and provide wait time information to customers such that customers may know how long the wait time is for a line or a queue. Typically operators of public venues may estimate the wait time for a line based on historical data and more recently crowd sourcing. However the wait time for a line depends of a plurality of factors that may change frequently based on specific situations. Further the conventional technique for estimating wait time may sometimes require customers input which may be cumbersome or inconvenient to the customers and or inaccurate. As such there is a need for a system or method that estimates the wait time of a line in real time and with accuracy.

Embodiments of the present disclosure and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure and not for purposes of limiting the same.

According to an embodiment a system or method is provided to estimate wait time at a line or a queue. In particular the system may estimate the wait time at a line by detecting the presence of a user in the line via Bluetooth Low Energy BLE communication. In an embodiment the system may detect when the user enters the line at a particular location of the line e.g. 50 feet from the end of the line and when the user departs from or reaches an end of the line via BLE beacons and may estimate the wait time at the line based on how long the user is in line and or a rate of progression through the line.

In an embodiment a distance between the user and the BLE beacon may be estimated based on a strength of the BLE signal received at the user s device or at the BLE beacon installed at one or more different locations in the line. The system may use the estimated distance to determine a length of the line or a wait time for the user.

In an embodiment a grid of multiple BLE beacons may be installed or provided at the location of the line to track the location and movement of a user. Based on the BLE signals detected at the user s mobile device the location of the user in the line may be determined by triangulation and by referencing the designated positions of the BLE beacons that emit the BLE signals. As such the system may determine how far the user is from the front of the line based on the location of the user. The system also may determine the speed the line is moving based on the movement of the user. Further the system may determine the wait time for the line based on the location and the movement of the user. In another example the locations and movements of two or more users may be used to estimate the wait time in the line.

In an embodiment the system may estimate a length of the line by detecting the location of the newest arriving user via the grid of BLE beacons. For example the presence and the location of the newest arriving user may be detected via the grid of BLE beacons. The location of the newest arriving user may then be used to determine the end of the line and to estimate the length of the line assuming that the newest arriving user stands at the end of the line.

In an embodiment the system may provide information regarding the wait time in the line to other users. For example the wait time information may be posted on a website or may be pushed via notification to other users. In another embodiment the system may provide estimated wait time to users who are currently waiting in line. In particular the system may estimate or calculate the wait time for a particular user based on the particular user s location in line and may send a notification about the wait time to the particular user s device in real time.

In an embodiment the system may detect a position of the user in line via Bluetooth beacons. The system may estimate the wait time for the user s position. For example the system may retrieve historical data such as wait time and or line speed from previous days or previous hours to estimate a current line speed. Thus the system may estimate the wait time for the user s current position in line.

In an embodiment the system may estimate and compare the wait times for multiple similar lines and may recommend a line with a shorter wait time to the user. For example there may be three different security check lines at the airport for entering the same terminal. The system may estimate the wait times for these three security check lines and may recommend one with the shortest wait time to the user. In an embodiment the system may recommend the security check line based on a user s flight time. For example users who need to hurry to their boarding gates may be directed to a security check line with the shortest wait time while users who have spare time may be directed to a security check line with longer wait time.

System may include a user device a merchant server and a payment provider server in communication over a network . Payment provider server may be maintained by a payment service provider such as PayPal Inc. of San Jose Calif. A user such as a sender or consumer utilizes user device to perform a transaction using payment provider server . User may utilize user device to initiate a payment transaction receive a transaction approval request or reply to the request. Note that transaction as used herein refers to any suitable action performed using the user device including payments transfer of information display of information etc. For example user may utilize user device to receive real time estimated wait times in a line. Although only one merchant server is shown a plurality of merchant servers may be utilized if the user is purchasing products or services from multiple merchants.

In some embodiments user device may download an application from payment provider server or from merchant server . The application may allow user to check the wait time of lines or queues at various merchants or public venues. User device may include a Bluetooth device configured to implement low energy Bluetooth communication. A network of low energy Bluetooth beacons may be installed at various line locations at various merchants or public venues. Thus the location and movements of user device at the line locations may be detected by the various Bluetooth beacons. The location and movement of user and or other users may be used to estimate the wait time at various locations in the lines.

User device merchant server and payment provider server may each include one or more processors memories and other appropriate components for executing instructions such as program code and or data stored on one or more computer readable mediums to implement the various applications data and steps described herein.

Applications may also include email texting voice and IM applications that allow user to send and receive emails calls and texts through network as well as applications that enable the user to communicate transfer information make payments and otherwise communicate and receive information for estimating or estimated line wait times as discussed herein. User device includes one or more user identifiers which may be implemented for example as operating system registry entries cookies associated with browser application identifiers associated with hardware of user device or other appropriate identifiers such as used for payment user device authentication. In one embodiment user identifier may be used by a payment service provider to associate user with a particular account maintained by the payment provider. A communications application with associated interfaces enables user device to communicate within system .

User device may include a Bluetooth device configured to implement low energy Bluetooth BLE communication. For example user device may detect various low energy Bluetooth signals from Bluetooth beacons installed in a merchant s store or at various public venues. Thus locations and movements of user device may be determined by positioning techniques such as triangulation or location fingerprinting.

Merchant server may be maintained for example by a merchant or seller offering various products and or services or by an operator of a public venue. The merchant may have a physical point of sale POS store front. The merchant may be a participating merchant who has a merchant account with the payment service provider. Merchant server may be used for POS or online purchases and transactions. Generally merchant server may be maintained by anyone or any entity that receives money which includes charities as well as banks and retailers or provides services and or items to a user.

Merchant server may include a database identifying available products including digital goods and or services e.g. collectively referred to as items which may be made available for viewing and purchase by user . Accordingly merchant server also may include a marketplace application which may be configured to serve information over network to browser of user device . In one embodiment user may interact with marketplace application through browser applications over network in order to view various products food items or services identified in database .

Merchant server also may include a checkout application which may be configured to facilitate the purchase by user of goods or services online or at a physical POS or store front. Checkout application may be configured to accept payment information from or on behalf of user through payment service provider server over network . For example checkout application may receive and process a payment confirmation from payment service provider server as well as transmit transaction information to the payment provider and receive information from the payment provider e.g. a transaction ID . Checkout application may be configured to receive payment via a plurality of payment methods including cash credit cards debit cards checks money orders or the like.

Merchant server may be connected to a network of Bluetooth beacons installed in the merchant s brick and mortar store or at the operator s public venue. The network of Bluetooth beacons may be installed at or near the line locations of the merchant s store or public venue to form a grid. Each Bluetooth beacon may emit a low energy Bluetooth signal in a specific frequency spectrum periodically. Thus the network of Bluetooth may allow detection of locations and movements of the consumer at different line locations.

Payment provider server may be maintained for example by an online payment service provider which may provide services between user and the operator of merchant server . In this regard payment provider server includes one or more payment applications which may be configured to interact with user device and or merchant server over network to facilitate the purchase of goods or services communicate display information and send payments by user of user device .

Payment provider server also maintains a plurality of user accounts each of which may include account information associated with consumers merchants and funding sources such as banks or credit card companies. For example account information may include private financial information of users of devices such as account numbers passwords device identifiers user names phone numbers credit card information bank information or other financial information which may be used to facilitate online transactions by user . Advantageously payment application may be configured to interact with merchant server on behalf of user during a transaction with checkout application to track and manage purchases made by users and which and when funding sources are used.

In some embodiments payment provider server may maintain a database including information regarding the line locations at respective merchant stores or public venues. The information regarding the line locations may be include floor layout of the merchant store or public venue location of the line shape size and or orientation of the line service or facility access associated with the line BLE beacons associated with the line historical wait times of different lines in different venues at different times of the day or year and the like. Payment provider server may periodically update the information regarding the line location. In an embodiment the payment provider server may detect and analyze the location and movement of users waiting in a line to estimate the wait time of the line.

A transaction processing application which may be part of payment application or separate may be configured to receive information from user device and or merchant server for processing and storage in a payment database . Transaction processing application may include one or more applications to process information from user for processing an order and payment and or determining rates of movement within a line as described herein. As such transaction processing application may store details of an order from individual users including funding source used credit options available etc. as well as line positions wait times and lengths. Payment application may be further configured to determine the existence of and to manage accounts for user as well as create new accounts if necessary.

At step user device or payment provider server may receive or access layouts of networks of beacons corresponding to the store layouts received in step . The beacon layouts may be merged with their corresponding store layouts such that the coordinate of each beacon in the beacon grid may be designated. For example a network of Bluetooth beacons may be installed in the merchant s store. Each Bluetooth beacon may be installed at a specific location in the merchant s store and may emit low energy Bluetooth signals. Thus a network or grid of Bluetooth beacons may be formed in the merchant s store.

As shown in as an example a Bluetooth beacon may be installed at a checkout counter . The Bluetooth beacon may be connected to merchant device . The Bluetooth beacon may emit a low energy Bluetooth signal with specific frequency spectrum. User may carry a user device including a Bluetooth device configured to communicate via low energy Bluetooth communication. When user enters the line location user device may detect Bluetooth beacons installed at the checkout counter . Thus the user may be detected when the user is standing in line via Bluetooth communication.

Returning back to at step user device or payment provider server may receive Bluetooth beacon specifications of various BLE beacons installed at respective line locations. Each Bluetooth beacon at the line location may emit a unique signal. A Bluetooth beacon database may be used to store profiles for each Bluetooth beacon. For example each Bluetooth beacon may have a profile containing the Bluetooth beacon s line location the unique signal signature of the beacon the signal strength of the beacon the broadcast range of the beacon and the like. In some embodiments a plurality of BLE beacons may be associated with a line location to provide better detection of the location and movement of users standing in line at the line location.

At step the system may set up wait time detection at each line location based on the locations the capabilities and the number of BLE beacons installed at the line location. In particular a wait time estimation scheme may be set up for each line location based on the availability and specification of BLE beacons installed at the line location. For example one BLE beacon may be installed at or near the front of a line. Thus the BLE beacon may detect the presence of users who are standing in line and who are in the broadcast range of the BLE beacon at the line location. The BLE beacon also may detect a relative distance of the users based on the strength of wireless signals received at the BLE beacon or at the respective user devices. As such the system may determine the wait time at the line based on how long the respective users are present at the line location. The BLE beacon may broadcast in a certain direction or in all directions. For example the BLE may broadcast toward an extending direction of the line. In another example multiple BLE beacons may be installed at the line location to provide more accurate detection of the locations and or movements of the users standing in line.

The wait time estimation scheme also may be set up for line location of various shapes sizes and lengths. For example a checkout line at a grocery store may be a relative short straight line. In another example a line for a ride at an amusement park may be a long line with a zig zagging shape. The wait time estimation scheme may take these factors into account to provide better wait time estimation. In long lines the GPS location of the users may be used in combination with BLE beacons to provide better wait time estimation.

The location of user device may be determined based on the Bluetooth signals received at user device using techniques such as triangulation or location fingerprinting. In the triangulation technique the location of user device may be determined based on the locations of three Bluetooth beacons and the distance of user device from the three Bluetooth beacons . The locations of the Bluetooth beacons may be predetermined when the Bluetooth beacons are installed at the line location. The distance between the Bluetooth beacons and user device may be determined based on the signal strength received between the Bluetooth beacons and user device . A stronger signal may indicate a shorter distance while a weaker signal may indicate a longer distance. Thus based on the Bluetooth signals between the Bluetooth beacons and user device the location of user device may be determined using the triangulation technique.

For example as shown in three Bluetooth beacons A B and C may each emit a unique Bluetooth signal. The signal range of each beacon may be illustrated as a circle of dashed line surrounding each beacon. As shown in user device may be located at a position at which user device receives signals from beacon B and beacon C but not beacon A. In particular user device receives signals with about the same signal strength from both beacons B and C. Thus user device is located between an area between beacons B and C but away from A. Further based on the signal strengths of the signals the distance between user device and beacons B and C may be determined. User device or payment provider server may analyze the signals and their signal strengths received at user device and reference the locations of the beacons that emit these signals to determine the location of user device by triangulation techniques.

In the location fingerprinting technique a database of signal fingerprints at various locations within the public venue may be predetermined. For example a signal profile may be predetermined for each location. The signal profile may include Bluetooth signals that are detected at that location and the strength of each of those detected Bluetooth signals. For example as shown in when user device is positioned at a certain position between beacons B and C a signal profile may be predetermined to indicate medium signals from beacons B and C and low or no signal from beacon A. A database of signal profiles associated with a plurality of respective locations on the shopping floor may be predetermined and stored. Thus based on a signal profile detected by user device a location of user device may be determined by referencing the database of signal profiles.

In some embodiments the signal profile may be the Bluetooth signal of user device received by respective Bluetooth beacons. For example as shown in when user device is positioned between beacons B and C a signal profile may be predetermined to indicate medium signals received by beacons B and C and weak or no signal received at beacon A. Thus the signal fingerprints may be signals received by user device or signals received by the respective Bluetooth beacons .

The location of user device may be determined by user device . For example user device may download a layout map of the merchant or the public venue and may determine user device s position based on the Bluetooth signals detected and the floor layout of the Bluetooth beacons . In some embodiments merchant device may determine the location of user device based on which Bluetooth beacons detect user device and the strength of the signal detected at the Bluetooth beacons . In some embodiments the detected signals and signal strengths may be forwarded to payment provider server and payment provider server may determine the location of user device.

Accordingly process may be used to set up wait time estimation for lines at various merchant stores or public venues. For example the line location floor layout number specification and locations of BLE beacons installed at the line location and other related information may be collected and used to estimate wait time at the line location. Thus based on the BLE communication set up at the line location the system may detect the presence location and or movement of users standing in line and may estimate the wait time at the line location in real time.

At step the presence of a user at a line location may be detected by one or more BLE beacons. One or more BLE beacons may be installed at a line location of a store or a public venue. The presence of the user may be detected by the BLE beacons when the user device receives and responds to the BLE beacons Bluetooth signals. For example a grid of BLE beacons may be positioned along different positions of an anticipated line such as from the front of a checkout terminal to the farthest distance the merchant expects a line to extend in whatever shape the line is expected to take. The BLE beacon may broadcast a Bluetooth signal in an extending direction of the line. When the user enters at the end of the line the Bluetooth signal from the BLE beacon may be received by use device which may respond with a Bluetooth signal back to the BLE beacon. Thus the system may detect that the user has entered the line location at a particular location of the merchant store.

In an embodiment a plurality of BLE beacons may be installed at the line location to provide more accurate detection of the location and movement of the users at or near the line location. The plurality of BLE beacons may allow the system to detect the user s location and movement within the line location. For example the BLE beacons may detect the presence of the user and where the user enters the line the movement and speed of the user in line when and or where the user reaches the front of the line and when and or where the user departs from the line location. The BLE beacons may also detect rates of movement within various locations in the line.

In an embodiment the system may distinguish users who are passing by the line location from users who are standing in line. In particular the BLE beacon may detect the presence of users who are passing by the line location but are not standing in line at the line location based on movement of users. For example a user moving quickly along a path of a line may be determined to be just passing by as opposed to a user stopping and starting at different intervals within the line. The system may determine that users who remain in the line location for a predetermined period of time as user who are standing in line. In another embodiment the system may detect the user s location and movement using a plurality of BLE beacons to determine whether the user is standing in line and whether the user is moving along with the line. In still another embodiment the system may ask the user to confirm whether he she is standing in line. For example when the user departs from the line location before the user reaches the front of the line the system may ask the user whether he she is giving up on waiting. This may also be determined automatically such as the system detecting users still in front of the user when the user moves away from the line. Users near the end of a long line may more likely leave the line due to a long perceived weight while those near the front of the line are less likely to leave since they have already spent time waiting and are close to the front. This data can be used to update wait times and line progression.

At step the system may analyze the user s presence location and or movement detected at the line location. For example the system may analyze when the user enters the line location and when the user departs from the line location. The system may analyze the location where the newest arriving user enters the line and the shape direction size of the line location to determine the length of the line. The system may analyze the presence locations and or movements of multiple users who are standing in line. The system may analyze the speed of the respective users moving through the line.

At step the system may determine the wait time at the line based on the collected location and or movement of users standing in line. In an embodiment the system may determine when the user arrives at the line location and when the user departs from the line location. The system may determine the difference in the arrival time and the departure time to estimate the wait time at the line as well as a rate of progression of the line using the length of the line as an additional data point. In some embodiments the system may use the arrival and departure times of a plurality of users to determine the different wait times of the respective users. The system may take an average of their wait times to estimate a general wait time of the line. In an embodiment the system may take the average of the wait times of the most recent users who waited in the line such as the average wait time of the last ten users who waited in the line.

In an embodiment the system may estimate the length of the line and the speed the line is moving to determine the wait time of the line. Because the length of the line and the speed of the line may change over time this method may provide a more accurate or more updated estimate of the wait time. For example the system may detect the location where the newest user arrives at the line to determine the end of the line. Based on the shape and the extending directions of the line the system may estimate the length of the line based on where the line ends. Because not all users carry a BLE enabled device this estimation may be implemented when the system detects that a new user with a BLE enabled device arrives at the line location.

The system also may determine the speed of the line based on the moving speed of one or more users who are standing in line. The speed of the line may be different for different sections of the line. Due to the length of the line the movement of users may propagate slowly from the front of the line to the end of the line with some lag. As such the speed of the line detected near the front of the line may be given more weight than the speed of the line detected near the end of the line. The wait time may then be determined based on the length of the line and the speed of the line. For example the wait time may be calculated by dividing the length of the line by the speed of the line. Because the length of the line and the speed of line may change frequently this method may allow the system to have a more updated length of line based on the location of the newest arriving user and the speed of the line detected in real time.

In an embodiment the system may determine the general wait time of the line for users who will be arriving at the end of the line. The general wait time may be broadcasted or published to other users at step . For example a display may be installed at the end of the line to inform newly arriving users of the expected wait time of the lien. In another example the general wait time may be published on a website such that other users may check the general wait time of the line via the internet.

In an embodiment the system may determine the wait time for a user who is standing in line based on the user s location in line. For example the user device may send the location of the user in the line to the system. In response the system may determine a wait time for the user based on the user s current location in line and may send the wait time to the user device . Thus the user may be standing in line and may receive continuous updates of the wait time as the user is moving through the line.

In an embodiment the system may determine a wait time for the user based on the user s current location and the estimated speed of the line. For example the current location of user in line may be detected via Bluetooth beacons installed at the line location. The speed of line may be estimated based on the movement of the user and or the movement of other users currently in line. In another embodiment the system may retrieve historical data of the speed of line from the previous days or previous hours. Based on the historical data a pattern of line speed at different hours days or months may be determined. Thus the speed of line may be estimated based on the current time day or month in view of the historical data. The system may then estimate the wait time for the user s location in line based on the estimated speed of line and the detected location of the user in line.

In an embodiment the system may estimate the wait times in multiple lines that provide similar access or service to the user . The system may recommend one of the multiple lines to the user based on their wait times. For example the system may recommend a line that has the shortest wait time for the user. In an embodiment the system also may recommend a line to the user based on the user s schedule. For example the user may have a flight time an appointment or other scheduled event on the user s schedule or calendar. The system may select a wait line for the user based on the user s scheduled event. For example the user may have a scheduled flight and may need to get through a security check line at an airport to get to the boarding gate. In this case the system may select a security check line based on the wait time at the line and the boarding time of the flight. If the user needs to hurry to get to the boarding gate the system may select the security line with the shortest waiting time. If the user has spare time to get to the boarding gate the system may select the security line with longer wait time such that the security line with shorter waiting time may be available to other users who are in a hurry. This information may be conveyed to merchant devices at the front of the line or an authorization may be displayed on the user device so that only those users with pressing time constraints are allowed to use the shorter or faster moving lines.

By using the above process the wait time of a line may be estimated based on presence locations and movement of users detected via Bluetooth communication. In particular the wait time of a line may be estimated based on how long users are in line the length of the line the moving speed of the line or the like.
