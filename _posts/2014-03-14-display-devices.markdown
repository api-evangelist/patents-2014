The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 800 611 filed Mar. 15 2013 which application is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Billboards and other large displays are an important component of most advertising portfolios. As with other real estate location is key. Most displays are configured to catch the eyes of viewers which can enhance the brands shown on the displays. In crowded display areas it is important to make a display distinctive to optimize the impact of the display.

In some examples the display devices incorporate lighting and movement. The lighting and movement are configured to catch a viewer s attention. This can enhance the impact of the brand shown on the display device.

Referring now to an example display device is shown. Generally the display device is mounted on the side of a building. In other examples the display device can be mounted to other structures such as a billboard structure or can be configured to be freestanding.

The display device includes a main display and a side display . The main display includes a top channel logo e.g. the stylized Coca Cola and a dynamic area .

The main display and the side display can include lighting to enhance the impact of the display device . For example as described further below the main display and the side display can include a plurality of elements that are lit. In addition the dynamic area includes a plurality of actuator assemblies that move.

For example as shown in and the display device includes a base structure upon which a plurality of modules are mounted. The base structure is mounted to the structure upon which the display device is mounted. The base structure provides structural integrity for each of the modules coupled thereto. The base structure also provides access to each of the modules for service and repair as described further below.

Each of the modules includes a plurality of actuator assemblies positioned therein. The use of individual modules allows the display device to be installed in an efficient manner since the modules can be moved and manipulated more easily than the entire display device . In this example the modules extend from the base structure a distance of approximately four feet although modules of different sizes can be used.

The example depicted shows that each of the modules includes a matrix of five rows of five actuator assemblies for a total of 25 actuator assemblies in each module . This configuration allows the actuator assemblies in each of the modules to function as a unit thereby addressing changes in the environment including stresses caused by the elements such as wind temperature etc. Because each of the modules functions as a unit such stresses are accommodated across the actuator assemblies .

In alternative designs the modules can include more or fewer actuator assemblies . In the depicted embodiment some of the actuator assemblies are nonmovable i.e. stationary in that the actuator assemblies remain in place and do not move like other actuator assemblies as described further below.

Referring now to the main display is shown as made up of a plurality of the modules . In this embodiment a height of the main display is 19.6 meters and a width is 12.25 meters although displays of other dimensions can be used. In this example there are approximately 1 960 actuator assemblies of which 1 715 are movable and 245 are nonmovable.

In this example the main display has a 12.5 millimeter LED pitch size see a pixel density of 6 400 pixels per square meter with a pixel configuration of 1R 1G and 1B per pixel. As describe more below the display has a large viewing angle 16 bit color processing depth and is controlled synchronously. Louvers tailored to the specific environment e.g. based upon the sun density at a particular latitude can be included to enhance the LED display during sunny conditions. The side display can be similarly configured.

For example shows four LED modules positioned adjacent to one another. The pitch does not vary between LED modules even with a provided gap as described further herein.

Referring now to each of the actuator assemblies is configured to move. Specifically each of the actuator assemblies includes a moving cube movingly mounted to a core . The moving cube is made of a plurality of aluminum extruded panels see positioned about a holding tube . The moving cube is configured to slide along the holding tube in directions .

The moving cube is moved by a linear actuator assembly in the directions in a plurality of extended positions. As depicted the actuator assembly is fully extended in the direction the actuator assembly is partially extended in the direction and the actuator assembly is fully retracted. In this example the moving cube moves approximately 20 inches when in the fully extended position as depicted by the actuator assembly

For example in the full retracted state shown in the actuator assembly has a length 362 of approximately 1 000 millimeters. In the full expanded state shown in the actuator assembly has a length 364 of approximately 1 500 millimeters. However other lengths could be used depending on the amount of movement required. For example the actuator assembly could be configured such that it extends more than about 20 inches or less than about 20 inches.

In this example the linear actuator assembly includes a driver with a servo motor. The servo motor is electrically controlled and moves the moving cube in the directions to any of a plurality of extended positions. The movement can be precisely controlled so that the position of the moving cube is known. For example in one embodiment control is as precise as 0.0079 inches with a position range of 1 to 29 000.

In this example the linear actuator assembly is a F12 BC made by W Robit of Taiwan. Such a linear actuator assembly can drive up to 44 pounds with a maximum drive speed of 40 inches per second. In another example a PAC UGT040D actuator made by PBC Linear of Roscoe Ill. is used. The motor of the linear actuator assembly is a BCH U04 Motor manufactured by Schneider Electric of Palatine Ill. The motor includes a LXM23A servo driver system and Modicon M258 logic controller both also manufactured by Schneider Electric. In still other examples the motor is a SM23165DT motor made by Moog Animatics of Santa Clara Calif.

A Light Emitting Diode LED module is mounted to each of the moving cubes . The LED module includes a plurality of LEDs such as an NSSM032T LED module made by Nichia Corporation of Japan. Such an LED module is a 3 in 1 SMD LED although other types can be used. In this example the LED module is 346 mm in height by 346 mm in width. The LED module is configured to provide a plurality of colors and each LED module on each of the actuator assemblies is individually controllable as described below.

In example embodiments the LED modules can be configured to display one or a plurality of colors. For example the LED modules can be configured to display text pictures or other effects. By grouping the LED module a larger effect such as a larger picture or text can be created on the main display .

In other embodiments LED modules could be placed on the sides e.g. mounted on panels and top and bottom of the moving cubes near the end of the moving cubes . In such an embodiment the light emitted from the LED modules placed on the side top and bottom of the moving cubes could be seen when looking at the display device from various angles. This embodiment for example would provide more continuous light when two adjacent moving cubes are positioned at different distances and the display is viewed from various angles.

In yet another alternative the brightness of the lights in the LED modules is configurable to create different appearances. For example the lights can be dimmed or otherwise dulled to form depth and other visual effects particularly around the edges of the display device .

A gap see is provided between each adjacent LED module . In one example this gap is four millimeters. This gap is small enough so that it is indiscernible from the viewing distance for the display device . Further the gap is an air gap so that any debris or other undesired materials does not get stuck between adjacent LED modules . Further the gap is configured to maintain the 12.5 millimeter pitch between adjacent LEDs .

In these examples the construction of the actuator assemblies allows for ease in access and maintenance. Specifically the way the actuator assemblies are coupled to the modules allows individual actuator assemblies to be removed individually from a rear of the display device . For example depicts the access of an actuator assembly from a rear of one of the modules . Further each of the actuator assemblies includes an access door see on the core that allows access to various components of the actuator assemblies from the rear during service.

Referring now to an alternative linear actuator assembly is shown. The actuator assembly is similar to the actuator assembly described above except that the linear actuator assembly is mounted to a side of the holding tube .

The display device may include various other features to obtain and hold the attention of individuals capable of viewing the display device. These features could be facilitated by an interactive module located on the display device or be operably connected to it. For example the interactive module may include or be operably connected to sensors such as microphones cameras motion detectors moisture sensors light sensors etc. Additional features may include speakers lasers or other devices capable of producing light shows which could also be used to attract and hold the attention of individuals. Such features could be operated separately or may be integrated with other sensors such that the display device choreographs its display depending on input from the various sensors of the interactive module . For example the interactive module can include speakers and lasers controlled by a computing device that can choreograph the various sensors speakers or lasers to make the display device more attractive and entertaining

In other examples sensors such as moisture sensors can be used to detect certain weather patterns. For example the sensors can be used to detect certain weather conditions in which operation of the actuator assemblies is not advisable icing conditions or extreme wind conditions specifically . In such scenarios the sensors detect the adverse weather conditions and stop movement of the actuator assemblies until such time as the detected weather state passes.

In other examples the interactive module is programmed to transmit sound e.g. music voice advertisements so that passers can tune to a particular radio frequency to listen on their radios. In yet other examples the interactive module can be programmed to communicate wirelessly e.g. through Bluetooth or via the Internet with viewers smartphones. In this example the viewer can access content such as a web site that allows the viewer to upload or otherwise stream content that can be displayed on the display device . Such content could be pictures etc.

In another example the interactive module could include microphones such that it could play live sound. Such microphones could be directionally focused such that they could focus in on a particular sound source. In this regard the display device could include software such that the display device could be interactive with those viewing the display device s advertisement based on any number of factors such as movement sound recognizing elements in its surroundings etc.

Referring now to an example system for controlling the display device is shown. In this example a computing device communicates with each of the actuator assemblies through a network . Specifically the computing device communicates through a router to a plurality of Ethernet to DMX converters which in turn communicate with the display device through a plurality of DMX splitters . Other configurations are possible.

In this example the computing device is a local or remote computing device such as a desktop laptop or tablet computer. The computing device can use a standard communication protocol such as DMX CANOPEN Ethernet or RS485 interface to control the display device .

The control by the computing device can include programming the movement of each of the actuator assemblies . In one example an application programming interface API is provided that assists in the programming of the movement of the actuator assemblies .

In one example the linear actuator assembly is controlled by the computing device according to a percentage of extension for the moving cube . For example the computing device defines a percentage such as 0 percent 10 percent 25 percent 50 percent 75 percent and or 100 percent for the moving cube at a given point in time. The logic controller of the linear actuator translates the percentage so that the motor of the linear actuator assembly moves the moving cube the desired amount. By defining a changing percentage over time the movement of the moving cube can be choreographed as desired.

In addition the computing device can define a color to be displayed by the LED module carried by the moving cube . The color can be changed to create the desired effect.

Since each of the actuator assemblies can be individually controlled separately the movement and color of each of the actuator assemblies can be controlled to create patterns or other visual effects for the display device .

For example the actuator assemblies in a certain area of the display can be extended and retracted in coordination to give the appearance of movement of the display device . In one such example the actuator assemblies are controlled to provide a wave like effect across the display device . In another example the control is randomized so that the actuator assemblies move in random patterns. Other configurations and patterns are possible.

By controlling the display device in this manner the overall visual impact of the display device is increased. Specified patterns can be used to further enhance the visual effect of the display device thereby catching the eye of a viewer.

In some examples the patterns are configured to make certain shapes and depictions. For example as shown in the actuator assemblies in the dynamic area are patterned to represent the shape of a Coca Cola bottle. To accomplish this each of the actuator assemblies is controlled to extend and or retract a certain distance to form the pattern of the bottle. An endless number of shapes and depictions can be created in this manner. In addition the shapes can be used to morph over time into a choreographed series of shapes.

For example the computing device can be programmed to create various shapes on the display device depending on the time of day as well as control the sequence of those shapes. The sequence can be choreographed or randomized as desired. For example in one embodiment the computing device can control the sign to depict fluid flowing out of a bottle to represent the flow of Coke from a Coca Cola bottle when it is drunk. Many other examples are possible.

In addition the computing device may also control other aspects of the display device such as microphones speakers cameras or other sensors such as motion detectors light sensors and moisture sensors. For example the computing device could be configured such that it controls cameras located on or near the display device such that it could display images or video a camera captures. The computing device may also control speakers located on or near the sign such that it can play music or other desired sounds such as sounds obtained by a microphone. Thus the display device would be able to play stored sound stream sound from the internet or also play live sound detected by the microphone.

In addition the computing device may be equipped with video recognition software such that for example the camera could recognize a passerby holding a can of Coca Cola and focus on and display that individual on the display . In addition the computing device may be configured or programed to play stored sounds at relevant times to communicate with for example the individual holding the can of Coca Cola being displayed on the display device by also controlling the speakers to project relevant sounds slogans or speech such as nice choice or enjoy that Coke. In this aspect of one example embodiment the computing device allows the sign to be interactive with those in its surroundings and drawing more attention to the display device .

The computing device may also control other sensors placed on the display such as for example motion detectors light sensors and moisture sensors. The display device may also include lasers that can be controlled by the computing device such that the display device can produce a laser light show. The computing device may also integrate one or more of the sensors or the information obtained therefrom speakers lasers etc. to work in combination to enhance the display device . In yet another example embodiment of the display the computing device could be connected to the Internet and obtain a variety of information and display it on the display such as weather news etc. Such sensors such as a light sensor could be used to adjust the brightness of the display device for example to adjust the brightness of the LEDs depending on the weather or time of day or night. Likewise the microphones could also be used to adjust the volume of the speakers to the appropriate level given the particular surroundings.

Referring now to an example process for controlling the display device is shown. Some of the operations in this process can be implemented for example by the computing device .

At operation three dimensional visualization software is used to author content for the display device . The software which is executed by the computing device or any other computing device not necessarily connected to the display device allows for the creation and or manipulation of video content that will be used to control the display device . The software optionally includes an emulator that depicts the display device to allow a user to author different content for the display device. One example of such content is an advertisement featuring a Coca Cola bottle. The advertisement can define the shape motion and color of the bottle to be depicted on the display device .

Next at operation the content is edited into video i.e. color and motion components. This is accomplished by extracting the video and motion components so that dual synchronized video files are formed. The first video file is for controlling the light display the LED modules and the second video file is for controlling the motion i.e. the moving cubes .

The first video file is transferred to operations whereat the LED modules of the display device are controlled. This includes controlling which of the LED modules are active and any content displayed on the LED modules. In this example the LED modules are controlled using the GigE protocol.

The second video file is transferred to operation whereat the motion file is interpreted and translated into the DMX protocol. This protocol is in turn used at operation to control movement of the moving cubes of the actuator assemblies by the servo motor.

By synchronizing the first and second video files the visual and motion components of the display device are synchronized to create the desired effects as defined by the author.

In these examples the computing device includes one or more processing units and computer readable media. Computer readable media includes physical memory such as volatile memory such as RAM non volatile memory such as ROM flash memory etc. or some combination thereof. Additionally the computing device can include mass storage removable and or non removable such as a magnetic or optical disks or tape. An operating system such as Linux or Windows and one or more application programs can be stored on the mass storage device. The computing device can include input devices such as a keyboard and mouse and output devices such as a monitor and printer .

The computing device also includes network connections to other devices computers networks servers etc. such as through the network . In example embodiments the computing device communicates with other components through one or more networks such as a local area network LAN a wide area network WAN the Internet or a combination thereof. Communications can be implemented using wired and or wireless technologies.

The display device is configured to be resistant to the forces of nature. For example the display device including the base structure and the modules is configured to withstand rain and wind as the display device is used outside during the different seasons. As noted herein in certain weather conditions certain functions of the display device can be suspended temporarily.

The various embodiments described above are provided by way of illustration only and should not be construed to limiting. Those skilled in the art will readily recognize various modifications and changes that may be made to the embodiments described above without departing from the true spirit and scope of the disclosure or the following claims.
