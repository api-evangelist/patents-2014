title: Systems and methods for drag-and-drop data binding
abstract: A data binding system facilitates binding of a data component to a feature of a software component. Prior to the binding, a graphical indication of the software component and a graphical indication of the feature of the software component are displayed. In addition, an indication of an element of the data component is displayed in a display area approximately adjacent to the displayed software component. The data binding system receives a user input command to bind the data component to the feature of the software component. The user input command may include dragging the indication of an element of the data component from the data component display area to the feature of the software component and subsequently dropping it on the feature. As a result, the data binding system automatically generates script or code that provides executable instructions to bind the feature of the software component to the data component.
