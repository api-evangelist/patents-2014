title: Dosage form to increase prasterone bioavailability
abstract: 

In contrast to the approach taught by the prior art, the instant approach is amenable to scale-up to commercial scale. Further, the resulting product is amenable to analysis using standard, known quantitative analytical techniques; thus, unlike the prior art approach, the instant approach may be used to manufacture a product in conformity with applicable regulatory standards.

This application is a divisional application of U.S. application Ser. No. 13 453 987 filed on 23 Apr. 2012 which claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 480 365 filed 28 Apr. 2011 and U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 480 404 filed 29 Apr. 2011 all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

Prasterone has the systematic name 3S 8R 9S 10R 13S 14S 3 hydroxy 10 13 dimethyl 3 4 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 dodecahydro 1H cyclopenta a phenan thren 17 2H one. This compound has the structure shown 

Prasterone is dimorphous. Both forms however are solid crystals at physiological temperatures melting point 140 41 for the needle form 152 53 for the leaflet form . Prasterone is poorly soluble in water 63.5 mg L water . Prasterone is relatively lipophilic having a log P octanol water 3.23. Prasterone is thus known in the art as poorly bioavailable.

One solution to this problem has been to simply administer large doses. For example Fernand LABRIE U.S. Pat. No. 5 728 688 teaches human clinical testing of daily doses of 1.6 grams per day see 4 66 et seq. LABRIE also teaches laboratory rat doses of 450 mg kg see 3 55 et seq. Given that the average American adult male weight is 86.6 kilograms and assuming an incorrect assumption that there is a 1 1 correspondence between human and rat dosing this implies a human dose of about 39 grams per day. Such large daily doses however may run the risk of precipitating undesired adverse side effects.

The literature is nonetheless quite sparse in teaching approaches to improve prasterone bioavailability. One approach has been to use non oral delivery routes. For example Fernand LABRIE U.S. Pat. No. 5 780 460 teaches percutaneous or transdermal administration using a variety of Gels solutions lotions creams ointments and transdermal patches. See e.g. Abstract see also e.g. Peter R. CASSON et al. 174 649 1996 .

Another approach pioneered by researchers in Italy employs alpha cyclodextrin to make a clathrate. For example Paolo CORVI MORA et al. 92 2177 2003 teaches improving the bioavailability of a type of dehydroepiandrosterone the authors unfortunately fail to specify which of the twenty dehydroepiandrosterones they investigated by high energy cogrinding with cyclodextrin combined with glycine biomaltodextrin polyvinyl pyrrolidone and or polyethylene glycol 400. This approach provided intriguing results. It has two critical failings however preventing its commercial use.

First the method requires grinding in a laboratory scale device a high energy vibrational micromill see p. 2178. This type of apparatus is not to my knowledge used by any manufacturer in the world to manufacture pharmaceutical clathrates on a commercial scale. Thus translating CORVI MORA 2003 to a commercial scale would require a significant amount of development and experimentation apparently entailing the design and purchase of custom micromilling machinery. Further there is no assurance that such an industrial scale process would be ultimately successful in making a composition with improved bioavailability.

Second CORVI MORA 2003 produces a material with a physical structure not amenable to structural analysis by known analytical methods. The resulting material for example appears to have no definite X ray diffraction fingerprint. Thus it is impossible to say whether the resulting material is in fact a clathrate or is simply an amorphous mixture of the respective components. This inability to clearly characterize the resulting composition because given the materials used the resulting material is likely not in fact a clathrate.

A clathrate is a complex of a donut shaped cyclodextrin with a lipophilic hole region which lipophilic hole region houses a lipophilic payload molecule. Dehydroepiandrosterones are lipophilic. Even the smallest of them however are simply too large to physically fit in the hydrophobic space present in cyclodextrin. The inability to quantitatively assay the resulting material to determine whether or not it is in fact a clathrate frustrates a potential manufacturer s ability to comply with applicable quality control regulations. Thus while CORVI MORA 2003 teaches a way apparently the only way to improve the bioavailability of an orally administered dehydroepiandrosterone it fails to provide the art with an industrial scale solution.

To address these shortcomings Paolo CORVI MORA PCT Publication WO 00 37109 2000 teaches at Example 11 to replace high energy vibrational micromilling with a more conventional approach to making clathrate complexes dissolving the dehydroepiandrosterone and alpha cyclodextrin in a solvent to make a solution and then removal of the solvent by spray drying or lyophilization . CORVI MORA 2000 however fails to say whether this approach makes a clathrate nor whether this approach increases or decreases dehydroepiandrosterone bioavailability.

The skilled artisan would infer that CORVI MORA 2000 does not increase dehydroepiandrosterone bioavailability for two reasons. First as mentioned above even the smallest of the various dehydroepiandrosterones is simply too large to physically fit in the hydrophobic space present in lpha cyclodextrin. Thus the skilled artisan would expect the approach taught by CORVI MORA 2000 dissolution and drying to result in a simple mixture of dehydroepiandrosterone and alpha cyclodextrin not a clathrate complex of dehydroepiandrosterone housed within the hydrophobic region of alpha cyclodextrin.

Second CORVI MORA 2000 was followed three years later by CORVI MORA 2003 . In the latter 2003 publication CORVI MORA et al. at page 2178 col. 1 note that dehydroepiandrosterone has low and variable bioavailability. The skilled artisan would thus read CORVI MORA 2003 to teach that CORVI MORA 2000 had not solved the problem of low and variable bioavailability. 

There thus remains a need for an industrial scale or commercial scale way to formulate prasterone 5 dehydroepiandrosterone to increase its bioavailability and decrease the variability of its bioavailability.

The instant invention provides a way to formulate prasterone to both increase its oral bioavailability and decrease the variability of its oral bioavailability. In contrast to the clathrate approach taught by the prior art the instant approach is amenable to scale up to commercial scale. Further the resulting product is amenable to analysis using standard known quantitative analytical techniques thus unlike the prior art approach the instant approach may be used to manufacture a product in conformity with applicable regulatory standards.

Micronization is important because it enables a higher ratio of durable liquid mass to prasterone mass. This is important to achieve the increase in bioavailability. Subsequent compression of micronized prasterone however will modify the particle size distribution of the micronized prasterone making the average particle size increase. Similarly storage over time will result in micronized particles of prasterone agglomerating into particles of larger size thus increasing the average particle size. Thus I believe it important to coat the micronized particles with a durable liquid vehicle. By durable I mean a liquid which is not entirely removed during formulation but which remains on the micronized prasterone particles.

Suitable examples include tocopherol fish oil safflower oil and olive oil I would expect each of these to inhibit particle agglomeration and thus preserve the particle size distribution of the micronized prasterone. Oils which have a relatively large proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids or polyunsaturated fatty acid glycerides may be particularly effective. Examples of such oils include linoleic acid linolenic acid both of which are common components of vegetable oils. Vegetable oils which have from 50 to 90 percent w w of polyunsaturated fatty acid glycerides include for example soyabean corn sunflower safflower and linseed oils. One may also use peanut oil albeit peanut oil has a lower total unsaturation value and peanut antigen is associated with peanut allergy so this type of oil while possible is not as preferred. Alternatively one may use fish oil or tocopherol for the opposite reason in addition to serving as the durable liquid vehicle the vehicle may confer cardiovascular benefits.

Alternatively the durable liquid vehicle could be a sterol any of a group of naturally occurring steroid alcohols typically derived from plants or animals. Sterols are waxy substances insoluble in water. Note that prasterone is itself a sterol a steroid alcohol years ago prasterone was synthesized from cholesterol thus when I say to mix prasterone with a sterol I intend to say to mix prasterone with a different sterol not to mix prasterone with prasterone. Note that certain a durable liquid vehicles could result in a eutectic mixture a mixture which solidifies at a lower temperature than the component durable liquid vehicle. While eutectic mixtures have their uses they may be problematic in manufacturing soft gelatin capsules because a eutectic mixture may prove difficult to handle requiring added heat to keep the mixture alone the eutectic temperature so the fill material remains liquid enough to flow in the softgel encapsulation machinery.

One may use a durable liquid vehicle system made of a polar solvent e.g. ethanol and non polar solvent e.g. palm oil together with a surfactant e.g. a fatty acid ester to render the polar and non polar phases miscible. While it is possible to use a durable liquid vehicle which is lipophobic I do not prefer it because I believe that using a relatively lipophilic vehicle will increase the bioavailability of the active ingredient viz using a relatively lipophobic vehicle.

While one should use enough of the durable liquid vehicle to inhibit particle agglomeration the precise amount is a matter of choice one may use just enough durable liquid vehicle to make a semi solid paste or enough to make a suspension or dispersion or a solution. One could use for example anywhere form 1 to 2 milliliters of durable liquid vehicle per gram of prasterone or about 1 liter of durable liquid vehicle for 2 kilograms of prasterone to make an adequate amount of fill for a commercially acceptable minimum manufacturing batch size of soft gelatin capsules of a 200 milligram dose load.

If the vehicle to prasterone ratio is too high then the total volume of the capsule fill needed to carry a 200 milligram dose load may become too large to fit into one soft gelatin capsule. Approved sizes for soft gelatin capsules include 

While not absolutely necessary one may micronize the prasterone directly in a liquid vehicle. This enables one to immediately form the vehicle prasterone mixture into an oral dosage form. This also minimizes the potential for overheating the prasterone during a dry micronization. Alternatively one may want to micronize under nitrogen.

The prasterone durable liquid vehicle may be coated onto a substrate such as micronized lactose. For example one could mix 2 parts w w micronized prasterone into 1 parts w w of a fatty acid such as cholesterol pivalate trimethyl acetate and then coat this mixture onto micronized lactose. I would expect the cholesterol pivalate to slightly increase the bioavailability AUC of the prasterone when compared to plain micronized prasterone coated onto lactose. Nonetheless while the use of coated cores and the like is possible I see no compelling advantage to using such more complex delivery systems rather than using a simple suspension of prasterone in durable liquid vehicle.

Given this disclosure the skilled artisan may readily find variations of this. For example one may use as soft gelatin capsule fill a vehicle which is free flowing at room temperature or one which is more viscous and perhaps even paste like at room temperature. The choice of viscosity is one of manufacturing convenience and finished product aesthetics. Thus I intend the legal coverage of my patent to be defined not by the specific examples recited here but by my legal claims here appended.
