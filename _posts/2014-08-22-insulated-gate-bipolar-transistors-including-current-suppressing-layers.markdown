This present application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 711 383 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 835 987 filed Feb. 27 2007 in the United States Patent and Trademark Office the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.

This invention was made with Government support under Contract No. N00014 05 C 0202 awarded by ONR DARPA. The Government has certain rights in the invention.

The present invention relates to electronic devices and fabrication methods. More particularly the present invention relates to high power insulated gate bipolar transistors and fabrication methods.

Power devices made with silicon carbide SiC are expected to show great advantages as compared to those on silicon for high speed high power and or high temperature applications due to the high critical field and wide band gap of SiC. For devices capable of blocking high voltages such as voltages in excess of about 5 kV it may be desirable to have bipolar operation to reduce the drift layer resistance via conductivity modulation resulting from injected minority carriers. However one technical challenge for bipolar devices in silicon carbide is forward voltage degradation over time possibly due to the presence of Basal Plane Dislocations BPD in single crystals of silicon carbide. Thus unipolar devices such as SiC Schottky diodes and MOSFETs are typically used for high power applications.

SiC DMOSFET devices with a 10 kV blocking capability have been fabricated with a specific on resistance of about 100 m cm. DMOSFET devices may exhibit very fast switching speed of for example less than 100 ns due to their majority carrier nature. However as the desired blocking voltage of devices increases for example up to 15 kV or more the on resistance of a MOSFET device may increase substantially due to the corresponding increase in the drift layer thickness. This problem may be exacerbated at high temperatures due to bulk mobility reduction which may result in excessive power dissipation.

With the progress of SiC crystal material growth several approaches have been developed to mitigate BPD related problems. See e.g. B. Hull M. Das J. Sumakeris J. Richmond and S. Krishinaswami Drift Free 10 kV 20 A 4H SiC PiN Diodes Journal of Electrical Materials Vol. 34 No. 4 2005. These developments may enhance the development and or potential applications of SiC bipolar devices such as thyristors GTOs etc. Even though thyristors and or GTOs may offer low forward voltage drops they may require bulky commutating circuits for the gate drive and protections. Accordingly it may be desirable for a SiC bipolar device to have gate turn off capability. Due to their superior on state characteristics reasonable switching speed and or excellent safe operation area SOA 4H SiC insulated gate bipolar transistors IGBTs are becoming more suitable for power switching applications.

Silicon carbide SiC IGBT devices are considered to be appropriate devices for high power applications especially for devices with blocking voltages in excess of 10 kV. The forward voltage drop of an IGBT is an important parameter of the device that affects the total power loss of the device. Thus to achieve low power loss a low forward voltage drop is desired.

Some embodiments of the invention provide an insulated gate bipolar transistor IGBT . The IGBT includes a first conductivity type substrate and a second conductivity type drift layer on the substrate. The second conductivity type is opposite the first conductivity type. The IGBT further includes a current suppressing layer on the drift layer. The current suppressing layer has the second conductivity type and has a doping concentration that is larger than a doping concentration of the drift layer. A first conductivity type well region is in the current suppressing layer and a second conductivity type emitter region is in the well region.

The IGBT may further include a gate oxide on the current suppressing layer above the well region a gate on the gate oxide layer and an emitter contact on the emitter region.

The current suppressing layer may include an epitaxial layer. In particular the substrate may include an off axis n type silicon carbide substrate and the drift layer and the current suppressing layer include p type silicon carbide epitaxial layers.

The current suppressing layer may have a thickness of about 1 m and or may have a doping concentration of about 1 10cmto about 1 10cm. In some embodiments the current suppressing layer may have a doping concentration of about 1 10cm.

The drift layer may have a doping concentration of about 2 10cmto about 2 10cmand a thickness of about 100 m to about 120 m.

The first conductivity may include n type and the second conductivity may include p type. In some embodiments the first conductivity may include p type and the second conductivity may include n type.

The IGBT may further include a buffer layer between the substrate and the drift layer the buffer layer may have the second conductivity type.

The well region may have a junction depth that is less than a thickness of the current suppressing layer. In particular the well region may have a junction depth of about 0.5 m.

Some embodiments of the invention provide methods of forming an IGBT. The methods include providing a substrate having a first conductivity type and forming a drift layer on the substrate. The drift layer has a second conductivity type opposite the first conductivity type. The methods further include forming a current suppressing layer on the drift layer. The current suppressing layer has the second conductivity type and has a doping concentration that is larger than a doping concentration of the drift layer. A first conductivity type well region is formed in the current suppressing layer and a second conductivity type emitter region is formed in the well region.

This invention may however be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.

It will be understood that although the terms first second etc. may be used herein to describe various elements these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element from another. For example a first element could be termed a second element and similarly a second element could be termed a first element without departing from the scope of the present invention. As used herein the term and or includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.

The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used herein the singular forms a an and the are intended to include the plural forms as well unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms comprises comprising includes and or including when used herein specify the presence of stated features integers steps operations elements and or components but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features integers steps operations elements components and or groups thereof.

Unless otherwise defined all terms including technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. It will be further understood that terms used herein should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of this specification and the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.

It will be understood that when an element such as a layer region or substrate is referred to as being on or extending onto another element it can be directly on or extend directly onto the other element or intervening elements may also be present. In contrast when an element is referred to as being directly on or extending directly onto another element there are no intervening elements present. It will also be understood that when an element is referred to as being connected or coupled to another element it can be directly connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements may be present.

Embodiments of the invention are described herein with reference to cross section illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments and intermediate structures of the invention. The thickness of layers and regions in the drawings may be exaggerated for clarity. Additionally variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result for example of manufacturing techniques and or tolerances are to be expected. Thus embodiments of the invention should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result for example from manufacturing. For example an implanted region illustrated as a rectangle will typically have rounded or curved features and or a gradient of implant concentration at its edges rather than a discrete change from implanted to non implanted region. Likewise a buried region formed by implantation may result in some implantation in the region between the buried region and the surface through which the implantation takes place. Thus the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the actual shape of a region of a device and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.

Some embodiments of the invention are described with reference to semiconductor layers and or regions which are characterized as having a conductivity type such as n type or p type which refers to the majority carrier concentration in the layer and or region. Thus n type material has a majority equilibrium concentration of negatively charged electrons while p type material has a majority equilibrium concentration of positively charged holes. Some material may be designated with a or as in n n p p n n p p or the like to indicate a relatively larger or smaller concentration of majority carriers compared to another layer or region. However such notation does not imply the existence of a particular concentration of majority or minority carriers in a layer or region.

Some embodiments of the invention provide silicon carbide SiC IGBTs that are suitable for high power and or high temperature applications. Some embodiments of the invention provide high voltage planar IGBTs on 4H SiC.

A planar gate 5.8 kV IGBT in SiC was built on an n type substrate in 2005. See Q. Zhang C. Jonas S. Ryu A. Agarwal and J. Palmour Design and Fabrications of High Voltage IGBTs on 4H SiC ISPSD Proceeding 2006. The p channel IGBT was selected due to the lack of high quality low resistivity p SiC substrates which are required for n channel IGBTs. The device exhibits a differential on resistance Rdiff on of about 570 m cmat a gate bias of 30 V at 25 C. and decreases to about 118 m cmat 200 C. respectively. The high on resistance was primarily attributed to the low bulk carrier lifetimes and low hole channel mobility.

A unit cell of a planar IGBT structure is shown in . A planar device structure such as the structure of the device shown in may provide process simplification and or enhanced device reliability. However other device structures may be advantageously employed.

The device of includes a p type buffer layer and a p drift epitaxial layer on an n type 8 off axis 4H SiC substrate . The p drift layer may have a thickness of about 100 m to about 120 m and may be doped with p type dopants at a doping concentration of about 2 10cmto about 6 10cmfor a blocking capability of about 10 kV. The p type buffer layer may have a thickness of about 1 to about 2 m and may be doped with p type dopants at a doping concentration of about 1 10cm. The p type buffer layer may be provided as a channel stop layer to prevent punch through.

The structure further includes n well regions and p emitter regions that may be formed by selective implantation of for example nitrogen and aluminum respectively. The junction depth of the n well regions may be about 0.5 m. The structure further includes n contact regions that extend from a surface of the drift layer into the n well regions . A guard ring based termination not shown may be provided around the device periphery.

A JFET region may be formed for example by implantation of aluminum in the drift layer between adjacent n well regions . The JFET region may be implanted with p type dopants to reduce the JFET resistance from the adjacent n well regions. In particular the JFET implantation dose may be selected to reduce the JFET resistance while keeping implant damage at an acceptable level. In some embodiments the JFET implantation may be performed at a dose sufficient to provide a dopant concentration of about 1 10cmin the JFET region. The JFET region may for example be formed by an epitaxial growth process.

In some embodiments a buried channel may be provided in the MOS channel region of the device . In particular a p type dopant such as aluminum may be implanted into the channel region of the n well regions between the p emitter regions and the JFET region to modify the threshold voltage and or to improve the inversion channel mobility. The buried channel layer may be formed using ion implantation and or epitaxial regrowth techniques. For example after an activation anneal of the n well regions and JFET implants a buried channel layer may be grown by epitaxial regrowth. In that case the buried channel may also permit formation of a deep n well that may prevent latch up by lifting the p type emitter implants to the buried channel regrowth layer. The deep n well may cause a lower n well resistance and may increase the device latch up current.

The buried channel may be formed by ion implantation with a dose of from about 5 10cmto about 5 10cmdepending on the amount of threshold adjustment required. In particular embodiments a threshold adjustment implant of aluminum may be performed at a dose of 3 10cm. The implant energy may be selected to position the channel at the surface of the device or at a desired distance from the surface. In some embodiments the threshold adjustment implant may be performed with an implant energy of at least about 25 keV. In some embodiments the threshold adjustment may include multiple implants. In particular embodiments the threshold adjustment may be accomplished by implanting aluminum ions with a dose of 8.4 10cmat 45 keV a dose of 1.12 10cmat 85 keV a dose of 1.52 10cmat 140 keV a dose of 1.92 10cmat 210 keV and a dose of 4.6 10cmat 330 keV for a total aluminum dose of 1 10cm. The buried channel may be formed by p type epitaxial growth which may provide a high channel mobility and or a long carrier lifetime.

All of the implanted dopants may be activated by annealing the structure at a temperature of about 1600 C. with a silicon over pressure and or covered by an encapsulation layer such as a graphite film. A high temperature anneal may damage the surface of the silicon carbide epitaxy. In order to reduce such damage a graphite coating may be formed on the surface of the device. Prior to annealing the device to activate the implanted ions a graphite coating may be applied to the top front side of the structure in order to protect the surface of the structure during the anneal. The graphite coating may be applied by a conventional resist coating method and may have a thickness of about 1 m. The graphite coating may be heated to form a crystalline coating on the drift layer . The implanted ions may be activated by a thermal anneal that may be performed for example in an inert gas at a temperature of about 1600 C. or greater. In particular the thermal anneal may be performed at a temperature of about 1600 C. in argon for 5 minutes. The graphite coating may help to protect the surface of the drift layer during the high temperature anneal.

After implant annealing a field oxide of silicon dioxide having a thickness of about 1 m is deposited and patterned to expose the active region of the device.

A gate oxide layer may be formed by a gate oxidation process with a final gate oxide thickness of 400 600 .

In particular the gate oxide may be grown by a dry wet oxidation process that includes a growth of bulk oxide in dry Ofollowed by an anneal of the bulk oxide in wet Oas described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 972 801 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As used herein anneal of oxide in wet Orefers to anneal of an oxide in an ambient containing both Oand vaporized HO. An anneal may be performed in between the dry oxide growth and the wet oxide growth. The dry Qoxide growth may be performed for example in a quartz tube at a temperature of up to about 1200 C. in dry Ofor a time of at least about 2.5 hours. Dry oxide growth is performed to grow the bulk oxide layer to a desired thickness. The temperature of the dry oxide growth may affect the oxide growth rate. For example higher process temperatures may produce higher oxide growth rates. The maximum growth temperature may be dependent on the system used.

In some embodiments the dry Ooxide growth may be performed at a temperature of about 1175 C. in dry Ofor about 3.5 hours. The resulting oxide layer may be annealed at a temperature of up to about 1200 C. in an inert atmosphere. In particular the resulting oxide layer may be annealed at a temperature of about 1175 C. in Ar for about 1 hour. The wet Ooxide anneal may be performed at a temperature of about 950 C. or less for a time of at least about 1 hour. The temperature of the wet Oanneal may be limited to discourage further thermal oxide growth at the SiC SiOinterface which may introduce additional interface states. In particular the wet Oanneal may be performed in wet Oat a temperature of about 950 C. for about 3 hours. The resulting gate oxide layer may have a thickness of about 500 .

After formation of the gate oxide a polysilicon gate may be deposited and doped for example with boron followed by a metallization process to reduce the gate resistance. Al Ni contacts may be deposited as the p type ohmic emitter contact metal and Ni as the n type collector contact metal . All contacts may be sintered in a Rapid Thermal Annealer RTA and thick Ti Au layers may be used for pad metals.

The resistance of the JFET region may contribute to an undesirable increase in on state forward voltage for the device . As described above the resistance of the JFET region may be reduced by ion implantation in the JFET region . However ion implantation can cause crystal damage which may reduce carrier lifetimes in JFET region . Furthermore the implantation depth is limited by the maximum implantation energy which may make it difficult to form an implanted JFET region that is deeper than the well regions of the device .

Accordingly some embodiments of the invention use epitaxial growth to form a current suppressing layer having a deep junction and having good crystal quality. The depth and doping concentration of current suppressing layer may be selected such that IGBT devices can achieve a low forward voltage drop differential on resistance and can maintain a high blocking capability

The current suppressing layer may have a doping concentration of about 1 10to about 1 10cm and in particular embodiments may be doped with aluminum at a concentration of about 1 10cm. Thus the current suppressing layer may provide a JFET region adjacent the n wells without ion implantation in the JFET region . The n wells the p emitter regions and the n contact regions may be formed by implantation of ions into the current suppressing layer using for example the implant conditions described above. In some embodiments the current suppressing layer may have a thickness of about 1 m.

The presence of current suppressing layer may result in benefits to the IGBT on resistance. For example the current suppressing layer may suppress current conduction in the bipolar junction transistor BJT portion of the device that is formed by the n well regions the p drift layer and the n substrate by reducing current gain of NPN BJT which may enhance hole accumulation underneath the MOS channel region . Thus the carrier distribution of an IGBT device according to embodiments of the invention may approach that of an on state PiN diode.

Additionally a high doping concentration in the JFET region may reduce the on state resistance of the JFET region . Moreover an epitaxially grown current suppressing layer may exhibit a long carrier lifetime which may reduce carrier recombination in the JFET region .

A forward voltage drop of 8.7V differential on resistance of 88 m cm at a gate bias of 20 V was measured for the IGBTs with implanted JFET regions while a forward voltage drop of 5.5V differential on resistance of 26 m cm was measured for IGBTs with current suppressing layer structures at room temperature. This represents a significant reduction in forward voltage of approximately 37 .

As shown in the blocking voltage of an IGBT with a current suppressing layer may remain high for doping concentrations of up to about 2 10cm but may begin to drop off as the doping concentration is increased. As shown in the forward voltage of an IGBT with a current suppressing layer may decrease as the doping is increased from about 1 10cmto about 2 10cm. After about 2 10cm the reduction in forward voltage may tend to level off. Accordingly as noted above the doping of the current suppressing layer may be chosen to provide an acceptably low on state forward voltage while maintaining an acceptably high blocking voltage.

It will be appreciated that although some embodiments of the invention have been described in connection with silicon carbide IGBT devices having n type substrates and p type drift layers and in which the minority carriers injected into the drift layer include electrons the present invention is not limited thereto and may be embodied in devices having p type substrates and or n type drift layers.

In the drawings and specification there have been disclosed typical embodiments of the invention and although specific terms are employed they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation the scope of the invention being set forth in the following claims.
