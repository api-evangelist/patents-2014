The invention relates to the field of polymers and olefin polymerization and more specifically olefin metathesis polymerization.

Copolymers are employed in a wide range of materials ranging from bulk plastics to specialized coatings pharmaceutical compositions and biomedical and electronic devices. Among the most commonly used are block copolymers which often rely on phase separation of the two blocks for their functional properties for example in drug delivery nanoparticles and random copolymers which incorporate two or more functional moieties that act co operatively for example in organic light emitting diodes. Regularly alternating polymers allow for controlled positioning of functional substituents but they are difficult to access synthetically.

Regioregular alternating polymers for example SAN styrene acrylonitrile an alternating copolymer used in plastics are generally synthesized by radical polymerization with kinetic control of alternation in the polymerization reaction.Recently ring opening metathesis polymerization ROMP and ring opening insertion metathesis polymerization ROIMP have been employed to synthesize alternating polymers Ilker M.

The existing methods of formation of alternating polymers are limited and there remains a need for new and more structurally diverse substrates and polymers. The present invention provides substrate and catalyst combinations that can generate a wider range of alternating polymers having a range of diverse properties.

Herein we address both the limitation of the NB COE ROMP i.e. the formation of COE homoblocks as well as the intramolecular chain transfer of current AROMP by utilizing CBE CH monomers containing the DAN PDI pair to achieve perfectly alternating copolymers. We show that these polymers exhibit a higher intensity charge transfer absorbance than analogous poly NB alt COE polymers.

The invention provides a method for producing an alternating AB copolymer comprising the repeating unit Ia Ib or Ic 

The method comprises contacting the cyclohexene derivative II with the cyclobutene derivative III in the presence of an olefin metathesis catalyst. This polymerization method enables the facile preparation of amphiphilic and bifunctional alternating polymers from simple and readily available starting materials.

The invention provides a method for producing an alternating AB copolymer comprising the repeating unit Ia Ib or Ic 

By way of example suitable cyclohexene and cyclobutene species include but are not limited to the following 

It will be understood that olefins in the substituents should be essentially unreactive with the metathesis catalyst under the reaction conditions so that the metathesis polymerization involves the cyclobutene and cyclohexene double bonds exclusively or nearly so. Generally any carbon carbon double bonds in R or in Rthrough Rshould be trisubstituted or tetrasubstituted or otherwise rendered unreactive with the catalyst.

Aryl as used herein includes but is not limited to optionally substituted phenyl naphthyl anthracenyl and phenanthryl groups. Heterocycle and heterocyclyl refer to monocyclic and fused polycyclic heteroaromatic and heteroaliphatic ring systems containing at least one N O S or P atom. Aryl and heterocyclic groups may contain from 1 to 60 carbon atoms and may range from furan thiophene and benzene to large chromophores such as phthalocyanines and fullerenes. For some applications aryl and heterocyclic groups will preferably contain from 1 to 20 carbon atoms.

It will be apparent that alkyl alkenyl cycloalkyl heterocyclyl acyl and aryl moieties in the substituents R and Rthrough Rmay be substituted with functional groups known to be compatible with the catalyst. Examples include but are not limited to C Cacyl acyloxy acylamino amido aryloxy alkoxy and alkylthio groups halogens protected amino groups such as BocNH and FmocNH protected hydroxy groups such as TMSO BzO and BnO and protected carboxyl groups such as CO t Bu and COBn. Accordingly the terms alkyl alkenyl cycloalkyl acyl aryl and heterocyclyl as used herein encompass such substituents.

The method may be used to prepare block copolymers as well in which one block comprises the repeating units Ia Ib or Ic the proportion of alternating and block copolymer regions in the polymer being dependent upon the catalyst and substrate. The catalyst may be any olefin metathesis catalyst known in the art such as those disclosed in WO 03 070779. It is preferably an alkylidene ruthenium complex and more preferably a complex of formula L 2 L XRu CHR wherein R may be for example H C Calkyl C Calkenyl C Ccycloalkyl or aryl. The ligand L is typically a trialkyl phosphines triarylphosphines tri cycloalkyl phosphines pyridines aryl wherein aryl is optionally substituted with a halogen. L is a second ligand and may be a trialkyl phosphine triarylphosphine tri cycloalkyl phosphine or a pyridine. L may also be an imidazolin 2 ylidine carbene of formula IV 

In certain embodiments L is a pyridine optionally 3 bromopyridine and L is an imidazolin 2 ylidine carbene. In another embodiment Ris preferably mesityl 2 methylphenyl 2 ethylphenyl 2 isopropylphenyl 2 3 diisopropylphenyl 2 6 difluorophenyl or 3 5 di t butylphenyl.

The polymers of the present invention may be prepared according to the representative Schemes 1 through 3.

The target monomers and catalyst are shown in . The syntheses of the side chains are in close analogy to published methods.Based on previous studies synthetic route 1 Scheme 1 was first investigated for the alternating copolymerization of the DAN and PDI functionalized CBE and CH monomers respectively. This route successfully afforded poly 1 alt 2 . However longer polymerization times were required due to the significant steric hindrance presented by the side chain units. This resulted in a decrease in the rate of polymerization inhibiting the formation of higher molecular weight polymers.

To minimize steric hindrance and to achieve a higher degree of polymerization a revised synthetic route was applied using DAN CBE 1 and a cyclohexene functionalized with N hydroxysuccinimide NHS compound 3 for AROMP Scheme 2 . The NHS group is less bulky than the PDI and is not reactive during the polymerization. The PDI ester can then be formed via a post polymerization functionalization strategy to generate poly 1 alt 5 . This modified route not only allowed for a higher degree of polymerization but also provided an alternative strategy for the incorporation of the PDI moiety.

Previous studies on poly CBE alt CH revealed signals in the H NMR spectrum corresponding to concentration independent intramolecular backbiting of the enoic ruthenium carbene on the unhindered disubstituted alkenes in the polymer backbone.As a result polydispersity indices of unfunctionalized poly CBE alt CH were larger than 2 and a significant fraction of the polymer was cyclic. In our case poly 1 alt 2 and poly 1 alt 5 did not show any proton resonance signals due to backbiting had PDIs lower than 1.3 and displayed a monomodal distribution. We hypothesize that backbiting is inhibited by the increased steric hindrance at the enoic carbene and disubstituted alkene in combination with the restricted flexibility of the polymer backbone upon modification with larger substituents. As a consequence longer AROMP copolymers were obtained than previously reported.

We designed a new set of cyclobutene derivatives as monomers with bicyclic structures which are very strained and can incorporate rings into the polymeric backbone.Therefore we utilized functional group Br containing bicyclo 4.2.0 oct 7 ene 7 carboxylate and aldehyde containing cyclohexene as the AROMP pair which provides a facile approach to prepare long and completely alternating copolymers with orthogonal functional groups. Post polymerization modification of Br with an azide group allows click chemistry while the aldehyde can be coupled to a hydrazide to introduce fluorophores which are not compatible with AROMP reactions.

The alternating copolymers were further modified according to Scheme 4 to crosslink with dansyl hydrazide DH and form poly 3 alt 4 DH it was coupled with Boc Trp alkyn to form poly 3 Trp alt 4 both fluorophores were introduced in a one pot reaction to provide poly 3 Trp alt 4 DH .

UV Vis spectroscopy was utilized to investigate the charge transfer between the side chains of the alternating copolymers in solution. The UV Vis spectrum of poly 1 alt 5 3 mM in chloroform shows a charge transfer absorbance at the characteristic wavelength light blue trace indicating that the side chains are able to favorably orient to transfer energy in this system. A concentration study from 3 mM to 100 M was carried out to determine if these interactions occur inter or intramolecularly. As shown in the charge transfer absorbance signal was persistent even at low concentrations. Moreover the absorbance followed Beer Lambert behavior based on the concentration of polymer which demonstrated that the charge transfer is intramolecular. Additionally the aromatic signals in the H NMR spectrum of poly 1 alt 5 are shifted upfield in comparison to the individual monomers . These shifts further indicate the pi pi stacking of the donor acceptor aromatic units and are consistent with similar shifts previously reported for partially folded polymers.

We compared the charge transfer absorbance of the functionalized poly CBE alt CH s to the previously reported functionalized poly NB alt COE b COE.As shown in poly 1 alt 5 exhibits a higher charge transfer absorbance intensity in comparison to the NB COE polymers at the same concentration which indicates that the new poly 1 alt 5 polymers more favorably align the aromatic units of the donor and acceptor moieties.

In conclusion we have demonstrated the AROMP of CBE and CH monomers containing bulky DAN PDI side chains. We attribute inhibition of backbiting to the steric hindrance provided by bulky side chains around the carbene and the polymer alkenes. UV Vis spectroscopic analysis shows a charge transfer absorbance signal for the perfectly alternating copolymers signifying the alignment of the side chains. The new polymers demonstrate an enhancement of charge transfer in comparison to previously studied polymers indicating that the sequence specificity in alternating CBE CH copolymers provides efficient energy transfer.
