Each of these patent applications is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

All publications and patent applications mentioned in this specification are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety to the same extent as if each individual publication or patent application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.

Described herein are catheters and specifically catheters that may include a rotating distal tip having both a directional cutting element and an OCT imaging sensor an inner lumen for a guidewire extending the length of the catheter and an optical fiber that is configured to wind and unwind within the catheter as the OCT imaging sensor at the distal end rotates. The catheters described herein may be configured as one or more of guidewire support and or placement catheters imaging catheters atherectomy catheters chronic total occlusion crossing catheters and hybrid support placement catheters with imaging and or atherectomy features. Methods of using the catheters described herein are also provided.

Peripheral artery disease PAD affects millions of people in the United States alone. PAD is a silent dangerous disease that can have catastrophic consequences when left untreated. PAD is the leading cause of amputation in patients over 50 and is responsible for approximately 160 000 amputations in the United States each year.

Peripheral artery disease PAD is a progressive narrowing of the blood vessels most often caused by atherosclerosis the collection of plaque or a fatty substance along the inner lining of the artery wall. Over time this substance hardens and thickens which may interfere with blood circulation to the arms legs stomach and kidneys. This narrowing forms an occlusion completely or partially restricting flow through the artery. Blood circulation to the brain and heart may be reduced increasing the risk for stroke and heart disease.

Interventional treatments for PAD may include endarterectomy and or atherectomy. Endarterectomy is surgical removal of plaque from the blocked artery to restore or improve blood flow. Endovascular therapies such as atherectomy are typically minimally invasive techniques that open or widen arteries that have become narrowed or blocked. Other treatments may include angioplasty to open the artery. For example a balloon angioplasty typically involves insertion of a catheter into a leg or arm artery and positioning the catheter such that the balloon resides within the blockage. The balloon connected to the catheter is expanded to open the artery. Surgeons may then place a wire mesh tube called a stent at the area of blockage to keep the artery open.

Such minimally invasive techniques e.g. atherectomy angioplasty etc. typically involve the placement of a guidewire through the occlusion. Using the guidewire one or more interventional devices may be positioned to remove or displace the occlusion. Unfortunately placement of the guidewire while critical for effective treatment may be difficult. In particular when placing a guidewire across an occlusion it may be difficult to pass the guidewire through the occlusion while avoiding damage to the artery. For example it is often difficult to prevent the guidewire from directing out of the lumen into the adventitia and surrounding tissues potentially damaging the vessel and preventing effective treatment of the occlusion.

If imaging is used to assist in placement of guidewires for treating PAD including treatment of chronic total occlusion fluoroscopy is typically used to visualize the location of the lumen of the vessel with respond to the guidewire. However it would be particularly beneficial to visualize within the lumen of a vessel as the guidewire is placed both to identify regions for effective therapy as well as to prevent damage to surrounding tissue.

A significant body of scientific and clinical evidence supports atherectomy as a viable primary or adjunctive therapy prior to stenting for the treatment of occlusive coronary artery disease. Atherectomy offers a simple mechanical advantage over alternative therapies. Removing the majority of plaque mass e.g. debulking may create a larger initial lumen and dramatically increases the compliance of the arterial wall. As a result stent deployment is greatly enhanced.

Additionally there are advantages related to the arterial healing response when selecting atherectomy as a treatment option. When circumferential radial forces are applied to the vasculature as in the case of angioplasty or stenting the plaque mass is displaced forcing the vessel wall to stretch dramatically. This stretch injury is a known stimulus for the cellular in growth that leads to restenosis. By removing the disease with minimal force applied to the vessel and reducing the plaque burden prior to stent placement large gains in lumen size can be created with decreased vessel wall injury and limited elastic recoil all of which have shown to translate into better acute results and lower restenosis rates.

Traditional atherectomy devices have been plagued by a number of problems which have severely limited market adoption. These challenges include the need for large access devices rigid distal assemblies that make control and introduction challenging fixed cut length unpredictable depth of cut insufficient tissue collection and removal and complex operation. The systems and devices described herein may overcome these hurdles and offer physicians a safe reliable and simple cutting system that offers the precision required in eccentric lesions various disease states and tortuous anatomy.

Despite the potential to improve restenosis rates associated with angioplasty and stenting in the coronary and peripheral vasculature atherectomy is not commonly performed. The primary reason for this limited use is the cost complexity and limited applicability of currently available devices. Many designs are unable to treat the wide range of disease states present in long complex lesions luminal gain is often limited by the requirement of the physician to introduce multiple devices with increased crossing profiles tissue collection is either unpredictable or considered unnecessary based on assumptions regarding small particle size and volumes and optimal debulking is either not possible due to lack of intravascular visualization or requires very long procedure times. Based on these limitations current devices are likely to perform poorly in the coronary vasculature where safety and efficacy in de novo lesions ostials and bifurcations continue to pose great challenges.

Previously atherectomy devices focused on macerating or emulsifying the atherosclerotic plaque such that it may be considered clinically insignificant and remain in the blood stream or aspirated proximally through small spaces in the catheter main body. The reliability of these devices to produce clinically insignificant embolization has been questioned when not aspirated through the catheter to an external reservoir. Aspiration requires a vacuum be applied to a lumen or annular space within the catheter to remove emulsified tissue. In early clinical evaluations of aspiration the presence of negative pressure at the distal working assembly cause the artery to collapse around the cutting element causing more aggressive treatment dissections and or perforations. In addition the option for post procedural analysis of any removed disease is extremely limited or impossible. Atheromed Pathway Medical and Cardio Vascular Systems Inc. are examples of companies working on such product designs.

Other atherectomy devices include the directional atherectomy devices such as those developed by Devices for Vascular Intervention and Fox Hollow. These catheters use cupped cutters that cut and direct the tissue distal into a storage reservoir in the distal tip of the device. This approach preserves the as cut nature of the plaque but requires large distal collection elements. These large distal tip assemblies can limit the capabilities of the system to access small lesions and create additional trauma to the vessel.

Currently available atherectomy devices also do not include and are poorly adapted for use with real time image guidance. Physician practice is often to treat target lesion as if they contain concentric disease even though intravascular diagnostic devices have consistently shown significantly eccentric lesions. This circumferential treatment approach virtually ensures that native arterial wall and potentially healthy vessel will be cut from the vasculature.

In light of the needs described above occlusion crossing catheter devices atherectomy catheter devices imaging catheters including imaging guidewire placement devices and imaging atherectomy devices and systems and methods for using them are described herein in order to address at least some of the concerns described and illustrated above.

The present invention relates to catheters having a rotating distal tip region that includes an OCT imaging sensor and may include one or more tissue dissecting elements. These catheters may also include a central passage or lumen that opens distally extending along the length of the catheter body that may be used to pass a guidewire. In general the catheters described herein may be configured as 1 guidewire support placement catheters 2 support placement imaging catheters 3 occlusion crossing catheters 4 occlusion crossing imaging catheters 5 atherectomy catheters and 6 atherectomy imaging catheters. Any of these catheter variations may include one or more of the elements described herein and any of these catheter variations may be used to treat a disorder particularly peripheral artery disease. Systems including any of these catheters are also described. For convenience in the description below these catheters may be referred to as occlusion crossing catheters. It is to be understood that any of the catheters described herein may be configured as occlusion crossing catheters.

In general a catheter may include a flexible elongate body a proximal handle or handle region and a distal rotating tip. The distal tip may have a corkscrew like rotating tip which is configured to rotate to enhance forward motion e.g. at low rates of rotation without cutting or drilling through the tissue. Rather than drilling the tip may be configured to prevent or reduce static friction avoiding damage to the luminal walls of the vessel and preventing the tip from passing through the adventitia.

The tip may be configured to rotate at very low speeds e.g. less than about 300 revolutions min less than 100 rev min less than 50 rev min less than 30 rev min e.g. between about 1 and about 30 rev min etc. at a constant or variable rate. In many variations particularly but not necessarily those including an imaging modality e.g. OCT with an imaging sensor affixed to the rotating tip the tip may rotate automatically both clockwise and counterclockwise alternately. For example the device or system may be configured to rotate the distal tip first clockwise then counterclockwise. The clockwise and counterclockwise rotations may be performed continuously for a predetermined number of revolutions or partial revolutions such as more than one revolution e.g. approximately 2 revolutions 2.5 revolutions 3 revolutions 5 revolutions 8 revolutions 10 revolutions 12 revolutions 20 revolutions 50 revolutions 100 revolutions or any number of revolution between 1 and 500 including fractions of revolutions . In some variations the number of rotations is not predetermined but may be based on timing or on feedback from the catheter or system. For example the distal tip and therefore the OCT imaging sensor may be rotated in a first direction until a tension or resistance threshold is reached then rotated in the opposite direction until a tension or resistance threshold is reached in that direction. This process may then be repeated.

Any of the catheters described herein may include one or more tissue dissecting cutting edges on the rotating distal tip. In some variations the forward edge of the catheter includes one or more helical edges which may be referred to as wedges. The helical edges may be arranged at the distal end of the device. The edge may have a small diameter particularly as compared with the ultimate diameter of the device. These edges may be sharp rough or otherwise dissecting.

Any of the catheter variations described herein may include a central lumen through which a guidewire may be passed for placement across an occlusion using the device. The central lumen typically extends along the length of the device from the proximal end or a region distal to the proximal end to the distal end of the catheter. Thus the catheter may include a distal opening. This central lumen may be referred to as a guidewire lumen. In some variations the device is configured to pass through a lesion or occlusion or an occluded region or regions of a vessel to position the catheter beyond the occlusion before a guidewire is passed through the catheter. Alternatively the guidewire may be housed or held within the lumen while the device is advanced through the occlusion or occluded region of a vessel such as an artery vein or duct for example a peripheral artery vein or bile duct.

In general the catheters described herein are configured to apply optical coherence tomography OCT to image the tissue. Thus the catheters described herein can include an imaging sensor such as an OCT imaging sensor. An OCT imaging sensor may include the distal end of an optical fiber and a mirror for directing light in out of the optical fiber. The optical fiber may be affixed to the distal tip structure. The imaging sensor may be oriented to image the vessel ahead of the device perpendicular to the device and or behind the device tip. The mirror or reflector may be used to direct the light path entering and exiting the end of the optical fiber to fix the imaging direction for the device. For example the optical fiber and mirror may be fixed to the rotating distal tip region and may be embedded in a transparent or translucent medium including transparent cement or other fixative .

An optical fiber of the OCT system can be attached only to the rotating distal tip and at a proximal end but be free to move within the device lumen. As the distal end or tip of the device rotates the optical fiber may wrap and unwrap around the inner lumen as the distal end tip is rotated clockwise and counterclockwise. Thus the length of the optical fiber extending from this affixed region at the rotatable distal tip to the proximal end of the catheter is loose within the catheter body and free to wind unwind around the catheter body. The inventors have discovered that this loose arrangement of the optical fiber creates advantages compared to systems in which an optical fiber is held along its length or prohibited from off axis winding including ease of construction and enhanced catheter flexibility. Thus any of the catheters described herein may be adapted to allow and control the winding unwinding of the optical fiber within the catheter and the optical fiber may be located within the catheter in an off axis position.

In some variations the distal end of the device is steerable pre bent or both. For example the distal end may be biased or curved at an angle off the axis of the shaft. In some variations a control member e.g. tendon or other actuator may be used to control the shape of the distal end. In some variations the catheter includes a prebiased shape or fixed jog so that the distal end of the device e.g. the rotatable distal tip forms an angle with the region of the catheter s elongate body immediately proximal to the fixed jog. A fixed jog may help with steering and navigation of the catheter. The jog may be in a plane that is in line with one or more fiduciary markers that are visible by fluoroscopy or other imaging modality e.g. ultrasound etc. .

Any of the catheters configured for imaging described herein may also be configured to enhance the imaging by flushing or otherwise clearing the imaging sensor region so that it may image the vessel wall s . For example the catheter may include one or more flush or fluid delivery ports for providing a flushing fluid to clear the visualization pathway for the device. Saline or other flush fluids may be released from the fluid delivery ports to clear the field of view. Flushing may be achieved at a sufficient fluid flow rate to clear help clear the field of view e.g. by flushing away red blood cells or other material that may inhibit visualization of the vessel walls . The flush port opening s at the distal end may be positioned and sized to minimize the amount of fluid or the fluid flow rate need to flush the imaging field. Thus a flush port may be located near the imaging sensor. For example a flush port may be less than 2 mm from the imaging sensor. Flushing may be controlled manually or automatically.

In some variations the catheter may have an outer protective housing along the elongate length extending between the distal tip region and the proximal handle or connector region. A space within the outer protective housing and an inner lumen may be referred to as the outer lumen or outer lumen region. An inner lumen which may be referred to in some variations as a guidewire lumen may be located within the outer lumen and used to pass the guidewire through the elongate length of the device. The inner lumen may be formed by an internal housing extending along the length of the device. The space between the outer protective housing and the inner lumen may also be referred to as the device lumen. In catheter variations including an optical fiber for imaging the optical fiber may be housed within the device lumen outer lumen. Further in devices including flushing the flushing fluid can flow through the outer lumen.

Also described herein are catheters including one or more expandable and or inflatable e.g. balloon elements. The inflatable element s may be used to help center the distal end of the device within the lumen of the device helping to prevent the tip of the device from passing through the adventitia. The inflatable member could also be used to limit or prevent the flow of a fluid that would normally block the field of view. In some variations the expandable inflatable region may be located near the distal tip of the device which may include a rotating distal tip end region.

Also described herein are catheters configured as atherectomy catheters that may also include imaging. For example describe herein are atherectomy catheters that are side facing side opening and configured to cut occlusive material from a vessel using a circular cutter than can be rotated or oscillated to cut the tissue. Tissue cut in this manner may be stored within the body of the device. The tissue may be masticated or ground up as it is removed.

Specific example of catheters and particularly occlusion crossing catheters that may be used to place a guidewire across an occlusion are provided below.

Described herein are catheter devices for crossing chronic total occlusions that include an elongate body a guidewire lumen extending within the elongate body from a proximal end of the elongate body to a distal end of the elongate body a rotatable tip at the distal end of the elongate body and configured to rotate relative to the elongate body and an OCT imaging sensor comprising an optical fiber coupled with the rotatable tip and configured to rotate therewith wherein the optical fiber is configured to wrap around the central lumen within the elongate body as the rotatable tip rotates.

These catheter devices may also include a drive mechanism configured to continuously rotate the rotatable tip alternately clockwise then counterclockwise. For example the drive mechanism may be configured to rotate the rotatable tip at between about 1 and about 100 rotations per minute rpm between about 30 and about 60 rpm or greater than 100 rpm.

A catheter may be configured so that the number of rotations clockwise and counterclockwise is limited. For example the number of rotations clockwise may be less than 15 rotations before switching to rotate counterclockwise another 15 rotations then repeating this pattern of rotation. In some variations the number of clockwise counterclockwise rotation is between about 1 and about 200 between about 1 and about 100 between about 1 and about 50 between about 1 and about 20 etc.

In some variations the OCT imaging sensor is configured to emit energy perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the catheter device. Thus the region of the body including the body lumen immediately outside of the catheter may be imaged. Because OCT may provides images of structures within the tissue the tissue forming and surrounding the lumen may be imaged. This information may be used to guide the catheter and or to confirm when an occlusion has been reached or crossed.

As mentioned the rotatable distal tip may comprise a helical blade edge or wedge. In some variations the helical wedge comprises a substantially smooth curved outer surface that presents an atraumatic tissue contacting surface when rotated in a first direction e.g. clockwise and that further presents a tissue dissection and or sharp or rough tissue cutting surface when rotated in an opposite direction to the first direction e.g. counterclockwise .

In any of the variations described herein one or more imaging markers e.g. fiducial markers may be included to help orient and guide the operation of the device including positioning the device within the body. A marker may be a radiopaque material e.g. a metal that can be seen in high contrast during fluoroscopy or a material that reflexes or absorbs optical beams from the OCT system e.g. metal dense polymer carbon powder . In variations of the catheter including a fixed jog the fixed jog may act as a marker or in conjunction with a marker to aid in steering the catheter device. In some variations the elongate body includes at least one marker configured to obstruct imaging from the OCT sensor at least once per rotation of the rotatable tip. More than one marker may also be used e.g. three markers .

In some variations the device includes a driveshaft that is concentric to the central lumen e.g. surrounds the central lumen so that the central lumen extends through the driveshaft. The driveshaft typically rotates the rotatable distal tip.

In general the imaging sensor may be proximal to though near or incorporated within the distal tip. For example the distal end of the rotatable tip may be less than 3 mm from the imaging sensor.

Also described herein are catheter devices for crossing occlusions the device comprising an elongate body a central lumen extending within the elongate body from a proximal end of the elongate body to a distal end of the elongate body a rotatable tip having spiral wedges at the distal end of the elongate body and configured to rotate relative to the elongate body an OCT imaging sensor comprising an optical fiber coupled with the rotatable tip and configured to rotate therewith wherein the optical fiber is configured to wrap around the central lumen within the elongate body as the rotatable tip rotates and a drive mechanism configured to continuously rotate the rotatable tip alternately clockwise then counterclockwise.

In another variation a catheter device for crossing occlusions includes an elongate body a central lumen extending within the elongate body from a proximal end of the elongate body to a distal end of the elongate body a rotatable tip at the distal end of the elongate body and configured to rotate relative to the elongate body an OCT imaging sensor comprising an optical fiber coupled with the rotatable tip and configured to rotate therewith wherein the distal end of the elongate body comprises one or more fiduciary markers configured to occlude the OCT imaging sensor as it rotates and a fixed jog region proximal to the distal end of the catheter the fixed jog positioning the distal end of the catheter at an angle relative to the region of the catheter proximal to the fixed jog. The fixed jog may form an angle of between about 10 to 45 degrees so that the distal end is at this angle relative to the region of the elongate body proximal to the fixed jog.

Also described herein are methods of crossing an occlusion or lesion. For example a method of crossing an occlusion or lesion may include advancing an occlusion crossing catheter into a body lumen rotating a rotatable distal tip at a distal end of an elongate body of the occlusion crossing catheter imaging a region of the body lumen surrounding the catheter using an OCT sensor coupled to the rotatable distal tip and passing the rotatable distal tip past an occlusion. In some variations a guidewire may be placed after passing the occlusion or lesion so the method may include the step of advancing a guidewire past the occlusion by passing the guidewire through a central lumen within the elongate body of the occlusion crossing catheter.

In general the method may include the step of displaying the imaged region surrounding the body lumen on a screen.

Rotating the rotatable tip may include winding an optical fiber forming the OCT sensor around the central lumen of the occlusion crossing catheter. The step of rotating may include alternately rotating the rotatable tip clockwise and then counterclockwise.

In some variations the entire catheter may also be rotated to orient it within the body lumen. For example the catheter body may be rotated to orient a fixed jog and steer the catheter towards damaged tissue.

Image correction may be used to enhance the imaging and user interface. For example in some variations the image may be corrected modified or enhanced prior or concurrent with display. For example in some variations the image may be corrected prior to displaying the image data to account for lag of the OCT imaging sensor relative to the detector. The image data may be corrected to mask out portions of the image including regions of the catheter noise and the like. Thus in some variations the image may be an annular region with the innermost donut hole region being shown as blank to represent the catheter diameter while the outermost region edge of the annulus may be masked to remove artifact.

In some variations the image taken with OCT imaging may be aligned with other imaging means including fluoroscopic imaging. For example the method may include the step of orienting image data taken with the OCT sensor to align with a fluoroscopy image.

Also described herein are methods of crossing a chronic total occlusion including the steps of advancing an occlusion crossing catheter into an occluded body lumen of a patient rotating a rotatable distal tip of the catheter relative to an elongate body of the catheter wherein the distal tip includes at least one helical blade and an OCT imaging sensor imaging a region of the body lumen surrounding the catheter using the OCT sensor on the rotatable tip wherein the catheter includes at least one marker configured to obstruct imaging form the OCT sensor at least once per rotation of the rotatable tip and steering the catheter within the body lumen of the patient based upon the OCT image of the body lumen and the marker.

In some variations the catheter comprises a fixed jog near the rotatable tip having a fixed orientation relative to the at least one marker and wherein steering comprises rotating the elongate body to orient the fixed jog. The steering can include pointing the distal end of the catheter toward unhealthy tissue imaged by the OCT sensor.

The catheters described herein typically include one or more imaging sensors at the distal end that may be rotated independently of the elongate body of a catheter. An imaging sensor may include an optical coherence tomography OCT sensor. The rotating distal end may also include one or more tissue cutting or dissecting surfaces that may aid the catheter in advancing within occluded regions of a vessel.

Examples of the types of catheters that are described herein in detail include 1 guidewire support placement catheters 2 support placement imaging catheters 3 occlusion crossing catheters 4 occlusion crossing imaging catheters 5 atherectomy catheters and 6 atherectomy imaging catheters.

Two sections are included below. Part I describes catheters including occlusion crossing catheters that may be used as guidewire placement and support catheters. In particular Part I describes catheters configured for imaging from the inside of a vessel such as an artery during operation. Part II describes atherectomy devices and methods of using them. The sections and subsections provided herein are for convenience only it should be understood that features included in one section or subsection may be included or excluded from devices described in any of the other sections and subsections.

Catheters such as occlusion crossing catheters including guidewire placement and or support catheters which may be referred to as occlusion crossing catheters for convenience may be used to cross an occlusion or lesion. These catheters may be used to place a guidewire within an occluded lumen of a vessel. Any of the catheters described herein may include a guidewire lumen spanning all or most of the length of the device and a rotating and or oscillating clockwise and or counterclockwise relative to the long axis of the catheter distal tip which may include one or more dissecting e.g. cutting surfaces. The rotatable distal tip region may be used to position a catheter through an occluded lumen of a vessel including for treatment of chronic total occlusions.

Described herein are catheters that include an imaging sensor at the distal tip to allow imaging of the vessel structure and morphology as it is being traversed. Imaging may be forward facing lateral facing adjustable between forward facing and lateral facing and or rear facing or angled between the forward and lateral facing. Any appropriate imaging modality may be used but particularly those using one or more optical fibers such as optical coherent tomography OCT .

The catheters described herein can be dimensioned to fit within vessels of the body such as blood vessels. For example the catheters can be configured to be placed within the peripheral blood vessels. Thus the catheters can have an outer diameter of less than 0.1 inch such as less than 0.09 inches such as less than or equal to 0.08 inches.

In one embodiment a catheter device includes a distal tip that is rotatable and an onboard imaging system for visualizing the vessel as the device is positioned. In this example the system includes an OCT imaging system for visualizing the structure and morphology of the vessel walls. The system can see a distance of up to 3 mm such as up to 2 mm into the depth of the vessel walls.

Referring to a catheter which may be used as a guidewire positioning catheter includes an elongate flexible shaft and a rotatable distal tip having an imaging sensor such as an OCT sensor connected thereto. The shaft extends from a handle region and terminates in the rotatable distal tip . The device in is not necessarily shown to scale as the length of the shaft has been reduced to show the other features at a more appropriate scale.

A guidewire can extend through the guidewire catheter device such as through a guidewire lumen in the shaft . The guidewire may be held resident in the device as it is positioned within a patient or it may be inserted after the distal end of the shaft or at least the distal tip has been positioned within the lumen of the vessel such as past an occlusion or lesion. The guidewire lumen can be housed inside of a driveshaft not shown in configured to rotate the tip . Thus in some variations the driveshaft is a tubular shaft such that the driveshaft may surround the guidewire lumen. In other variations the driveshaft is a solid shaft which extends through the length of the catheter and runs alongside e.g. adjacent to the guidewire lumen.

The system can include an optical fiber not shown in that is fixed at one end to the distal tip but is otherwise free to move around such as within an internal lumen between a lumen housing the guidewire and an outer casing of the shaft . Power and imaging lines cabling may extend from the handle region to connect the optical fiber with a power source and a light source for the OCT system.

The handle region can house the control mechanism for controlling the rotation of the distal tip and OCT reflector sensor at the end of the optical fiber . The control mechanism controls the direction of the distal tip as well as the number of revolutions before switching direction. In some embodiments the handle region can also control the rate of rotation. As discussed further below the rate of rotation as well as the number of clockwise and or counterclockwise rotations may be optimized to advance the distal end of the device though an otherwise occluded lumen of a vessel while generating a cross sectional image of the lumen i.e. 360 degrees. The rate and number of rotations may also be optimized to prevent damage to the optical fiber used for the OCT imaging which is attached only at the distal end of the device such that the rest of the fiber can extend along the length of the shaft can wrap off axis around the internal lumen e.g. guidewire lumen of the catheter without breaking.

Referring to the shaft can include a fixed jog or a J shaped bend near or just proximal to the distal tip . The fixed jog can have an angle of 10 to 45 degrees such as between 20 and 30 degrees. In some embodiments the jog is shapeable by the user prior to placing the catheter in the body lumen i.e. the user can fix the jog at the desired angle prior to use. As discussed further below the fixed jog can aid in steering the shaft to the point of interest. The shaft can include an outer sheath . The outer sheath can include a braided material such as stainless steel elgiloy cobalt chromium alloys carbon fiber or Kevlar. The braided material can improve the stiffness of the catheter to help navigate the catheter through vessel. Further the shaft can include a guidewire lumen see extending within a driveshaft see from the proximal end to the distal end of the catheter. The guidewire lumen can end in an opening in a distal tip of the device. The guidewire lumen can thus be configured to pass a guidewire therethrough. Further the distal tip can include an imaging sensor such as an OCT sensor configured to capture images within a lumen.

Referring to one variation of the distal end of the shaft can have a distal tip that is roughly corkscrew or helically shaped. The distal tip can thus include spiral flutes such as two spiral flutes. In this variation the distal tip rotates and does not extend or retract into a housing i.e. remains exposed from the shaft . The distal tip can be attached to a driveshaft that rotates within the outer sheath and can be configured to rotate in both the clockwise and counterclockwise directions. Further the distal tip can include a substantially smooth curved outer surface that presents an atraumatic tissue contacting surface when rotated in one direction i.e. the counterclockwise direction in and that further presents a sharp tissue cutting surface or edge when rotated in the opposite direction i.e. the clockwise direction in .

At least a portion of the tip such as the proximal portion of the tip i.e. the proximal portion of the cutting geometry can have a diameter that is substantially equal to or greater than the diameter of the shaft . That is the cutting edge can be helical such that at the distal end the diameter of the cutting geometry is reduced to the size of the guidewire lumen and gradually increases to the approximate outer diameter of the shaft as it moves proximally. Further the tip can be configured such that it cuts only in the forward direction and not substantially in the lateral direction. That is the cutting edge can be substantially forward facing.

An OCT imaging sensor including the distal end of the optical fiber and the mirror can be fixed to the rotatable distal tip and rotate with it. The distal end of the optical fiber can be secured in a notch formed in the rotatable distal tip . An epoxy or other securing material that has a refractive index appropriately mismatched with the end of the optical fiber can hold the end of the optical fiber in the notch as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 790 703 Publication No. US 2010 0305452 A1 incorporated by reference above. The imaging sensor can direct the optical beam for OCT imaging from the distal tip of the catheter into the tissue. In one embodiment the imaging system is oriented so that the mirror directs the optical beam approximately or substantially perpendicular to the catheter axis. In some variations this angle is different or is adjustable. For example the orientation of the mirror may be changed including adjusted by the user to change the direction of imaging and or image more distally or proximally. As used here substantially perpendicular may include plus or minus 10 degrees plus or minus 5 degrees or plus or minus 2 degrees off of the 90 degree angle that is perpendicular from the elongate axis of the distal tip and or catheter body.

The sensor can be located close the distal end of the tip such as just proximal to the cutting edge . For example the sensor can be located within 5 mm of the distal end of the tip such as less than 3 mm such as approximately 2 mm. Advantageously by minimizing the distance between the sensor and the distal end of the tip the resulting image will be a closer approximation of the exact tissue or material being passed by the distal end. The sensor may be directed laterally e.g. to image the sides of the vessel in which the catheter is traveling or angled forward or backward. The sensor can be located off of the central axis of the shaft and close to the outer diameter of the tip such as within 0.05 inches e.g. less than 0.3 inches less than 0.02 inches or less than or substantially equal to 0.01 inches of the outer diameter of the tip . Advantageously by having the sensor close to the outer diameter the depth that the OCT system can see into the tissue will be greater i.e. the amount of tissue lying within the OCT imaging range is increased.

As shown in the rotating tip is held in a chassis that is fixed relative to the shaft i.e. that does not rotate with the rotating tip . The chassis is any structure within which the distal tip can rotate and which secures the driveshaft and or the distal tip to the end of the shaft it may also be referred to as a housing. The outer sheath can be connected to the chassis such that the outer sheath also remains stationary while the distal tip rotates.

The chassis can have one or more window regions through which the OCT imaging sensor can view the tissue. For example as shown in the chassis can include three window regions separated by spines which may be referred to as posts struts dividers separators etc. arranged annularly around the chassis . These spines may serve as reference markers as the imaging sensor rotates as discussed below. The spines may be separated from one another by different distances. For example one of the windows may be larger than the other two or smaller than the other two. This asymmetric sizing may provide a visual reference on the display of the OCT imaging. Thus in one example there are three spines arranged such that there is a 90 window between the first and second spine a 90 degree window between the second and third spine and a 180 degree window between the first and third spine. The spines can have a predetermined and fixed location relative to the jog in the catheter. For example one of the spines can be aligned relative to the jog . In one embodiment shown in the second spine is aligned opposite to the jog i.e. such that the catheter points away from the second spine the inner curved portion of the jog is opposite to the second spine and the outer curved portion of the jog is axially aligned with the second spine . This alignment can be used to help orient the device in a specific direction with respect to the image and or vessel as discussed further below.

As shown in the distal tip can include a groove at the proximal end to engage a bushing e.g. annular ring . The bushing can remain fixed with respect to the shaft and may provide a lubricious surface to eliminate or reduce friction and fix the longitudinal position of the distal tip . The bushing may be made of PEEK or other hard lubricous material. In some embodiment the groove may be crimped or clamped to the stationary chassis thereby allowing the rotatable distal tip to have improved stability during rotation.

Referring to in another embodiment the bushing includes a shoulder . The shoulder can extend outward into the space between the distal edge of the chassis and the distal tip . The shoulder can be made of the same lubricous material as the rest of the bushing . The shoulder prevents the distal edge of the chassis from rubbing against the tip and further reduces the friction of the system.

As shown in the chassis may engage the groove of the distal tip directly such as by one or more tabs or locks that can be pushed in when the distal tip is held within the chassis to lock the bushing ring and distal tip in position. The chassis or distal tip can be made from a lubricious material.

Referring to the chassis can include one or more openings or ports out of which a clearing fluid such as saline or water may be driven to help clear the pathway for imaging the walls of the vessel lumen as the device is operated. Blood including red blood cells and other blood components may degrade the ability of the OCT imaging system from imaging other tissues because OCT may not readily see through blood. Thus the catheter may be configured to clear the blood from the region of interest i.e. the region where the optical beam is emitted from the catheter for OCT imaging. The ports can thus be configured to emit a clearing fluid from the catheter to clear blood from the imaging sensor. Thus in this variation the port is located directly adjacent to the imaging sensor and emits fluid to clear blood from the region where the optical beam is being emitted. The ports can be less than 2 mm from the imaging sensor such as less than 1.5 mm. Advantageously by having the ports close to the imaging sensor the pressure and amount of clearing fluid required to clear the blood from the region of interest can be low. For example less than 1 ml such as less than 0.5 ml e.g. less than 0.2 ml of clearing fluid can be required to clear the blood from the region of interest. Thus the required pressure may be nominal and the flow of saline or other clearing fluid may be minimal and still effectively clear blood from the imaging space greatly improving the resolution of the vessel walls and increasing the depth of penetration. Further using small amounts of clearing fluid can advantageously avoid problems associated with having too much fluid in a small space such as separation of tissue e.g. dissection .

The shaft can be configured such that the clearing fluid enters at the proximal end of the catheter and is transported to the distal end by flowing in a space between the outer sheath and the driveshaft . The clearing fluid may be pressurized from the proximal end e.g. using a syringe etc. so that it is pushed out of the opening to clear blood from the OCT pathway.

Referring to the OCT portion of the catheter device may be referred to as an off axis imaging system because the management of the OCT optical fiber is arranged asymmetrically off axis with reference to the long axis of the catheter. The fiber can be configured to extend freely within the shaft in the space between the driveshaft and the outer sheath except where it is attached at the distal end of the device e.g. at the rotatable distal tip . Accordingly as shown in when the driveshaft is rotated to rotate the distal tip the fiber can wrap around the driveshaft . This arrangement can advantageously enhance the flexibility i.e. allow for movement of the catheter without fracturing the optical fiber .

Because the optical fiber winds and unwinds around the driveshaft as it is rotated with the distal tip both the rate of rotation and the number of rotations may be controlled to optimize performance prevent the fiber from binding within the shaft and prevent the fiber from snapping due to excessive twisting or rotation. For example the distal tip may be configured to alternate its rotation from clockwise to counter clockwise. Thus the driveshaft can be configured to rotate with the distal tip clockwise for a fixed number of rotations and to rotate counterclockwise for the same number of rotation before switching back to clockwise rotations and repeating the process. The number of rotations in the clockwise direction can be substantially equivalent to the number of counter clockwise rotations in order to relieve any residual twisting. Advantageously by having a substantially equivalent number of rotations in the clockwise and counterclockwise directions accumulation of fiber twisting can be avoided thereby avoiding snapping of the fiber due to such accumulated twisting. In general the device is configured to rotate the distal tip n rotations clockwise and n rotations counterclockwise switching between clockwise and counterclockwise rotational direction after each n rotations. The number of rotations n can be any number including fractional typically between 1 and 100 preferably it is between 1 and 10 depending on the length of the catheter and the amount of stress the fiber can withstand. For example the device may be configured to rotate approximately 6 8.5 10 12.7 15 etc. times clockwise then counterclockwise the same number of rotations. Thus the device is configured so that it doesn t continuously spin clockwise or counterclockwise but has a limited number of rotations in either direction e.g. less than 25 rotations such as 10 rotations after which it automatically switches to rotate the other direction. The transition between clockwise and counterclockwise rotation may be performed automatically which is described in more detail with reference to below.

The rotation may be driven by a motor or other driver e.g. within the handle or it may be manual. Preferably the rotation is automatic and is driven at a constant speed that is typically between about 1 and 300 revolutions per minute rpm for example the rotation rate may be about 10 rpm 20 rpm 30 rpm 40 rpm 50 rpm 60 rpm etc. In some variations the distal tip is rotated between about 1 and about 100 rpm e.g. between about 1 and 80 rpm such as between about 30 and 60 rpm. The rate and the consistency of rotation may be optimized for penetration through the occlusion within the vessel for image stability and also to produce relatively streak free imaging using the OCT. Thus the rate of rotation may be limited to an upper limit speed that is held relatively constant. In addition the rate of rotation may be sufficiently low e.g. less than 150 or 100 or 50 rpm so that the distal head rotates but does not drill through the tissue including one or more occlusions. In some embodiments the user can control the rate of rotation such as by setting the motor to rotate at a particular speed.

Referring to the handle of the device can be configured to control rotation and advancement of the shaft . The handle can include a switch configured to turn the system on or off i.e. to start the rotation of the distal tip and or the imaging system . The handle can be covered by a housing which may be configured to conform to a hand or may be configured to lock into a holder e.g. for connection to a positioning arm a bed or gurney etc. . Within the handle a drive system including a motor and drive gears may drive the driveshaft to rotate the distal tip of the device and or the OCT imaging system relative to the shaft . In some variations the drive system is controlled or regulated by a toggling directional control subsystem for switching the direction of rotation of the driveshaft between the clockwise and counterclockwise direction for a predetermined number of rotations e.g. 10 .

In a mechanical directional control can be configured to switch the direction of rotation between clockwise and counterclockwise when the predetermined number of rotations have been completed. In this example the directional control includes a threaded track or screw which rotates to drive a nut in linear motion rotation of the threaded track by the motor results in linear motion of the nut along the rotating but longitudinally fixed threaded track . As the motor powers the driveshaft in a first rotational direction e.g. clockwise the nut moves linearly in a first linear direction e.g. forward until it hits one arm of a U shaped toggle switch driving the U shaped toggle switch in the first linear direction and flipping a switch visible in to change the direction of the motor to a second rotational direction e.g. counterclockwise and causing the nut to move linearly in a second linear direction e.g. backward until it hits the opposite side of the U shape toggle switch triggering the switch to again change the direction of rotation back to the first rotational direction e.g. clockwise . This process may be repeated continuously as the motor is rotated. The motor may be configured to rotate the driveshaft in either direction at a constant speed. The system may also include additional elements e.g. signal conditioners electrical control elements etc. to regulate the motor as it switches direction.

The number of threads and or length of the threaded track screw may determine the number of rotations that are made by the system between changes in rotational direction. For example the number of rotations may be adjusted by changing the width of the U shaped toggle e.g. the spacing between the arms . Lengthening the arms or increasing the pitch of the screw would increase the number of rotational turns between changes in direction n . The toggle may therefore slide from side to side in order to switch the direction of the motor. The length of the nut can also determine the number of rotations that are made by the system between changes in rotational direction i.e. the longer the nut the fewer the number of rotations before switching direction.

In some variations the motor is rotated in a constant direction and the switch between clockwise and counterclockwise is achieved by switching between gearing systems engaging and disengaging an additional gear or using gears that mechanically change the direction that the driveshaft is driven.

In the exemplary device shown in the drive system includes the motor and three gears that engage each other to drive the driveshaft in rotation. For example the motor rotates a first gear which is engaged with a second gear shown in this example as a 1 1 gearing although any other gear ratio may be used as appropriate . A third gear engages with the second gear . The third gear may drive or regulate an encoder for encoding the rotational motion. This encoded information may in turn be used by the drive system providing feedback to the drive system or may be provided to the imaging system.

Referring to the cabling can include both a fluid flush line configured to be attached to a fluid source and an optical fiber configured to be connected to the OCT system. The flush line and the fiber can both run through the handle . The fiber and the flush line can be bonded at a bonding point in the handle creating a seal to prevent fluid from leaking into the handle. The flush line can end at the bonding point allowing the fluid to exit the flush line and continue down the shaft in the space between the outer sheath and the driveshaft . Further the fiber can extend through the bonding point and wrap around the driveshaft in the space . As shown because the fiber is configured to wrap around the guidewire lumen a separate fiber management system is not necessary. In some embodiments a protective coating can surround the optical fiber until distal of the bonding point .

Referring to the fiber can be connected at the proximal end to a common path OCT system . The common path OCT system includes a light source such as a swept frequency laser. In an alternative arrangement the light source could be a broadband light source such as a super luminescent diode to conduct Time Domain OCT or Spectral Domain OCT using an optical spectrometer . The optical fiber transfers radiation from the light source to the target . The optical fiber is in optical contact with an interface medium i.e. the light exiting the optical fiber and entering the interface medium sees only one interface. In some embodiments as shown in the end of the optical fiber is embedded in the interface medium . The interface medium can be for example a glue or epoxy. In the common path OCT system the index of refraction of the interface medium is different than the index of refraction of the core of the optical fiber . This creates a Fresnel reflection in which part of the light exits the core and part of the light is reflected back. Some of the light beam that exits the optical fiber will encounter the target and be reflected or scattered by the target . Some of this reflected or scattered light will in turn reenter the tip of the optical fiber and travel back down the fiber in the opposite direction. A Faraday isolation device such as a Faraday Effect optical circulator can be used to separate the paths of the outgoing light source signal and the target and reference signals returning from the distal end of the fiber. The reflected or scattered target light and the Fresnel reflected reference light from the fiber face can travel back to a detector located at the proximal end of the optical fiber .

Because the reflected or scattered target light in the OCT system travels a longer distance than the Fresnel reflected reference light the reflected or scattered target light can be displaced by frequency phase and or time with respect to the reference beam. For example if swept source radiation is used then the light from the target will be displaced in frequency. The difference in displacement in phase time or frequency between the reflected or scattered target light and the reference light can be used to derive the path length difference between the end of the optical fiber tip and the light reflecting or light scattering region of the target. In the case of swept source OCT the displacement is encoded as a beat frequency heterodyned on the carrier reference beam.

The light source can operate at a wavelength within the biological window where both hemoglobin and water do not strongly absorb the light i.e. between 800 nm and 1.4 m. For example the light source can operate at a center wavelength of between about 1300 nm and 1400 nm such as about 1310 nm to 1340 nm. The optical fiber can be a single mode optical fiber for the ranges of wavelengths provided by the light source .

On the left is an OCT image . To obtain the OCT image the distal tip of the catheter rotates at approximately 30 rpm and the OCT system provides a continuous set of images as the catheter rotates within the vessel. The images are combined into a continuously updated OCT image that corresponds to the inside of the lumen in which the catheter is inserted. That is the OCT image is an image trace of the interior of the vessel just proximal to the distal tip as it rotates. The line extending to almost 12 o clock in the figure indicates the current direction of the OCT laser beam as it is rotating. The circle in the middle of the image represents the diameter of the catheter and thus the area surrounding the circle indicates the vessel. The OCT imaging can extend more than 1 mm from the imaging sensor such as approximately 2 mm or approximately 3 mm and thus will extend into the walls of the vessel particularly in the closer region of the vessel so that the different layers of the vessel may be imaged. In this figure the three striped rays extending at approximately 2 o clock between 7 and 8 o clock and approximately 11 o clock indicate the location of the three spines of the catheter and thus may act as directional markers indicating the orientation of the distal end of the catheter within the body. As described in more detail below the user may also be able to determine relative orientation of the OCT image relative to the patient s body orientation using these striped rays .

On the bottom left of the image is a waterfall view of the OCT image as it circles the radius of the body. This waterfall image may be particularly useful in some applications of the system for example indicating the relative longitudinal position of a feature e.g. layered structures occlusions branching region etc. as the device is moved longitudinally within the vessel. The waterfall view typically includes a time axis the x axis while the y axis shows the image from the OCT sensor. In addition the waterfall view may provide an indication of when the catheter has crossed an occlusion. For example the waterfall view may show the patient s heartbeat when the walls of the vessel move relative to the heartbeat. In these cases the waterfall view may show the walls of the vessel moving with the heartbeat. In contrast when the distal tip is within an occlusion the wall of the vessel the waterfall view will not show movement of the walls since the occlusion material typically prevents the movement of the walls due to the heartbeat while in healthy vessels the heartbeat is apparent. Thus it may be possible to determine when the catheter has crossed the occlusion based on the waterfall view . In some variations this effect may be automated to provide an indication of when the device is within or has crossed an occlusion. In general crossing the boundary of a total occlusion is not well defined and may result in inadvertently dissecting the vessel. When the catheter is within the true lumen the vessel wall may move if the catheter tip is not in the true lumen all or part of the vessel wall will not move. Thus this movement of the wall during heartbeat may reflect the position within the true versus false lumen.

The generated fluoroscopy images and OCT images can be oriented relative to one another e.g. so that what the user sees on the right side of the OCT image is consistent with what the user sees on the right side of the fluoroscopy image. Referring to the shaft can include a fluoroscopy marker also shown in and that provides varying contrast in a fluoroscopy image depending on its radial orientation. The marker may be a radiopaque band with one or more asymmetric features such as a C T or dog bone shape that can be used to radially orient the shaft because the fluoroscopic image of the marker will change depending on its orientation. The fluoroscopy marker can have a fixed location relative to the spines and or the jog . For example as shown in the fluoroscopy marker can be aligned opposite to the jog and or axially aligned with the second spine described above. The fluoroscopy marker can be used to align a fluoroscopy image with an OCT image during use of the catheter.

As shown in to align the fluoroscopy image with the OCT image the shaft can be rotated slightly such that the marker is aligned to a particular side of the screen such as at the 9 o clock position. The up down position of the catheter i.e. whether the catheter is pointed down as shown in or pointed up can also be determined. After the rotational position and the up down position of the catheter have been determined using the fluoroscopy image the OCT image can then be oriented such that striped ray from the middle marker the second spine described above of the shaft is also at the 9 o clock position in the OCT image . Such positioning can be termed fluorosyncing. Fluorosyncing can be performed using manual input from the user such as information regarding the up down position and the rotational position or can be performed automatically. To orient the OCT image using this information the software may draw the OCT image either in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction depending on the up down orientation of the catheter in the fluoroscopy image and will rotate the image 90 180 or 270 depending on the rotational position of the catheter in the fluoroscopy image .

Once the fluorosync has been completed the absolute and relative position and orientation of the catheter within the patient s body may be determined. The markers on the chassis imaging system visible in the OCT system may therefore provide sufficient orientation markers such that the fluoroscopic imaging may be reduced.

The displayed images can be used in combination with steering mechanisms such as the OCT markers the fluoroscopy marker and the fixed jog of the device to steer the catheter and rotatable tip to the desired location. Referring to the OCT image shows healthy tissue in the form of a layered structure and non healthy tissue in the form of a nonlayered structure. The cat ears in the image show a region between the healthy and unhealthy tissue caused by a slight expansion of the vessel around the catheter at that location. Accordingly during a CTO procedure one goal may be to steer the catheter towards the unhealthy tissue. Because the middle spine is aligned opposite to the jog as shown in the ray corresponding to the middle spine can be oriented opposite to the non healthy tissue to steer the catheter in the correct direction. shows the catheter deflected toward the layered healthy tissue. shows the catheter rotated such that it is deflected toward the unhealthy non layered structure. Thus the system may be configured to allow the orientation of the catheter to be rotated into the correct position using the fixed directional markers from the chassis that are visualized by the OCT. In some variations the distal end of the device may be steerable and may be steered while still rotating the distal end of the device.

Additional steering members may also be included such as a selective stiffening member which may be withdrawn inserted to help steer the device and or one or more tendon members to bend extend the device for steering.

Image correction can be performed on the resulting OCT images in order to mask out unwanted or unnecessary portions of the image. For example referring to the fiber can be configured such that it ends within the shaft . As a result the fiber will image the distance c between the fiber distal end and the mirror as well as the axial distance c between the mirror and the outer diameter of the shaft . The resulting image would therefore include portions that correspond to the interior of the shaft. Accordingly image processing can be performed such that distance c c or c c is masked out in the displayed image. In the case where c and c are masked out only the area c would show up on the image where the total imaging distance or capability of the fiber is equal to c c c . For example up to 100 pixels can be masked out such as between 20 and 60 pixels for example approximately 40 pixels.

Additional image processing is possible. For example the image can be corrected to account for lag of the optical fiber in the amount of rotation at the handle vs. at the distal end of the catheter. Images for lag correction can be captured automatically. Further images can be exported and stored for example in a movie format. The images can optionally viewed in adjustable grayscale. Further the speed of the waterfall view can be adjusted. In some variations and offset or ghost image may be overlaid atop the OCT to indicate the difference between the predicted and actual rotational orientation of the catheter.

The catheter variation described immediately above provides an internal motor for rotating the distal tip. In some variations a manually rotatable device may be used with an adjunctive device providing a motorized movement of the distal tip. In this variation the handle portion of the device may set and be secured within a housing that includes a motor and gearing to automatically rotate the distal tip at a predetermined or adjustable speed. Thus this motorized accessory device may adapt an otherwise manual device to automatically rotate.

In some variations the rotatable distal tip includes a fixed or rotatable housing from which dissection elements may extend or retract. An imaging element such as an OCT imaging element may be included in this embodiment as well. Referring to in some variations wedges may be extended from a rotatable distal tip . In the device is shown with the wedges retracted into the rotatable distal tip . In the wedges have been extended from the housing . The distal end of the device can be shared and is shown deflecting upwards steering in one plane in while the wedges are extended from the housing.

Both the distal tip and the wedges can be configured to rotate. The wedges which may be sharp blades or may be blunt can be extended from the distal housing and locked in any position extended partially extended or retracted and rotated clockwise and or counterclockwise while locked in a retracted extended or partially extended position.

The wedges may be fully or partially retracted into a distal housing. The extension of the wedge from the distal housing may be limited. For example the wedges may be prevented from extending fully out of the distal housing thereby preventing material such as a plaque or tissue from getting caught between the wedges and the housing.

The wedges at the distal end may be referred to as a blade or blades even though they may be substantially blunt. In some variations the wedges are configured so that they are forward cutting but not side cutting. This means that they may include a forward facing cutting edge and the more lateral edges may be blunted or less sharp. In some variations the rotating distal tip includes only a single wedge rather than multiple wedges. The wedge blade may be helically arranged at the distal tip.

In one embodiment the rotating distal end comprises two or more wedges that are radially separated around the tip region e.g. spaced equally apart radially . It may be advantageous to have three or more wedges spaced around the tip which may improve centering of the device as described herein.

In the examples provided above the distal tip of the device is rotated through multiple complete rotations both clockwise and counterclockwise to move the distal tip and or any attached imaging sensor in rotation around the elongate longitudinal axis of the device. In some variations the distal tip of the device including the atherectomy devices described below may be rotated through partial rotations. This is illustrated in . In this example a driveshaft rotates continuously in one direction e.g. clockwise but this one directional rotation is translated at the distal end of the device into oscillating motion.

In operation rotation of the driveshaft will rotate the camming member as illustrated in pushing the oscillation rotating element first clockwise then counterclockwise to subtend an arc within the outer housing. This motion thereby allows scanning of the OCT imaging system across this arc. The larger the camming member and or the greater offset of the driveshaft and the camming member the greater the arc traversed by the oscillation rotating element .

As mentioned above any of the catheters described herein may be used to treat peripheral vascular disease. In particular the catheters may be used to place one or more guidewires across an occlusion so that the occlusion may be imaged removed and or displaced. Referring to in some variations the devices described herein are centering or self centering within the lumen of the vessel. The vessel shown in cross section on the left a transverse section on the right of each figure includes the media e.g. tunica media surrounded by adventitia e.g. tunica adventitia . During operation it is desirable that the devices remain centered within the true lumen the center of the vessel as shown in rather than a false lumen i.e. the region between the adventitia and media as shown in . If the catheter device does end up in the sub intimal plane e.g. false lumen as illustrated in the device may reside between the media on one side and the adventitia on the other. To ensure that the devices described herein end up in the true lumen the devices may be configured for both passive centering self centering and active centering including a centering mechanism .

In some configurations the devices described herein are self centering and are thus configured to help maintain the catheter e.g. the tip of the catheter within the true lumen. When used to treat chronic total occlusions the manually or automatically rotatable distal end of the catheter may guide the catheter in the true lumen especially when the reaching the distal cap of a lesion. For example because the diameter of the rotating distal end may be at least equal to the diameter of the more proximal regions of the elongate body of the device the tip may be sufficiently blunt to passive self center within the lumen of a vessel. However if the device does end up within the false lumen it can be configured to self center back into the true lumen. That is the elastic nature of adventitia typically prevents the tip from engaging and tearing the tissue. At the same time it is easy for the rotating tip to engage with the media if it is presented in the front of the device which may include the tissue cutting surface s . Thus the rotating tip may selectively dissect its way through the media and not through adventitia. Once the device dissects its way through the medial it returns to the true lumen.

Although centering self centering of the catheter may result from the rotation of the distal end for the dimensions of the devices illustrated herein one or more additional centering features may also be used to help the device to stay in true lumen of the blood vessel. Thus in some variations the catheter may be configured for use with one or more centering features to help prevent the distal tip from leaving the true lumen. The centering feature may project from the distal tip the lateral sides of the distal tip or the lateral sides of the distal end region e.g. proximal to the distal tip.

In some variations the centering feature is a balloon that expands or is expandable inflatable or otherwise extendable from the lateral sides of the distal end region of the device to keep the distal tip centered in the lumen. The device may also be deflectable or steerable at the distal tip region as previously described and or may include one or more sensors e.g. OCT imaging as described above to help detect when the tip is approaching or has passed into the false lumen or otherwise left the true lumen.

For example illustrates one variation of a catheter as described in patent application U.S. Ser. No. 12 689 748 previously incorporated by reference which may have a rotating distal tip region. shows a catheter similar to the catheter of but including a balloon located proximal to the rotating distal tip. Although only this catheter design is shown with the centering mechanism it is to be understood that the centering mechanism could apply to any of the catheter configurations described herein. In some variations the balloon may cover or extend over the rotating distal tip region. In this example the distal end region proximal to the distal tip that rotates may include a balloon that is collapsed around the outer diameter of the catheter shaft but may be inflated and expanded against the walls of the vessel. In addition to centering the distal end of the catheter shaft expanding the balloon may also expand the opening or passageway through the vessel. This may in turn improve treatment outcomes with the device perhaps by loosening or preparing the atheroma or other occlusion for removal or displacement. In the proximal region of the catheter shaft includes a port for example a y type connector for inflation fluid that may be use to inflate and deflate the balloon . Any appropriate inflation fluid may be used including water saline lubricant dye or some combination of these.

In this example the catheter is fabricated similarly to the catheters described previously i.e. to include an inner lumen for passage of a guidewire surrounded by a driveshaft for rotating oscillating the distal tip and again surrounded by an outer diameter jacket e.g. of a flexible braided stainless steel polymer etc. . Referring to prior to lamination of the outer jacket on the outer catheter an additional tube to form the inflation lumen e.g. a 0.011 ID polyimide tube is fused along the side of the outer catheter during lamination. A mandrel e.g. a 0.009 stainless steel mandrel may be inserted during assembly processing to insure patency of the inflation lumen and removed upon completion.

A balloon e.g. formed by nylon extrusion may be attached near the distal end e.g. proximal to the distal end of the catheter as illustrated in and also . The balloon can have a nominal dimension of approximately 10 cm in length and a diameter of 5 mm expanded . The balloon has two rounded shoulder regions one at the proximal end and one at the distal end in some variations one or both ends may be tapered. In the inflation lumen ends between the proximal and distal end of the balloon e.g. near the center of the balloon and terminates in a skived opening to allow entry exit of inflation material. In some variations the balloon has a slightly smaller diameter at the proximal end compared to the distal end to compensate for the missing inflation lumen at the distal end thus the overall outer diameter of the catheter may be remain relatively constant.

The balloon may be fused to the outer portion of the distal end of the catheter as shown in . For example a short length of PEBAX tubing may be added to the shaft at the locations where the distal and proximal ends legs of the balloon will be located. These PEBAX lengths may be used to ensure that enough material seals and fuses the balloon to the outer shaft. and C show the fused proximal rear leg and distal front leg regions of the balloon. Prior to fusing the balloon to the shaft the inflation lumen polyimide tube is skived at the distal end to correspond to a location of the distal inflation deflation hole approximately midway along the length of the balloon . The balloon may be folded sealed and or heat set e.g. to maintain the small delivery diameter etc. . For example the balloon may be pleated folded and heat set.

The dimensions of the entire catheter including the balloon and distal end region may be adjusted. In one example the dimensions un inflated are approximately proximal shaft has a diameter between about 0.074 inches and 0.084 inches the mid shaft region has a diameter between about 0.074 inches and 0.079 inches the proximal balloon leg has a diameter between about 0.085 inches and 0.094 inches the distal balloon leg has a diameter between about 0.079 inches and 0.085 inches and the mid region of the balloon over the inflation lumen has a diameter between about 0.077 inches and 0.085 inches. The double wall thickness of the balloon is approximately 0.0045 inches and the catheter has a length from the distal end of the proximal assembly to the distal tip of the device of 111 cm while the length from the distal end of the Y arm to the distal tip of the device is approximately 91 cm. When inflated to 6 atm pressure the balloon has a proximal diameter of about 0.218 inches a mid diameter of approximately 0.211 inches and a distal diameter of approximately 0.210 inches at 10 atm in this example the proximal diameter was about 0.222 inches the mid diameter was approximately 0.216 inches and the distal diameter was approximately 0.215 inches.

Other variations of centering feature may be used as well not limited to the annular toroidal balloon described above. For example in some variations one or more arms may extend from the outer shaft of the device and apply lateral force against the walls of the vessel to center it within the lumen. Alternatively a coil located near the distal end and coiling around the distal end region may be expanded to extend loops outward and center the device. Any appropriate material including shape memory materials e.g. nickel titanium may be used and the centering feature may be configured to be atraumatic when contacting the vessel lumen e.g. having rounded or flat large diameter tissue contacting surfaces etc. .

The guidewire positioning devices described herein may be configured as single use over the wire devices. For example the device may be compatible other guidewires of standard sizes used in minimally invasive procedures. The outer diameter of the elongate device including the distal end region may fit within a F sheath. The devices may be used with any appropriate guidewire including steerable guidewires. For example the guidewire may be a 0.035 guidewire. These devices may generally be described as steering a guidewire although they may be used with a guidewire within the catheter or the guidewire may be positioned within the device after the catheter has been positioned.

In general these devices may provide support and guidance for positioning a guidewire across an occlusion. As described herein the devices may support probing and exchange of an assortment of guidewires by traversing an occlusion in a vessel. Typically the catheters are inserted ahead of the guidewire or with the guidewire retracted within the catheter to provide a safe pathway thorough the occluded vessel and thereby reduce or eliminate unnecessary damage to the vessel. In addition the devices described herein may be used to deliver contrast. The internal lumen which may be used by the guidewire and or the outer lumen may also be used for local dye or fluoroscopic contrast injections without removing the device from the vessel.

In operation the rotating oscillating distal tip allows the device to be passed through an occlusion such as a plaque occluding a blood vessel or artery without requiring removal of the plaque. Thus the device may be used to bluntly form a pathway through a plaque using the retractable extendable rotating wedges at the distal tip or simply using the rotating distal tip alone. The cutting edges at the distal tip may also allow for helical and blunt micro dissection. It is important to note that the catheter may be used without substantially dissecting or cutting the tissue and that the distal tip is not necessarily intended and may not remove tissue but merely form a passage through an occluded vessel. Once in position the guidewire may be used to insert other devices including atherectomy catheters.

In some variations the cutting edges at the distal tip are sharp e.g. cutting or knife edged while in other variations the cutting edges are substantially blunt. The cutting edges are typically curved around or along the longitudinal axis of the distal tip. For example the cutting edge may extend helically around the distal tip end of the device.

In some variations the catheters described herein may be used e.g. inserted in to the body in a F guide sheath for placement into the body. In general the elongate catheter is flexible and the outer surface s may be coated so that the catheter can be readily inserted into a lumen of a sheath catheter or directly into a body lumen. The elongate outer sheath is typically tubular and may be coated either or both inner and outer diameter surfaces with a protective cover. The elongate outer sheath may be referred to as a shaft e.g. catheter shaft and may be coated with a lubricious material or may be formed of a smooth and or lubricious material.

In some variations the distal tip of the catheter is retractable into an expanded approximately toroidal shaped distal balloon that is expanded proximal to the distal tip. This variation may allow re centering or re orientation of the catheter.

As noted above the distal end of the catheters described herein may be steerable. The distal end region may be steerable in any appropriate manner. In particular the distal end region may be steerable by defecting in one direction e.g. down or in more than one direction e.g. down up right left etc. . The degree of deflection may also be controlled. In some variations the tip may be deflected a maximum of 10 degrees 15 degrees 20 degrees 25 degrees 30 degrees 45 degrees 60 degrees 90 degrees or any angle there between. In some variations the distal end region of the device is pre biased to be straight. Therefore the straight configuration of the distal tip may be restored once the deflection controlled at the proximal end is restored to the straight configuration. In addition to be deflectable in some variations the distal end of the device is flexible. The end region may include the tip e.g. the rotating tip or it may include the region immediately proximal to the tip. In general the tip region may refer to the rotatable tip region at the distal end. The deflection may be performed by any appropriate method including a pullwire coupled to a hinged distal region a prebiased curve which can be released e.g. by a pullwire etc. etc.

Deflection or steering of the distal end may help with re entry of the device. For example the deflectable steerable distal end region which may be referred to as the steerable tip may allow the catheter to re enter the true lumen of the vessel if it becomes subintimal e.g. if it extends into the fascia or region around the vessel .

In some variations as described above the distal region of the catheter is prebent e.g. includes a jog. In other variations the catheter includes a bendable distal end. Steering these catheters may be aided by visualization and may include rotating the length of the catheter body which may be guided by imaging. Rotation or turning of the catheter body may be used to orient the distal tip region because of the bend in the catheter in both fixed bend and bendable catheters.

In general the proximal handle may act as an interface with the operator and may include one or more controls. The handle region may also include connections to power e.g. in automatic rotating oscillating variations imaging e.g. connection to imaging source and processing or the like.

The devices described herein may be any appropriate length but relatively short length catheters may be particularly useful. For example the device may be approximately 100 cm allowing the device to reach any occlusion down to the popliteal and ease physician handling outside the body. In other variations the device is between about 50 and 150 cm between about 70 and 120 cm etc.

As mentioned the distal tip may be driven by an elongate driveshaft or torque shaft that extends the length of the device. This driveshaft is typically robust allowing increased torque precision and manipulation during the operation. For example the torque shaft may be made of a braided stainless steel material having a hollow lumen forming or surrounding a central e.g. guidewire lumen of the device . Rotation of the driveshaft typically drives the distal tip rotation. The driveshaft is typically flexible and connects to the rotational control at the proximal end e.g. handle . The distal tip including the wedges and housing may rotate both clockwise and counterclockwise.

The handle region at the proximal end of the device may also be adapted for handheld use. In particular the controls at the handle region may be adapted so that the device may be manipulated by a single hand. In some variations the handle region may also include one or more indicators or displays for displaying the status of the distal end of the device. For example the handle may include an indicator indicating the extent to which the wedges are extended from the distal tip. The indicator may be a dial slider or the like. The indicator may be marked or unmarked. The proximal handle may be otherwise configured to be handheld. For example the controls may be clustered or located at one end of the handle with a gripper region at the other end. For example the controls may be clustered at the proximal portion of the handle allowing the distal portion of the handle to be gripped in the palm of the hand and manipulated by the thumb and forefinger of the right.

In general the elongate outer sheath of the catheter is flexible and may be coated so that it can be readily inserted into a lumen of a sheath catheter or directly into a body lumen. For example the elongate outer sheath of the catheter may be formed of a braided stainless steel a polymer or the like. The elongate outer sheath is typically tubular and may be coated either or both inner and outer diameter with a protective cover. The elongate outer sheath may be referred to as a shaft e.g. catheter shaft and may be coated with a lubricious material or may be formed of a smooth and or lubricious material.

The dimensions of the devices described herein including in the figures may be varied while staying within the scope of the invention as generally described. Unless otherwise indicated these dimensions are intended as merely illustrative and not limiting.

As mentioned briefly above various aspects of the devices described herein provide substantially benefits compared to other device which may be used in occluded vessels including rotating devices. For example the forward cutting blades may prevent cutting on the sides walls of the lumen. This configuration may also help with self centering as mentioned. In addition the device may be configured so that the diameter of the blade e.g. wedge region is the same as the diameter of the rest of the catheter. Thus the diameter of the distal end having the rotatable wedge is maximized so that the blades are the same crossing profile as the rest of the catheter which may allow for optimal engagement within the occlusion in the vessel.

In some variations the guidewire lumen described herein is not central but is offset along all or a portion of the length of the device. The lumen or a separate lumen may also be used to pass a material such as a contrast dye saline an imaging device etc. An outer lumen may surround the inner guidewire lumen and may enclose this space to form a separate lumen in which one or more additional lumens e.g. inflation lumen in variations including a balloon or expandable feature may be included a driveshaft for rotating or controlling rotation of the distal tip may also be included.

As described above the proximal end of the device typically includes a handle region that may be used to control the distal end. For example the device may include a rotation control a wedge articulation control and or a steering control. In some variations these controls may be combined into one or more controls or these functions may be distributed or divided between different controls. Any appropriate control may be used including slides knobs dials buttons levers switches etc. In some variations the controls may be automated or computer controlled. In some variations a driver e.g. motor mechanical driver etc. may be used to drive the controls. For example rotation of the distal tip region may be driven by a motor and may be geared or otherwise controlled. The rotation may be manually or automatically controlled.

One variation of an atherectomy catheter which may be used after placement of a guidewire as described above is illustrated in and described below. In general an atherectomy catheter may access the vasculature using conventional catheterization techniques employing sheath and or guiding catheter access and tracking over a positioned guidewire. The device may track through the vasculature to the target lesion. A fiber e.g. a Single Mode fiber can be positioned at or near the distal assembly of the device and to enable imaging e.g. OCT imaging to be used for lesion assessment and treatment planning. For example the device may be rotationally oriented toward the diseased sector of the artery and activated using proximal physician controls to preferentially expose the cutting edge to the diseased tissue. In the variation described herein a circular cutter will begin rotational movement at approximately 10 to 10000 revolutions per minute rpm of the driveshaft. The device may be translated through the lesion to plane and cut the diseased tissue while the OCT image provides real time feedback regarding wall and disease characterization cutter apposition and relative cut depth. During the cutting pass the tissue may travel through the circular hollow cutter into a tissue reservoir that is distal to the cutter. Upon completing the cutting pass proximal controls may be used to articulate the device returning the cutter to its shielded position for further delivery and placement. Multiple runs through this procedure may occur to fully treat the disease.

In some variations at least some portions of the device can be hollow. Accordingly the cutter can cut tissue from the wall of the artery pass directly through the hollow portions and be stored in a tissue storage area such as tissue storage area .

Referring to the driveshaft can be directly connected to the circumferential cutter and to an auger or Archimedean screw. The driveshaft can thus transmit torque to the cutter while allowing tissue to pass through the hollow cutter as it is rotated. In this configuration as the cutter is advanced across a tissue lesion in a pull to cut configuration and the cutter cuts the tissue from the vessel wall. With continued advancement of the cutter auger assembly tissue is then passed through the inner hollow diameter of the cutter . As the tissue advances to the rotating auger component the tissue is then cut into segments by the cutting edge of the auger component and passed into the tissue storage area distal to the auger .

The system depicted in shows the auger component configured in a helical geometry. However the auger component can have other configurations. For example show an auger component that is capable of shearing tissue segments when rotated in either the clockwise or counterclockwise direction. The auger can be substantially T shaped with two cutting edges . Rotation of the auger component in either the clockwise or counterclockwise direction would thus cause shearing of tissue. Advantageously by having two cutting edges the auger component can shear tissue two times per rotation of the driveshaft . The auger component can further include angled surfaces configured to push cut tissue distally into the tissue storage area . Because the auger component can cut in both the clockwise and counterclockwise directions it can work even if the driveshaft oscillates between clockwise and counterclockwise directions as described above with respect to the driveshaft . In this configuration the cutter edge can be configured for optimal cutting efficiency and is not limited to traditional continuously rotating cutters.

Specifications of the driveshaft may balance flexibility to navigate tortuous anatomy and torsional tensile compressive rigidity to drive distal mechanisms through hard calcified tissues or tight lesions. In either the continuously rotating configuration or the oscillatory cutting configuration the cutter concept can be configured in a push to cut configuration where the catheter is advanced to perform the cutting operation. Conversely the cutter concept can also be configured in a pull to cut configuration where the catheter is retracted to perform the cutting operation. For the illustration purposes only the description herein focuses on the pull to cut embodiment though it should be clear that push to cut variations may be used as well. Common to all described embodiments minimal longitudinal motion and translational deflection of the tip mechanism such that the tissue entry window is mainly defined by the vertical distance from the shear component base to the cutter edge. This may prevent increased tissue invagination into the exposed tissue entry point with increased apposition force. Depth of cut will then remain relatively constant at varied force of engagement between cutter and tissue.

In a pull to cut configuration the cutting edge orientation may be such that cutting of tissue is performed with longitudinal movement of catheter distal to proximal.

In some variations the auger mechanism may be configured to function in a continuously rotating system where the auger is configured with a helical geometry . When oscillating the direction of rotation of the device driveshaft the auger may assume a geometry that is capable of shearing tissue segments in either direction of rotation.

As described above any of these catheters may include imaging including the atherectomy catheters. The imaging element can provide a cross sectional view of vessel wall morphology in the cutting plane. Ultrasound and or optical imaging technologies may be used. Optical Coherence Tomography OCT is one preferred method of image guidance. The OCT technology currently embodied on prototype devices is capable of achieving approximate 10 micron lateral resolution and requires fiber optic assembly diameters below 0.010 inches.

The device may thus include on board and real time image guidance capabilities. This capability may require an imaging element or energy emitting assembly to be positioned at the distal portion of the device such that local images of the vessel may guide device usage. The distal energy emitter s may be positioned in multiple locations in fixed positions or embodied in a mating assembly that may translate in an eccentric lumen or in the hollow lumen of the driveshaft. The emitter may send and receive relevant light or sound signals at 90 degrees from the catheter axis or at angles up to approximately 50 degrees to visualize distal or proximal wall features from a fixed position.

The emitting element may be positioned distal and or proximal to the cutting edge. In a pull to cut configuration proximal placement would provide information during a cutting pass prior to the cutter interacting with the tissue and therefore allow the physician to stop or continue cutting as disease changes in depth and or position. Distal placement would also provide guidance regarding cut quality depth and cutting efficiency.

Furthermore the data collected at the distal end of the catheter after transmitted and appropriately processed may drive an automated means of cutter actuation. Increased amounts of disease detected by the software may automatically increase open distance between the cutter edge and the tip mechanism therefore increasing cut depth. Oscillatory cutter speeds may be adjusted according to feedback from the imaging system.
