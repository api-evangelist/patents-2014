After receiving the authentication request the authentication and authorization server subsystem generates authentication information and transmits back to the authentication and authorization client subsystem wherein the authentication information comprises a secret and a certificate. The authentication and authorization client subsystem protects the authorization request used to request a second device not shown in for the authorization and transmits the authorization request to the authentication and authorization server subsystem .

The authentication and authorization server subsystem authenticates the authorization request. After authenticating the authorization request the authentication and authorization server subsystem generates an authorization information and transmits the authorization information to the authentication and authorization client subsystem wherein the authorization information comprises a secret shared with the first device and the second device and an authorization certificate authorized by the first device. The authentication and authorization client subsystem transmits the authorization information to the first device through the API so that the first device may communicate with the second device directly according to the authorization information.

It should be noted that in the first embodiment the first device may be an application and the second device may be a service. In another embodiment the first device and second device may belong to a component.

In the second embodiment the local temporary management subsystem is used to store the authentication information when the authentication and authorization client subsystem receives the authentication information transmitted from the authentication and authorization server subsystem . In the second embodiment the system may comprise a plurality of authentication and authorization server subsystems . When any authentication and authorization server subsystem is started the authentication and authorization server subsystem may transmit a registration message to the server proxy subsystem to request for a registration. On the contrary when any authentication and authorization server subsystem is stopped the authentication and authorization server subsystem may transmit a cancellation message to the server proxy subsystem. to cancel the registration. The server proxy subsystem stores information of the authentication and authorization server subsystem and finds an authentication and authorization server subsystem corresponding to the authentication and authorization client subsystem from the plurality of authentication and authorization server subsystem according to the information of the authentication and authorization server subsystem .

In a particular embodiment when the first device transmits an authentication request to the client the authentication and authorization client subsystem may determine whether the local temporary management subsystem stores the authentication information. When determining that the local temporary storage management subsystem stores the authentication information and the authentication information is available the authentication and authorization client subsystem transmits the authentication information to the first device and does not trigger a process that the client requests the server for the authentication. When determining that the local temporary storage management subsystem does not store the authentication information or the authentication information stored in the local temporary storage management subsystem is unavailable the authentication and authorization client subsystem transmits the authentication request to the authentication and authorization server subsystem to obtain an updated authentication information and store in the local temporary storage management subsystem .

In another embodiment the authentication and authorization client subsystem can detect whether the authentication information stored in the local temporary storage management subsystem has expired or is unavailable.
