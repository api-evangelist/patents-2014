The present invention generally relates to online communication with an audience and more specifically to systems and methods for efficiently and effectively generating a web presence that conveys desired information to various requesters and facilitates user interaction with the requesters.

The Internet comprises a vast number of computers and computer networks that are interconnected through communication links. The interconnected computers exchange information using various services. In particular a server computer system referred to herein as a web server may connect through the Internet to a remote client computer system and may send to the remote client computer system upon request one or more websites containing one or more graphical and textual web pages of information. A request is made to the web server by visiting the website s address known as a Uniform Resource Locator URL . Upon receipt the requesting device can display the web pages. The request and display of the websites are typically conducted using a browser. A browser is a special purpose application program that effects the requesting of web pages and the displaying of web pages.

Browsers are able to locate specific websites because each website resource and computer on the Internet has a unique Internet Protocol IP address. Presently there are two standards for IP addresses. The older IP address standard often called IP Version 4 IPv4 is a 32 bit binary number which is typically shown in dotted decimal notation where four 8 bit bytes are separated by a dot from each other e.g. 64.202.167.32 . The notation is used to improve human readability. The newer IP address standard often called IP Version 6 IPv6 or Next Generation Internet Protocol IPng is a 128 bit binary number. The standard human readable notation for IPv6 addresses presents the address as eight 16 bit hexadecimal words each separated by a colon e.g. 2EDC BA98 0332 0000 CF8A 000C 2154 7313 .

IP addresses however even in human readable notation are difficult for people to remember and use. A URL is much easier to remember and may be used to point to any computer directory or file on the Internet. A browser is able to access a website on the Internet through the use of a URL. The URL may include a Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP request combined with the website s Internet address also known as the website s domain name. An example of a URL with a HTTP request and domain name is http www.companyname.com. In this example the http identifies the URL as a HTTP request and the companyname.com is the domain name. A domain can further host multiple websites that can be accessed by appending character strings that constitute the full path to the website s files. For example the domain for FACEBOOK includes one or more websites as the term is used herein for each of its users. A user specific website is requested by appending a directory to the FACEBOOK main URL e.g. http www.facebook.com username.

Domain names are much easier to remember and use than their corresponding IP addresses. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ICANN approves some Generic Top Level Domains gTLD and delegates the responsibility to a particular organization a registry for maintaining an authoritative source for the registered domain names within a TLD and their corresponding IP addresses. For certain TLDs e.g. .biz .info .name and .org the registry is also the authoritative source for contact information related to the domain name and is referred to as a thick registry. For other TLDs e.g. .com and .net only the domain name registrar identification and name server information is stored within the registry and a registrar is the authoritative source for the contact information related to the domain name. Such registries are referred to as thin registries. Most gTLDs are organized through a central domain name Shared Registration System SRS based on their TLD.

The process for registering a domain name with .com .net .org and some other TLDs allows an Internet user to use an ICANN accredited registrar to register their domain name. For example if an Internet user John Doe wishes to register the domain name mycompany.com John Doe may initially determine whether the desired domain name is available by contacting a domain name registrar. The Internet user may make this contact using the registrar s webpage and typing the desired domain name into a field on the registrar s webpage created for this purpose. Upon receiving the request from the Internet user the registrar may ascertain whether mycompany.com has already been registered by checking the SRS database associated with the TLD of the domain name. The results of the search then may be displayed on the webpage to thereby notify the Internet user of the availability of the domain name. If the domain name is available the Internet user may proceed with the registration process. Otherwise the Internet user may keep selecting alternative domain names until an available domain name is found. Domain names are typically registered for a period of one to ten years with first rights to continually re register the domain name.

The information on web pages is in the form of programmed source code that the browser interprets to determine what to display on the requesting device. The source code may include document formats objects parameters positioning instructions and other code that is defined in one or more web programming or markup languages. One web programming language is HyperText Markup Language HTML and all web pages use it to some extent. HTML uses text indicators called tags to provide interpretation instructions to the browser. The tags specify the composition of design elements such as text images shapes hyperlinks to other web pages programming objects such as JAVA applets form fields tables and other elements. The web page can be formatted for proper display on computer systems with widely varying display parameters due to differences in screen size resolution processing power and maximum download speeds.

For Internet users and businesses alike the Internet continues to be increasingly valuable. More people use the Web for everyday tasks from social networking shopping banking and paying bills to consuming media and entertainment. E commerce is growing with businesses delivering more services and content across the Internet communicating and collaborating online and inventing new ways to connect with each other. However presently existing systems and methods for designing and launching a website require a user wishing to establish an online presence to navigate through a complicated series of steps to do so. First the owner must register a domain name. The owner must then design a website or hire a website design company to design the website. Then the owner must purchase configure and implement website related services including storage space and record configuration on a web server software applications to add functionality to his website maintenance and customer service plans and the like. This process can be complicated time consuming and fraught with opportunity for user error. It may also be very expensive to produce serve and maintain the user s website. Merchants may be hesitant to create an online presence because of the perceived effort involved to do so. These merchants limit their business to offline brick and mortar points of sale.

Some existing website design approaches can simplify the design process through automation of certain of the design process steps. Typically a user is provided a template comprising a fully or substantially hard coded framework. The user must then customize the framework by providing content such as images descriptive text web page titles and internal organizational links between web pages and element layout choices. However users that are not experienced with website design or have little time to focus on the details may publish websites that contain layout errors such as misaligned content and may not have the capacity to produce valuable website content such as business promoting videos.

Furthermore a valuable web presence now extends far beyond the user s website. Customers commonly engage with businesses and with each other online via social networks business listing services and email and other direct communication. There can be significant pressure on a business to stay in close contact with its customers by quickly responding to their messages and routinely posting online content that engages customers and draws new visitors to the user s social network pages business listings and website.

The present invention overcomes the aforementioned drawbacks by providing a system and method for improving the creation and management of a website owner s web presence by automatically retrieving information from a number of data stores to promote the website owner s social media engagement and presented content. The system and method further improves the presentation of content within the website owner s website by automatically producing content and rearranging content according to favorable placement and alignment rules. The web server tasked with serving the web page to requesting devices also known as a hosting provider may perform one or more disclosed algorithms. Alternatively the web server may assign the performance to a related computer system such as another web server collection of web or other servers a dedicated data processing computer or another computer capable of performing the algorithms. Alternatively a standalone program may be delivered to and installed on a personal computing device such as the user s desktop computer or mobile device and the standalone program may be configured to cause the personal computing device to perform the algorithms. For clarity of explanation and not to limit the implementation of the present methods the methods are described below as being performed by a web server that serves the web page to requesting devices. The creation of web pages is described with a left sided prioritization for left to right reading countries it will be understood that left and right directions may be reversed for right to left reading countries.

In one implementation the present disclosure describes a method by a server computer electronically connected to a communication network. The method includes collecting interaction data of a user and calculating one or both of a contact importance score for each of one or more contacts that produced a portion of the interaction data and an engagement score for the user. The contact importance score may include a plurality of components including one or more of a contact type a contact location a contact industry a contact purchase history a contact interactivity history and a contact online reach. Calculating the importance score may include obtaining a value for each of the plurality of components adjusting the values of each of the components according to a predetermined weight corresponding to the importance of the component to an industry of the user and combining the values to obtain the contact importance score. The method may further include for each contact for which the contact importance score is calculated identifying the contact from the interaction data and collecting contact data from one or more data stores the contact data being related to the contact s interactions with the user. The contact importance score may be calculated for the contact from the contact data. The method may further include organizing each discrete element of the interaction data as a feed entry in a single feed and displaying via an interface the single feed to the user with the feed entries arranged by contact importance score of the contact that produced the discrete element of the interaction data. The method may further include receiving a selection of one or more of the feed entries and updating the calculating step according to the selection.

The method may include collecting engagement data that includes the interaction data and web presence data and calculating one or more components of the engagement score from the engagement data the engagement score may be calculated using the components of the engagement score. The method may further include presenting to the user one or more recommendations for improving the engagement score. The recommendations may correspond to an age of the user s business. The method may further include determining the age of the user s business within a business lifecycle framework. The components of the engagement score may correspond to one or more best practices of an industry of the user s business. The computer server may calculate both of the contact importance score and the engagement score and the method may further include identifying the contact from the interaction data and collecting contact data from one or more data stores the contact data being related to the contact s interactions with the user. The contact importance score may be calculated for the contact from the contact data. The contact importance score may include a plurality of components including one or more of a contact type a contact location a contact industry a contact purchase history a contact interactivity history and a contact online reach.

The method may further include identifying according to an algorithm a plurality of potential content receiving a selection of the potential content as selected content posting the selected content to one or more online platforms of the user and updating the algorithm based on the interaction data the interaction data including one or more interactions of the user s audience with the selected content. Identifying the plurality of potential content may include searching one or more data stores for public content using one or more keywords related to an industry of the user. The interaction data may be used to identify the potential content.

In another implementation the present disclosure describes a method by a server computer electronically connected to a communication network. The method includes identifying a plurality of potential content including one or both of public content and original content and posting one or more of the plurality of potential content to one or more online platforms of a user wherein identifying the original content includes automatically commissioning the generation of the original content. The method may further include monitoring one or more interactions of the user s audience with the posted potential content and updating a ratio of original content to public content based on the monitored interactions the ratio being used to identify the potential content. The method may further include displaying the potential content to the user and receiving a selection by the user of the potential content wherein the potential content that is posted to the one or more platforms is the potential content selected by the user. The method may further include determining a strategic time for posting content to the one or more platforms receiving from a user an identification of smart post potential content and posting the smart post potential content to the one or more platforms at the strategic time. The strategic time may depend on the user s industry.

In yet another implementation the present disclosure describes a method by a server computer electronically connected to a communication network. The method includes providing an interface for configuring the server computer to generate a website receiving a request to align a plurality of elements on one or more web pages of the website aligning the elements and publishing the one or more web pages. The interface may include a grid having a selected resolution and the method may include aligning a top edge and a left edge of a first of the elements with the grid and aligning a top edge of each of the remaining elements with the top edge of the first element. Aligning the elements may include from the elements creating a plurality of groups of elements aligning each of the groups with the other groups and within each group aligning the elements of the group with each other. Aligning the elements may further include aligning at least one element from each group with at least one element of one or more of the other groups. Creating the plurality of groups may include identifying one or more contextual indicators that two or more of the elements should be grouped together the contextual indicators including one or more of similarity of element properties absolute or relative positioning in approximately the same column or row of pixels placement within common HTML tags and similarity of element types. The contextual indicators may further include a graphical similarity to a standard web page structure. Aligning the elements may further include creating one or more family groups containing a plurality of the groups and aligning the groups within each family group.

The elements may include a plurality of images. A first of the images may have a greater height than a second of the images and aligning the elements may include resizing the height of the second image to the height of the first image. Aligning the elements may include determining if a first of the elements and a second of the elements are misaligned vertically by less than an alignment threshold and if so moving the second element into a desired vertical alignment with the first element. Aligning the elements may include determining if the elements should be uniformly spaced horizontally and if so moving one or more of the elements so that the elements are uniformly spaced horizontally. Aligning the elements may include comparing a graphical layout of the elements to one or more standard web page structures.

The interface may be a website builder application. The website builder application may be configured with a drag and drop web page layout designer. The website builder application may be further configured to display a button that the user presses to request alignment of the elements on the web page.

In yet another implementation the present disclosure describes a method by a server computer electronically connected to a communication network. The method includes collecting video content from a website the video content including theme data and presentation data producing a video from the video content and publishing the video. The theme data may include a color scheme and the color scheme may be identified from one or more images on the website.

Referring to a web server may be configured to communicate over the Internet with one or more requesting device in order to serve requested website content to the requesting device . The requesting devices may request the website content using any electronic communication medium communication protocol and computer software suitable for transmission of data over the Internet. Examples include respectively and without limitation a wired connection WiFi or other wireless network cellular network or satellite network Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol TCP IP Global System for mobile Communications GSM protocols code division multiple access CDMA protocols and Long Term Evolution LTE mobile phone protocols and web browsers such as MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER MOZILLA FIREFOX and APPLE SAFARI.

A requesting device may be a device for which web pages are typically designed without concern for display user interface processing or Internet bandwidth limitations including without limitation personal and workplace computing systems such as desktops laptops and thin clients each with a monitor or built in large display collectively PCs . A requesting device may be a device that cannot display the informational and functional content of web pages that are designed for viewing on PCs. Such limited devices include mobile devices such as mobile phones and tablet computers and may further include other similarly limited devices for which conventional websites are not ordinarily designed. Mobile devices and mobile phones in particular have a significantly smaller display size than PCs and may further have significantly less processing power and if receiving data over a cellular network significantly less Internet bandwidth.

The web server may be configured to create and or serve a website that adapts to the requirements of requesting devices with different capabilities as described above. In some embodiments such adaptation may include generating a plurality of versions of the website that convey substantially the same content but are particularly formatted to be displayed on certain requesting devices in certain browsers or on certain domains e.g. FACEBOOK or GOOGLE . For example the web server may generate a first version of the website that is formatted for PCs and a second version of the website that is formatted for display on mobile phones. In other embodiments such adaptation may include converting a website from a format that can be displayed on one type of requesting device into a website that can be displayed on another type of requesting device . For example the web server may upon receiving a request for the website from a mobile phone convert the website designed to be displayed on a PC into a format that can be displayed on the mobile phone. In the present disclosure therefore the term website refers to any public private or semi private web property on which a user may maintain information and allow the information to be presented to the public or to a limited audience and which is communicable via the Internet. Non limiting examples of such web properties include websites mobile websites web pages within a larger website e.g. profile pages on a social networking website vertical information portals distributed applications and other organized data sources accessible by any device that may request data from a storage device e.g. a client device in a client server architecture via a wired or wireless network connection including but not limited to a desktop computer mobile computer telephone or other wireless mobile device content feeds and streams including RSS feeds blogs and viogs YOUTUBE channels and other video streaming services and the like and downloadable digital platforms such as electronic newsletters blast emails PDFs and other documents programs and the like.

Furthermore the web server may be configured to serve a user interface to the device that is able to connect electronically to the web server over the Internet or another computer network and is used to maintain the website and other elements of the owner s web presence. The user device may be any suitable web access device including a personal computer tablet smartphone or other mobile device and the like. The web server may be configured to adapt and serve the user interface to any user device used to access the web server . The user may be an individual a group of individuals a business or other organization or any other entity that desires to build a website or web presence and use it to convey information about itself or another topic where the information may be of a commercial or a non commercial nature. For clarity of explanation and not to limit the implementation of the present methods the methods are described below as being performed by a web server that receives input for creating a website for a small business such as a restaurant or bar retail store or service provider i.e. barber shop real estate or insurance agent repair shop equipment renter and the like unless otherwise indicated.

The web server may be configured to communicate electronically with one or more data stores in order to retrieve information from the data stores. The electronic communication may be over the Internet using any suitable electronic communication medium communication protocol and computer software including without limitation a wired connection WiFi or other wireless network cellular network or satellite network TCP IP or another open or encrypted protocol browser software application programming interfaces middleware or dedicated software programs. The electronic communication may be over another type of network such as an intranet or virtual private network or may be via direct wired communication interfaces or any other suitable interface for transmitting data electronically from a data store to the web server . In some embodiments a data store may be a component of the web server such as by being contained in a memory module or on a disk drive of the web server .

A data store may be any repository of information that is or can be made freely or securely accessible by the web server . Suitable data stores include without limitation databases or database systems which may be a local database online database desktop database server side database relational database hierarchical database network database object database object relational database associative database concept oriented database entity attribute value database multi dimensional database semi structured database star schema database XML database file collection of files spreadsheet or other means of data storage located on a computer client server or any other storage device known in the art or developed in the future file systems and electronic files such as web pages spreadsheets and documents. Each data store accessible by the web server may contain information that is relevant to the creation of the website as described below. Such data stores include without limitation to the illustrated examples search engines website information databases such as domain registries hosting service provider databases website customer databases and internet aggregation databases such as archive.org government records databases such as business entity registries maintained by a Secretary of State or corporation commission public data aggregators such as FACTUAL ZABASEARCH genealogical databases and the like social networking data stores such as public semi private or private information from FACEBOOK TWITTER FOURSQUARE LINKEDIN and the like business listing data stores such as YELP Yellow Pages GOOGLE PLACES LOCU and the like media specific data stores such as art museum databases library databases and the like point of sale transaction data stores offline crawling data stores and entity candidate data stores as described below.

The web server may be configured to analyze a plurality of aspects of the user s social media engagement and to provide through the interface on the user s device displays conveying the results of the analysis to the user. In one aspect the web server may provide a contact importance score for one or more of the user s contacts. The contact importance score may depend on several factors including without limitation the contact type such as an individual member subscriber or non member business critic press and the like the contact s geographic location the contact s industry of employment the contact s purchase history the contact s history of online interactivity with the user and the contact s own social online media reach including metrics such as number of followers or subscribers posting i.e. presentation of new media content frequency on various websites and the like. The factors may further include one or more scores for the contact that are generated by a separate scoring algorithm. For example the contact importance score may include as a factor a social media influence score generated for the contact by third party. Non limiting examples of such third party scores include a Klout score which is a measurement of the contact s social media network production of interactive content and ability to drive action a Peerlndex score which measures similar factors to Klout but with time based averaging of scores and a Kred score produced by PeopleBrosr.

The web server may also determine whether the contact uses any particular services and may adjust the contact importance score accordingly. For example the web server may produce contact importance scores for the user via the Website Builder application offered by GoDaddy Operating Company LLC GoDaddy and in this environment the web server may determine whether the user uses any other of GoDaddy s small business services such as its online store or invoicing and bookkeeping services. The web server may value a contact that does use any such services higher than a contact that does not and may therefore increase the contact importance score for the former contact as compared to the latter contact.

Through analysis and relative weighing of the contact importance score factors the web server may indicate to the user via the contact importance score a particular contact s value to the user s business. The value may be considered contextually in terms of both realized and potential direct and indirect commercial benefit generated by the contact. Direct commercial benefit may be understood as the revenue the business has generated from the contact s purchases as a current or past customer of the user s business. A realized direct commercial benefit may be the total amount of money spent by the contact on the user s goods or services as identified by the web server s access of the data stores. A potential direct commercial benefit may be an estimation of the contact s continued direct purchases from the user based on trend analysis of past spending behaviors on the user s and other products on the contact s social network activity e.g. a blog post describing the user s product or on a combination thereof or on other factors. A realized indirect benefit may be an amount of sold products to other customers that were driven to the user s website or store by the contact s advice. Such traffic may be traceable to the contact by several means including collection of referral information directly from the other customers and link tracking in online content. Similarly a potential indirect benefit may be an analysis of the contact s reach. For example a contact has a high potential indirect benefit if her social network is large and or she generates an attractive volume of frequently visited online content.

The user may view the contact importance score as a gauge of the impact the contact has or may have on the user s business. Furthermore the web server may calculate a contact importance score for a person who is not a customer but is a potential customer or even simply an entity that is attempting to interact with the user online. For example the web server may deliver to the user a message from the entity via an online communication channel e.g. TWITTER FACEBOOK email etc. and the web server may calculate the contact importance score for that entity by for example applying the method below. The user may then reference the contact importance score in deciding whether and how to respond to the entity whether or not the entity is a customer.

In particular interaction data may include text images hyperlinks and other HTML and metadata that make up a post that is directed at or mentions the user s business. Examples of posts include without limitation a direct message to the user via the user s email address or one or more of the user s social networking profiles e.g. using an email client a Short Messaging Service SMS or other cellular phone network and protocol or a direct messaging client within a social networking platform e.g. FACEBOOK Messenger a public or semi private message directed at the user such as a tweet or retweet between the contact s and the user s TWITTER profiles a social network post such as a FACEBOOK status update or new entry in an INSTAGRAM photo feed a blog or other website article a comment on a business listing e.g. a YELP review an article a social network post or another source of relevant online content and a reposting of content from the user s website or social networking profile such as a FACEBOOK share or a link to the user s webpage. In some embodiments the user may configure the web server to collect interaction data that does not mention the user s business. For example the user might configure the web server to collect data from any post by a particularly important contact even if the post does not pertain directly to the user s business.

The interaction data collected at step may further include information pertaining to the entity i.e. entity data that authored or otherwise made available each collected post. In some embodiments the entity data may include data that can be obtained from the entity s user profile on whichever platform hosts the post. Specifically the entity data may include the entity s user name real name or business name email address or other contact information geographic location employer and other biographical information as it may be obtained from the entity s user profile. It will be understood that the type of data that can be obtained may depend on the service i.e. platform that is hosting the relevant post. In some embodiments the entity data may include such biographical data as described above but obtained from another source. For example the web server may collect an identifier of the entity such as a user name real name or email address from the post itself and then may search public records using the identifier to obtain the biographical information. In some embodiments the web server may itself search public records in the data stores it can access. In other embodiments the web server may feed the identifier into a records retrieval service to obtain the biographical information.

At step the web server may identify one or more important contacts of the user s business from the interaction data. An important contact may include any or all of the user s past and current customers. Such identification may therefore include comparing the entity data within the interaction data to a database of the user s customers. In some embodiments the web server may search a customer contact database using an identifier of the entity contained in the entity data as described above. For example where the user keeps all of its customer contact information in an electronic rolodex e.g. MICROSOFT Outlook contacts FullContact Data.com Contactually Plaxo Factual the web server may identify whether the identifier for the entity is a match to any of the records in the electronic rolodex. In some embodiments the web server may identify whether an entity thought not a past or current customer is an important contact as either a lead i.e. a potential customer or an influencer of buyer behavior in the field of the user s business. An entity may be identified as a lead by analyzing its interactions with the user with the user s competitors or with its own social networks. Non limiting examples of such analysis include semantic analysis of direct interactions with the user on one or more of the user s platforms such as to ascertain one or more characteristics of the user s relationship with the entity e.g. the entity inquires about products or services of the user or the entity has posted about the business on various platforms in the past semantic or pattern analysis of the entity s interactions with competing businesses on their online platforms such as repeated posts shares or likes of content on profiles of multiple competitors which reflects interest in related products and review of mutual contacts to determine if the entity has connections to the user s customers. An entity may be further or alternatively identified as an influencer by analyzing the entity s online reach such as the size of the entity s social networks the frequency and level of engagement with the entity s posts related to the industry etc.

At step the web server may collect contact data for one or more of the contacts identified at step . The contact data may include any of the data collected as entity data described above and may further include data pertaining to the contact s past interactions with the user s business and data pertaining to any factor of the contact importance score. Example contact data includes without limitation data related to purchase history such as dates and amounts of purchases products purchased and amounts thereof and the like as well as aggregate and or trend analysis of such purchase data data related to the contact s online interactions with the user and or the user s business such as an accounting of previous posts made by the contact to or about the business including dates and content of posts data related to the contact s online presence such as website addresses social networks on which the contact has a user profile frequency of posts on any of the contact s online platforms frequently visited websites and the like data related particularly to the contact s social networking presences as it may differ from the contact s general online presence data such as the number of friends followers or subscribers to the contact s user profiles or news feeds and data related to any other relevant activities of the contact such as whether the contact is a user of a particular service e.g. GoDaddy Bookkeeping described above . The contact data may further include a score or collection of scores for the contact generated by other scoring algorithms such as a Klout social influence score.

From the collected contact data at step the web server may calculate the contact importance score. Any suitable algorithm may be used to weigh elements of the collected data that correspond to the factors of the contact importance score. In an exemplary embodiment the contact importance score may be comprised of eight equally weighted components each graded on a scale of 1 10 and then averaged to determine a contact importance score of 1 10. The eight components correspond to the eight factors identified above contact type contact location contact industry contact purchase history contact interactivity history contact online reach contact scores from other scoring algorithms and contact usage of related services. A higher score indicates a better capacity to drive business to the user and the capacity to drive business may be determined by the user s industry location age i.e. its position in a typical business life cycle for its industry or a combination thereof. In other embodiments there may be more or fewer components and the components may have different weights according to the factors that are more important to a particular business or industry. For example contact importance for restaurants may heavily weight factors such as frequency of the contact s posts on platforms such as Yelp and Foursquare number of followers the contact has who also post frequently on Yelp and frequency that the contact mentions food topics on FACEBOOK TWITTER and other platforms. In contrast contact importance for a hair salon may heavily weight customer influence on platforms such as Pinterest Yelp and FACEBOOK and amount of followers that are within five miles of the hair salon. Furthermore the web server may adapt the weights of the components over time in response to the user s input or lack thereof as described further below so that contact importance scoring more accurately reflects the goals of the user.

As illustrated subsequent to the collection of interaction data at step and in conjunction with the generation of customer importance scores at step the web server may organize the interaction data into a folder structure that is conducive to the user s access. For example the data may be organized by type of post i.e. direct message semi private or public message mention in a post by platform or service or by content. Examples of content classification include positive versus negative comments requests for contact and the like. In some embodiments step may take place after contacts are identified from the interaction data at step and content classification can include classification by customer business lead influencer etc. The organization step may be optional and may be skipped and the interaction data presented to the user in other formats such as chronologically or by platform.

In some embodiments at step the interaction data may be organized for presentation to the user via display of a single feed. The single feed may include all of the interactions presented agnostically in any suitable newsfeed format. By agnostic it is meant that all interactions are presented in the same ordered list regardless of the platform or service from which the interaction data was collected. A suitable newsfeed format may comprise entries that display the identity of the posting entity all or a portion of the posted content and any other element of the interaction data that may be valuable such as the time of or time elapsed since the posting or the platform or service on which it was posted. The single feed may be formatted for presentation on the user s device . An example display of the single feed for a smartphone is shown in .

Once the contact importance score s is are calculated step and the interaction data is organized for display in the single feed step at step the web server may display the entries for each interaction arranged sequentially in descending order of the posting entity s contact importance score. In this manner the interaction data may be prioritized according to the posting entity s importance to the user s business. In some embodiments the single feed may include or prioritize only entries for interaction data that has not yet been viewed by the user. The user may thereby rely on the single feed to determine the interactions that according to the contact importance scoring algorithm are most noteworthy to be reviewed and addressed. The example single feed of includes entries arranged by contact importance score.

Presented with the single feed of interactions the user may select any entry in the single feed to view an expanded display of the interaction data associated with that entry. At step for any entry in the single feed the web server may determine whether the user selects the entry for further review. If the user does select the entry for review the web server may present the expanded display for the entry to the user. Referring to the expanded display may include the contact importance score for the contact that posted the interaction. The contact importance score may be displayed in any suitable format for conveying the score. In the illustrated example the contact importance score is displayed as a slider bar with a slider indicating the score along the bar . Other suitable displays include numerical color coded and the like. The expanded display may further include additional details about the contact and her posted interaction. The additional details may include without limitation contact identifying information such as the contact s name or username the text of the posted interaction and a summary of important data about the contact such as details about the contact s purchase history details about the contact s social networking reach and biographical details such as a list of the contact s interests. The expanded display may further include one or more action buttons for taking action on the interaction. Example actions as associated with the illustrated buttons include replying to the contact s message reposting the contact s message marking the entry as important or a favorite e.g. to indicate to the user to return to the entry later and storing the entry in one of the folders described above.

Referring again to if the user does not select the feed entry at step the web server may interpret the user s failure to select the entry as an indication that the interaction or entity associated with the entry is not as important to the user as was calculated at step . The web server may wait for a predetermined amount of time to pass or for a predetermined number of other entries to be selected before determining that a particular unselected entry is not relevant to the user. In such a case at step the web server may update the contact importance scoring algorithm causing it to learn that the calculation for that contact is faulty for some reason. Over time a collection of faulty calculations may exhibit commonalities in their data that the web server may identify. The web server may thereby improve the contact importance scoring algorithm by emphasizing or de emphasizing factors or components of the score to produce more consistently relevant results.

The web server may further use the interactive data as collected at step of or as formatted into the single feed described above to appraise the user s social media presence and to recommend actions that may improve the user s social media and other online presences. In some embodiments the web server may analyze the interaction data either on its own or in combination with other web presence data or with comparative data to produce an engagement score for the user. The engagement score may be relative to an ascertainable set of best practices for the user s industry. That is businesses in different industries may use different online platforms with varying frequency to engage their customers and potential customers. For example a hair salon may benefit greatly from sharing a large volume of high resolution images e.g. of hairstyles with its online audience and therefore may wish to post new content to its PINTEREST account more often than a restaurant or mechanic would use that service.

The aspects of an industry that are relevant to its online engagement best practices may include without limitation type of goods or services sold including the nature e.g. platforms fulfillment practices frequency volume shipping and return policies etc. of typical online commerce in those goods or services customer demographics including age gender and geographic location and geographic penetration such as whether the industry is local typically personal services such as barbers dentists massage parlors and the like but also small goods such as bookstores metropolitan or regional e.g. restaurants and breweries amusement parks museums or super regional e.g. chain stores franchises and large retailers . In turn the industry best practices for a business that are relevant to the user s engagement score may include without limitation platforms on which content is shared content of user profiles on each platform type and frequency of new content shared by the business acceptance of interactions from followers e.g. enabling public comments on a blog post response time to interactions from followers position and tone of the user s representative s i.e. WHO is posting personal content owner manager employees etc. and how does that person s online personality reflect on the business paid and unpaid advertisement placement and other marketing practices and other aspects of best practices which may depend on the industry.

The user s engagement score may further include comparative data of the user s online presence to those of its competitors. As described further below the web server may identify one or more of the user s competitors and analyze elements of the competitors websites social networks and other online platforms. Suitable aspects for comparison may depend on the industry and its best practices and may include without limitation presence on a particular online platform and type and frequency of posts thereon size of social networks e.g. for a particular platform number of followers in the first generation i.e. direct and second generation i.e. followers of followers type and amount of common followers frequency and content of views shares comments reviews etc. on competitor s profiles or posts and business information such as hours products offered online or not online prices etc.

Referring to to calculate and present the user s engagement score the web server may first collect engagement data at step . The engagement data may include web presence data describing the user s web presence. The web presence data may include any data that the user has himself made available via an online platform herein user posted data . Non limiting examples of user posted data include the user s website data from user profiles postings of original content e.g. blog posts status updates uploaded images and the like shared content e.g. retweeted TWITTER posts or FACEBOOK shares emails and sent personal messages replies to messages comments in conversations or threads and other data posted by the user. The web presence data may further include any data mentioning or otherwise relevant to the user s business which other entities have put online herein entity posted data . Non limiting examples of entity posted data include any of the interaction data described above with respect to the step as well as data pertaining to the business which is not interaction data such as online platform content identified through internet search analytics and searches.

Particularly regarding this search identified content the web server may execute searches of any of the data stores to collect information that is relevant to the business but may not mention the business. For example the web server may ascertain the industry of the user s business and then may access or perform an analysis of high traffic keywords that are related to the industry and are frequently used in internet searches such as for products offered by the industry participants. The web server may identify hot i.e. currently popular or exceptionally high traffic keywords for the user s business which may be all or a subset of keywords having a particular level of traffic. A subset of such keywords may be identified by narrowing the keywords such as by traffic from certain geographic areas by frequency of advertisements bought for the keyword by frequency searched as an n gram with other relevant keywords and the like. The hot keywords and the top results in searches for the hot keywords may all be considered search identified content to be included in the calculation of the user s engagement score.

Comparative data from competitors web presences may be considered entity posted data relevant to the user s business and may therefore be identified as described above with respect to search identified content. Alternatively the web server may perform a discrete process of identifying the user s business competitors and collecting data from identified competitors web presences. Any suitable process of identifying competitors may be used including those processes described in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 010 294 filed Aug. 26 2013 entitled METHOD FOR AUTOMATING SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION FOR WEBSITES owned by Go Daddy Operating Company LLC and incorporated herein by reference. The web server may access any suitable data store to identify competitors and obtain comparative data. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 010 294 further describes suitable methods for extracting data from the competitors websites e.g. by scraping metadata and source code which may also be performed on competitors user profiles blogs news feeds and the like on any online platform to which the competitors web presences extend. The comparative data may be the data extracted from the competitors web presences or the comparative data may be one or more metrics calculated from the extracted data for comparison to comparable metrics calculated from the user posted data.

At step the web server may calculate from the engagement data collected at step one or more components of the engagement score. The components of the engagement score may each relate to an ascertainable best practice for the user s industry as described above. Thus the engagement score may be a standardized set of components that apply to varying degrees across all industries or the engagement score may be a selection of components that are most significant to the identified industry. In one embodiment the engagement score components include without limitation the frequency of posts to each online platform individually and or in aggregate number of posts per day comprising new original i.e. not shared from another source content average traffic to posts average traffic to and or clicks on advertisements average number of interactions per day average elapsed time to read and or respond to contact interactions total number of subscribers friends followers on each online platform and in aggregate and demographic ratios such as ratio of male to female followers and ratio among age groups or location.

At step the web server may calculate the engagement score by comparing each calculated component to its associated industry best practice and then combining the resulting comparison data to produce the engagement score. The comparison data may be a percentage a ratio or a numerical value representing the difference between the calculated component value and the best practice value. For example if the industry best practice is to post new content five times per day and the user is only posting an average of four times per day the user has an 80 score for that component if the industry best practice is to respond to a contact s direct message within six hours and the user is averaging five hours in response time the user has a 100 score for that component alternatively the faster response time than best practice might be considered a negative and the user may receive less than a 100 for the component e.g. 84 . If these two example components were the only components of the engagement score and were equally weighted the calculated engagement score would be 90 . In some embodiments however the components may have different weights and the weights may change over time in accordance with changing practices or trends in collected data as described above with respect to calculating the contact importance score.

At step the web server may display the engagement score to the user via the user s device . In some embodiments the engagement score may be displayed on its own while in other embodiments step comprises displaying a score overview screen that includes the engagement score along with useful information that may be derived for the user by the web server from the data collected at step . illustrates an example score overview screen presenting the engagement score in the form of a thermometer displaying the engagement score as a percentage. The score overview screen may further include audience demographics for each platform or in the aggregate. The audience demographics or other processed data that is extractable from the calculated engagement score components may be prepared for display at step such as by incorporating them into the score overview screen .

The score overview screen may further include a recommendation summary . The recommendation summary may list recommendations to the user for improving the user s online presence to better conform to industry best practices and thus improve the engagement score as well as to generally improve the information the user provides online. In some embodiments the recommendations may be derived at step from the calculated engagement score. In such embodiments the recommendations may be directed to improving the engagement score by bringing the user s practices more in line with the industry best practices for each component of the engagement score. Thus the web server may determine that a recommendation is needed if there is a deviation in the comparison data i.e. the comparison data indicates less than a 100 score for the component. In some embodiments the deviation may be required to deviate at least a predetermined amount referred to herein as a recommendation threshold before the web server determines a recommendation is needed.

If a recommendation is needed the web server may review the comparison data to identify which analyzed factors within the component do not satisfy the industry best practices i.e. meet or exceed the recommendation threshold . The web server then generates a recommendation which may be a recommended action that will bring the user s online engagement into line with the best practices. The recommendation may be displayed to the user in the recommendation summary step or in a detailed recommendations screen as shown in step . The example detailed recommendations screen presents the engagement score thermometer and presents the recommendations divided into sections that correspond to the components of the engagement score. Specifically the sections relate to but are not limited to the user s general online presence which may relate to the achievement of presence development goals based on the life cycle of the business the scope of the user s social engagement which may relate to the amount and frequency of posts on the user s social network platforms or the average amount of time to respond to social media interactions business information which may relate to analysis of the user s business information operating hours prices offerings etc. in comparison to the competition or customer demands and marketing strategies which may identify hot keywords or areas for advertising based on search analytics. In practice the recommendations may convey suggested actions and if the user performs them the user s engagement score will improve when it is next calculated.

In some embodiments for one or more of the engagement score component calculations step the contact importance score calculation step and the derivation of recommendations step the web server may take the age of the business i.e. the stage within a typical lifecycle for a business in the relevant industry into account and may adjust the scores or recommendations accordingly. Non limiting examples of parameters by which the business age may be calculated include the number of years the business has been operating the business annual or total revenue or number of customers rate of unique customer contacts per day total number of calls or purchases per day number of business reviews on review platforms such as Yelp annual expenditures such as for marketing or shipping movement of the business into a larger office retail or warehouse space and suitable combinations of such parameters. In some embodiments the web server may provide age appropriate scores and recommendations according to the identified best practices of the industry of the business. In some embodiments a framework of lifecycle stages may be applied to each industry. For example a lifecycle framework may be divided into the following stages idea startup emerging established expanding and maintaining size. Suitable goals may be determined to meet the best practices of each industry at each stage. In one example of taking business age into account in the scoring algorithm a company in the early stages of the business would have their score based on having a profile making sure fields are populated making sure they are on the right social networks for their business etc. In one example of taking business age into account in recommending improvements to the user s web presence a company in later stages might have recommendations on how to optimize its FACEBOOK cover photo to drive conversion how to specify its About Us text to maximize SEO score and ability to get found online etc.

To keep up with customer engagement and online best practices a user may need to post fresh content to one or more online platforms multiple times per day. Users may quickly run out of content and may not have time to produce more. The web server may further assist a user in maintaining his business online presence and engaging customers and other entities with postings of new content by identifying and recommending to the user content for posting to one or more of the user s online platforms. According to the methods described below the web server may be configured to identify any type of content that should engage the user s audience thus the systems and methods herein facilitate sourcing of the user s online content from a single location the web server .

As described throughout this disclosure content may be any text image video web page or hyperlink thereto combination of the foregoing or other suitable type of information published online. The web server may identify any content and in the method described below the content may be classified as original or public content. Original content is content created by or for the user regarding a topic of the user s choosing usually relevant to the user s business that is unique to the user s web presence when the user first publishes it. Public content is content generated by a third party not specifically for the user which is found on another online platform and is initially published by a party other than the user. An example of original content is a blog post written by the user and an example of public content is an article first published on time.com that the user shares on his FACEBOOK profile. Depending on the industry and age of the user s business and the reach of the user s web presence the user may find that either original or public content is more effective than the other at interacting with the user s audience. The present systems and methods analyze the user s content to identify and leverage its popularity in producing new content.

At step the web server may use the seeds to identify potential content for the user s web presence. The potential content may be any content suitable for publication on one or more of the user s online platforms. In some embodiments the potential content may be classified as either public or original content. To identify public content the web server may search any suitable data store such as by performing keyword searches on a search engine using the seeds searching for occurrences of the seeds in news feeds within the user s social networks and the like. To identify original content the web server may commission one or more content drafting services to generate articles of original content based on the seeds. Such content drafting services and their content generation processes are known in the art. For example TextBroker engages thousands of authors that receive a request for original content e.g. a blog post on a topic and with a length and tone of the requestor s choosing and draft the original content for a fee. In some embodiments the web server may provide a content type e.g. blog post status update etc. length and the seeds to one or multiple content drafting services and may receive one or multiple articles of original content in return.

In some embodiments the web server may automatically post some or all of the identified content to the user s web presence as described below with respect to step . In other embodiments at step the web server may display the identified potential content to the user for selection of which content to post. The web server may aggregate all of the identified potential content and may identify each article by for example type such as original or public suitable platform s for publication e.g. all social networks or blog or FACEBOOK and TWITTER source of content date first published traffic to source post. As shown in the web server may present a potential content feed arranging the articles e.g. in any suitable order and may list the source title and a brief summary such as the first three lines of the article. The web server may allow the user to select an article from the feed for a detailed view of the article and posting options. illustrates a detail screen containing the full text of the article and a post interface . The post interface may present posting options to the user and receive the user s selection. In the illustrated example the post interface displays the available platforms TWITTER LINKEDIN and FACEBOOK and a switch for turning on or off the post to that platform. The post interface further allows the user to select whether to post the content immediately post button or with a delay referred to herein as a smart post smart post button . A request for a smart post instructs the web server to post the content to the selected platforms at a strategic time in order to increase the post s exposure to all or a select subset of the user s audience. Strategic times may vary by industry for example a restaurant may receive most of its web traffic in the hour before lunch and the hour before dinner while a mechanic may receive most of its web traffic early in the morning. Strategic times may also vary according to particular entities within the audience which the user especially benefits from reaching. For example the web server may track contact importance scores as described above and may track the times of day that a particular contact with a high contact importance score typically engages with the user s content. The web server may post smart post content during those tracked times of day. Strategic times may also be set manually by the user. In some embodiments potential content that does not get selected by the user may be retained by the web server . The unselected content may be made available to other users via their unique instances of the post interface .

Referring back to at step the web server receives the content selection from the user via the post interface . At step the web server may post the content according to the user s selections. That is the web server may post the selected content to the selected platforms immediately or at a strategic time set by the user or identified by the web server . At step the web server may monitor interaction of the user s audience with the posted content. The web server may track any type of interaction with the content such as views amount of time spent viewing whether particular contacts viewed other links within content followed products purchased shares by viewers and new traffic therefrom comments and the like. In some embodiments tracking the interaction may include collecting interaction data as described above with respect to step .

At step the web server may use the information collected by monitoring the interactions to update the algorithm it uses to identify content. In some embodiments the web server may adjust the ratio of original content to public content that it identifies as potential content based on which type of content receives better quality or quantity of interactions when posted by the user. In some embodiments the web server may identify keywords within particularly popular i.e. widely viewed widely shared high volume of comments or any other suitable relative metric for comparing interactivity with posts posted content and may weight those keywords higher as seeds in subsequent potential content identification step . The web server may then return to the content identification step to continue identifying potential content using the updated algorithm.

The social engagement analysis and content recommendation tools described above may be provided to the user via the described interface for one or more user devices . In some embodiments the interface may be provided in one or more standalone software applications including smartphone or web based applications that perform one or more of the described functions. In some embodiments the interface may be provided to a user of a website building tool that can facilitate initial generation of the user s website as well as continuing updates of the website and of the user s presence on other online platforms as the user provides access to them.

Referring to a system for performing the website building and social engagement analysis methods described herein may include the web server and a plurality of modules for performing one or more steps of the methods. The modules may be hardware or software based processing modules located within the web server in close physical vicinity to the web server or remote from the web server and implemented as standalone server computers or as components of one or more additional servers or of one or more other computing devices such as a payment terminal or cash register. The modules may include without limitation a user interface module for providing input output capabilities between the system and the user a data retrieval module for performing searches of data stores a data processing module for evaluating retrieved data comparing retrieved data to other data performing score calculations and the like a website generation module which may be a component of the data processing module or a separate module and which creates web pages and posts new content thereto one or more data storage modules for storing the data retrieved by the data retrieval module content objects created by the data processing module and the website generated by the website generation module and a payment processing module for processing payment information provided when a user chooses to purchase a generated website generated content or other elements of data generated via the methods herein.

The website builder may be any suitable website building application that may be configured to perform or to be compatible with the methods described herein. In one embodiment the website builder is the GODADDY Website Builder. In some embodiments the website builder may use a grid layout for what you see is what you get web page building in which the user may drag drop resize change properties and otherwise edit web page elements in an environment that reflects what the web page will actually look like when it is published. The grid helps a user align elements on the web page and may be set at any suitable resolution. In other embodiments the website builder may not use a grid.

With or without the aid of a grid users frequently find that a web page design that appears ready to publish is actually fraught with slight misalignments. For example as shown in a first image has a first caption below it a second image adjacent the first image is aligned with the first image at the top and the second caption below the second image is the same size as the first caption but the second image is slightly shorter e.g. three pixels shorter than the first image and a third image and third caption are the same size as the first image and first caption but are misaligned e.g. by about three pixels with the first image vertically. The misalignments may not be perceived by the user or the user may notice them but prefer not to spend the tedious effort to perfectly align all of the content. The present disclosure thus provides methods for automatically aligning web page elements and groups to correct these imperfections.

At step the web server may analyze the elements placed within the page layout to identify groups of elements that are intended to be displayed in contextual relationship with each other. The web server may analyze both the source code of the web page and the graphical layout divorced from the source code reading contextual indicators that the elements should be grouped together for alignment as described below. Contextual indicators in the source code may include identical or similar element properties e.g. cascading style sheet CSS class absolute or relative positioning in approximately the same column or row of pixels placement within common or similarly structured or HTML tags same or related element types and the like. Contextual indicators may depend on the element type as well. For example in determining whether two images on the web page should be grouped the web server may analyze both their position relative to each other and their size i.e. width and height . Contextual indicators may include a mapping of the web page graphical layout against one or more standard web page structures. For example the illustrated web page layout includes a standard layout of an image over a text block i.e. a caption forming the groups of and a standard layout of image text block groups aligned horizontally across the page.

Elements can be in multiple groupings and may depend on other elements. In these cases elements may be given a parent child relationship with a defined set of attributes. Other similar parent child entities may also be assigned the same set of attributes. Groups may also be nested such as is illustrated in where the identified groups are then grouped together in a family group corresponding to the standard layout of the groups aligned horizontally across the web page.

At step the web server may align the elements of each group relatively to each other. Where the web builder can apply a grid to the layout the web server may use the grid to determine the elements spatial relationships to each other such as distance and alignment. Otherwise the web server may determine spatial relationships using any suitable measurements such as raw pixel count between elements or differences in absolute position values. In some embodiments the web server may apply one or more thresholds to determine whether the user intended to align two elements across the top bottom or sides. Thresholds may pertain to dimensions and distances of the elements relative to each other to the grid lines or both. Example thresholds include without limitation a distance threshold related to the distance between two elements a size threshold related to a size difference between two elements and an alignment threshold related to a vertical or horizontal distance between corresponding edges e.g. tops left sides or between horizontal or vertical centerlines of two elements. In an example if the alignment threshold is five pixels and the first image is aligned with a grid line across its top and the top of the second image is less than five pixels from that grid line the web server may determine that the first and second images should be aligned across the top. In another example if the size threshold is three percent and the second image has the same width as the first image and is less than three percent shorter than the first image as illustrated in the web server may determine that the first and second images should be the same size.

The web server may then correct the alignment of any elements such as by modifying the source code of one or more web pages of the website. For example to increase the height of the second image the web server may read the original height of the first image and then set the height of the second image equal to that of the first image .

At step the web server may align the groups with each other. In some embodiments the web server may find the edges top bottom and sides and centerlines of each group to facilitate alignment. The web server may align a first of the groups such as the topmost leftmost group to the grid first. Subsequently the web server may follow any of the alignment steps recited above to identify groups that should be aligned with each other and then to align the groups. The illustrated web page layout demonstrates several examples. In the groups of the family group are determined to be non uniformly spaced horizontally and the middle group is moved to the left to uniformly space the groups see . Then the rightmost group is determined to be vertically out of alignment with the other two groups and is moved so that its top edge aligns with those of the other groups as shown in . Finally the bottom edge of the middle group is determined to be out of alignment with the other two groups through element analysis as described above the second image is determined to be shorter than the other two images and its size is increased accordingly. These steps result in a final alignment of the groups as shown in . With all groups and elements aligned at step the web server may publish the web page s .

The website builder may further have a video production module herein video producer that aids the user in producing video content herein videos for the user s website or other online platforms. The video producer may be a standalone module of the system or it may be component of another module such as the data processing module or website generation module . The video producer may create videos based on content obtained from the user s web presence including the website built or under development within the website builder application. Upon publication of the website or completion of the video the video producer may publish the video to one or more of the online platforms. In some embodiments publication of the video may improve search engine indexing of the video and the web page s on which it appears.

The web server may be configured to generate a video having any suitable purpose or message. Examples include an introduction or overview of the user s business an instructional video for a product a video tour of a space e.g. the user s store and the like. illustrates an example method of generating a profile or overview video using website elements added to the website builder application. At step the web server may provide the website builder interface as in step described above. At step the web server may collect video content from the website elements added by the user to the website via the website builder interface. Step may be performed during the website layout process. That is the web server may collect the video content as the user is building his website in the website builder application. Alternatively the web server may collect the video content after the user has finalized the website design and is ready to publish or has published the website. In another embodiment the web server may collect the video content from a published website using any suitable content scraping algorithm to obtain the video content described below.

The video content may include theme data and presentation data. Theme data may include data that provides a unifying look and feel or background for the presentation data. Theme data may include business logos color schemes fonts and typesets design elements such as lines curves and shapes sound files or streams element layouts and the like. Theme data may be extracted from text or graphic elements uploaded drawn or typed by the user as well as from the source code of the web page. The web server may identify primary themes from the theme data by frequency or prominence analysis. Frequency analysis may include a count of the times an element of theme data is repeated on a web page or across the user s website as a whole. For example if an image serves as a background image for every web page on the user s website the web server may identify the two or three most used colors in the image as the color scheme of the website. The web server may use any suitable method for identifying frequently used colors such as by counting pixels having a certain color value i.e. a certain RGB or CMYK value or range of values. Prominence analysis may include an identification of the theme data elements that are displayed in the typically most viewed locations of a web page. For example the web server may identify business logos and color scheme s from the masthead of a web page and may identify the most important typesetting from the masthead and or headers on the web page. In some embodiments the web server may identify fonts or typesets from the source code of the web page or by performing optical character recognition of images on the web page and font comparisons of any text identified in the images to know fonts or typesets.

Presentation data may include data that conveys descriptive content about the business to viewers. Presentation data may include text e.g. headers paragraphs etc. images slideshows video clips information from interactive web applications information in hyperlinks e.g. web addresses or from hyperlinked content and the like. The web server may identify elements of presentation data by content type such as text image video etc. The content type may be identifiable from HTML tags in the web page source code from a filename of the element e.g. store photo.gif may be identified as an image by its file extension or from element type indicators used within the website builder program. In an example of the latter the website builder interface provided at step is a drag and drop environment where the user selects the type of content to add and drags a new element into the design environment to insert the element into the web page the web server tracks the content type of the added element. The web server may further identify elements of presentation data by more informational categories. For example text may be identified as title header paragraph and the like according to its HTML tag.

The web server may identify organizational details describing the presentation data elements. Organizational details may include the web page title or template e.g. home page about us page contact page menu product list page from which the element was obtained placement on the web page e.g. masthead center bottom whether the data element was emphasized e.g. by italicized or capital letters relatively larger font or different font or background color from surrounding elements and other information about how the presentation data is organized that may indicate which data elements are prominent and should be included in the video.

At step the web server may optionally collect supplemental video content that includes theme data and or presentation data obtainable from another data source outside of the web page such as from any of the data stores accessible by the web server . For example the web server may collect presentation data from social networking platforms on which the user has an account or profile or from an online business listing data store e.g. YELP on which the user s business is listed. Such presentation data may be obtained from interaction data collect e.g. at step as described above. In some embodiments the supplemental presentation data may include stock images video or other video content that the web server may obtain from a stock content data store. The web server may obtain suitable stock content by identifying the industry of the user s business and searching for relevant stock content.

In some embodiments the web server may store the theme data and presentation data as records in a database. The records may be arranged in a data structure that facilitates creation of the video. In some embodiments certain data elements such as the business name and industry may be required for video creation and the data structure may include a record for each required element. Another content requirement may be a predetermined amount of text or video data that is sufficient to create a video of a desired length. For example the web server may be required to collect at least 150 words from paragraph tags on the website to create a voiceover or readable text overlay for a 30 second video. The web server may continue to collect content at steps and at least until it stores theme data or presentation data in each of the required element records.

At step the web server may produce the video. In some embodiments the theme data and presentation data may be stitched together with audio small animations etc. using any suitable video production technique. Based on the intent and context of how an image or text is used on each web page e.g. items on a page titled menu may be displayed differently than pictures in the About us page the video may modify the display of data collected from each of those web pages. In one embodiment the web server may engage a video production server to create the video. The video production server may be operated by the web server or by a third party. For example the web server may format the collected theme data and presentation data for use by the ANIMOTO video creation service and may transmit the formatted data to a video production server operated by ANIMOTO. The web server may then receive the completed video from ANIMOTO.

At step the web server may publish the video in one or more online locations. The web server may embed the video on the user s website and may publish the website together with the video. Additionally or alternatively the web server may publish the video on YOUTUBE and or another video streaming service.

The schematic flow chart diagrams included are generally set forth as logical flow chart diagrams. As such the depicted order and labeled steps are indicative of one embodiment of the presented method. Other steps and methods may be conceived that are equivalent in function logic or effect to one or more steps or portions thereof of the illustrated method. Additionally the format and symbols employed are provided to explain the logical steps of the method and are understood not to limit the scope of the method. Although various arrow types and line types may be employed in the flow chart diagrams they are understood not to limit the scope of the corresponding method. Indeed some arrows or other connectors may be used to indicate only the logical flow of the method. For instance an arrow may indicate a waiting or monitoring period of unspecified duration between enumerated steps of the depicted method. Additionally the order in which a particular method occurs may or may not strictly adhere to the order of the corresponding steps shown.

Various embodiments of the invention may be implemented at least in part in any conventional computer programming language. For example some embodiments may be implemented in a procedural programming language e.g. C or in an object oriented programming language e.g. C . Other embodiments of the invention may be implemented as preprogrammed hardware elements e.g. application specific integrated circuits FPGAs and digital signal processors or other related components.

In some embodiments the disclosed apparatus and methods e.g. see the various flow charts described above may be implemented as a computer program product for use with a computer system. Such implementation may include a series of computer instructions fixed either on a tangible medium such as a computer readable medium e.g. a diskette CD ROM ROM or fixed disk or transmittable to a computer system via a modem or other interface device such as a communications adapter connected to a network over a medium.

The medium may be either a tangible medium e.g. optical or analog communications lines or a medium implemented with wireless techniques e.g. WIFI microwave infrared or other transmission techniques . The series of computer instructions can embody all or part of the functionality previously described herein with respect to the system.

Those skilled in the art should appreciate that such computer instructions can be written in a number of programming languages for use with many computer architectures or operating systems. Furthermore such instructions may be stored in any memory device such as semiconductor magnetic optical or other memory devices and may be transmitted using any communications technology such as optical infrared microwave or other transmission technologies.

Among other ways such a computer program product may be distributed as a removable medium with accompanying printed or electronic documentation e.g. shrink wrapped software preloaded with a computer system e.g. on system ROM or fixed disk or distributed from a server or electronic bulletin board over the network e.g. the Internet or World Wide Web . Of course some embodiments of the invention may be implemented as a combination of both software e.g. a computer program product and hardware. Still other embodiments of the invention are implemented as entirely hardware or entirely software.

The present invention has been described in terms of one or more preferred embodiments and it should be appreciated that many equivalents alternatives variations and modifications aside from those expressly stated are possible and within the scope of the invention.
