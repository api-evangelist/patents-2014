title: Trusted user circles
abstract: A trusted user circle server for encryption key distribution and authentication support, as well as a client-side application which resides on user's devices are disclosed. In particular, the trusted user circle server manages a repository for static public keys (SPUK) which are used for authentication and secure distribution of a dynamic private context key (DPCK) used for the end-to-many encryption. Accordingly, posting users encrypt posted document using the DPCK and viewing users retrieve the DPCK to decrypt the posted document. These keys are associated to the trusted user circle and are generated dynamically for a given circle policy context (CPC). The CPC is an identifier that represents a group of members of a trusted user circle. It changes whenever any member of the trusted user circle leave it, when a new trusted user circle is created or when the DPCK expires after a pre-determined period of time.

A social network is a social structure e.g. community made of members e.g. a person or a user connected by social relationships such as friendship kinship relationships of beliefs knowledge prestige culture etc. Individual computers linked electronically are used to form the basis of computer mediated social interaction and networking within a social network community. A social networking service is a platform to build computer mediated social networks. Throughout this disclosure the terms social network and social network service may be used interchangeably and refer to a computer mediated social network having computer servers to facilitate social interaction among members of the social network. Many social networks are web based that allow each individual user to create a public profile to create a list of users referred to as social network friends with whom to share information and to exchange social network messages e.g. e mail and instant messaging as well as share user posted documents e.g. photo video sharing and blog posting among social network friends. In a broader sense the term social network may also refer to other online communities such as Internet forum or message board that is an online discussion site where users hold conversations in the form of posted messages.

Examples of computer mediated social network services include Facebook a registered trademark of Facebook Inc. Palo Alto Calif. Myspace a registered trademark of Myspace Inc. Beverly Hills Calif. Twitter a registered trademark of Twitter Inc. San Francisco Calif. LinkedIn a registered trademark of LinkedIn Ltd. Mountain View Calif. etc. Certain social network services provide application programming interfaces APIs allowing programmatic retrieval of social network messages by third party developers.

Public key cryptography also known as asymmetric cryptography is a class of cryptographic algorithms which require two separate keys one of which is secret or private and one of which is public. Although different the two parts of this key pair are mathematically linked. The public key is used for encryption whereas the private key is used for decryption. The term asymmetric stems from the use of different keys to perform these opposite functions each the inverse of the other. In contrast symmetric cryptography relies on the same key to perform both encryption and decryption.

Other aspects of the invention will be apparent from the following detailed description and the appended claims.

Specific embodiments of the invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying figures. Like elements in the various figures are denoted by like reference numerals for consistency.

In the following detailed description of embodiments of the invention numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a more thorough understanding of the invention. However it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known features have not been described in detail to avoid unnecessarily complicating the description.

Embodiments of the invention provide a trusted user circle server for encryption key distribution and authentication support as well as a client side application which resides on user s devices. In one or more embodiments the trusted user circle server manages a repository for static public keys SPUK which are used for authentication and secure distribution of a dynamic private context key DPCK used for the end to many encryption. Accordingly posting users encrypt posted document using the DPCK and viewing users retrieve the DPCK to decrypt the posted document. These keys are associated to the trusted user circle and are generated dynamically for a given circle policy context CPC . The CPC is an identifier that represents a group of members of a trusted user circle. It changes whenever any member of the trusted user circle leave it when a new trusted user circle is created or when the DPCK expires after a pre determined period of time.

As shown in the system includes various components coupled via computer network These components include users e.g. user A user B user C etc. and corresponding user devices e.g. user device A user device B user device C etc. a website and a trusted user circle server . In one or more embodiments the computer network may include wired and or wireless portions of the Internet and or other data communications networks such as wide area networks WANs local area networks LANs etc. As shown a portion of the users may be members of various trusted user circles that allow members to join or exit from time to time. For example the user A user B user C etc. are members of the trusted user circle while the user A user B etc. remain members of the updated trusted user circle subsequent to the user C exiting the trusted user circle . Although only the trusted user circle and updated trusted user circle are shown in other overlapping or non overlapping trusted user circles not shown may also exist in the system . In addition certain users not shown may not be members of any trusted user circle but merely users of the website . Throughout this disclosure an action performed by the user device as directed by the user may be referred to as being performed by the user of the user device.

Further as shown in the trusted user circle server includes a user manager trusted user circle manager and repository . In one or more embodiments the user manager and trusted user circle manager include software hardware or a combination thereof that collectively perform tasks of the trusted user circle server based on information stored in the repository . The repository may be used for storing trusted user circle profiles of various trusted user circles and user keys accessible to members of various trusted user circles. As shown the trusted user circle profile A includes information associated with the trusted user circle and updated versions thereof. In addition the user keys include user A keys having static public key SPUK A encrypted dynamic private context key EDPCK A and updated EDPCK A of the user A user B keys having SPUK B EDPCK B and updated EDPCK B of user B user C keys having SPUK C and encrypted DPCK C of user C and other user s keys. The repository and or any of the data collections stored therein may be a data store such as a database a file system one or more data structures e.g. arrays link lists tables hierarchical data structures etc. configured in a memory an extensible markup language XML file any other suitable medium for storing data or any suitable combination thereof. The repository may be a device internal to the trusted user circle server . Alternatively the repository may be an external storage device operatively connected to the trusted user circle server .

In one or more embodiments the users are individuals or persons who use the website for accessing information such as the posted document A post document B etc. The user devices include any device configured with computing and communication capability such as a smart phone tablet computer notebook computer desktop computer personal digital assistant gaming device etc. As noted above the user A user B and user C are members of one or more trusted user circles and are also users of the trusted user circle server . In one or more embodiments the website may be a social network website email website Internet forum website blog website or other online community website where user posted information are shared by users according to access credentials and policies of the website . In one or more embodiments the trusted user circle server in cooperation with associated client applications e.g. a browser plug in a mobile app etc. installed on user devices provide functionalities that allow users to join one or more trusted user circles for sharing user posted documents on the website with an additional layer of access control. This additional layer of access control is in addition to and separate from the access credentials and policies of the website . In one or more embodiments the trusted user circle server in cooperation with associated client applications installed on user devices provide the aforementioned functionalities using the method described in reference to below.

Turning to each of the components within the trusted user circle server in one or more embodiments of the invention the trusted user circle server includes the user manager that is configured to manage user keys for authenticating user access to the trusted user circle server and functionalities provided therefrom. In one or more embodiments when a user registers to access functionalities of the trusted user circle server e.g. by creating an account on the trusted user circle server the user manager generates a random token referred to as the static seeding token or SST for the user and sends this user specific SST to the user device. In response the user device in particular a client application executing on the user device generates an encryption key based on the SST and a user attribute e.g. a password . In one or more embodiments the encryption key is a public and private key pair based on asymmetric cryptography. The public and private keys remain unchanged regardless if the user joins or exits any trusted user circle and therefore are referred to as static keys. Specifically the public key is referred to as a static public key SPUK and the private key is referred to as a static private key SPRK . Once generated the user device uploads the SPUK to the trusted user circle server where the user manager stores the uploaded SPUK in the user keys . This mechanism ensures that even if two different users have the same password their SPUKs are different and it allows portability of the SPRK among all the user s devices.

As shown in the user device A generates the key pair SPUK SPRK A and uploads the SPUK portion of the key pair to the trusted user circle server as the SPUK A . Similarly the user device B generates the key pair SPUK SPRK B and uploads the SPUK portion of the key pair to the trusted user circle server as the SPUK B . Further the user device C generates the key pair SPUK SPRK C and uploads the SPUK portion of the key pair to the trusted user circle server as the SPUK C .

In one or more embodiments access to the trusted user circle server and information stored in the repository requires user authentication. In one or more embodiments the users authenticate with the trusted user circle server using their SPRKs. Since the trusted user circle server has a copy of all the users SPUKs the user manager sends a random challenge phrase to the user during authentication plus a copy of the previously generated user specific SST if the user device needs to regenerate the SPRK. In response the user encrypts a response phrase using his her SPRK and sends the encrypted response phrase back to the trusted user circle server . Accordingly the user manager decrypts the encrypted response phrase using the user s SPUK and if the challenge and response phrases perfectly aligns then the user is authenticated. After being authenticated the user may choose to either to store the SPRK on his her user device for future use or to regenerate the SPRK each time the user accesses the trusted user circle server .

In one or more embodiments of the invention the trusted user circle server includes the trusted user circle manager that is configured to manage the trusted user circle profiles for controlling user access to posted documents on the website based on the aforementioned additional layer of access control. In one or more embodiments the trusted user circle is created and organized by an organizing user such as the user A . Accordingly the user A is referred to as the organizing user and the user device A is referred to as the organizing user device. In one or more embodiments in response to a circle creation request from the user A to create the trusted user circle the trusted user circle manager creates an identifier of the trusted user circle and stores the identifier as the circle policy context CPC identifier A the trusted user circle profile A of the trusted user circle .

In one or more embodiments in response to a member invitation request from the user A the trusted user circle manager sends an invitation to the user device B and user device C to invite the user B and user C to join the trusted user circle . Accordingly the user B and user C join the trusted user circle in response to the invitation. For example one or more of the user B and user C may already be users of the trusted user circle server prior to receiving the invitation and can readily accept the invitation to join the trusted user circle . In another example one or more of the user B and user C may not be users of the trusted user circle upon receiving the invitation and will need to register for account creation on the trusted user circle server before becoming members of the trusted user circle .

In one or more embodiments the CPC identifier is updated in response to one or more pre determined events such as any member exiting the trusted user circle or the expiration of a pre determined expiration period. In one or more embodiments the CPC identifier remains unchanged when any new member joins the trusted user circle . In one or more embodiments the CPC identifier is updated when the user C exits the trusted user circle . Upon the user C exiting the trusted user circle is updated to become the updated trusted user circle . Accordingly the trusted user circle manager updates the CPC identifier to generate an updated version of the CPC identifier . As shown in this update version is stored in the trusted user circle profile A as the updated CPC identifier . Additional versions of the CPC identifier may continue to be generated and stored in the trusted user circle profile A as other members exit the trusted user circle or as pre determined expiration periods expire periodically. In one or more embodiments as the membership of the trusted user circle evolves due to new member joining and or existing member exiting the trusted user circle manager keep track of the membership history in the trusted user circle membership history . In one or more embodiments those membership change events in the trusted user circle membership history and including removal of any exiting member are linked to corresponding CPC identifiers as indicated by the arrows connecting the trusted user circle membership history to the CPC identifier and the updated CPC identifier .

When a new CPC identifier e.g. CPC identifier or a new version e.g. updated CPC identifier is created a dynamic private context key DPCK e.g. DPCK or an updated version of the DPCK not shown is generated by the organizing user device e.g. user device A . In one or more embodiments the DPCK is a pseudo random key that is generated by the user device A with the combination of the CPC identifier and the SPRK of user A . For example in response to creating the trusted user circle the user device A may obtain the CPC identifier from the trusted user circle manager to generate the DPCK . In another example in response to an indication that the user C has exit the trusted user circle the user device A may obtain the update CPC identifier from the trusted user circle manager to generate an updated version of the DPCK . Such indication may come from the user A processing the removal of the user B from the trusted user circle or from the trusted user circle manager updating the trusted user circle membership history due to the user C exiting the trusted user circle . In one or more embodiments the user device A may regenerate various different versions of the DPCK by requesting corresponding versions the CPC identifier from the trusted user circle manager .

In one or more embodiments the trusted user circle server in cooperation with the user device A distribute various versions of the DPCK upon creation thereof. Specifically when the user A acts as the organizing user in processing new member addition and or exiting member removal of the trusted user circle and or an updated circle thereof e.g. updated trusted user circle the user device A downloads SPUKs of all current members of the trusted user circle or updated circles thereof. The downloaded SPUKs are used to encrypt the current version of the DPCK for secure distribution to all current members. In one or more embodiments the encrypted current version of the DPCK is distributed via the trusted user circle server .

As shown in upon processing the addition of the user B and user C as new members to the trusted user circle the user device A downloads the SPUK B and SPUK C to encrypt the DPCK and generates the encrypted DPCK EDPCK B and the EDPCK C . The EDPCK B and EDPCK C are then uploaded to the trusted user circle server for use by the user B and user C respectively. In particular the uploaded EDPCK B and EDPCK C are stored by the user manager in the user A keys and the user B keys respectively where access requires authentication by the user manager . In addition upon processing the removal of the user C who exits the trusted user circle the user device A generates the updated version of the DPCK and downloads the SPUK B to encrypt the updated version of the DPCK thus generating the updated EDPCK B for the user B . The updated EDPCK B is then uploaded to the trusted user circle server and stored by the user manager in the user B keys . In particular since the user C is not a member of the updated trusted user circle the user device A does not generate any updated EDPCK using SPUK C and does not upload and store any additional EDPCK in the user C keys . Although the user A is the creator of the DPCK in one or more embodiments an DPCK and the updated version thereof are also encrypted using the SPUK A of the user A to generate the EDPCK A and the updated EDPACK A for uploading and storing in the user A keys . In one or more embodiments the user manager manages various versions of the EDPCK based on corresponding CPC identifiers. As shown in the EDPCK A EDPCK B and EDPCK C correspond to the trusted user circle and are linked to the CPC identifier contained in the trusted user circle profile A of the trusted user circle . Similarly the updated EDPCK A and updated EDPCK B correspond to the updated trusted user circle and are linked to the updated CPC identifier contained in the trusted user circle profile A of the trusted user circle . Based on the user authentication described above the user A keys is exclusively accessible by the user A the user B keys is exclusively accessible by the user B the user C keys is exclusively accessible by the user C and so on and so forth.

Based on the EDPCK stored in the user keys and managed by the user manager any user who is a current member of a particular trusted user circle may encrypt all documents posted on the website using a current version of the DPCK retrieved from a current version of his her EDPCK. Specifically the user requests his her EDPCK from the user manager and decrypt the EDPCK using his her SPRK to retrieve the DPCK. Each encrypted document is then combined with metadata containing information e.g. CPC identifier of all members of the particular trusted user circle before the combination is posted on the website . The metadata may also contain un encrypted advertisement or other URL information to facilitate a viewing user to join the trusted user circle. In one or more embodiments the metadata is generated and combined with the encrypted document by the posting user device.

As shown in prior to the user C exiting the trusted user circle the user B posted the posted document A using his EDPCK B . In this context the user B is referred to as a posting user and the user device B is referred to as a posting user device. In one or more embodiments the posted document A includes an encrypted document and the associated metadata where the metadata contains the CPC identifier . In addition subsequent to the user C exiting the trusted user circle the user B posted the posted document B using his updated EDPCK B . In one or more embodiments the posted document B includes another encrypted document and the associated metadata thereof where the metadata contains the updated CPC identifier .

The decryption of a posted document is based on the embedded CPC identifier. If a user is able to identify based on the embedded CPC identifier and has access to the correct version of the EDPCK corresponding to the posted document then the user is able to decrypt the EDPCK using his her SPRK and in turn decrypt the posted document for viewing. If the user is not associated with the embedded CPC identifier then his her EDPCK corresponding to the posted document is never generated and the user will not be able to decrypt the posted document for viewing.

As shown in whether before or after the user C exiting the trusted user circle the user C is always able to identify his EDPCK B from the CPC identifier embedded in the metadata of the posted document A . Accordingly the user C uses his her SPUK to decrypt the EDPCK B and retrieve the DPCK for further decrypting the posted document A . In this context the user C is referred to as a viewing user and the user device C is referred to as a viewing user device. In contrast because the posted document B is posted after the user C exiting the trusted user circle the user C is not able to identify any updated EDPCK from the updated CPC identifier embedded in the metadata of the posted document B that he she can decrypt using his her SPRK. Accordingly the user C may have access to the posted document B but is not able to decrypt for viewing.

Although embodiments described above are based on the public and private key pair of asymmetric cryptography in other embodiments symmetric cryptography may be used where one encryption key takes place of both the public key and the private key. In those embodiments the SPUK and SPRK are the same and referred to as a static encryption key while DPCK is referred to as a dynamic encryption key.

Initially in Step an organizing user device used by an organizing user within the trusted user circle obtains a circle policy context CPC identifier from a trusted user circle server separate from the website. Specifically the CPC identifier identifies membership information maintained by the trusted user circle server for the trusted user circle. In one or more embodiments the CPC identifier is initially generated by the trusted user circle server when the trusted user circle is initiated and organized by the organizing user. Subsequently the CPC identifier may be updated as the membership of the trusted user circle evolves with additions of new members and removals of exiting members.

In Step the organizing user device generates a dynamic private context key DPCK from a first static private key SPRK of the organizing user and the CPC identifier. Accordingly the DPCK is provided to the trusted user circle for all members to encrypt and decrypt member posted documents on the website. In one or more embodiments the DPCK is securely provided to each member of the trusted user circle via the trusted user circle server using the member s SPRK SPUK static public key pair based on asymmetric cryptography. In one or more embodiments the DPCK is linked with the CPC identifier in the trusted user circle server and the combination is accessible to all current members of the trusted user circle.

In Step an posting user device used by a posting user within the trusted user circle generates first metadata of a first document where the first metadata identifies the trusted user circle. In one or more embodiments the CPC identifier is accessible from the trusted user circle server to all current members of the trusted user circle. In such embodiments the first metadata includes the CPC identifier obtained from the trusted user circle by the posting user device.

In Step the posting user device uses the DPCK of the trusted user circle to encrypt the first document into the first encrypted document.

In Step the posting user device sends the first encrypted document associated with the first metadata to the website where the first encrypted document associated with the first metadata is posted on the website as a first posted document.

In Step the viewing user device obtains the first posted document from the website and analyzes the first metadata in the first posted document to retrieve the CPC identifier. In one or more embodiments the viewing user identifies and obtains from the trusted user circle based on the viewing user being within the trusted user circle the DPCK linked to the retrieved CPC identifier.

In Step in response to identifying the DPCK and based on the DPCK the viewing user device decrypts the first posted document in particular the first encrypted document included therein to retrieve the first document and present the first document to the viewing user.

In Step a second posted document is accessed on the website. In particular the second posted document is posted and otherwise accessed subsequent to a member exiting the trusted user group. Specifically the exiting member has viewed the first posted document described above and is the viewing user referred to herein. Accordingly the trusted user group becomes the updated trusted user group without the exiting member i.e. the viewing user referred to herein . As noted above any of the remaining members of the trusted user circle may also retrieve any posted document and become another viewing user. However throughout the description of the term viewing user refers to the particular viewing user described in Steps and above. Details of accessing the second posted document after the viewing user exiting the trusted user circle are described in reference to below.

As shown in in step in response to the viewing user exiting the trusted user circle the organizing user device obtains an updated CPC identifier from the trusted user circle server. Specifically the updated CPC identifier identifies updated membership information maintained by the trusted user circle for the updated trusted user circle.

In Step the organizing user device generates the updated DPCK from the first SPRK of the organizing user and the updated CPC identifier. Accordingly the updated DPCK is provided to the updated trusted user circle for all remaining members to encrypt and decrypt member posted documents on the website. In one or more embodiments the updated DPCK is securely provided to each member of the updated trusted user circle via the trusted user circle server using the member s SPRK SPUK static public key pair based on asymmetric cryptography. In one or more embodiments the updated DPCK is linked with the updated CPC identifier in the trusted user circle server and the combination is accessible to all remaining members of the updated trusted user circle.

In Step the posting user device generates second metadata of a second document where the second metadata identifies the updated trusted user circle. In one or more embodiments the updated CPC identifier is accessible from the trusted user circle server to all remaining members of the updated trusted user circle. In such embodiments the second metadata includes the updated CPC identifier obtained from the trusted user circle by the posting user device.

In Step the posting user device uses the updated DPCK to encrypt the second document into the second encrypted document.

In Step the posting user device sends the second encrypted document associated with the second metadata to the website where the second encrypted document associated with the second metadata is posted on the website as a second posted document.

In Step the viewing user device obtains the second posted document from the website and analyzes the second metadata in the second posted document to determine that the viewing user is not authorized to access the second document from the website based on the viewing user being separate from the updated trusted user circle. In one or more embodiments the viewing user device is not able to access the updated CPC identifier from the trusted user circle server based on the viewing user being separate from the updated trusted user circle. As a result the viewing user device is not able to recognize the updated CPC identifier in the second metadata. Accordingly the viewing user is not able to identify or obtain from the trusted user circle server the updated DPCK linked to the updated CPC identifier.

In Step in response to determining that the viewing user is not authorized to access the second document from the website the viewing user device presents the second posted document to the viewing user without decryption.

Although the description above relates to the viewing user device being able to decrypt the first encrypted document generated and posted by the posting user as well as being unable to decrypt the second encrypted document generated and posted by the same posting user in other examples the first encrypted document and the second encrypted document may be generated and posted by different members of the trusted user circle or the updated trusted user circle.

Further as shown in the viewing user screenshot A corresponds to a browser window on a smartphone referred to as the viewing user device used by Joe shown as the viewing user who has not installed on the smartphone any mobile app that performs the client portion of the authentication encryption decryption tasks described in reference to A and B above. For example Joe may not be a member of the trusted user circle where Andy belongs. In another example Joe may be a member or ex member of the same trusted user circle where Andy belongs but just bought the smartphone and has not had a chance to install the mobile app yet. The viewing user screenshot A shows Joe s browser window displaying Andy s posted document on the social network website where Andy s posted document shown as encrypted document is displayed in the encrypted format. In addition a URL link URL is displayed along with the encrypted document allowing Joe to install the mobile app by clicking on the URL . After Joe successfully installed the mobile app the browser window shown as the viewing user screenshot A is redirected as shown in below.

Further as shown in the viewing user screenshot C corresponds to a browser window on Joe s smartphone after Joe joins or rejoins the same trusted user circle where Andy belongs. Specifically the viewing user screenshot C shows Andy s posted document is now displayed in the decrypted format. The decryption is performed by the mobile app just installed on Joe s smartphone that performs the client portion of the authentication encryption decryption tasks described in reference to A and B above. Similar to the viewing user screenshot C any other current member of this trusted user circle who has the correct browser plugin or mobile app installed on his her user device is able to view Andy s posted document in the decrypted format.
