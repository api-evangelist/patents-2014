This application is a continuation and claims the benefit of priority under 35 USC 120 of U.S. application Ser. No. 12 795 396 filed Jun. 7 2010 and titled Method for Monitoring and Controlling Viewing Preferences of a User which is incorporated by reference.

Content viewers today are exposed to an overwhelming amount of information and are challenged by the degree of interaction and personalization needed to manage this massive amount of information. In an era of digital communications a user may be confused by an array of technology including traditional analog televisions DVRs Digital Video Recorders PVRs Personal Video Recorders media centers EPG Electronic Program Guide based systems Internet related content and traditional remote control devices.

A method includes receiving input related to advertising preferences of a user of a media system that is connected to a content delivery network and defining an advertisement control policy for the user of the media system based on the received input. The method also includes during viewing on the media system of a channel provided by the content delivery network controlling the media system to deliver advertisements based on the defined advertisement policy.

Implementations may include one or more of the following features. For example the method may include displaying channel information for advertisement channels made available on the content delivery network and receiving from the user of the media system selection of a subset of the displayed advertisement channels made available on the content delivery network. In this example the method may include defining an advertisement control policy based on the user selected subset of advertisement channels and when advertising content is needed on the media system controlling the media system to deliver advertisements from the user selected subset of advertisement channels.

In some implementations the method may include receiving input identifying a percentage allocation for each advertisement channel included in the user selected subset of advertisement channels. The percentage allocation may define a percentage of time the corresponding advertisement channel is used to deliver advertisements. In these implementations the method may include defining an advertisement control policy based on the percentage allocation for each advertisement channel included in the user selected subset of advertisement channels and controlling the media system to deliver advertisements from the user selected subset of advertisement channels in accordance with the percentage allocation for each advertisement channel included in the user selected subset of advertisement channels.

In some examples the method may include accessing at least one of targeting data related to preferred advertisement selection for the user of the media system and media system behavior analytics data for the user of the media system and automatically identifying without intervention of the user of the media system an advertisement channel for the user of the media system based on at least one of the targeting data and the media system behavior analytics data. In these examples the method may include defining an advertisement control policy based on the identified advertisement channel and when advertising content is needed on the media system controlling the media system to deliver advertisements from the identified advertisement channel.

In addition the method may include accessing targeting data related to preferred advertisement selection for the user of the media system and automatically identifying the advertisement channel for the user of the media system based on the targeting data. The method also may include accessing media system behavior analytics data for the user of the media system and automatically identifying the advertisement channel for the user of the media system based on the media system behavior analytics data. The method further may include accessing advertisement behavior analytics data for the user of the media system and automatically identifying an advertisement to display to the user of the media system based on the advertisement behavior analytics data. The advertisement behavior analytics data may describe advertisement viewing behavior of the user of the media system and remote control activity of the user of the media system during display of advertisements.

Also the method may include automatically selecting without intervention of the user of the media system and from among multiple different advertisement channels made available on the content delivery network an advertisement channel for the user of the media system based on at least one of the targeting data and the media system behavior analytics data. The method further may include identifying advertisements for the user of the media system based on at least one of the targeting data and the media system behavior analytics and defining a user specific advertisement channel for the user of the media system that includes the advertisements identified based on at least one of the targeting data and the media system behavior analytics.

In some implementations the method may include receiving input related to advertising delivery preferences of the user of the media system and determining one or more rules for controlling advertisement delivery based on the advertising delivery preferences. In these implementations the method may include defining an advertisement control policy based on the one or more advertisement delivery rules and controlling the media system to deliver advertisements based on the one or more advertisement delivery rules.

The method may include receiving a selection from among options 1 to repeatedly receive an advertisement after a particular period of time of content viewing on the media system 2 to repeatedly receive an advertisement upon change of a channel being output by the media system and 3 to repeatedly receive an advertisement upon change of a content file being output by the media system. The method also may include determining a rule to repeatedly deliver an advertisement after a particular period of time of content viewing on the media system monitoring for completion of the particular period of time of content viewing on the media system and repeatedly delivering an advertisement upon detecting completion of the particular period of time of content viewing on the media system.

In some examples the method may include receiving a selection from among options 1 to repeatedly receive an advertisement after a particular period of time of content viewing on the media system 2 to repeatedly receive an advertisement upon change of a channel being output by the media system and 3 to repeatedly receive an advertisement upon change of a content file being output by the media system. In these examples the method may include determining a rule to repeatedly deliver an advertisement upon change of a channel being output by the media system monitoring for change of a channel being output by the media system and repeatedly delivering an advertisement upon detecting change of a channel being output by the media system.

In some implementations the method may include receiving a selection from among options 1 to repeatedly receive an advertisement after a particular period of time of content viewing on the media system 2 to repeatedly receive an advertisement upon change of a channel being output by the media system and 3 to repeatedly receive an advertisement upon change of a content file being output by the media system. In these implementations the method may include determining a rule to repeatedly deliver an advertisement upon change of a content file being output by the media system monitoring for change of a content file being output by the media system and repeatedly delivering an advertisement upon detecting change of a content file being output by the media system.

In addition the method may include receiving input defining whether advertisements should be output on a primary output device of the media system output on an output device of a remote control of the media system or output on both the primary output device of the media system and the output device of the remote control of the media system. The method also may include determining a first rule to output advertisements on the primary output device of the media system in response to receiving input defining that advertisements should be output on the primary output device of the media system determining a second rule to output advertisements on the output device of the remote control of the media system in response to receiving input defining that advertisements should be output on the output device of the remote control of the media system and determining a third rule to output advertisements on both the primary output device of the media system and the output device of the remote control of the media system in response to receiving input defining that advertisements should be output on both the primary output device of the media system and the output device of the remote control of the media system. The method further may include controlling the media system to deliver advertisements using the primary output device of the media system in response to determining the first rule controlling the media system to deliver advertisements using the output device of the remote control of the media system in response to determining the second rule and controlling the media system to deliver advertisements using both the primary output device of the media system and the output device of the remote control of the media system in response to determining the third rule.

In some examples the method may include determining a mandatory advertisement viewing period controlling the media system to output advertisements during the mandatory advertisement viewing period and controlling the media system to lock other functions of the media system during the mandatory advertisement viewing period. In these examples the method may include enabling the user of the media system to perform other functions of the media system or continue receiving advertisements after completion of the mandatory advertisement viewing period.

Also the method may include detecting that the mandatory advertisement viewing period has completed and in response to detecting that the mandatory advertisement viewing period has completed outputting an indication that the mandatory advertisement viewing period has completed while continuing to output advertisements and enabling the user of the media system to provide input to return to viewing on the media system the channel provided by the content delivery network. The method further may include detecting that the mandatory advertisement viewing period will complete within a particular amount of time and in response to detecting that the mandatory advertisement viewing period will complete within the particular amount of time outputting an indication that the mandatory advertisement viewing period will complete within the particular amount of time while continuing to output advertisements and enabling the user of the media system to provide input to continue receiving advertisements after completion of the mandatory advertisement viewing period. When input is received to continue receiving advertisements prior to completion of the mandatory advertisement viewing period output of advertisements may be continued without automatically returning to the channel provided by the content delivery network at the completion of the mandatory advertisement viewing period. When input is not received to continue receiving advertisements prior to completion of the mandatory advertisement viewing period the channel provided by the content delivery network may be returned to at the completion of the mandatory advertisement viewing period automatically without intervention of the user of the media system.

In some implementations the method may include selecting advertising content to present on a remote control device that is included in the media system and that controls a media device included in the media system sending the selected advertising content to the remote control device and displaying the selected advertising content on a display of the remote control device without impacting display of content output by the media device controlled by the remote control device. In these implementations the method may include selecting an advertisement to present on the remote control device based on content concurrently being output by the media device controlled by the remote control device. Further in these implementations the method may include receiving user input interacting with the advertising content displayed on the remote control device and performing one or more operations based on the user input interacting with the advertising content displayed on the remote control device.

In some examples the method may include controlling a voice over internet protocol module included in a remote control device to establish a telephone call based on an advertisement being delivered by the media system. The remote control device may be included in the media system and may be configured to control a media device included in the media system. In these examples the method may include controlling the voice over internet protocol module included in the remote control device to place a telephone call to a representative of a company that provided the advertisement being delivered by the media system. Additionally in these examples the method may include controlling the voice over internet protocol module included in the remote control device to receive a telephone call from a representative of a company that provided the advertisement being delivered by the media system.

Further the method may include maintaining an expiration attribute for an advertisement eligible for delivery by the media system. The expiration attribute may define a time when the advertisement expires and is no longer eligible for delivery by the media system. The method also may include determining that the advertisement has expired based on the expiration attribute and in response to determining that the advertisement has expired preventing the advertisement from being served by the media system and causing deletion of the advertisement from electronic storage included in the media system to the extent the advertisement has been stored in electronic storage included in the media system.

The method may include causing an advertisement to be streamed to the media system. The method also may include causing an advertisement to be pre downloaded to electronic storage of the media system in advance of a time when the advertisement is to be presented and at the time when the advertisement is to be presented presenting the advertisement pre downloaded to electronic storage of the media system.

In another aspect a system includes at least one computer and at least one computer readable medium coupled to the at least one computer having instructions stored thereon which when executed by the at least one computer causes the at least one computer to perform operations. The operations include receiving input related to advertising preferences of a user of a media system that is connected to a content delivery network and defining an advertisement control policy for the user of the media system based on the received input. The operations also include during viewing on the media system of a channel provided by the content delivery network controlling the media system to deliver advertisements based on the defined advertisement policy.

In yet another aspect at least one computer readable storage medium is encoded with at least one computer program comprising instructions that when executed operate to cause a processor to perform operations. The operations include receiving input related to advertising preferences of a user of a media system that is connected to a content delivery network and defining an advertisement control policy for the user of the media system based on the received input. The operations also include during viewing on the media system of a channel provided by the content delivery network controlling the media system to deliver advertisements based on the defined advertisement policy.

The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other potential features and advantages of the disclosure will be apparent from the description and drawings and from the claims.

Multiple types of content such as audio e.g. music podcasts video and still images e.g. photographs may be made available over the content delivery network . Licensed and license free content may be made available. For example licensed content may be acquired from a content owner .

Content may be made available from a variety of sources. For example Internet content may be accessed from an Internet link e.g. URL Uniform Resource Locator . Content may also be accessed from peer to peer networks. For example content may be accessed from one or more BitTorrent clients which are part of one or more BitTorrent swarms . Content may be accessed from other sources such as from a television broadcast e.g. MSO Multiple System Operator cable satellite local or from content e.g. photographs audio previously recorded video available from devices e.g. DVR stereo computer DVD Digital Video Disc player connected to a user s home network and or located in a user s home.

Content curators may use a content curator portal to define custom channels which may be made available for subscription by end users . The content curators may be commissioned to search for select and organize multiple types of content from various sources into channels. Content curators may for example organize channels by topic or genre. Content curators may for example select licensed content license free content BitTorrent content or content from their private collection to name a few examples.

Channels may be offered for free to end users or end users may subscribe to channels on a fee basis. Users may rate or rank channels or content curators based for example on programming selection sequencing and quality. Content curators may be promoted for example based on popularity.

Content owners may be compensated for the use of licensed content that they own which is used in channels defined by content curators . For example the system may provide support for digital rights management DRM . By allowing access to their licensed content content owners may experience increased distribution and revenue and targeted exposure in focused channels. Multiple revenue agreements may be possible such as per use agreements subscription revenue sharing and advertisement revenue sharing.

A content curator may work with one or more advertisers such as an ad agency to include advertisements on a channel. For example an advertisement may be displayed if a user switches a channel or when a program finishes. As another example advertisements may be displayed on the display of a remote control device such as while a program is being displayed on a television. Content curators advertisers and content owners may share advertising revenue. Sharing in advertising revenue may provide an incentive for content curators to create interesting and popular channels. A content curator may work with one or more advertisers to create one or more advertisements which are customized and targeted for one or more particular channels. End users may customize advertisement viewing preferences such as by specifying preferred topics preferred or excluded companies region preferences etc.

Advertisers may use an advertiser portal to upload advertisements and to control advertisement publication. Advertisers may define and apply advertisement insertion rules to particular advertisements and or may allow a content curator to decide when and how to insert the advertisements into channels defined by the content curator . APIs Application Programming Interfaces may be provided which allow advertisers to enable the system to interface with standard advertisement inventory management systems to allow for control and management of advertisements . Various advertisement pricing plans may be supported such as individually priced ads or bulk pricing. Other advertising features may be included such as online purchasing of items or providing customer contact options.

Advertisers content curators and content owners may access user viewing behavior data. Advertisers may access user viewing behavior data such as viewed channels viewed content viewed advertisements advertisement display frequency advertisement viewed length user actions during advertisement display user characteristics advertisement and content view times advertisement and content view counts and hosting channel information to monitor reach and performance of advertising campaigns. Advertisements may be targeted to specific users based on recorded user viewing behavior data. Content curators may access user viewing behavior data to learn about behaviors of end users who subscribe to their channels. Content owners may access user viewing behavior data to learn about their fan base such as accessing information about user demographics time of day of access and user actions during content display. Content presentation and playback may be customized and personalized for a particular end user based specifically on recorded user viewing behavior of the particular end user and generally on recorded user viewing behavior of all users.

User viewing behavior data may be captured for example by a media player and or a downloader device . The media player and or the downloader device may play content included or ordered on a channel defined by a content curator . In some implementations the media player may play content downloaded from the content delivery network by the downloader device . In some implementations the media player and the downloader device are different logical functions of the same physical device. In other implementations the media player and the downloader device are different physical devices. In some implementations the media player is a software application which may be executed for example on a computing device such as a desktop or laptop computer.

The media player and or the downloader device may be connected to external media storage devices respectively. The external media storage devices may be for example USB Universal Serial Bus drives. The external media storage devices may be used for example to transfer data to from the media player or the downloader device respectively such as to transfer data to from a computing device.

The media player and or the downloader device may communicate wirelessly with one or more remote control devices . The end user may navigate through channels and perform other functions using the remote control device . The remote control device may communicate e.g. using Infrared IR technology of radio frequency RF technology with the television the media player and or the downloader device . The remote control device also may communicate over a network with the media player and or the downloader device to control functions of the media player or the downloader device . The remote control device may include a small display screen that displays preview content and or advertisements.

The media player and or the downloader device may download content from the content delivery network without consuming resources of a computing device owned by the end user . For example content may be downloaded into the home of an end user without using resources of a personal computer owned by the end user . The media player and the downloader device may use less electricity than a personal computer thus reducing the electric bill of the end user . The media player and or the downloader device may connect to other computing devices connected on a user s home network. The media player and or the downloader device may include built in functionality to communicate with and download information from a peer to peer network such as the BitTorrent swarm .

The end user may search for and subscribe to content using an end user content search portal . For example the end user content search portal may provide a directory listing of available defined channels. The directory listing may be organized in a hierarchy of categories and sub categories. A particular channel may appear in one or more categories or sub categories. The end user content search portal may also provide a search function to allow end users to search for available defined channels based on a keyword search. As another example users may search for channels based on other criteria such as sorting channels based on channel or content curator popularity or ranking. An end user may subscribe to a defined channel for example by selecting a channel link displayed in a directory listing or in a list of search results.

The end user may also search for and initiate download of individual content items to the downloader device using a partner site such as a BitTorrent search engine . As another example the end user may send an email which includes a content link to an email address associated with their downloader device to initiate an automatic download to the downloader device of the content linked to by the content link. The content link may refer to a content file available on the Internet and may be a reference to a video resource available from a streaming video website. The end user may send an email with an attachment to an email address associated with the downloader device to initiate a download of the attachment to the downloader device . The end user may use an end user content download portal to search for and to select content to download to the downloader device .

The content and directory database stores information about content and also information about defined channels. Content curators may use a content curator portal to define channels and to manage defined channels. The content curator portal may display a listing of licensed and license free content available in the content and directory database . The content curator portal may also provide a search function which allows the content curator to search for content available in the content and directory database and to also search for content included in the private collection of the content curator or content available on the Internet such as content available from peer to peer networks such as BitTorrent .

The content curator portal may communicate with a content curator server . For example a channel definition defined using the content curator portal may be sent to the content curator server which may communicate with the server system to request that the channel definition be stored in the content and directory database . As another example information for existing channel definitions associated with a particular content curator may be retrieved from the content and directory database and sent from the content curator portal server to the content curator portal for display.

In some implementations the content curator portal server is one physical server computing device and in other implementations the content curator portal server includes multiple physical server computing devices. Similarly in some implementations the server system is one physical server computing device and in other implementations the server system includes multiple physical server computing devices. In some implementations multiple physical server computing devices are used with some or all server computing devices implementing both the content curator portal server and the server system . In some implementations one physical server computing device is used with the one physical server device implementing both the content curator portal server and the server system .

The network may be one or more public or private wired or wireless networks such as the Internet or may be a Session Initiated Protocol SIP network such as the PsipTN network offered by TelTel . The network may include for example one or more of the Internet Wide Area Networks WANs Local Area Networks LANs analog or digital wired and wireless telephone networks e.g. a PSTN Integrated Services Digital Network ISDN and Digital Subscriber Line xDSL radio television cable satellite and or any other delivery or tunneling mechanism for carrying data services. The network may include multiple networks or subnetworks each of which may include for example a wired or wireless data pathway.

Content may be downloaded to one or more user media player downloader devices . For example content corresponding to a user subscribed channel may be automatically downloaded to the media player downloader device in response to a user selection of a corresponding channel. As another example a user may search for and download content to the media player downloader device . A user may using a remote user device monitor and manage user initiated downloads. The remote user device may be any type of electronic device configured to exchange communications with the server system over a network. The remote user device may be a general purpose computer e.g. a desktop personal computer a workstation or a laptop computer a mobile or wireless device or a device designed for a specific function e.g. a cell phone a smart phone a tablet PC a personal digital assistant PDA etc. .

Advertisements may be organized into one or more advertisement channels. One or more advertisers such as an ad agency may manage advertisement content using an advertiser portal . Advertisement content may be stored on an advertisement server . Advertisement content may be downloaded over the content delivery network to the media player downloader device . Advertisement content may also be sent to the remote control . As another example advertisement content may be streamed to the media player downloader device or the remote control . Advertisement content may be played on a display of the remote control and or advertisement content may be displayed on the television screen . Advertisements may be downloaded to the media player downloader device or to the remote control automatically without user intervention. In some implementations advertisements may expire. In these implementations expired advertisements are not displayed to the user and may be periodically deleted from the media player downloader device or the remote control .

Advertisement content may be displayed on the display of the remote control without impacting simultaneous display of non advertisement content on the television screen . The content consumer may use the remote control to interact with advertisement content displayed on a display of the remote control or advertisement content displayed on the television screen . The advertisement server may identify advertisement content to display based on content currently playing on the media player downloader device based on targeting data related to the content consumer or based on behavior analytics data collected in response to historical use of the media system and the remote control .

The system receives input related to advertising preferences of a user . For example the system may receive a user input indicating user selection of one or more advertisement channels to be used for displaying advertisement content. As another example the system may receive user input related to advertisement delivery timing e.g. receive advertisements every certain number of minutes receive advertisements upon channel change receive advertisements upon content file change and a preferred output device used to display advertisements e.g. primary output device of a media system such as a television screen or a display of a remote control device or both . The system may also receive input related to preferred interests of a user. Interests may also be inferred based on the types of content e.g. types of non advertising content or types of advertising content a user watches. Other advertisement preferences may be inferred such as from user demographics e.g. user age user gender user location .

The system defines an advertisement control policy for the user based on the received input . For example the system may define an advertisement control policy based on user selected advertisement channels to display advertisement content using the user selected advertisement channels. As another example the system may automatically identify without user intervention an advertisement channel from among multiple different advertisement channels based on targeting data and or media system behavior analytics data. The system may also define a user specific advertisement channel for the user that includes advertisements identified based on targeting data and or media system behavior analytics data.

In some implementations the system may identify a set of individual advertisements to display to the user where the individual advertisements are not included in an advertisement channel. Individual advertisements may be stored for example in a central advertisement repository e.g. a repository accessible by the advertisement server . The advertisement control policy may refer to the identified advertisements or may include a query definition for querying the advertisement repository for one or more individual advertisements where the query definition is based on the received input related to advertising preferences of the user.

The system may determine one or more rules for controlling advertisement delivery based on user advertising delivery preferences. For example the system may determine a rule to repeatedly deliver an advertisement after a particular period of time of content viewing on the media system to repeatedly deliver an advertisement upon change of a channel being output by the media system or to repeatedly deliver an advertisement upon change of a content file being output by the media system. As another example the system may determine a rule to output advertisements on the primary output device of the media system in response to receiving input defining that advertisements should be output on the primary output device of the media system determine a rule to output advertisements on the output device of the remote control of the media system in response to receiving input defining that advertisements should be output on the output device of the remote control of the media system or determine a rule to output advertisements on both the primary output device of the media system and the output device of the remote control of the media system in response to receiving input defining that advertisements should be output on both the primary output device of the media system and the output device of the remote control of the media system.

During viewing of a channel on a media system the system controls the media system to deliver advertisements based on the defined advertisement policy . For example the system may automatically switch to an advertisement channel such as a user selected advertisement channel a system identified advertisement channel or a user specific system defined advertisement channel. As another example the system may control the media system to deliver one or more advertisements selected from an advertisement repository. In this example the advertisements in the advertisement repository may not be included in an advertisement channel.

As another example if the advertisement control policy specifies that advertisements should be repeatedly delivered after a particular period of time of content viewing on the media system the system may monitor for completion of the particular period of time of content viewing on the media system and may repeatedly deliver an advertisement upon detecting completion of the particular period of time of content viewing on the media system. As yet another example if the advertisement control policy specifies that advertisements should be repeatedly delivered upon change of a content file being output by the media system the system may monitor for change of a content file being output by the media system and may repeatedly deliver an advertisement upon detecting change of a content file being output by the media system. If the advertisement control policy specifies that advertisements should be repeatedly delivered upon change of a channel being output by the media system the system may monitor for change of a channel being output by the media system and may repeatedly deliver an advertisement upon detecting change of a channel being output by the media system.

If the advertisement control policy specifies that advertisements should be output on the primary output device of the media system the system may control the media system to deliver advertisements using the primary output device of the media system. For example a media player downloader device may be controlled to output advertisements on a television screen. If the advertisement control policy specifies that advertisements should be output on the output device of the remote control of the media system advertisements may be delivered using the output device of the remote control of the media system. For example advertisements may be displayed on a display screen of the remote control device. If the advertisement control policy specifies that advertisements should be output on both the primary output device of the media system and the output device of the remote control of the media system advertisements may be delivered using both the primary output device of the media system and the output device of the remote control of the media system.

The system displays channel information for advertisement channels available on a content delivery network . For example representations of advertisement channels may be displayed on a user interface such as a user interface displayed on the display of a remote control device a user interface displayed on a primary output device of a media system e.g. television screen or a user interface displayed on a user interface portal. Channel information may include a channel name channel description channel number or channel category e.g. genre to name a few examples.

For example illustrates an example user interface which displays advertisement channel representations for advertisement channels and . Advertisement channel displays advertisements for products of a particular category e.g. automobiles . Advertisement channel may display advertisements selected by a particular advertisement jockey or content curator or may display advertisements for products recommended by a particular advertisement jockey or content curator. As another example the advertisement channel may display advertisements promoting one or more content curators and or one or more channels. Advertisement channel displays advertisements for products produced by a particular manufacturer and advertisement channel displays advertisements for a particular retailer. Advertisement channel displays advertisements related to a particular user interest e.g. sports and advertisement channel displays coupon advertisements. Other types of advertisement channels may be used such as a channel which displays advertisements with a regional or other geographic focus. As another example an advertisement channel may display gender specific advertisements.

The system receives selection of a subset of the advertisement channels available on the content delivery network . For example a user may select one or more advertisement channel representations from among a group of advertisement channel representations displayed in a user interface. For instance in the example of the user may select one or more of the advertisement channels and . As shown a first user user one has selected the advertisement channels and and a second user user N has selected the advertisement channel . The selections of the first user are stored as a first advertisement policy and the selections of the second user are stored as a second advertisement policy . The system uses the first advertisement policy to control advertisements presented to the first user and uses the second advertisement policy to control advertisements presented to the second user.

In addition to receiving selection of a subset of advertisement channels the system may also receive input identifying a percentage allocation for each advertisement channel included in the user selected subset of advertisement channels where the percentage allocation defines a percentage of time the corresponding advertisement channel is used to deliver advertisements. For example the first user has defined percentage allocations which specify that the allocation of time the advertisement channels and are to be used when delivering advertisements to the first user is fifty percent thirty percent and twenty percent respectively. Since the second user has selected only one advertisement channel the selected advertisement channel may be used one hundred percent of the time when advertisements are delivered to the second user.

The system defines an advertisement control policy based on the user selected subset of advertisement channels . For example the advertisement control policy may specify that advertising content delivered to the user be selected from the subset of advertisement channels based on the percentage allocation for each advertisement channel. Advertisements may be delivered for example on an interval basis e.g. every thirty minutes before the start of a new content item or when the user switches to a different channel to name a few examples.

When advertising content is needed the system controls the media system to deliver advertisements from the user selected subset of advertisement channels . For example the system may switch a channel from a channel to a user selected advertisement channel. A remote control device or a media player downloader device may switch a channel to an advertisement channel. The system may prevent the user from switching channels until at least a mandatory advertisement viewing time has elapsed.

Advertisements may be delivered in accordance with the percentage allocation for each advertisement channel. For example the system may track the amount of time advertising content is played from each advertisement channel included in the user selected subset of advertisement channels and may calculate a difference for each advertisement channel between the percentage allocation for the advertisement channel and the percentage of actual advertising content playback time for the advertisement channel e.g. for a particular advertisement channel the percentage allocation may be twenty percent but the current percentage of actual advertising content playback time for the channel may be eighteen percent . A next advertisement channel to use for advertising content may be selected by identifying the advertisement channel which has the maximum corresponding calculated difference.

For example a first advertisement channel may have a percentage allocation of twenty percent and an actual current advertising content playback percentage of eighteen percent for a calculated difference of two percent. A second advertisement channel may have a percentage allocation of thirty percent and an actual current advertising content playback percentage of twenty seven percent for a calculated difference of three percent. The second advertisement channel may be selected over the first advertisement channel for delivery of the next advertising content to be delivered to the user because it has a greater calculated difference.

In some implementations a user may use a user interface to select a set of individual advertisements to display e.g. where the individual advertisements are not included in an advertisement channel . For example the user may select a set of advertisement representations. An advertisement control policy may be defined which directs the system to select a user selected advertisement when advertisement content is needed. When advertisement content is needed the system may control the media system to access and deliver a user selected advertisement.

In some implementations a user selected advertisement is downloaded to the user s media player downloader device or to the user s remote control device after the user selects the advertisement and the advertisement is accessed from electronic storage of the media player downloader device or electronic storage of the remote control device when advertisement content is needed. In some implementations the system may determine whether to deliver advertising using a user selected individual advertisement using an advertisement channel or using a system identified individual advertisement. For example the system may select a user selected advertisement if a user selected advertisement is available and may deliver an advertisement from an advertisement channel or may identify an individual advertisement not selected by the user if there are no user selected individual advertisements available.

The system accesses targeting data related to preferred advertisement selection for a user . For example targeting data may be stored user preferences entered by a user which indicate preferred advertisement selections. A user may enter user preferences for example using a user interface displayed on a remote control device on a primary display of a media system e.g. television screen or on an end user portal. User preferences may be stored for example in a user profile.

The system accesses media system behavior analytics data for the user . For example the system may access media system behavior analytics data which is based on tracked content viewing behavior and or tracked remote control behavior of a user. The system may track channels subscribed to by the user and watched by the user and a type or genre of each channel. The system may also track content items watched by the user and a type or genre of each content item. The system may track a user s remote control actions such as interactions with advertisements e.g. browse product compare product purchase product fast forward advertisement rewind advertisement pause advertisement skip advertisement or a user s browsing of channels or content items in a content guide. In the example of the user profile data includes content attributes which indicate that user one is interested in sports programming and movie programming. The content attributes may be inferred for example based on the types of content e.g. types of non advertising content or types of advertising content watched by user one.

The system identifies an advertisement channel for the user based on the targeting data and the media system behavior analytics data . For example the system may identify from among a set of available advertisement channels one or more advertisement channels which relate to the targeting data and or the media system behavior analytics data. For instance in the example of an interest one advertisement channel and an interest three advertisement channel have been identified from a set of available advertisement channels based on the interests for inclusion in a set of advertisement channels for user one. As another example a sports equipment advertisement channel has been identified from the set of available advertisement channels based on the content attributes for inclusion in the set of advertisement channels for user one. As yet another example a California advertisement channel has been identified from the set of available advertisement channels based on the demographic data for inclusion in the set of advertisement channels for user one. The interest one advertisement channel and the interest three advertisement channel have been assigned priorities of one and two respectively because these channels are based on interests explicitly specified by user one and therefore have a relatively high likelihood of matching user one s interests. The sports equipment advertisement channel has been assigned a priority of three because it matches content explicitly selected by user one for viewing and therefore has been determined to have the next best chance of matching user one s interests. The California advertisement channel has been assigned a priority of four because it has been inferred from demographic data of user one and therefore has been determined to have the lowest chance of matching user one s interests of the selected advertisement channels.

In some implementations the system may create a user specific advertisement channel based on the targeting data and the media system behavior analytics data. For example illustrates a user specific advertisement channel created for a user one user based on user profile data . Similar to the user profile data described above with respect to the user profile data includes user interests demographic data and content attributes .

The user specific advertisement channel includes advertisements and . The advertisement and the advertisement are related to interest one and interest three respectively and may have been selected from among available advertisements based on the user interests . The advertisement may be an advertisement targeted to one or more demographics included in the demographics . The movie related advertisement and the sports related advertisement may have been selected based on the content attributes .

The user specific advertisement channel may include other types of advertisements. For example the advertisement is a weather related advertisement that is suitable for the current weather and the advertisement is a breaking news advertisement that is relevant to breaking news. Advertisements may also be selected based on trends identified by social media organizations. For example the advertisement is a trend related advertisement that corresponds to trends identified on social network messaging and or search systems. Advertisements may be time sensitive such as a retailer advertisement which has a particular expiration date. The content in a user specific advertisement channel may be updated dynamically in response to changes to a user s interests demographics media system behavior or to changes in an inventory of available advertisements.

In some implementations the system may identify a set of individual advertisements to display to the user based on the targeting data and the media system behavior analytics data where the individual advertisements are not included in an advertisement channel. Individual advertisements may be stored for example in a central advertisement repository e.g. a repository accessible by the advertisement server .

Returning to the system defines an advertisement control policy based on the identified advertisement channel . For example the advertisement control policy may specify that advertisements be delivered from one or more identified advertisement channels selected from among available advertisement channels or from a user specific advertisement channel. Advertisements may be delivered for example on an interval basis e.g. every thirty minutes before the start of a new content item or when the user switches to a different channel to name a few examples. In some implementations an advertisement control policy may refer to the identified individual advertisements which are not included in an advertisement channel or may include a query definition for querying an advertisement repository for one or more individual advertisements where the query definition is based on the targeting data and the media system behavior analytics data.

If multiple advertisement channels are identified from among available advertisement channels the advertisement control policy may indicate a priority order for the multiple identified advertisement channels. For instance in the example of the set of advertisement channels identified for user one includes a prioritization of advertisement channels in an order of advertisement channels and ordered from highest priority to lowest priority. For example the advertisement channel may have a more relevant match to the user profile data than the advertisement channel . If the advertisement control policy is based on a priority order of advertisement channels advertisement channels with a higher priority may be displayed more often than advertisement channels with a lower priority.

When advertising content is needed the system controls the media system to deliver advertisements from the identified advertisement channel . For example the system may switch a channel from a channel to an identified advertisement channel. For example a remote control device or a media player downloader device may switch a channel to an advertisement channel. The system may prevent the user from switching channels until at least a mandatory advertisement viewing time has elapsed after the system has caused an advertisement channel to be displayed. As another example the system may control the media system to deliver one or more advertisements selected from an advertisement repository.

The system receives input related to advertising delivery preferences of a user . For example a user may configure advertising delivery preferences on a user interface such as a user interface displayed on the display of a remote control device a user interface displayed on a primary output device of a media system e.g. television screen or a user interface displayed on an end user interface portal. For example illustrates an example user interface for configuring advertising delivery options.

The user may configure the timing of advertisement delivery using a timing area . For example the user may select control to repeatedly receive advertisements after a particular period of time e.g. thirty minutes of content viewing on the media system. The user may select control to repeatedly receive an advertisement upon change of a channel being output by the media system. The user may select control to repeatedly receive an advertisement upon change of a content file being output by the media system. The user may select control to enable self controlled advertising. For example with self controlled advertising the user may be required to manually select and watch a certain number of minutes e.g. one hundred minutes of advertising content per month. As another example the user may be required to manually select and watch a certain number of minutes of advertisement content where the viewing time of the advertisement content is a percentage of total non advertisement content viewing time. For example a user may be required on a periodic basis e.g. monthly to manually select and watch advertising content having a total viewing time equal to at least five percent of the total non advertising content viewing time for the user. The system may track the self controlled advertisement viewing of users and penalize users that do not meet the agreed upon advertisement viewing requirements. The penalty may be a monetary penalty or forced advertisement viewing in which a media system for a penalized user is locked until the agreed upon advertisement viewing requirements have been met.

The user may configure a target output device for advertisements using a device area . For example the user may select control to specify that advertisements should be output on a primary output device of the media system e.g. television screen . The user may select control to specify that advertisements should be output on an output device of a remote control of the media system e.g. a remote control display screen . The user may select control to specify that advertisements should be output on both the primary output device of the media system and the output device of the remote control of the media system.

Returning to the system determines one or more rules for controlling advertisement delivery based on the advertising delivery preferences . For instance in reference to the example of the system may determine a rule to repeatedly deliver an advertisement after a particular period of time of content viewing on the media system in response to user selection of the control . The system may determine a rule to repeatedly deliver an advertisement upon change of a channel being output by the media system in response to user selection of the control . The system may determine a rule to repeatedly deliver an advertisement upon change of a content file being output by the media system in response to user selection of the control . The system may configure a rule involving self controlled advertisement selection in response to user selection of the control .

In addition the system may determine a rule to output advertisements on the primary output device of the media system in response to user selection of the control . The system may determine a rule to output advertisements on the output device of the remote control of the media system in response to user selection of the control . The system may determine a rule to output advertisements on both the primary output device of the media system and the output device of the remote control of the media system in response to user selection of the control .

Returning to the system defines an advertisement control policy based on the one or more advertisement delivery rules . For example the system may define an advertisement control policy based on a rule related to advertisement delivery timing and or based on an advertisement delivery output device.

The system controls the media system to deliver advertisements based on the one or more advertisement delivery rules . For example if the advertisement control policy specifies that advertisements should be repeatedly delivered after a particular period of time of content viewing on the media system the system may monitor for completion of the particular period of time of content viewing on the media system and may repeatedly deliver an advertisement upon detecting completion of the particular period of time of content viewing on the media system. For example and as shown in a media system may be outputting non advertising content on a channel twenty one e.g. as illustrated by channel representation . After a particular time period e.g. thirty minutes has elapsed the system may switch to an advertisement channel sixty one e.g. as illustrated by channel representation . When advertisement content is complete the system switches back to the channel twenty one e.g. as illustrated by channel representation .

The system plays content on the channel for the particular time period and when the particular time period elapses again the system may switch to the advertisement channel sixty one e.g. as illustrated by channel representation . Similar to the cycle described above when advertisement content is complete the system switches back to the channel twenty one e.g. as illustrated by channel representation . Channel switching may be automatically performed without user intervention for example by a remote control device or by a media player downloader device. Although illustrates switching to an advertisement channel for advertisement delivery as another example one or more individual advertisements not included in an advertisement channel may be delivered.

Returning to as another example if the advertisement control policy specifies that advertisements should be repeatedly delivered upon change of a content file being output by the media system the system may monitor for change of a content file being output by the media system and may repeatedly deliver an advertisement upon detecting change of a content file being output by the media system.

If the advertisement control policy specifies that advertisements should be repeatedly delivered upon change of a channel being output by the media system the system may monitor for change of a channel being output by the media system and may repeatedly deliver an advertisement upon detecting change of a channel being output by the media system. For example and as shown in a media system may be outputting non advertising content on a channel twenty one e.g. as illustrated by channel representation . If the system detects a user request to change to a different channel e.g. channel twenty three the system may before switching to channel twenty three switch to an advertisement channel e.g. advertisement channel sixty one as illustrated by channel representation resulting in the output of advertisement content.

When the advertisement content is complete the system may switch to the requested channel twenty three e.g. as illustrated by channel representation . If the system detects a user request to change to a different channel e.g. channel twenty five the system may similar to the processing described above switch to an advertisement channel e.g. advertisement channel sixty one as illustrated by channel representation resulting in the output of advertisement content. When the advertisement content is complete the system may switch to the requested channel twenty five e.g. as illustrated by channel representation . Although illustrates switching to an advertisement channel for advertisement delivery as another example one or more individual advertisements not included in an advertisement channel may be delivered.

Returning to if the advertisement control policy specifies that advertisements should be output on the primary output device of the media system the system may control the media system to deliver advertisements using the primary output device of the media system. For example a media player downloader device may be controlled to output advertisements on a television screen. For example an advertisement displayed on a television screen may be selected based on content being displayed on the display of a remote control device. For example a content preview file or a content file may be displayed on the remote control device and an advertisement to display on the television screen may be selected based on the genre of the content preview file or content file being displayed on the remote control device.

If the advertisement control policy specifies that advertisements should be output on the output device of the remote control of the media system advertisements may be delivered using the output device of the remote control of the media system. For example advertisements may be displayed on a display screen of the remote control device. For example an advertisement displayed on a remote control device may be selected based on content being displayed on a television screen. For example a content preview file or a content file may be displayed on the television screen and an advertisement to display on the remote control device may be selected based on the genre of the content preview file or content file being displayed on the television screen.

If the advertisement control policy specifies that advertisements should be output on both the primary output device of the media system and the output device of the remote control of the media system advertisements may be delivered using both the primary output device of the media system and the output device of the remote control of the media system. In some implementations an attempt is made to display an equal amount of advertisements e.g. equal in number of advertisements equal in advertisement viewing time on each of the primary output device and the output device of the remote control. In other implementations whether to display advertisements on the primary output device or the output device of the remote control may be based on user remote control behavior analytics data. For example if user remote control behavior analytics data indicates that a user has a high degree of remote control interaction during content viewing e.g. content guide browsing or other browsing the system may display a higher percentage of advertisements on the output of the remote control device than on the primary output device.

As another example if user remote control behavior analytics data indicates particular patterns of remote control activity e.g. a user may frequently use the remote control during the first five minutes of viewing of a content item advertisements may be displayed on the output device of the remote control in a manner corresponding to the detected pattern e.g. if the user frequently uses the remote control during the first five minutes of content item viewing advertisements may be displayed on the output device of the remote control during the first five minutes of content item viewing .

The system determines a mandatory advertisement viewing period . For example the system may determine a mandatory advertisement viewing period based on accessed user advertisement delivery preferences e.g. in reference to . A mandatory advertisement viewing period may be a particular period e.g. three minutes of advertisement viewing shown in response to the elapsing of a particular period of time of content viewing e.g. thirty minutes . The user may have selected to have advertisements delivered every certain number of minutes. As another example the mandatory advertisement viewing period may be determined in response to a user switching to a different channel if the user has configured advertisement delivery preferences to receive advertisements upon a channel change. As yet another example the mandatory advertisement viewing period may be determined in response to a content file change on a channel e.g. the ending of the playing of one content file and the beginning of a new content file on the current channel .

The mandatory advertisement viewing period time may be a fixed amount of time for each advertisement viewing period e.g. three minutes each period or may be a variable amount of time. For example the length of the mandatory advertisement viewing period may be based on the amount of content viewing time since the last mandatory advertisement viewing period. If the user has selected to receive advertisements upon a channel change the length of the mandatory advertisement viewing period may be based on the amount of time elapsed since the previous channel change. If the previous channel change was for example less than fifteen minutes ago the mandatory advertisement viewing period may be for example one minute and if the previous channel change was for example more than thirty minutes ago the mandatory advertisement viewing period may be for example three minutes.

Similarly if the user has configured to receive advertisements after a content file change the length of the mandatory advertisement viewing period may be based on the length of the just completed content file. For example a mandatory advertisement viewing period occurring after completion of a two hour content file may be for example five minutes and a mandatory advertisement viewing period occurring after completion of a five minute content file may be for example thirty seconds.

The system outputs advertisements during the mandatory advertisement viewing period . For example the system may switch to and play an advertisement channel during the mandatory advertisement viewing period. A remote control or a media player downloader device for example may switch to the advertisement channel. As another example the system may control the media system to deliver one or more advertisements selected from an advertisement repository.

The system locks other functions of the media system during the mandatory advertisement viewing period . For example the user may be prevented from switching to a channel during the mandatory advertisement viewing period. In some implementations the user may be allowed to switch to a different advertisement channel during the mandatory advertisement viewing period.

The system enables the user to perform other functions or continue viewing advertisements after completion of the mandatory advertisement viewing period . For example if the user s advertisement delivery preferences are configured such that advertisements are delivered upon a channel change the system may automatically switch to the user requested channel after completion of the mandatory advertisement viewing period. As another example if the user s advertisement delivery preferences are configured such that advertisements are delivered upon a content file change the system may automatically switch to the next content file in the currently viewed channel upon completion of the mandatory advertisement viewing period.

In some implementations the system may prompt the user upon completion of the mandatory advertisement viewing period. For example and as shown in a user interface may be displayed. The user interface includes a message which may be overlaid on top of an advertisement . The message indicates that the mandatory advertisement viewing period has ended. The user may select a control to return to content viewing. In some implementations the user interface remains displayed until the user selects the control . In other implementations the user interface may be closed if there is no user response after a certain period of time e.g. ten minutes after the user interface is displayed. The user interface may be displayed on the display of a remote control device or on the primary display e.g. television screen of a media system.

As another example a user interface may be displayed for a short period of time e.g. five seconds before completion of the mandatory advertisement viewing period. The user interface may be displayed for example on the display of a remote control device or on the primary display e.g. television screen of a media system. The user interface includes a message which may be overlaid on top of an advertisement . The message indicates that the system will be returning to content viewing in a short period of time e.g. five seconds . The user may select a control to continue to watch ads. If the user does not select the control the system may switch to a channel after the period of time indicated in the message elapses. If the user selects the control the system may maintain selection of an advertisement channel such as for a certain period of time e.g. for another mandatory advertisement viewing period or until the user manually switches to another channel. As another example if the user selects the control one or more individual advertisements not included in an advertisement channel may be selected and displayed.

The system selects advertising content to present on a remote control device . For example the system may select a next advertisement on an advertisement channel. The advertisement channel may be a channel associated with multiple users or may be a user specific advertisement channel. As another example the system may select an advertisement based on a category of content being viewed on the media system e.g. if the user is watching sports content a sports related advertisement may be selected .

The system sends advertising content to the remote control device . For example advertisement content may be sent from a media player downloader device to the remote control device. As another example advertisement content may be downloaded to the remote control device over a network. As yet another example the system may identify advertising content previously downloaded to and stored on the remote control device.

The system displays advertising content on the remote control device without impacting display of content by the media device controlled by the remote control device . For example and as shown in an advertisement may be displayed in a display area of a remote control device . The advertisement may be related to a content item represented by a representation displayed in a content guide . The user may have selected the representation to play the content item e.g. to direct a media player downloader device to output the content item on a television screen . The advertisement may be displayed in the display area without impacting display of the content item on the television screen e.g. the display of the advertisement on the remote control device may occur without interrupting the output of the content item by the media player downloader device .

Returning to the system receives user input interacting with the advertising content displayed on the remote control device . For example the user may browse information related to the advertisement compare a product featured in the advertisement to other products purchase the product or contact a sales person regarding the advertisement. As shown in the user may interact with a product advertisement displayed on a remote control using one or more controls and .

The user may select the control to see additional information about the product e.g. product description product features reviews . The user may select the control to compare the product to other related products. The user may select the control to purchase the product. For example the user may use the remote control device to initiate an electronic transaction over a network or if the remote control device implements telephony features e.g. using VOIP Voice Over Internet Protocol operating over a WiFi Wireless Fidelity network the user may initiate a purchase by placing a telephone call. The user may contact a sales center by selecting the control . The user may communicate with the sales center for example on a telephone call through instant or text messages or through electronic mail. As another example subsequent to selection of the control the user may request that a sales associate call the user e.g. call the user s remote control device or another telephone associated with the user . A user s interactions with the controls and may be stored in association with the user.

Returning to the system performs one or more operations based on the user input interacting with the advertising content displayed on the remote control device . For example the system may initiate an electronic transaction for a product purchase may initiate a communication with a sales center may play preview content for an advertised channel may subscribe a user to an advertised channel or may download content associated with a subscribed channel. Although the user interfaces and are described above as being displayed on a remote control device the user interfaces and may also be displayed on a television screen and the transactions may be carried out using the television.

The system includes a processor a memory a storage device and an input output device . Each of the components and are interconnected using a system bus .

The described features can be implemented advantageously in one or more computer programs that are executable on a programmable system including at least one programmable processor coupled to receive data and instructions from and to transmit data and instructions to a data storage system at least one input device and at least one output device. A computer program is a set of instructions that can be used directly or indirectly in a computer to perform a certain activity or bring about a certain result. A computer program can be written in any form of programming language including compiled or interpreted languages and it can be deployed in any form including as a stand alone program or as a module component subroutine or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment.

Suitable processors for the execution of a program of instructions include by way of example both general and special purpose microprocessors and the sole processor or one of multiple processors of any kind of computer. Generally a processor will receive instructions and data from a read only memory or a random access memory or both. The elements of a computer may include a processor for executing instructions and one or more memories for storing instructions and data.
