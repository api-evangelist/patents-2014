Further the syntax psecret is interpreted by the command interpreter module of the enhanced data messaging EDM tool or code to mean that a password namely secret is required in order to open the text message sent by the sender. Moreover the syntax n is interpreted by the command interpreter module of the enhanced data messaging EDM tool or code to mean that all of the n s apply to the message that is the recipient cannot copy nc forward nf blind copy nb store ns or print np the electronic message. Further the sender can select from additional features such as auto deleting a message in seconds s in days d in months m or even years y and or for a specific day and time dt . Further the sender can select a language feature l a voice feature v a vibration mode feature vb redirect feature rd for redirecting a recipient to a website for instance when payment is being requested and unsend feature u for taking back or unsending a message that has not yet been opened by a recipient. Also the sender can choose other features such as rights r provided to a recipient for instance auto recover a deleted message or deleted portion rights pertaining to IN for in network rights or ON for out of network rights attributes a or A such as burst ab must be over 18 to view a018 . In addition the sender can select a certain code cd to be used for delivering the message such as cdm for Morse code. Further a comma syntax is used to separate commands selected. As shown in box of other commands can be selected by a user or sender to configure the electronic message created by the sender. For instance use of 2d instead of 2h in the text shown in would be interpreted by the command interpreter module to mean that the message is to be deleted in 2 days instead of 2 hours . Further for instance a sender can select or type in EDM commands such as dt 5 00pmest091508 which would translate into delete the EDM message on the recipient device on a specific date and time dt namely Sep. 15 2008 at 5 00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time est . In an alternate embodiment a user may configure the EDM commands to use military time for instance 1700 instead of 5 00pmest or the commands could be configured separately for a specific date and a specific time. Additionally a sender can select other syntax commands such as on to turn on certain features provided by the enhanced data messaging EDM tool or code or off to turn off certain features provided by the enhanced data messaging EDM tool or code. Further as shown in rights r may be varied among the sender and the recipient. Similarly attributes a can be varied. For instance a sender can create a message such that when the message is received on a recipient device the message could burst on ab or the message could be displayed in a certain font or displayed using certain animation. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that other commands can be preconfigured within the enhanced data messaging EDM tool or code for providing selective enhanced privacy and control features to one or more portions of an electronic message. As mentioned herein above a drop down menu within the enhanced data messaging EDM tool or code may be provided for a sender to select one or more commands for the electronic message instead of the user having to type in the syntax as shown in . Further the EDM syntax can also be configured such that a user can spell out selected commands versus having to abbreviate used in an EDM message that is created. After the enhanced data messaging EDM tool or code has processed the commands in step then in step the command processing module of the enhanced data messaging EDM tool or code captures data inputted and stores tracks data where applicable. For instance if the sender of the electronic message has selected the auto erase feature in the enhanced data messaging EDM tool or code the command interpreter module of the enhanced data messaging EDM tool or code tracks the time on a recipient s device such that the electronic message is deleted in 2 hours and 30 seconds. The electronic message is sent to the recipient s or receiver s device which is received by the enhanced data messaging EDM tool or code on the receiver s device. The enhanced data messaging EDM tool or code installed or deployed on the recipient device determines in step whether or not a password is required and if so in step the enhanced data messaging EDM tool or code prompts the recipient for a password namely secret . In an embodiment the enhanced data messaging EDM tool or code is configured to allow the recipient five tries to enter the correct password and if a correct password is not entered within the allotted number of tries the electronic message is deleted on the recipient device. It is understood that the enhanced data messaging EDM tool or code can be configured with various forms of encryption based on a user s needs. Similarly the message may not require any passwords to open the message. Accordingly if a correct password is entered within the allotted time or the correct password is entered within the number of tries permitted in step and or if no password is required in step the electronic message Meet me in the hotel lobby at 5 pm is displayed on the recipient s device in step . Similarly in step if the enhanced data messaging EDM tool or code determines that the electronic message does not wish to use the features provided in the enhanced data messaging EDM tool or code then the electronic message Meet me in the hotel lobby at 5 pm is displayed on the recipient s device in step . The enhanced data messaging EDM features can be applied to web pages zip files flashes and or voice mail in a voice mail system.
