This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 940 449 filed Jul. 12 2013 which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 938 720 filed Nov. 12 2007 the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

This disclosure relates to methods and systems for manipulating digital images and more particularly to automatic cropping of images.

People are social creatures some more social than others. We express this socialization through relationships and we carry it out through networking and communication. Networking can be for both social and business purposes. For example a person may meet an important business connection or potential client at a conference seminar or other event. Similarly a person may meet a potential friend or romantic interest during a night out or at a sporting event concert or other social event.

This document discloses methods techniques and systems for storing and managing image data in a mobile device. In some embodiments the methods includes generating an image on the mobile device identifying automatically at least one person in the image creating a cropped image of the person and storing the cropped image to memory upon request of a user of the mobile device.

In some aspects the method further includes prompting the user to store the cropped image of the at least one person as a contact. The user may be prompted to select one of a new contact and a previous contact. The contact information may be updated using the cropped image when the user selects a previously stored contact and new contact information including the cropped image may be stored when the user selects a new contact.

In other aspects the method further includes generating a crop perimeter that corresponds to the at least one person and enabling the user to adjust dimensions of the crop perimeter to provide an adjusted crop perimeter. The cropped image may be based on one of the crop perimeter and the adjusted crop perimeter.

In another aspect the method also includes determining automatically whether multiple persons are present in the image and enabling the user to select a single person when multiple persons are present in the image. The step of creating the cropped image of the at least one person may be based on a selected single person. The method may also include generating crop perimeters corresponding to each of the multiple persons wherein the step of enabling the user to select a single person includes enabling the user to select one of the crop perimeters to provide a selected crop perimeter. The user may adjust dimensions of the selected crop perimeter to provide an adjusted crop perimeter. The cropped image may be based on one of the selected crop perimeter and the adjusted crop perimeter.

In yet other aspects the method further includes querying the user whether to store the image to memory storing the image to memory if the user indicates as such and purging the image if the user indicates as such.

The details of one or more embodiments are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features objects and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings and from the claims.

In various embodiments automatic cropping may enable a person or multiple persons to automatically be identified in an image and to automatically generate a cropped image of an identified person or persons. The cropped image may be stored to a memory and may be associated with a contact. The contact information may in turn be synchronized with a desktop computer. In addition the image may be used in various manners such as in a visual index by which a user can pull up contact information about acquaintances or visually dial those acquaintances on the telephone.

Such techniques may provide one or more advantages. For example a user may readily obtain information for adding a visual element to a user interface. Such an additional visual element may greatly simplify and enhance a user s interaction with a mobile device. In addition a photograph of an acquaintance may help trigger a user s memory about the acquaintance such as for a user who meets many different people and cannot always keep their names straight.

One known technique for facial identification is disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6 301 370 issued on Oct. 9 2001 and entitled Face Recognition From Video Images the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference. U.S. Pat. No. 6 301 370 describes a method for detecting and recognizing an object in an image frame such as a head having particular facial characteristics for example. The object identification and recognition process uses an image processing technique based on model graphs and bunch graphs that efficiently represent image features as jets. The jets are composed of wavelet transforms and are processed at nodes or landmark locations on an image corresponding to readily identifiable features.

In particular a crop perimeter has been automatically generated for each person in a group of two people identified in the image in display by techniques that can identify a face in an image. The crop perimeters may designate automatically generated suggested cut lines that permit a portion of the image to be removed so that a selected portion can be seen more clearly e.g. by later zooming in on the selected portion . Alternatively the crop perimeters may be manually identified such as by a user indicating an intent to crop out a portion of a figure and the user then manipulating the crop perimeter e.g. by steering it in x and y directions with a 4 direction key and changing its size with a scroll wheel on a mobile device to select a portion to be cropped from the image. Although the crop perimeters of are illustrated as rectangles other shapes can be implemented including but not limited to a square a circle an ellipse a triangle a star a pentagon a hexagon an octagon and even a user defined shape. Such cropping thus enables an image e.g. a still image or a video image to be taken using the mobile device and a portion of the acquired image to be used in various manner.

Where multiple people appear in an image the user may be prompted to select a desired person. This selection can occur by the user scrolling through the identified persons such as with a 4 direction key or a touch screen display. In one embodiment a selected person may be identified by a solid lined crop perimeter e.g. crop perimeter while a non selected person may be identified by a dashed or phantom lined crop perimeter e.g. crop perimeter or vice versa. As the user scrolls between persons the crop perimeters switch between the solid lined crop perimeter and the phantom lined crop perimeter . For example in the exemplary image of the selected identified person may be indicated by the solid lined crop perimeter . Also different line colors or line weights may be used to indicate which individuals in a picture are currently selected and which are not.

Upon selecting an identified person the user may adjust the dimensions of the crop perimeter . More specifically the user may adjust the height width circumference and or any other appropriate dimension. In this manner the automatically generated crop perimeter may be tailored by the user to encompass as much or as little of the identified person as desired even if the location of the crop perimeter and its initial size are identified automatically. For example the automatically generated crop perimeter may be adjusted by the user to encompass the facial area of the identified person. As another example the automatically generated crop perimeter may be adjusted to encompass the entire body of the identified person or a desired portion of the body of the identified person. In addition multiple people may be enveloped by the crop perimeter such as when a user intends to associate the cropped image with an entry associated with a pair of twins.

The area of the image which is encompassed by the automatically generated crop perimeter or the adjusted crop perimeter may then be stored as a cropped image. The main image may be discarded or may be separately stored. In addition the main image may be stored and the cropped portion may be referenced as a part of the saved main image so that separate storage of a main image and a cropped image is not required.

The user may be presented with buttons in display to select an action to be performed relative to a selected portion of an image. The buttons may be selected for display based on an application the user is operating e.g. if they acquired the image while they had their contacts program operating by the content of the image e.g. if faces are identified in the image or by other factors such as suggesting that a user make a contact out of an image whenever the image is taken at a certain time e.g. late at night or in a certain place e.g. at a convention or at a bar as determined for example using GPS capabilities and geo data accessible to the mobile device.

In this example the user is presented with buttons to begin a process of adding portions of the image to contacts records for the user. In the example the user may select button to indicate that the person currently selected in an image is a new contact i.e. someone for whom the user does not currently have stored contact information. The user may select button to indicate that the person currently selected in an image is a current contact i.e. someone for whom the user has contact information but does not have a picture the user could also already have a picture but may wish to append the newest picture to a record associated with a particular acquaintance .

When the user identifies the image as relating to a new contact the device may open a blank contact form with the cropped image inserted into the form. Where the user identifies the images as relating to an existing contact the device may prompt the user in familiar ways to identify the contact such as by typing the first few letters of the contact s last name so that the device may then display a list of all contacts that match those letters and the user may then scroll up and down in the list to select the particular appropriate contact.

The pictures may be based on the cropped image described above. In some instances a picture may not be available for one or more contacts. In such a situation the picture associated with a particular contact may include an icon such as is the case with contacts Debra and Sara of . The icon may be received for instance from a device of the other user or may be selected by the person operating the display . For example as a help in remembering who Sara and Debra are the user may have received the impression that Debra was very much like a flower child and thus selected a peace sign to represent her and may have observed that Sara was very happy and thus selected a smiley face to represent her. If no icon is assigned the picture associated with a particular contact may include a generic silhouette as is the case with contact Frank of . Pictures may also be obtained via other routes such as from social networking web sites where members post photos and other information.

In the mode shown in the GUI enables a user to scroll through the phonebook images and select a contact based thereon. Once a contact has been selected the user may have several options including but not limited to calling the contact text messaging e.g. SMS the contact telephony messaging MMS the contact emailing the contact and or editing the contact information. When a particular contact has been selected the images of the other contacts may be removed and information associated with the selected contact displayed instead. For example the image of the selected contact may be moved to one side of the display and buttons representing options for actions that may be performed on the device may be displayed.

It may further be provided that the contact image is provided as a three dimensional 3D image as opposed to a two dimensional 2D or flat image. More specifically the cropped image can be mapped onto a 3D model of a human face for example. The 3D model can be a standard model can be selected from a plurality of 3D models and or can be generated based on the cropped image itself. In this manner the user is provided with a life like 3D icon of a contact.

The process may then crop the identified faces out of the image at box . Where there are multiple faces the cropping may occur at once or may be conducted serially. Various approaches for such cropping may be used such as by forming images that are separate from the main image and displaying the cropped images side by side for further manipulation or by showing them one by one. Also the cropped portions may be left in position on the display while the rest of the image is eliminated around them. In addition the cropped images may be enlarges or shrunk to fit a standard sized space such as a photo frame in a contacts database record. Padding may also be added to the cropped image to make it fit a particular size and shape.

At box the cropped image is associated with contact information in a contacts database such as a standard contacts application that is part of a personal organizer. The association may occur in a number of manners such as manual data entry linking to an existing contact short range wireless transmission from a device owned by the subject of the image long range transmission such as via e mail or access through a website or other mechanism. When multiple images have been identified a user may associate each image with a different contact in turn.

The cropped image is then provided for contact related activities at box . For example the image can be displayed when a user of a device pulls up a particular contact record. Also as shown in the image may be displayed with other images in a visual contacts directory. In addition multiple images of a single contact may be stored and a system may create a photo album for that contact. Cropped images in the album may be linked back to the base images from which they were cropped so that a user may browse a visual directory of the cropped images to find one they like and then may select a particular cropped image to see a full image.

The cropped images may also be transferred to another device such as a mobile device of another user or to an initial user s laptop or desktop computer. Before or after being transferred the image may be provided for example to a social networking web site such as to show various people who the particular user has been in contact with.

At the automatic cropping determines whether there are multiple persons present in the image. If multiple persons are present the user selects a particular person at . At the user is queried as to whether the crop perimeter is to be adjusted. If the crop perimeter is to be adjusted the user adjusts the crop perimeter at . At the user is queried as to whether the selected person is a new contact. If the selected person is a new contact the user is prompted for and inputs contact information at . If the person is not a new contact the user is prompted to select a previously stored contact at . The contact information is stored at .

Referring now to the exterior appearance of an exemplary device that implements the automatic cropping is illustrated. In more detail the hardware environment of the device includes a display for displaying text images and video to a user a keyboard for entering text data and user commands into the device a pointing device for pointing selecting and adjusting objects displayed on the display an antenna a network connection a camera a microphone and a speaker . Although the device shows an external antenna the device can include an internal antenna which is not visible to the user.

The display can display video graphics images and text that make up the user interface for the software applications used by the device and the operating system programs used to operate the device . Among the possible elements that may be displayed on the display are a new mail indicator that alerts a user to the presence of a new message an active call indicator that indicates that a telephone call is being received placed or is occurring a data standard indicator that indicates the data standard currently being used by the device to transmit and receive data a signal strength indicator that indicates a measurement of the strength of a signal received by via the antenna such as by using signal strength bars a battery life indicator that indicates a measurement of the remaining battery life or a clock that outputs the current time.

The display may also show application icons representing various applications available to the user such as a web browser application icon a phone application icon a search application icon a contacts application icon a mapping application icon an email application icon or other application icons. In one example implementation the display is a quarter video graphics array QVGA thin film transistor TFT liquid crystal display LCD capable of 16 bit or better color.

A user uses the keyboard or keypad to enter commands and data to operate and control the operating system and applications that provide for automatic cropping of images. The keyboard includes standard keyboard buttons or keys associated with alphanumeric characters such as keys and that are associated with the alphanumeric characters Q and W when selected alone or are associated with the characters and 1 when pressed in combination with key . A single key may also be associated with special characters or functions including unlabeled functions based upon the state of the operating system or applications invoked by the operating system. For example when an application calls for the input of a numeric character a selection of the key alone may cause a 1 to be input.

In addition to keys traditionally associated with an alphanumeric keypad the keyboard also includes other special function keys such as an establish call key that causes a received call to be answered or a new call to be originated a terminate call key that causes the termination of an active call a drop down menu key that causes a menu to appear within the display a backward navigation key that causes a previously accessed network address to be accessed again a favorites key that causes an active web page to be placed in a bookmarks folder of favorite sites or causes a bookmarks folder to appear a home page key that causes an application invoked on the device to navigate to a predetermined network address or other keys that provide for multiple way navigation application selection and power and volume control.

The pointing device is any appropriate type of pointing device and may be a joystick a trackball a touch pad a camera a voice input device a touch screen device implemented in combination with the display or any other input device.

The antenna which can be an external antenna or an internal antenna is a directional or omni directional antenna used for the transmission and reception of radiofrequency RF signals that implement point to point radio communication wireless local area network LAN communication or location determination. The antenna may facilitate point to point radio communication using the Specialized Mobile Radio SMR cellular or Personal Communication Service PCS frequency bands and may implement the transmission of data using any number or data standards. For example the antenna may allow data to be transmitted between the device and a base station using technologies such as Wireless Broadband WiBro Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave ACCess WiMAX 3GPP Long Term Evolution LTE Ultra Mobile Broadband UMB High Performance Radio Metropolitan Network HIPERMAN iBurst or High Capacity Spatial Division Multiple Access HC SDMA High Speed OFDM Packet Access HSOPA High Speed Packet Access HSPA HSPA Evolution HSPA High Speed Upload Packet Access HSUPA High Speed Downlink Packet Access HSDPA Generic Access Network GAN Time Division Synchronous Code Division Multiple Access TD SCDMA Evolution Data Optimized or Evolution Data Only EVDO Time Division Code Division Multiple Access TD CDMA Freedom Of Mobile Multimedia Access FOMA Universal Mobile Telecommunications System UMTS Wideband Code Division Multiple Access W CDMA Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution EDGE Enhanced GPRS EGPRS Code Division Multiple Access 2000 CDMA2000 Wideband Integrated Dispatch Enhanced Network WiDEN High Speed Circuit Switched Data HSCSD General Packet Radio Service GPRS Personal Handy Phone System PHS Circuit Switched Data CSD Personal Digital Cellular PDC CDMAone Digital Advanced Mobile Phone System D AMPS Integrated Digital Enhanced Network IDEN Global System for Mobile communications GSM DataTAC Mobitex Cellular Digital Packet Data CDPD Hicap Advanced Mobile Phone System AMPS Nordic Mobile Phone NMP Autoradiopuhelin ARP Autotel or Public Automated Land Mobile PALM Mobiltelefonisystem D MTD Offentlig Landmobil Telefoni OLT Advanced Mobile Telephone System AMTS Improved Mobile Telephone Service IMTS Mobile Telephone System MTS Push To Talk PTT or other technologies. Communication via W CDMA HSUPA GSM GPRS and EDGE networks may occur for example using a QUALCOMM MSM7200A chipset with an QUALCOMM RTR6285 transceiver and PM7540 power management circuit.

The wireless or wired computer network connection may be a modem connection a local area network LAN connection including the Ethernet or a broadband wide area network WAN connection such as a digital subscriber line DSL cable high speed internet connection dial up connection T 1 line T 3 line fiber optic connection or satellite connection.

The microphone allows the device to capture sound and may be an omni directional microphone a unidirectional microphone a bi directional microphone a shotgun microphone or other type of apparatus that converts sound to an electrical signal. The microphone may be used to capture sound generated by a user for example when the user is speaking to another user during a telephone call via the device . Conversely the speaker allows the device to convert an electrical signal into sound such as a voice from another user generated by a telephone application program or a ring tone generated from a ring tone application program. Furthermore although the device is illustrated in as a handheld device in further implementations the device may be a laptop a workstation a midrange computer a mainframe an embedded system telephone desktop PC a tablet computer a PDA or other type of computing device.

The CPU can be one of a number of computer processors. In one arrangement the computer CPU is more than one processing unit. The RAM interfaces with the computer bus so as to provide quick RAM storage to the CPU during the execution of software programs such as the operating system application programs and device drivers. More specifically the CPU loads computer executable process steps from the storage medium or other media into a field of the RAM in order to execute software programs.

With regard to graphics rendering a system wide composer manages surfaces and a frame buffer and handles window transitions using the OpenGL ES and two dimensional hardware accelerators for its compositions.

The Dalvik virtual machine may be used with an embedded environment since it uses runtime memory very efficiently implements a CPU optimized bytecode interpreter and supports multiple virtual machine processes per device. The custom file format .DEX is designed for runtime efficiency using a shared constant pool to reduce memory read only structures to improve cross process sharing concise and fixed width instructions to reduce parse time thereby allowing installed applications to be translated into the custom file formal at build time. The associated bytecodes are designed for quick interpretation since register based instead of stack based instructions reduce memory and dispatch overhead since using fixed width instructions simplifies parsing and since the 16 bit code units minimize reads.

The application libraries include a view system a resource manager and content providers . The system services includes a status bar an application launcher a package manager that maintains information for all installed applications a telephony manager that provides an application level JAVA interface to the telephony subsystem a notification manager that allows all applications access to the status bar and on screen notifications a window manager that allows multiple applications with multiple windows to share the display and an activity manager that runs each application in a separate process manages an application life cycle and maintains a cross application history.

The applications include a home application a dialer application a contacts application a browser application and automatic cropping application .

The telephony manager provides event notifications such as phone state network state Subscriber Identity Module SIM status or voicemail status allows access to state information such as network information SIM information or voicemail presence initiates calls and queries and controls the call state. The browser application renders web pages in a full desktop like manager including navigation functions. Furthermore the browser application allows single column small screen rendering and provides for the embedding of HTML views into other applications.

Some processes can be persistent. For example processes associated with core system components such as the surface manager the window manager or the activity manager can be continuously executed while the device is powered. Additionally some application specific process can also be persistent. For example processes associated with the dialer application may also be persistent.

The processes implemented by the operating system kernel may generally be categorized as system services processes dialer processes browser processes and maps processes .
