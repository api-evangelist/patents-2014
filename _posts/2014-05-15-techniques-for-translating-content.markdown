This application is a Continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 881 605 filed Sep. 14 2010 entitled TECHNIQUES FOR TRANSLATING CONTENT which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

While current communications networks provide the ability to easily communicate to people all over the world the content of a communication is only effective when it is provided in a language that is understandable to those involved in the communication. A website providing content in English for instance may not be very useful to a non English speaking person. Generally in such situations content in one language often must be translated to another language to be effective. An entity wishing to expand operations of an electronic commerce website into another country for example may need to translate all or at least a portion of the website into the country s local language. Similarly an entity wishing to provide services to populations who do not communicate well in a primary language of a geographic area must translate much of the content that it distributes whether electronically or otherwise. Complicating this issue is the fact that content is often generated at a high rate especially when content providers give users the opportunity to provide their own content.

Partly due to the need to translate content and the amount of content to be translated automated translation tools have developed. However because of the complexity of language cultural differences in how people express themselves various incongruent grammatical structures and other factors the quality of content translated by these automated translation tools is not optimal. The meaning of a word for instance may change dramatically based on the context in which the word is used. The word flash for example can refer to a burst of radiant energy an illumination device of a camera a brief moment in time a type of computer memory or other things depending on how the word is used. In another language a single word may not have the same multiple meanings. Automated translation tools have had limited success ascertaining the correct meaning of a word when translating. Thus automated translation tools often provide content that is difficult to understand or simply not elegantly composed. While manual translation by a qualified translator may address these issues manual translation is often time consuming and prohibitively expensive for many uses when translation would be beneficial.

Techniques including systems and methods for translating content are described and suggested herein. In an embodiment various instances of content are provided to users. Examples of content instances include documents portions of text audio files video files and generally any collection of information that encodes information expressed in a language. Providing content instances to users may be performed in various ways including in an embodiment sending content instances to users over a communications network for display or other presentation on user devices. Content instances for example may be encoded as part of web pages. In an embodiment at least some users are provided an opportunity to translate content instances. As an example some or all users may be provided content with a selectable interface element that can be selected in order to allow the users to submit translations of the content. The submitted translations may be stored and used to provide translations of the content to other users.

In an embodiment submitted translations are rated by one or more reviewers. Reviewers may be people to whom translated content is provided on a web page. Reviewers may submit electronic votes a type of review to express opinions about the quality of a particular translation. Reviewers may also be provided an opportunity to submit their own translations and or to correct translations that the reviewers believe are mistranslations. Votes received for translations may be used to rate the translations. For example if reviewers of a translation generally agree that the translation is a good translation then the translation may be rated high or generally favorably such as by having nine out of ten stars or some other measure of the translation s quality. If reviewers generally agree that a translation is a poor translation then the translation may be rated low or generally unfavorably such as by being given a lower score or having a higher percentage of unfavorable ratings. A translation s rating may be encoded in a translation score which may be a numerical or other value that indicates the translation s quality as determined by reviewers that have submitted votes for the translation. A translation s rating may be used to determine whether to provide the translation to users and or to determine in which contexts to provide the translations. For instance if a user navigates to a web page about a particular item e.g. product or service offered for consumption e.g. purchase rent lease or download if translated information related to the item is available in a language that the user understands and the translated information is rated high or favorably enough then the translated information may be provided to the user. The information related to the item may be for instance a user generated review of the item submitted in a language other than a language that the user understands.

Reviewers and translators may also be rated in accordance with various embodiments. Reviewers for example may be rated based at least in part on statistics regarding how their reviews agree with those submitted by other reviewers. The quality of a reviewer based at least in part on how the reviewer s reviews agree with other reviewers may be encoded in a reviewer score which may be a numerical or other value that indicates the quality of the reviewer. If others generally agree with a reviewer about the quality of one or more translations then the reviewer may be rated high. If others generally disagree with a reviewer about the quality of one or more translations then the reviewer may be rated low. Translators that have provided translations of content may be rated based at least in part on statistics regarding how their translations have been rated. The quality of a translator based at least in part on ratings of the translator s translations may be encoded in a translator score which may be a numerical or other value that indicates the quality of the translator.

Reviewer scores translator scores and translation scores may be used in calculations of each other. As an example a translation score of a piece of content or portion of content may be based at least in part on the reviews of the translation by others. Reviews of the translation that are associated with high score reviewers may be more heavily weighted than translation scores submitted by lower scoring reviewers. In this manner a translator s translator score may depend at least in part on scores of reviewers that have reviewed the translator s translations. As another example a person s reviewer score may be affected by their agreement with reviews submitted by high score reviewers e.g. increases reviewer score as opposed to reviews submitted by lower scoring reviewers e.g. lowers reviewer score .

Translations provided according to various embodiments described and suggested herein may be provided as a service to entities in need of translations. Entities may for instance request translations by calling a web service operable to provide translations. An entity may submit content and one or more languages into which a translation of the content is desired. The submitted content may be provided by users according to the various embodiments described and suggested herein. Translations may be then provided to the requestor.

In an embodiment as different users select the yes button or the no button the users selections are recorded and used to provide information about how users in general value the review. For instance as shown in the Web page a sentence appears saying that This review was helpful for 191 out of 206 shoppers. Thus in an embodiment users may have selected either the yes button or the no button and of those users may have selected the yes button . In this manner users can quickly ascertain based at least in part on the opinions of other users whether they want to read the review carefully in making a purchasing or other consumption decision.

In the example Web page content is provided in English. The Web page may for instance be provided as part of the electronic commerce website that offers items for consumption to users in an English speaking country such as the United States Canada or the United Kingdom or generally that offers items for consumption to a target set of users that are able to understand English. Items for consumption may include consumer products services electronic content such as audio files video files electronic books and electronic documents access rights to content and generally any items that may be consumed. An entity operating the website or another entity may wish to provide reviews to users or other content in languages other than English. For instance an entity that operates the website of which the Web page is a part may wish to make it easier for users that do not read English or at least not well to browse the Web page . Accordingly the Web page includes a selectable translation button to provide a translation of the review. An example of a Web page to which the user may navigate in order to translate the review is provided in which will be discussed in more detail below.

The translation button may be provided to all users to whom the review is provided for display. Alternatively the translation button may be selectively or otherwise provided to users. For instance the translation button may be provided only to users identified in a data store as being able to communicate in a language other than English or perhaps only to users identified in the data store as having the ability to communicate in a particular language in which a translation of the review is desired. In this last example for instance if the review is not needed in Spanish but is needed in Russian the translation button may be presented to users that are identified in the data store as being able to communicate in Russian. Generally any suitable way of selectively providing the translation button may be used and the manner in which the translation button is provided may vary depending on the context in which translations are needed.

As noted translations submitted by users using the translation button or otherwise provided may be used to provide corresponding content in another language. Accordingly shows an illustrative example of a Web page which includes content of the page discussed above in connection with that has been translated. In this particular instance some of the content of the Web page shown on has been translated into Russian for the Web page shown in . For example the Web page includes a review which in this example is a Russian translation of the review shown in . The review in may have been translated by an automated translation tool and or by one or more users. In Web page a yes button and a no button are provided to the user and which may operate similarly to the yes button and the no button described above in connection with . Text appearing on the yes button and no button in however in this example are translated to Russian for the benefit of a user to whom the Web page is displayed.

In the Web page an indication is provided to the user in order to inform the user that the review was originally submitted in another language. In this particular instance the indication is a phrase in Russian informing the user that the review is a translation of a review originally submitted in English. Also provided in the Web page in this example embodiment is a translation improvement button which is selectable by the user to correct any portion of the translation or otherwise provide his or her own translation. While the translation improvement button is shown with English text the text may be in Russian as may other portions of the web page and or an application used to display the web page . Selection improvement button may allow the user to navigate to the Web page shown in or a page having similar features. The Web page shown in and features shown thereon is described in more detail below. In an embodiment a user is allowed to change a translation although one or more processes for authorizing changes to translations may be used. For instance users may be provided an option to vote on one or more changes of a translation and a determination whether the change may be made based at least in part on votes received. In this manner incorrect translations may be avoided.

Also shown in the example embodiment of is a portion of the original content viewing element that is selectable by a user in order to view the translated content in its original language. In this example the original content viewing element is presented as text with an embedded command that upon selection of the text causes the content to be displayed in the language it was originally submitted in. The command may be a hyperlink to a page containing the original content a JavaScript command that causes the original content to be displayed or generally any mechanism that can be used to cause the original content to be provided to the user. The original content viewing element or other elements may include other options such as the ability to view the content in a language other than the original language such as a language to which the original content was also translated.

In some instances users who may not understand another language well enough to provide a translation may nevertheless recognize that a translation is a poor translation. For instance if a word is spelled wrong grammar is incorrect and or if spelling and grammar are correct but nonstandard phrasing is used the user may recognize that translation is poor. Similarly if the review is simply difficult to understand the user may recognize that the translation is poor. For example a person who understands only Russian may recognize that a translation is poor based solely on the translation itself without any substantial knowledge of the language from which the translation was made. Of course users who do understand other languages may also recognize the translation is poor. Accordingly in an embodiment the Web page includes a yes button and a no button that in this case allows the user to whom the Web page is displayed to indicate whether or not the user thinks that the translation is good. For instance if the user thinks that the translation is good he or she may select the yes button and information regarding the user selection of the yes button may be responsibly communicated to an appropriate server. Similarly the user may select the no button to indicate that he or she thinks that the translation is poor and information corresponding to the user s selection would be transmitted appropriately. As will be described below information regarding whether or not users think the translation is good or bad is collected and used in various ways.

As noted the embodiment shown in is provided for the purpose of illustration and variations are contemplated as being within the scope of the present disclosure. Accordingly shows an illustrative example of such a variation that may be used in accordance with an embodiment. In particular shows a Web page in which content from the Web page shown in has been translated. The Web page may be provided as an alternative to the Web page shown in . In this example the Web page is in many aspects similar to the Web page shown in . For example the Web page includes a review which is a translation of the review discussed above in connection with . Returning to the Web page also includes a yes button and a no button translated into Russian to allow the user to whom the Web page is displayed to indicate whether or not he or she finds that review is helpful. The Web page in this instance also includes a pop up box which may appear superimposed on the Web page subsequent to user input indicative of user intent to view the original text from which the review was translated. The user input may be for example selection of the phrase See original text. For instance the pop up box may appear superimposed on the Web page subsequent to the user selection of the phrase see original text. The pop up in the embodiment includes the original review which in this example is the review discussed above in connection with .

In the pop up in this example includes a yes button and a no button which may operate similarly to the yes button and the no button discussed above in connection with . Thus the user may select either the yes button or the no button in order to indicate whether or not the user thinks the translation is a good translation of the original translation shown on the pop up box . Because in this example the yes button and no button are in the pop up box the user is only provided the ability to indicate whether or not he or she thinks that translation of the original review to the review is good when the user can view the original review in English with the translated review . Therefore it is ensured that the user is able to compare the text of both the original review and the translated review when selecting either the yes button or no button . However variations are possible including providing a yes button and a no button both directly on the web page and in the pop up box . The Web page and the pop up box also in this example include a translation improvement button which may operate similar to the translation improvement button described above in connection with .

For example previously submitted reviews containing the phrase the quality is terrible in English may have already been translated into Russian by the system or other reviewers . If one or more of these Russian translations of the phrase the quality is terrible is consistent and or if the Russian translation is highly rated where ratings of reviews are discussed more below then the prior Russian translation s of the phrase the quality is terrible may have be stored in a data store. Thus when another review is submitted in English with the phrase the quality is terrible a reliable Russian translation of the phrase is readily available. Translations of some portions of content may be provided based at least in part on translation consistency among users whereas other portions of continuity may be provided based at least in part on content having been translated by one or more highly rated translators. Generally many different ways of translating portions of content may be combined together to form content. Thus for instance translations of different sentences of the review may have been provided in different ways and the translations of the different sentences may be combined to form a larger piece of content. Further instead of leaving content in the original language an automated translation tool may be used for content for which a reliable translation is not available.

As noted in various embodiments users are provided an opportunity to submit translations of content. Accordingly shows an illustrative example of a Web page which may be provided to users that have indicated an intent to help with translation. The Web page may have been sent for example to any user that has indicated an intent to assist with translations or may be selectively provided to certain users such as users that have signed up to be translators to users that have demonstrated a level of proficiency for translating and the like. Also variations the page may be provided to users such as users identified as understanding more than one language in order to entice the users to sign up as translators of content. In this illustrative example the Web page may be provided to a user that has selected the translation button in the improvement button shown in the improvement button shown in or the translation improvement button of . Generally the Web page may be provided to a user subsequent to the receipt of any indication of user intent and or interest in assisting with translation or in any suitable manner.

In this example the Web page includes content which in this example is identical to the review shown in . The content is provided along with a translation input box which an embodiment is an interface element that allows a user to type paste or otherwise input a translation of the content . In this example the original content is parsed into sentences allowing a translator to input translations for one or more of the sentences of the content . A submission button allows a user to select the button in order to send a completed translation to an appropriate server which receives the translation and forwards the translation appropriately such as to a computer system operable to store the translation in a data store. If the user only provided translations for portions of the content then the translated portions may be submitted upon selection of the submission button . A system that receives a submitted translation may identify the language into which the content was translated using various techniques. In one embodiment the system detects the language of the translation. Language abilities of users stored in user profiles may be used to determine a language of a translation. Users may also be able to specify the language of the translation. For instance the Web page may include a drop down box or other interface element that allows the user to select the language of the translation.

Also in this example various other translations of the content that were perhaps submitted by other users or that have provided by various translation tools or by a combination of other users and automated translation tools may be provided to the user in the Web page in order to assist the user in preparing the translation or at least to provide the user with examples of how content has been previously translated. Thus for instance if the user is not certain how to translate a particular phrase he or she may see how others have translated the phrase and may use that phrase if he or she thinks that the translation of the phrase is correct. In this example translations by other translators are in Russian even though translations may have been received for other languages. In an embodiment translations by other users or by automated methods may be provided to a user based at least in part on the languages the user understands. Thus in this example the user is provided translations in Russian. However translations by others may be provided in other languages. For example translations received for all or some languages into which the content has been translated may be provided. In an embodiment users are able to self select in a user interface such as a profile creation and or editing page the languages he or she is able to or willing to translate.

In addition as shown in this example the Web page includes a yes button and a no button which may operate similarly to the yes button and no button in order to allow the user to indicate whether he or she thinks that each of the other translations is good. In this manner the votes of people participating in translations may be used to determine the quality of various translations. In other words in this manner the translators are provided an opportunity to be reviewers as well.

It should be noted that the Web pages shown in are provided for the purpose of illustration and that variations are contemplated as being in the spirit of the present disclosure. For instance specifically show respective Web pages displayed utilizing a particular browser application although other ways of displaying content to users would be utilized. For example an application dedicated to translation services may be utilized in order to display content to users. In addition the Web pages shown in show particular arrangements of content interface elements and the like for the purpose of illustration but other arrangements may be used. For instance generally any interface elements that allow users to communicate translations and opinions thereof may be used. In addition while the examples shown in provide an illustrative example of content being in the form of user generated reviews embodiments in the present disclosure may be used in order to provide translations of other content. For instance any user generated content may be translated in accordance with various embodiments described herein. Generally any translatable content may be translated using the embodiment described and variations thereof. Examples of content that may be translated include text in one or more languages audio files or portions thereof having spoken words in one or more languages video files or portions thereof with audio tracks having spoken words in one or more languages and or subtitles in one or more languages video files showing one or more visual languages such as American Sign Language and generally any content that is used for expression in one or more languages.

In the environment as shown in the Web server accesses a content data store system in order to provide content to the user . The content data store may include for example hypertext markup language HTML files extensible markup language XML files and or generally data records that contain content. The content can be any content which is used to express information in a language such as any of the various types of content discussed above.

The Web server also in an embodiment accesses a translation data store which in an embodiment includes translations of some of the content in the content data store and or portions thereof. For instance using the example of user generated reviews that have been translated using various means may be stored in the translation data store . Data in the translation data store may be organized in a manner associating translations with content of which the translations are translated. With the example of for instance the review of may be stored in the translation data store in a manner that associates the translation of with the review of . One or more relational database tables may be used to associate translations with corresponding content. Generally data in the translation data store may be stored in any manner that allows for location of translations of corresponding content. Data in the translation data store may also be stored in a manner that identifies the language of the translation. Thus for instance if the review of has been translated into multiple languages an appropriate translation may be readily available from the translation data store of .

The specific arrangement in is provided for the purpose of this illustration and other environments may be utilized in accordance with various embodiments. For instance the figure of shows a single user device although generally multiple user devices which may be of different types may utilize the Internet or other communications network or combination of network to access the Web server . As another example multiple Web servers may access the content of content data store and the translation data store . In addition for the purpose of illustration only certain components of the environment are shown and other components are not shown. For instance a website may be provided collectively by multiple servers and not just a single Web server . Similarly each of the content data store and the translation data store may comprise multiple data stores or be implemented in a single data store. The content data store and translation data store may also be accessed by the Web server over the Internet or other network. Generally other variations are also contemplated as being in the spirit of the disclosure.

As noted the process or variations thereof may be used to in appropriate situations identify and provide appropriate translations of content to present to a user. In an embodiment the request for content is received in accordance with an embodiment. The request for content may be received in any suitable manner. For instance the request for content may be a hypertext transfer protocol HTTP request sent by a user device in connection with a Web browser executing on the user device. The request may be sent over a communications network to a server operable to receive the HTTP request and respond with content accordingly. Generally however the request for content may be made in other ways. In an embodiment once the content is received a determination is made whether an identity of a user associated with the request for content is ascertained. The determination whether the user s identity is ascertained may be performed in any suitable manner. For instance a cookie associated with the user may have been sent from a computing device of the user and used in order to identify the user from a data store that associates cookies with user accounts. The user also may have provided identification information such as during an authentication process utilizing a username and password input by the user. Generally any method of identifying the user and or determining whether or not the user is identified may be used.

In an embodiment if the identity of the user is not ascertained then content is provided in a default language. For instance in an electronic commerce website dedicated to offering items for consumption in North America website content may be provided in English. Similarly the default language for a website primarily directed to users in Russia or to Russian speakers in another location may be in Russian. Generally the default language may be in any language. If however the user s identity is ascertained then a determination is made whether a primary language of the user is known. For instance a user may have a user profile stored in connection with the website from which content was requested. User profile may identify the primary language of the user. Similarly information about the user may be used to deduce a primary language of the user. For instance if it is known that the user visits many websites that are in a particular language that particular language may be assumed to be a primary language of the user. Similarly if the request for content was received from a Web page of a particular language that particular language may be assumed to be the primary language of the user. Information about the website from which the user navigated may be ascertained for instance from an HTTP referrer value provided with the request for content discussed above in an embodiment. In any event if the primary language of the user is not known in an embodiment then content in the default language is provided in accordance with the embodiment.

If the primary language is known however then a determination is made whether the primary language is the same as the default language. If the primary language is the same as the default language then in an embodiment a determination is made whether the user understands a second language. If the primary language is the default language and a second language is not known for the user then in an embodiment content is provided in the default language. Determination of whether the user communicates or otherwise understands the second language may be performed in a suitable manner such as by referencing a profile of the user or by deducing or otherwise assuming the user understands a second language based on other information known about the user such as a language on the website from which the user has navigated.

If the primary language of the user is a default language and it is determined that the user understands a second language then in an embodiment content is provided in the default language with a translation option. Providing content with a translation option may be done in any suitable manner. In an embodiment providing content with a translation option includes providing to the user content with an interface element that is selectable by the user for allowing the user to navigate to a page in which the user may provide a translation. For instance the translation button of or a similarly functional interface element may be provided with content provided to the user. In an embodiment if the primary language is not a default language however a determination is made nevertheless whether the user understands a second language. If a determination is made that the user understands the second language in an embodiment a determination is made whether there is content available for the user s primary language such as whether a translation of the requested content or a portion thereof is stored in the data store. If content is not available for the user s primary language then in an embodiment content is provided in the default language with a translation option such as in the manner described above. If however there is content available for the user s primary language and it is determined that the user understands a second language then the content is provided in the primary language with the translation option. If the requested content was for a particular Web page for instance a translation into the user s primary language may be provided to the user with a translation option in accordance with the embodiment. If however it is determined that the user does not understand the second language or it is simply not known that the user understands a second language a determination is made whether there is content available for the primary language. If content is not available for the primary language then content is provided in the default language which may be with or without translation function. If however content is available for the user s primary language then in an embodiment content is provided in the primary language without a translation option. Thus if the requested content is a Web page a translation of the Web page may be provided to the user without a translation option in accordance with an embodiment.

Of course the process illustrated in includes specific actions for the purpose of illustration and variations of the methods are possible. For instance a translation option may be provided to the user regardless of any determinations about the user s ability to understand another language whether or not such determinations are made. Also more sophisticated criteria than that described above may be utilized in order to determine the language in which content should be provided to the user and or whether or not to provide a translation to the user with the provided content. As another example the process described above may be modified to take into account users who speak multiple languages. For users that speak more than two languages for example the process may include selecting content in a language selected from multiple languages understood by the users. Rankings of languages may be stored for users that understand multiple languages and for a user content in the highest ranked language that is available may be provided to the user. Rankings may be based at least in part on user input indicating a ranking and or may be derived from user activity in connection with content in various languages. As an example if a user often navigates to pages with content in Ukrainian but less often navigates to pages with content in Russian Ukrainian may be ranked higher for the user than Russian and if available content in Ukrainian may be selected over content in Russian. Other variations are considered within the scope of the present disclosure.

In some instances it may be desirable to limit the abilities of users to provide translations. It may be desirable for example to selectively provide options for translating content to users so that users efforts are more likely to be spent translating content that is in greater need of translation. Accordingly shows a flowchart for an illustrative example of a process that may be used in order to selectively provide translation options as content in order to increase the chance of any content being translated for content in which there is a greater need for translation. The process of and the following description describes the process in terms of user reviews such as those shown in although the process may be applicable to any translatable content. In this particular example of the process is provided in connection with the examples shown in where an entity operates a website to offer items for consumption in another language such as by launching a new website in another country or simply by providing translated content on an originally existing website. Variations of the process may be used in various other contexts.

In an embodiment an item on a first website in a first language is identified . For instance the process may be performed repeatedly for all items offered for consumption on a website. Each item offered for consumption on the website may be identified sequentially. Identification of an item for consumption may also be performed in other ways such as in ways that are based upon user input indicating user s intent on identifying the item. For instance an administrator or even a user may identify through user input the item offered for consumption. As another example identification of an item may occur when a user in some manner indicates that a translation of content related to the item would be helpful such as by making an appropriate selection through a website interface.

In an embodiment once the item is identified a determination is made whether more reviews for the item are needed in the first language. Thus for instance if the first language is Russian a determination may be made whether more reviews are needed in Russian in order to provide users with a robust experience. A robust experience may be provided to users for instance when the number of reviews available for an item in a language of the users exceeds a threshold. In an embodiment if more reviews are needed in the first language then a determination is made whether there are reviews for the identified item on a second website in a second language. Thus continuing the same example if the identified item is offered for consumption on a Russian website a determination may be made whether reviews for that item are available on a second English language website. Of course other languages may be used. If reviews for the identified item for consumption are available then in an embodiment the reviews of the second website in the second language are provided on both websites with a translation option. In this manner reviews are available to viewers on a first website albeit in a second language. Also in this manner if visitors to the first website understand the second language they have the benefit of reading the reviews and in an embodiment the option of translating reviews for other users. Similarly visitors to the second website are provided the option of translating the reviews thereby making translations of the reviews available on the first website.

With the reviews on both websites provided with translation options the translations are received in accordance with an embodiment. Translations may be received for instance in connection with user interface such as Web page similar to the Web page described above in connection with or generally any suitable interface or in any suitable manner. Once translations are received in an embodiment reviews in the second language on the first website that have been translated are converted to their translations in accordance with the embodiment. Thus visitors of the first website may see translations of the original reviews such as in the manner described above in connection with .

Variations of the process described above are contemplated as being within the scope of the present disclosure. For instance for the purpose of illustration shows simply providing the reviews of the second website on both websites with the translation option. However more sophisticated processes may be used. For instance translation options may be only provided to users who satisfy certain criteria such as users identified as understanding the second language or identified as being able to translate into the first language. In addition one or more criteria may be used in order to determine when to replace reviews in the second language on the first website with translations. For example translations of the reviews may be provided on the website in the first language only responsive to conditions indicative of the reviews being reliable being satisfied and or responsive to user request for translations. For instance a user visiting the first website may see a review in the second language in proximity to an option for requesting a translation of the review even though a translation for the review has been received. In other words the translated review is not provided to the user automatically because the review has not been identified as being reliable. However if the user requests the translation the review not identified as reliable may be provided to the user. Of course other variations are contemplated as being within the spirit of the present disclosure.

As discussed translations reviewers and or translators may be rated in accordance with various embodiments. shows a flowchart for an illustrative example of a process that may be used in order to rate translations and reviewers of translations. A translator in an embodiment is a user computing device or application operating on a computing device that translates content. For instance in an embodiment the translator is a person that manually provides translations by composing translations and submitting translations through an interface. In an embodiment the process includes providing translated content. Translated content may be provided in any manner such as in the manner described above in connection with or in other ways such as through the application and even in physical ways such as by providing the physical printout of translated content. Once the translated content is received in an embodiment a translation quality vote is received from a reviewer. A translation quality vote in an embodiment is an indication from a user about the user s opinion of the quality of the translation. For instance referring to a quality vote may be received in accordance with user selection of the yes button or the no button shown in the figure. In an embodiment a quality vote is a value that indicates a user s opinion whether the translation is good or bad although other values such as values in a numerical range may be used. In an embodiment when the quality vote is received information regarding past votes for the translation is access . A record in a data store corresponding to the translation may be accessed. The record may include information of the past votes including statistics such as how many votes the translation received the types of votes received yes no good bad and the like ratings of users that submitted the votes the identities of users that submitted the votes and or generally any information relevant to the voting process described herein.

In an embodiment a determination is made whether the received translation quality vote matches past votes received for the translation. For instance if a translation has received primarily good votes and the received translation quality vote is a bad vote then determination may be made if there is not a match. Similarly if past votes have primarily been good votes and the translation quality vote is also a good vote then a determination may be made that received translation quality votes matches. More sophisticated ways of determining whether there is a match may also be used. For instance in a system where users rank translations on more refined scales for example votes that rank translations on a scale such as a number of stars out of five stars a distance from an average ranking may be used to determine whether there is a match. For example if a scale from one to five is used with five indicating the highest ranking a voter can give a translation the difference between a vote for a translation and the average of votes already received for the translation may be used to determine whether the vote matches the past votes. If the difference is greater than two then it may be considered that there is not a match. Thus if the average ranking for a translation is four and a half and a vote for a ranking of two is received it may be determined that there is a match. However if the vote indicated a ranking of three then it may be determined that there is a match. Other scales and methods of determining whether there is a match may be used.

In an embodiment if there is a match between the received translation quality vote and the past votes then a determination is made whether the received translation quality vote is a good vote or a bad vote. If the received translation quality vote is a good vote then a translator reputation score for a translator that provided the translation quality vote is adjusted upward in accordance with an embodiment. A translator reputation score may be any score that is indicative of a corresponding translator s quality. For instance for a particular translator a translator reputation score may be 

In addition in an embodiment if there is a match between the received translation quality vote and the past votes and the translation quality vote is a good vote a translation score for the translation itself is adjusted upward and a reviewer reputation score for the reviewer that submitted the received translation quality vote is adjusted upward as well. A translation score for a translation may be any score that indicates a quality of the translation. For instance a translation score of a translation t may be 

The reviewer score may be any score that indicates a quality of a reviewer. For example a reviewer score may be determined as 

In this manner of adjusting the translator score and translation score scores representative of a translator s reputation the translation s quality and a reviewer s reputation are all increased because the reviewer and past voters agree that the translation is good. Also because the reviewer agrees with other reviewers the reviewer has his or her reputation score increased because of the agreement with other reviewers.

In an embodiment if there is a match between the received translation quality vote and the past votes but the received translation quality vote was a bad vote then the translator reputation score is adjusted downward the translation score is adjusted downward and the reputation reviewer score is adjusted upward. In this manner a score indicative of the translator s reputation is adjusted downward because both the reviewer and past reviewers agree that the translation is bad. Similarly because the reviewer and past reviewers agree that the translation is bad the translation score is adjusted downward. But because the reviewer agree with past reviewers the reviewer s reputation score is adjusted upward.

If in an embodiment there is not a match between the received translation quality vote and past votes a determination is made whether the received translation quality vote was good or bad. If the received translation quality vote was good then the translator reputation score is adjusted upward the translation score is adjusted upward and the reviewer reputation score is adjusted downward. The translator reputation score is adjusted downward because collectively the votes indicate less agreement on the quality of the translator of this particular translation done by the translator. Similarly the translation score is adjusted upward because the received translation quality vote is good which is in disagreement with the past votes indicates that the translation is not as bad as the past votes had indicated. In other words the translation score is adjusted upward because there is less agreement among users that the translation is bad. The reviewer score in this instance is adjusted downward because the reviewer does not agree with other reviewers.

In an embodiment if there is not a match between the received translation quality vote and the past vote and the received translation quality vote is a bad vote then in an embodiment the translator reputation score is adjusted downward the translation score is adjusted downward and the reviewer reputation score is adjusted downward. In this manner the translator reputation score is adjusted downward because there is less agreement about the translation of the translator being good. Similarly the translation score is adjusted downward because there is less agreement among users that the translation itself is good and the reviewer s reputation score is adjusted downward because the reviewer did not agree with past reviewers.

The process may be performed in connection with a translation every time a vote regarding the translation s quality is received in accordance with an embodiment. Variations of the process are also contemplated as being in the spirit of the present disclosure. For instance multiple votes may be received before translator reputation scores translation scores and reviewer reputation scores are adjusted. In this manner more information is collected from users before conclusions are made about the translation s quality. In addition while process shows the reviewer s reputation score being adjusted all reviewers having reviewed the translations may have their scores adjusted as well. For instance past reviewers of the translation may have their scores adjusted upward when the current reviewer agrees about the translation s quality. Similarly past reviewers may have their scores adjusted downward when the current reviewer disagrees with the translation s quality. In this manner if reviewers initially agree about a translation but then more reviewers come along and disagree then the reviewers that disagree will ultimately cause scores to be adjusted and corrected accordingly.

As noted when one reviewer of the translation votes the scores of multiple reviewers may be adjusted due to the fact that the statistics regarding agreement among reviewers has changed due to the received vote. Accordingly shows a flowchart for an illustrative example of a process that may be used to adjust reviewer scores in accordance with the embodiment. In an embodiment the process includes receiving a translation quality vote from a reviewer. The translation quality vote may be received such as in a manner described above. In addition information regarding past translation quality votes is access in accordance with the embodiment such as in the manner described above. When the information regarding the past translation votes is accessed in an embodiment past reviewers are identified . Past reviewers may be identified so that the scores for the past reviewers may be adjusted according to the nature of the received translation quality vote.

In an embodiment a determination is made based at least in part on the received translation quality vote and the accessed information regarding past votes whether there is a match between the received translation quality vote and the past votes. If there is a match between the received translation quality vote and the past votes then in an embodiment all reviewer s reputation scores are adjusted upward accordingly. However if in an embodiment there is not a match between the received translation quality vote and the past votes then a determination is made whether the current reviewer is more reputable than the past reviewers. Determining whether the current reviewer is more reputable than the past reviewers may be accomplished in any suitable manner. For instance in an embodiment determining whether the current reviewer is more reputable than the past reviewer is performed by comparing a reviewer reputation score of the current reviewer with an average of the reviewer reputation score of the past reviewers. More sophisticated ways of determining whether the current viewer is more reputable than the past reviewer may be used. For instance in an embodiment if the past reviewers include a threshold number of reviewers that have corresponding reputation scores exceeding a reputation score threshold those reviewers having the reputation scores exceeding the reputation score threshold may be compared with the current reviewer. If user reputation scores do not exceed reputation score threshold they are not considered or are considered with less weight. In this manner a group of highly rated translators are used as a basis for comparison in order to prevent situations such as when there s general agreement among past reviewers about the translation but the average reputation score is low for various reasons. For instance there may be many reviewers with low reputation scores but nevertheless agree with just a few reviewers having high reputation scores. In other words low reputation scores by themselves may not be indicative of a reviewer s quality but may simply be due to having performed few activities as a reviewer.

In any event in an embodiment if it is determined that the current reviewer is more reputable than the past reviewer then the past reviewer s scores are adjusted downward in accordance with an embodiment. If however the past reviewer is determined to be more reputable than the current reviewer then the current reviewer s score is adjusted downward. In this manner only the less reputable of the reviewer or past reviewers have their corresponding reviewer reputation score s adjusted downward thereby preventing a number of bad reviewers affecting the score of a good reviewer.

Variations of the process are considered as being within the scope of the present disclosure. In addition variations and combinations of the processes described above are also considered as being within the scope of the present disclosure including variations described above in connection with other processes. For instance scores are adjusted as votes are received however users whether translators or reviewers may have their own reputation scores changed over time. Thus in an embodiment data that is collected recording who has voted for which translation and reputation scores and translation scores may be adjusted accordingly as user reputation scores change over time. As an example if a reviewer becomes a highly rated reviewer then that reviewer s past actions may be provided more weight in recalculating scores for translation and reviewers connected with the reviewer having the high reputation score. Similarly if a user initially has a high reputation score but his or her score diminishes over time the effect that user has had in the past may also diminish over time because of the realization that the reviewer should have less influence than what was initially given. As yet another example one or more quality control mechanisms may be in place to enhance the quality of scores computed in accordance with various embodiments. Votes for instance may be checked for uniqueness to prevent users from voting multiple times on the same translation. Users may be prevented from voting multiple times on the same translation and or multiple votes from a single user for the same translation may be disregarded or at least provided less weight in calculations of scores. Similarly users may be prevented from voting for translations that they themselves submitted. As above users may simply be prevented from voting on their own translations and or votes from a user for his or her own translation may be disregarded or given less weight.

Embodiments of the present disclosure may be used to provide translations to various entities. shows an illustrative example of an environment which may be used in order to provide content in accordance with an embodiment. The components of the environment may implement one or more of the embodiments described herein or variations thereof. In this particular example a user device accesses a website such as in the manner described above. An operator of the website may wish to provide translated content to a user of the user device and therefore may utilize a translation web service . A translation web service in an embodiment is a web service that receives requests for translations and provides translation in response either immediately or when translations become available. The website and the translation may be operated by the same entity or by different entities. For instance the translation web service may provide services to many websites that are in need of translated content. In an embodiment the translation web service provides an application programming interface API that is callable by devices utilized in connection with the website . For instance the website may send a call to the translation web service . The call may include the content to be translated or identification thereof and an identification of a language or multiple languages into which the content should be translated. The call may also include the identification of the language of the content that was provided although the language of the content that was provided may be detected by the translation web service.

When the translation web service receives a request for a translation in an embodiment the translation web service acts as a translation data store which includes past translation. The content to be translated may be parsed and if there are strings or other portions of the content already translated in the translation data store then a translation of those portions may be accessed. All of the content or the remaining portion of the content may be translated in any suitable manner such as in a manner described above. For instance the content may be provided on a website such as the website shown in for a user to translate. In addition to the foregoing the translation web service may be operated in connection with its own website. For instance as shown in the diagram the translation web service communicates with various websites in different languages. Websites may be translations of an electronic commerce website operated in connection with the translation web service. Thus the translation web service may provide translations to its own websites as well as its third party websites such as the website . The translation web service may or may not request a fee for translations provided to third parties. The translation web service may simply translate content for others in order to improve the data in the translation data store .

The illustrative environment includes at least one application server and a data store . It should be understood that there can be several application servers layers or other elements processes or components which may be chained or otherwise configured which can interact to perform tasks such as obtaining data from an appropriate data store. As used herein the term data store refers to any device or combination of devices capable of storing accessing and retrieving data which may include any combination and number of data servers databases data storage devices and data storage media in any standard distributed or clustered environment. The application server can include any appropriate hardware and software for integrating with the data store as needed to execute aspects of one or more applications for the client device handling a majority of the data access and business logic for an application. The application server provides access control services in cooperation with the data store and is able to generate content such as text graphics audio and or video to be transferred to the user which may be served to the user by the Web server in the form of HTML XML or another appropriate structured language in this example. The handling of all requests and responses as well as the delivery of content between the client device and the application server can be handled by the Web server. It should be understood that the Web and application servers are not required and are merely example components as structured code discussed herein can be executed on any appropriate device or host machine as discussed elsewhere herein.

The data store can include several separate data tables databases or other data storage mechanisms and media for storing data relating to a particular aspect. For example the data store illustrated includes mechanisms for storing production data and user information which can be used to serve content for the production side. The data store also is shown to include a mechanism for storing log data which can be used for reporting analysis or other such purposes. It should be understood that there can be many other aspects that may need to be stored in the data store such as for page image information and to access right information which can be stored in any of the above listed mechanisms as appropriate or in additional mechanisms in the data store . The data store is operable through logic associated therewith to receive instructions from the application server and obtain update or otherwise process data in response thereto. In one example a user might submit a search request for a certain type of item. In this case the data store might access the user information to verify the identity of the user and can access the catalog detail information to obtain information about items of that type. The information then can be returned to the user such as in a results listing on a Web page that the user is able to view via a browser on the user device . Information for a particular item of interest can be viewed in a dedicated page or window of the browser.
