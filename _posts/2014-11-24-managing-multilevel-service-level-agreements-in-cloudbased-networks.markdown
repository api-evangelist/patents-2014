This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 789 660 filed May 28 2010 which issued as U.S. Pat. No. 8 909 783 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

The present teachings relate to systems and methods for managing multi level service level agreements SLAs in cloud based networks and more particularly to platforms and techniques for managing and adjusting resources in the cloud based networks in response to the detection of one or more triggering events.

A service level agreement SLA is an agreement between a user and a cloud network provider. The user for example a company is associated with a plurality of end users of a cloud based network provided by the cloud network provider. The SLA specifies that the cloud network provider agrees to commit an amount of resources associated with virtual machines in the cloud network for use by the end users during operation of software products and applications. In return the user can be charged a specified rate in proportion to the amount of committed resources. For example in the SLA the cloud network provider can commit to provide or maintain a specific amount of server uptime persistent storage software application instantiation network performance cloud storage support response time and other elements. Further the SLA can detail any remedies or adjustments for any service failure associated with the use of the resources in the cloud network. Vendors to the user such as independent software vendors ISVs can allow their software products and applications to be executed and operated by the end users via the virtual machines in the cloud network.

The SLA however does not account for peak or low usage times an increase in the number of end users operating the virtual machines and other situations that can cause the usage of the resources in the cloud network to fluctuate. For example there can be times or situations in which the user can be forced to pay for on demand service if the resource usage exceeds what is specified in the agreement. Further there can be times or situations for which a segment of the resources in the cloud network can remain unused by end users.

Therefore it may be desirable to provide systems and methods for managing multi level SLAs in cloud based networks. In particular it may be desirable to agree upon a resource commitment that can vary based on various factors or triggering events.

Embodiments of the present teachings relate to systems and methods for managing multi level SLAs in cloud based networks. In particular embodiments relate to platforms and techniques for managing and adjusting resources in the cloud based networks available for end user operation in response to detecting one or more triggering events. In embodiments the end user operation can be a set of users accessing via a set of instantiated virtual machines application or product resources provided by one or more vendors such as ISVs.

Embodiments described herein can be implemented in or supported by a cloud network architecture that can support multi level SLAs. As used herein a user can refer a person customer subscriber administrator corporation organization or other entity contracting into a multi level SLA with a cloud network provider. In embodiments the user can be a vendor itself such as an ISV. Further as used herein a cloud can comprise a collection of resources that can be invoked to instantiate a virtual machine process or other resource for a limited or defined duration. Further as used herein a multi level SLA can be an agreement between a user and a cloud network provider. For example the user can be a company or other entity with an online storefront that can utilize software applications of a vendor that are supported by resources of the cloud network provider. In particular the multi level SLA can specify various levels of resources such as virtual machines to be provided to the user by the cloud network provider. The end users associated with the user can utilize the provided resources to operate products and applications of the vendor. In embodiments the cloud network provider can charge the user various rates based on the levels of resources allocated for end user operation among other factors. For example the cloud network provider can charge the end user more for a high level of resources. As used herein the resources can be hardware such as for example servers device drivers storage such as hard drives databases random access memory RAM and other memory processors multimedia cards and the like software bundled with installed on or otherwise associated with the hardware and or other resources. In embodiments vendors such as ISVs can supply software resources for use with other resources. Resources can also include communications resources such as ports or channels provided to a virtual machine or other machine or process in the cloud. Resources can likewise include services such as Web based services deployed in the cloud for example security or identity management services and or other resources.

In embodiments a resource managing module can be independent of any user or vendor to the user and independent of any one cloud network. In embodiments the resource managing module can be implemented on a cloud management system and can be configured to monitor resource usage and manage resource availability in one or more cloud networks. For example the resource managing module can be configured to monitor end user operation of the applications and products via one or more instantiated virtual machines. Further the resource managing module can be configured to detect one or more triggering events and adjust resources associated with a set of virtual machines in one or more cloud networks in response to the one or more triggering events and based on specifications of a multi level SLA. In embodiments the one or more triggering events can be a changeover of specified time periods or can be a usage condition threshold such as conditions relating to an increase or decrease in end user use of the resources being reached or exceeded. It should be appreciated that other triggering events are envisioned.

Instead of situations where a user may be forced to pay on an on demand basis for resources that exceed the resources specified in a conventional SLA or situations where the user may be charged an amount for resources that is disproportionate to the amount actually used by the end users the multi level SLA can allow for both predicted or unexpected changes in end user operation within the cloud networks while also being cost efficient. Further the multi level SLA can decrease the chance of cloud providers not being able to support the necessary end user operation. Therefore users can save money throughout the life of the multi level SLA. Further the management of the multi level SLAs can make for a more streamlined process.

As shown for example in the collection of resources supporting a cloud can comprise a set of resource servers configured to deliver computing components needed to instantiate a virtual machine process or other resource. For example one group of resource servers can host and serve an operating system or components thereof to deliver to and instantiate a virtual machine. Another group of resource servers can accept requests to host computing cycles or processor time to supply a defined level of processing power for a virtual machine. A further group of resource servers can host and serve applications to load on an instantiation of a virtual machine such as an email client a browser application a messaging application or other applications or software. Other types of resource servers are possible.

In embodiments the entire set of resource servers or other hardware or software resources used to support the cloud along with its instantiated virtual machines is managed by a cloud management system . The cloud management system can comprise a dedicated or centralized server and or other software hardware and network tools that communicate via network such as the Internet or other public or private network with all sets of resource servers to manage the cloud and its operation. To instantiate a new set of virtual machines a user can transmit an instantiation request to the cloud management system for the particular type of virtual machine that the user desires to invoke for its intended application. A user can for instance make a request to instantiate a set of virtual machines configured for email messaging or other applications from the cloud . The request can be received and processed by the cloud management system which identifies the type of virtual machine process or other resource being requested. The cloud management system can then identify the collection of resources necessary to instantiate that machine or resource. In embodiments the set of instantiated virtual machines or other resources can for example comprise virtual transaction servers used to support Web storefronts or other transaction sites.

In embodiments the user s instantiation request can specify a variety of parameters defining the operation of the set of virtual machines to be invoked. The instantiation request for example can specify a defined period of time for which the instantiated machine or process is needed. The period of time can be for example an hour a day or other increment of time. In embodiments the user s instantiation request can specify the instantiation of a set of virtual machines or processes on a task basis rather than for a predetermined amount of time. For instance a user could request resources until a software update is completed. The user s instantiation request can specify other parameters that define the configuration and operation of the set of virtual machines or other instantiated resources. For example the request can specify an amount of processing power or input output I O throughput the user desires to be available to each instance of the virtual machine or other resource. In embodiments the requesting user can for instance specify a service level agreement SLA acceptable for their purposes. Other parameters and settings can be used. One skilled in the art will realize that the user s request can likewise include combinations of the foregoing exemplary parameters and others.

When the request to instantiate a set of virtual machines or other resources has been received and the necessary resources to build that machine or resource have been identified the cloud management system can communicate with one or more of the set of resource servers to locate resources to supply the required components. The cloud management system can select providers from the diverse set of resource servers to assemble the various components needed to build the requested set of virtual machines or other resources. It may be noted that in some embodiments permanent storage such as hard disk arrays may not be included or located within the set of resource servers available to the cloud management system since the set of instantiated virtual machines or other resources may be intended to operate on a purely transient or temporary basis. In embodiments other hardware software or other resources not strictly located or hosted in the cloud can be leveraged as needed. For example other software services that are provided outside of the cloud and hosted by third parties can be invoked by in cloud virtual machines. For further example other non cloud hardware and or storage services can be utilized as an extension to the cloud either on an on demand or subscribed or decided basis.

With the resource requirements identified the cloud management system can extract and build the set of virtual machines or other resources on a dynamic or on demand basis. For example one set of resource servers may respond to an instantiation request for a given quantity of processor cycles with an offer to deliver that computational power immediately and guaranteed for the next hour. A further set of resource servers can offer to immediately supply communication bandwidth for example on a guaranteed minimum or best efforts basis. In other embodiments the set of virtual machines or other resources can be built on a batch basis or at a particular future time. For example a set of resource servers may respond to a request for instantiation at a programmed time with an offer to deliver the specified quantity of processor cycles within a specific amount of time such as the next 12 hours.

The cloud management system can select groups of servers in the set of resource servers that match or best match the instantiation request for each component needed to build the virtual machine or other resource. The cloud management system can then coordinate the integration of the completed group of servers from the set of resource servers to build and launch the requested set of virtual machines or other resources. The cloud management system can track the combined group of servers selected from the set of resource servers or other distributed resources that are dynamically or temporarily combined to produce and manage the requested virtual machine population or other resources.

In embodiments the cloud management system can generate a resource aggregation table that identifies the various sets of resource servers that will be used to supply the components of the virtual machine or process. The sets of resource servers can be identified by unique identifiers such as for instance Internet protocol IP addresses or other addresses. The cloud management system can register the finalized group of servers in the set of resource servers contributing to an instantiated machine or process.

The cloud management system can then set up and launch the initiation process for the virtual machines processes or other resources to be delivered from the cloud. The cloud management system can for instance transmit an instantiation command or instruction to the registered group of servers in the set of resource servers . The cloud management system can receive a confirmation message back from each participating server in the set of resource servers indicating a status regarding the provisioning of their respective resources. Various sets of resource servers may confirm for example the availability of a dedicated amount of processor cycles amounts of electronic memory communications bandwidth or applications or other software prepared to be served.

As shown for example in the cloud management system can then instantiate one or more than one set of virtual machines or other processes based on the resources supplied by the registered set of resource servers shown in . In embodiments the cloud management system can instantiate a given number for example 10 500 1000 or other numbers of virtual machines to be made available to users on a network such as the Internet or other public or private network. Each virtual machine can be assigned an instantiated machine ID that can be stored in the resource aggregation table or other record or image of the instantiated population. Additionally the cloud management system can store the duration of each virtual machine and the collection of resources utilized by the complete set of instantiated virtual machines .

In embodiments the cloud management system can further store track and manage a user s identity and associated set of rights or entitlements to software hardware and other resources. Each user that populates a set of virtual machines in the cloud can have specific rights and resources assigned and made available to them. The cloud management system can track and configure specific actions that a user can perform such as provision a set of virtual machines with software applications or other resources configure a set of virtual machines to desired specifications submit jobs to the set of virtual machines or other host manage other users of the set of instantiated virtual machines or other resources and other privileges or actions. The cloud management system can further generate records of the usage of instantiated virtual machines to permit tracking billing and auditing of the services consumed by the user. In embodiments the cloud management system can for example meter the usage and or duration of the set of instantiated virtual machines to generate subscription billing records for a user that has launched those machines. Other billing or value arrangements are possible.

The cloud management system can configure each virtual machine to be made available to users of the network via a browser interface or other interface or mechanism. Each instantiated virtual machine can communicate with the cloud management system and the underlying registered set of resource servers via a standard Web application programming interface API or via other calls or interfaces. The set of instantiated virtual machines can likewise communicate with each other as well as other sites servers locations and resources available via the Internet or other public or private networks whether within a given cloud or between clouds.

It may be noted that while a browser interface or other front end can be used to view and operate the set of instantiated virtual machines from a client or terminal the processing memory communications storage and other hardware as well as software resources required to be combined to build the virtual machines or other resources are all hosted remotely in the cloud . In embodiments the set of virtual machines or other resources may not depend on or require the user s own on premise hardware or other resources. In embodiments a user can therefore request and instantiate a set of virtual machines or other resources on a purely off premise basis for instance to build and launch a virtual storefront or other application.

Because the cloud management system in one regard specifies builds operates and manages the set of instantiated virtual machines on a logical level the user can request and receive different sets of virtual machines and other resources on a real time or near real time basis without a need to specify or install any particular hardware. The user s set of instantiated machines processes or other resources can be scaled up or down immediately or within a short period of time on an on demand basis if desired. In embodiments the various sets of resource servers that are accessed by the cloud management system to support a set of instantiated virtual machines or processes can change or be substituted over time. The type and operating characteristics of the set of instantiated virtual machines can nevertheless remain constant or almost constant since instances are assembled from abstracted resources that can be selected and maintained from diverse sources based on uniform specifications.

In terms of network management of the set of virtual machines that have been successfully configured and instantiated the cloud management system can perform various network management tasks including security maintenance and metering for billing or subscription purposes. The cloud management system of a given cloud can for example install or terminate applications or appliances on individual machines. The cloud management system can monitor operating virtual machines to detect any virus or other rogue process on individual machines and for instance terminate the infected application or virtual machine. The cloud management system can likewise manage an entire set of instantiated virtual machines or other resources on a collective basis for instance to push or deliver a software upgrade to all active virtual machines. Other management processes are possible.

In embodiments more than one set of virtual machines can be instantiated in a given cloud at the same overlapping or successive times. The cloud management system can in such implementations build launch and manage multiple sets of virtual machines based on the same or different underlying set of resource servers with populations of different instantiated virtual machines such as may be requested by different users. The cloud management system can institute and enforce security protocols in a cloud hosting multiple sets of virtual machines. Each of the individual sets of virtual machines can be hosted in a respective partition or sub cloud of the resources of the main cloud . The cloud management system of a cloud can for example deploy services specific to isolated or defined sub clouds or isolate individual workloads processes within the cloud to a specific sub cloud. The subdivision of the cloud into distinct transient sub clouds or other sub components which have assured security and isolation features can assist in establishing a multiple user or multi tenant cloud arrangement. In a multiple user scenario each of the multiple users can use the cloud platform as a common utility while retaining the assurance that their information is secure from other users of the overall cloud system. In further embodiments sub clouds can nevertheless be configured to share resources if desired.

In embodiments and as also shown in the set of instantiated virtual machines generated in a first cloud can also interact with a set of instantiated virtual machines or processes generated in a second third or further cloud . Further the cloud management system of the first cloud can interface with the cloud management system of the second cloud to coordinate those domains and operate the clouds and or virtual machines or processes on a combined basis. The cloud management system of a given cloud can track and manage individual virtual machines or other resources instantiated in that cloud as well as the set of instantiated virtual machines or other resources in other clouds.

In the foregoing and other embodiments the user making an instantiation request or otherwise accessing or utilizing the cloud network can be a person customer subscriber administrator corporation organization or other entity. In embodiments the user can be or include another virtual machine application or process. In further embodiments multiple users or entities can share the use of a set of virtual machines or other resources.

In embodiments the user can be an owner administrator company or other entity who can provide provision or otherwise deliver software applications or other software hardware or other products or services such as products and services of one or more ISVs to end users accessing the cloud . In embodiments the end users can access the set of instantiated virtual machines located in the cloud . It should be appreciated that the user can have one or more multi level SLAs with one or more cloud providers to provide software product s and or maintain end users in one or multiple clouds and or across multiple products and or product lines. The resource managing module can adjust resources associated with the set of instantiated virtual machines in accordance with specifications of any applicable multi level SLAs. In embodiments the multi level SLAs can specify resource availability related to the use of one or more of the set of instantiated virtual machines by end users to operate software applications products services and the like provided by for example the one or more ISVs . The resource managing module can be configured to communicate with the user the one or more ISVs the set of instantiated virtual machines and or other machines hosts nodes or resources. In embodiments the resource managing module can track and manage the set of instantiated virtual machines or other resources instantiated in the cloud as well as the set of instantiated virtual machines or other resources instantiated in other clouds

In embodiments the multi level SLA can be a multi tiered SasS subscription plan for users such as an entity utilizing products of an ISV according to embodiments of the present teachings. For example the user can enter into a multi level SLA with a cloud network provider whereby the cloud network provider can commit in a first commitment level to provide 1 000 virtual machines for use by end users to operate software products associated with an ISV during peak weekday business hours e.g. Monday Friday 9 00 AM 5 00 PM provide in a second commitment level 500 virtual machines for use by end users during off peak weekday hours e.g. Monday Friday 5 00 PM 9 00 AM and provide in a third commitment level 200 virtual machines for use by end users during weekend hours e.g. all day Saturday and Sunday wherein the cloud network provider can bill the user monthly for a period of 12 months. This exemplary multi level SLA can have one or more triggering events such as the changeover points from peak weekday business hours to off peak weekday hours to weekend hours. Accordingly in this example the amount of available virtual machines can be reduced in response to detecting when the time is 5 00 PM on a weekday. It should be appreciated that other multi level SLAs with varying terms and specifications are envisioned.

The resource managing module can be configured to examine a multi level SLA between a cloud provider and the user to determine a plurality of commitment levels for the set of instantiated virtual machines based on detected triggering events. For example the resource managing module can detect the changeover to an off peak time period such as when the time changes to 5 00 PM and correspondingly reduce the resources associated with the set of instantiated virtual machines from a first commitment level to a second commitment level as specified by the multi level SLA. Similarly the resource managing module can detect the changeover to a peak time period such as when the time changes to 9 00 AM and correspondingly increase the resources associated with the set of instantiated virtual machines from the second commitment level to a third commitment level as specified by the multi level SLA. In embodiments the triggering events can be the reaching or exceeding of usage condition thresholds related to the end user operation of the set of instantiated virtual machines . For example the resource managing module can increase resources associated with the set of instantiated virtual machines from a first commitment level to a second commitment level if end user operation reaches or exceeds a threshold level. Similarly the resource managing module can decrease resources associated the set of instantiated virtual machines from the second commitment level to a third commitment level if end user operation reaches or falls below a low threshold level.

In embodiments the resource managing module can terminate or instantiate one or more virtual machines in the same cloud or in multiple clouds . Further the resource managing module can terminate a set of instantiated virtual machines in one cloud and instantiate another set of virtual machines in another cloud to effectively roll over resources available to end users from one cloud based network to another. In embodiments the resource managing module can be configured to provide an output report detailing any resource adjustment to the user or other entity. For example the output report can be provided to the user at fixed or varied intervals or at any point during the terms of the multi level SLA.

Processor can also communicate with computer readable storage medium and the resource managing module to execute control logic allow for managing multi level SLAs as described herein and control the operation of virtual machines and other resources in cloud . Other configurations of cloud management system associated network connections and other hardware and software resources are possible.

In an adjustment to resources associated with the virtual machines can be determined in response to the detected triggering event and in accordance with the commitment levels of the multi level SLA. In embodiments the cloud management system can examine the commitment levels of the multi level SLA and determine an increase or decrease in associated virtual machine resources based on the detected triggering event. In the resources associated with the virtual machines can be adjusted in accordance with the commitment levels of the multi level SLA. In embodiments the cloud management system can terminate or instantiate one or more virtual machines in the same cloud network or in multiple cloud networks. Further the cloud management system can terminate one or more virtual machines in one cloud network and instantiate one or more virtual machines in another cloud network to effectively roll over resources available to end users from one cloud network to another. In an output report of the resource adjustment can be provided to the user. In embodiments the output report can be provided upon each resource adjustment at varied or fixed intervals or at other points during the term of the multi level SLA. In the terms of the multi level SLA can be checked for fulfillment. If the multi level SLA has not been fulfilled processing can return to for detection of a triggering event. If the multi level SLA has been fulfilled processing can proceed to end at .

The foregoing description is illustrative and variations in configuration and implementation may occur to persons skilled in the art. For example while embodiments have been described which operate using one resource managing module and associated cloud management system in embodiments one or more of resource managing module and associated cloud management system and or other servers data stores and or other logic or resources can be used. For further example while embodiments have been described in which cloud resources and subscription plans are modified or adjusted in embodiments the subscription plans associated fees and resources associated with the plans can be modified or adjusted according to any combination and at any time or interval. Other resources described as singular or integrated can in embodiments be plural or distributed and resources described as multiple or distributed can in embodiments be combined. The scope of the present teachings is accordingly intended to be limited only by the following claims.
