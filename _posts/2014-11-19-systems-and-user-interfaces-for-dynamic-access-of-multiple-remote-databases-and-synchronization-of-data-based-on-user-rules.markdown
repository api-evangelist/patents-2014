This application claims priority benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119 e of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 906 786 filed on Nov. 20 2013 the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

Embodiments of present disclosure relate to systems and techniques for dynamic interactions with user information.

Generally user computing devices and computing systems may facilitate the management of a user s personal data. For example the user may have information stored in a plurality of remote databases such as those used by various social networking sites elastic on demand storage systems for example cloud computing systems or remote file sharing services as well as the user s own personal computer or mobile device to store personal data and or personal information. The user s use of the Internet may result in a wide distribution of the user s personal information to many different computing systems devices and other users. For example social networking sites online retailers and or blogs may contain personal information about the user.

Generally when a user wishes to update profile information e.g. address phone number etc. for example at a social networking site credit monitoring service blog and or other online service the user will manually update the information at each of the sites by logging into multiple sites and providing information for storage in the relevant databases of the multiple sites. Thus if a user changes phone numbers he may need to visit multiple websites and navigate to the profile change sections in each in order to make the same change to the phone number on the multiple sites. These tasks become redundant and accordingly the user may not make changes to all accounts. Additionally such manual changes increase the risk of errors e.g. typos in the updated information provides to different entities.

The systems methods and devices described herein each have several aspects no single one of which is solely responsible for its desirable attributes. Without limiting the scope of this disclosure several non limiting features will now be described briefly.

Disclosed herein are systems and methods that automatically identify updated information associated with a user in one or more remote databases e.g. databases associated with online web services and determine updates to me made to other remote databases based on user rules for providing such automatic updates. Thus the systems and methods disclosed herein may allow a user to update profile information of the user at not just a single website or entity but with multiple entities without requiring the user to communicate with each of the entities individually. In some embodiments the methods disclosed herein are performed by a profile update system that has existing relationships and or communication channels with multiple entities such as financial institutions government institutions retail companies and websites for example. Accordingly the profile update system may advantageously push any updates to the user s profile information to multiple entities with which the user has a relationship e.g. an account in order to implement such profile updates across the multiple entities. Such updates may be implemented for example via an application programming interface API that the plurality of remote database also referred to generally as partners or entities herein have access to. For example a change to a user s information in a first remote database may be determined via access to the first remote database through an API and changes in the user s information that are identified may be pushed to one or more other remote databases via the API.

The term database as used herein may refer to an database e.g. RDBMS or SQL database or may refer to any other data structure such as for example a comma separated values CSV eXtendible markup language XML TeXT TXT file flat file spreadsheet file and or any other widely used or proprietary format. In some embodiments one or more of the databases or data sources may be implemented using a relational database such as Sybase Oracle CodeBase and Microsoft SQL Server as well as other types of databases such as for example a flat file database an entity relationship database and object oriented database and or a record based database.

In some embodiments a profile update system includes an update status module that communicates with remote databases to which updates were provided in order to track if when the updates are implemented within those remote databases. The status of the updates may they then be provided to the user such that the user can intervene in making updates if necessary e.g. if a remote database associated with a particular user account is not recognizing an address update that the user wants to ensure is correct . Additionally an update status user interface may include an option for re requesting updates to the user s information such as at the request of the user interfacing with the update status user interface and or may automatically re request the profile information be updated at one or more remote databases at which the updates are not implemented within a predetermined time period.

In one embodiment a computing system is configured to access a plurality of remote databases in order to identify data inconsistencies between the remote databases and provide user interfaces to a user in order to initiate communication via one or more APIs to certain remote databases indicating updates that reconcile said data inconsistencies. The computing system may include one or more storage devices configured to store electronic software instructions and one or more computer processors in communication with the storage device. The one or more computer processors may be configured to execute the stored software instructions to cause the computing system to automatically access first user information stored in one or more storage devices the first user information including indications of each of a plurality of remote databases having data regarding a first user the first user information including a plurality of first data fields and a corresponding plurality of first data values associated with respective first data fields wherein at least some of the plurality of remote databases include matching first data values in particular first data fields access a first remote database of the plurality of remote databases via one or more network connections and an application programming interface in communication with the first remote database determine first remote data associated with the first user stored in the first remote database compare the first remote data to the first user information by comparing each of a plurality of first data values in the first user information to corresponding remote data values of associated data fields in the first remote data identify a particular first data value that does not match a corresponding remote data value for an associated data field generate an interactive user interface for transmission to a remote user computing device the interactive user interface including authentication prompts usable to authenticate an identity of the first user receive input from the remote user computing device and compare the input from the remote computing device to expected authentication information from the first user. In one embodiment in response to determining that the expected authentication information from the first user matches the input from the remote computing device authenticating the first user and generate a second user interface for transmission to the remote user computing device the second user interface including the particular first data value the corresponding remote data value and an interactive user interface control usable by the first user to instruct the computing system to update the particular first data value in the first user information with the corresponding remote data value from the first remote data. In one embodiment in response to receiving an indication via the second user interface that the first user selected the user interface control replacing the particular first data value in the first user information with the corresponding remote data value from the first remote data identifying a subset of the plurality of remote databases that each do not include the corresponding remote data value generate a third user interface for transmission to the remote user computing device the third user interface including an indication of at least some of the subset of remote databases and interactive user interface controls usable to select one or more of the subset of remote databases. In one embodiment in response to receiving an indication of a selected one or more of the first subset of remote databases from the remote user computing device determine access protocols for each of the selected one or more remote databases and using the determined access protocols for respective of the selected one or more remote databases transmitting the corresponding remote data value to each of the selected one or more remote databases in order to initiate updates at each of the selected one or more remote databases.

Although certain preferred embodiments and examples are disclosed below inventive subject matter extends beyond the specifically disclosed embodiments to other alternative embodiments and or uses and to modifications and equivalents thereof. Thus the scope of the claims appended hereto is not limited by any of the particular embodiments described below. For example in any method or process disclosed herein the acts or operations of the method or process may be performed in any suitable sequence and are not necessarily limited to any particular disclosed sequence. Various operations may be described as multiple discrete operations in turn in a manner that may be helpful in understanding certain embodiments however the order of description should not be construed to imply that these operations are order dependent. Additionally the structures systems and or devices described herein may be embodied as integrated components or as separate components. For purposes of comparing various embodiments certain aspects and advantages of these embodiments are described. Not necessarily all such aspects or advantages are achieved by any particular embodiment. Thus for example various embodiments may be carried out in a manner that achieves or optimizes one advantage or group of advantages as taught herein without necessarily achieving other aspects or advantages as may also be taught or suggested herein.

Once the updates have been pushed to the various remote databases the profile update system may track status of the updates at each of the or at least some of the remote databases and provide updates to the user. is one example user interface that may be provided to the user in order to indicate changes to the user s profile that have been implemented or not implemented in various remote databases. In this example the update status for John Doe s email change illustrated in is provided for each of three remote databases websites in this example to which the user requested the email address change be pushed. As noted above the user may push updates to profile information to any number of entities not limited to only websites which may be automatically determined by the profile update system and or provided by the user.

In the example of the update status indicates that site and site e.g. two different remote databases associated with partner websites changed the email address for John Doe in response to the update request from the profile update system on November 15 and November 16 respectively. The status update also indicates that site had not yet changed the email address for John Doe. In this embodiment John Doe has the option of selecting a link to initiate resending of the updated email address request to site by selecting the re send link. In one embodiment resending the updated email address causes the profile update system to transmit the profile update in the same manner as was previously provided to site . In other embodiments resending the updated profile information is performed in a different manner. The user also has the option of selecting the take me to site link in order to be redirected to site and possibly to the update profile section of site so that the user can manually update the email address with site .

In the embodiment of at a first action indicated by the circled numeral the user is authenticated in order to confirm that that user is who they really say they are and to reduce the risk of fraud in the profile update system pushing profile changes to accounts that are not authorized by the user e.g. changes that are provided by a fraudster impersonating the user . In this embodiment an authentication module of the profile update system initiates the authentication process which may be a process that is carried out entirely by the profile update system or which may include actions by a third party such as an authentication provider. Depending on the embodiment the authentication may take various forms. For example in one embodiment authentication may be based on knowledge based questions that are asked of the user wherein the questions are formed in such a way that only the particular user should know the answers. In one embodiment authentication questions are asked based on information regarding the user located in credit data of the user. Such out of wallet questions are configured to solicit responses that include information highly likely to only be known by the user and or unlikely to be known by a fraudster such as a monthly payment amount on an outstanding debt obligation which may appear on the user s credit report the name or address of a particular loan servicer the date that the last payment was posted to a credit account and so on.

Once the user is authenticated e.g. the user of the remote computing device provides answers to authentication questions or other authentication information indicating that the user really is the individual identified in the profile information the user is given an opportunity to provide profile updates action of . In this embodiment an update module interfaces with the user in order to receive profile updates from the user. As discussed below with reference to the update module may also detect changes to the user s profile information at various remote databases and or determine which other remote databases the detected profile update should be provided to.

In the example of the user desires to make a change to profile data that is relevant to profile data stored with multiple data sources entities. As discussed above in some embodiments the user may have a master profile stored with a particular service such as a database maintained by the profile update system and may make changes to that master profile in order to trigger pushing of changes to multiple remote databases. In other embodiments the user may log into a website or call a number associated with the profile update system in order to initiate the process of pushing changes to the user s profile to multiple remote databases. In this embodiment the user may not need to provide the full profile information but rather may provide only the profile information that is to be changed as well as any other information needed for authentication or other procedures performed by the profile update entity such as an updated email address or telephone number.

In some circumstances the user may be required to provide proof of the profile information change such as by submitting a marriage certificate death certificate change of address verification etc. in order for the profile update system to push the requested profile update to certain entities. For example certain governmental institutions may require such proof of change before making profile updates regarding the user. Thus depending on embodiment the profile update system may forward the proof of change information to one or more entities and or the entities may rely on the indication from the profile update system that the proof of change information was received and accurately indicated the requested profile update. In some embodiments a third party that specializes in authenticating such information may be consulted by the profile update system in order to determine whether the updates to the user s profile are legitimate.

At action of the profile update system pushes the indicated update to a plurality of remote databases of partners such as financial institutions governmental institutions retail companies and non commerce companies such as websites and social media applications. In other embodiments any other entity may be included as a recipient of profile updates of the user.

The profile update system may then monitor the status of updates at the various entities such as by accessing the website of those entities periodically in order to determine whether the requested profile updates have been made. As discussed above with reference to the for example the user may be provided with various user interfaces indicating the status of profile updates and may be offered options for following up with partners that have not yet made the requested profile updates.

Depending on the embodiment the user profile information may include various information about the user including for example the user s name gender age ethnicity handicaps address contact information photo employer education interests and any other data associated with the user.

In other embodiments other communication protocols and methods may be used in order for the profile update system to obtain user information from the partner . For example the profile update system may query the partner database periodically in order to access information from users that are registered with the profile update system e.g. using login credentials provided by respective users. The profile update system may then compare profile data for respective users from the partner with profile data for the users stored at the profile update system and or profile information of the user at other partners such as partners .

At action of the profile update system such as the update module determines if any updates to the user profile information should be pushed to any remote third party databases. In one embodiment the user establishes rules that are usable by the profile update system in order to automatically determine which third party databases should be updated with new profile information discovered at one or more partners. For example rules may indicate that certain types or categories of information that are identified as new or changed information at certain specific or groups of remote databases e.g. trusted databases are automatically pushed to all other remote databases that require the update e.g. all that have different information for the updated data field of the user . In other embodiments the user is provided information on updates to the user s profile that are identified at partner and provided an opportunity to indicate which of a plurality of other partners e.g. partners to which the detected update should be provided. In one embodiment the user is provided with a list of other partners that have different information in the updated data fields of the user s profile. The user may then select which of the remote databases to update with the identified profile information. Thus in one embodiment the user can update profile information across multiple remote databases by updating profile information at a particular site so that the profile update system automatically detects that update and initiates provision of the update to other remote databases. Accordingly the user may not even need to access a website provided by the profile update system in order to initiate changes to multiple remote databases having profile information of the user. The profile update system may then push the detected profile update to partners via the API or other communication technology . As noted above in some embodiments rather than use of an API to access the user profile the user provides authentication credentials e.g. login and password that are usable by the profile update system to login to the users account and automatically update the user s profile information.

In one example embodiment the user provides a profile update to a first partner and the profile update system automatically detects the update. The detected profile update may then be pushed to the user such as via an application executing on the user s mobile device or a text message sent to the user s mobile device with a request to authorize pushing of the detected update to all or some of the other remote databases that store profile information of these user whether the remote databases are indicated by the user or are automatically detected by the profile update system such as based on scanning of user profile databases of multiple partners in order to identify remote databases having profile information for respective users . Thus the user may be able to update profile information at any of multiple remote databases e.g. of various websites or online services in order to initiate and easily implement updates of those same profile updates to multiple remote databases.

At action of a user interface including graphical user interfaces information provided to an application installed on a user device text messages etc. may be provided to the user indicating status of profile updates at one or more remote databases to which the detected profile update has been pushed.
