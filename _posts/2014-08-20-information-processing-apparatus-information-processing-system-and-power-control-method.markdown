This application claims the benefit of Japanese Priority Patent Application JP 2013 175222 filed Aug. 27 2013 the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The present disclosure relates to an information processing apparatus an information processing system and a power control method.

A central processing unit CPU incorporated into a personal computer PC operates in low power by lowering an operating frequency and an operating voltage at a time of instruction execution. On the other hand at a time of no instruction execution the CPU operates so as to reduce power consumption by transiting to a sleep state operating at a very low operating voltage. For example JP 2004 246400A discloses a mechanism for transiting to a sleep state when a CPU is in a no instruction execution state.

Such as a cell phone a smartphone and a tablet terminal equipment that can constantly connect to a network and that can instantly turn on and off a power supply has been widely spread. In addition a movement to cause PCs to achieve operation AOAC always on always connect achieved by such equipment is spreading. As a technology for achieving an AOAC environment there is a technology referred to as Connected Standby or Intel Smart Connect Technology iSCT for example.

Particularly iSCT have a feature that can easily achieve a relatively inexpensive AOAC environment by using an existing device. iSCT is a technology that equipment periodically returns from a sleep state S3 to a state S0 iSCT running with low power consumption runs only for a short time receives an e mail updates data and then again returns to the sleep state. By such operation a user can consistently use an up to date PC.

Even if it is a short time an e mail is received and data is updated in the S0 iSCT state. Accordingly for a system of a PC such as an operating system OS or BIOS there is no difference from a running state S0 . In a case of a PC whose screen is not exposed such as a laptop because the user closes a lid when the PC is not used it is possible to physically prevent the screen which is provided with a touchscreen from being touched even in the S0 iSCT state.

However recently a tablet type PC with an OS and systems that are the same as existing PCs have been distributed. Since the tablet type PC is consistently in a state where the screen is exposed such tablet type PC shifts into a running state when the screen is touched in the S0 iSCT state. Accordingly when the AOAC environment is tried to be achieved in such tablet type PC an object touches the screen in a bag for example the tablet type PC unexpectedly shifts into a running state and heating and unnecessary consumption of battery may occur in association with the running.

Accordingly the present disclosure proposes a novel and improved information processing apparatus information processing system and power control method that can prevent a shift into a running state that a user does not intend when the AOAC environment is achieved.

According to an embodiment of the present disclosure there is provided an information processing apparatus including a mode control unit configured to perform control at least so as to switch a first mode that causes the information processing apparatus to be operated at a first voltage level and a second mode that causes the information processing apparatus to be operated at a second voltage level higher than the first voltage level and an operation control unit configured to disable certain input operation performed by a user if a state satisfies a certain condition after the mode control unit switches a mode to the second mode.

According to an embodiment of the present disclosure there is provided an information processing system including a display unit configured to display information a mode control unit configured to perform control at least so as to switch a first mode that causes an information processing apparatus to be operated at a first voltage level and a second mode that is a state where the display unit does not display information and that causes the information processing apparatus to be operated at a second voltage level higher than the first voltage level and an operation control unit configured to if a state satisfies a certain condition after the mode control unit switches a mode to the second mode disable certain input operation performed by a user the certain input operation switching the state to a state where the display unit displays information.

According to an embodiment of the present disclosure there is provided a power control method including performing control at least so as to switch a first mode that causes an information processing apparatus to be operated at a first voltage level and a second mode that causes the information processing apparatus to be operated at a second voltage level higher than the first voltage level and disabling certain input operation performed by a user if a state satisfies a certain condition after a mode is switched to the second mode.

As described above the present disclosure proposes a novel and improved information processing apparatus information processing system and power control method that can prevent a shift into a running state that a user does not intend when the AOAC environment is achieved. Note that the present disclosure is not limited to the effect stated above and in addition to or in place of the effect stated above may achieve any of the effects indicated in this specification or effects that can be understood from the specification.

Hereinafter preferred embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the appended drawings. Note that in this specification and the appended drawings structural elements that have substantially the same function and structure are denoted with the same reference numerals and repeated explanation of these structural elements is omitted.

First an appearance example of a PC according to a first embodiment of the present disclosure is shown. is an explanatory diagram showing an appearance example of a PC according to the first embodiment of the present disclosure. With reference to the appearance example of the PC according to the first embodiment of the present disclosure will be explained.

The PC according to the first embodiment of the present disclosure achieves an always on always connected AOAC environment in which the PC can constantly connect to a network and can instantly turn on and off a power supply. The PC according to the first embodiment of the present disclosure achieves the always on always connected AOAC environment by using iSCT. The following description will be given on a premise that the PC achieving the AOAC environment using iSCT has a state S0 iSCT running with low power consumption in addition to a sleeping mode set by Advanced Configuration and Power Interface ACPI .

As shown in the PC according to the first embodiment of the present disclosure is a so called tablet type apparatus including a touchscreen in a display. shows the PC including a display unit a main button and a power button .

The display unit includes a display for displaying a letter an image a movie and other information. For example the display unit may include a liquid crystal display or an organic EL display. In addition the display unit includes a touchscreen having a touchpad on a display screen. The PC receives input operation performed by a user by causing the user to touch the display unit with a finger a stylus or the like.

The main button is a button for turning on the display unit or for causing a certain menu screen to be displayed on the display unit . For example when the user presses the main button in a state where the display unit is off the PC shifts into a running state S0 causes the display unit to turn on and displays a lock screen or a menu screen on the display unit . The lock screen is a screen for preventing the PC from operating improperly by an unintended touch to the touchscreen. The menu screen is a screen for causing the user to execute an application.

The power button is a button for turning on and off the PC . When the user keeps pressing so called long press the power button for a certain time period the PC performs processing such as turning on the power so as to shift into a running state S0 or turning off the power.

For example when the user presses the power button in a state where the display unit is off the PC causes the display unit to turn on and displays the lock screen or the menu screen on the display unit . As an another example when the user presses the power button in a state where the display unit is on and displays a screen the PC causes the display unit to turn off. A function of the main button and a function of the power button differ in that the PC does not cause the display unit to turn off even if the user presses the main button in the state where the display unit is on and displaying a screen.

Peripheral equipment such as a keyboard a touchpad and a mouse may be connected to the PC while the peripheral equipment is not shown in . For example such peripheral equipment is connected to the PC through a Universal Serial Bus USB .

In the case where the user puts the PC into the sleep state S3 iSCT periodically for example every 15 minutes during a day and every 2 hours during a night causes the PC to return to a state S0 iSCT running with low power consumption to run only for a short time and to receive an e mail and update data in a state where the display unit is off without the user knowing about such operation. Note that the S3 state is an example of a first mode according the embodiment of the present disclosure and the S0 iSCT state is an example of a second mode according the embodiment of the present disclosure.

To put the PC into the sleep state S3 for example the user keeps the PC unused for a while or the user presses the power button so as to turn off the display unit . Next after receiving the e mail or updating the data the PC shifts into the sleep state S3 again. As described above even if the PC is in the sleep state S3 the PC can get new information by periodically shifting from the sleep state S3 to the S0 iSCT state.

In a state where a sleep mode is S3 the PC can maintain the S3 state even if the user unintendedly performs input operation on an input device such as the touchscreen. However in a state where a sleep mode is S0 iSCT for a system of a PC such as an OS or BIOS there is no difference from a running state S0 . When a touchscreen is touched in the state where the sleep mode is S0 iSCT a screen turns on in response to the touch and the tablet type PC such as the PC shifts into the running state S0 . Accordingly when the AOAC environment is tried to be achieved in such tablet type PC by using iSCT the tablet type PC may unexpectedly shift from S0 iSCT to a running state S3 in a bag for example and heating and unnecessary consumption of battery may occur in association with the running.

Even in the S0 iSCT state the PC does not turn on the display unit only by touching the main button or the power button . However it is highly possible that the display unit constituting a large part of a surface area of the PC is touched without the user knowing about the touch. Accordingly a shift into the running state S0 by touching the display unit that the user does not intend has to be avoided.

A similar phenomenon may occur not only by touching the touchscreen but also by touching the peripheral equipment which may be connected in a wireless or wired manner such as a keyboard and a touchpad. That is when the peripheral equipment which may be connected in a wireless or wired manner such as the keyboard or the touchpad is touched in the state where the sleep mode is S0 iSCT the screen turns on in response to the touch and the state of the PC shifts into the running state S0 .

In a traditional PC the keyboard and the touchpad are often controlled by systems such as the Basic Input Output System BIOS an embedded controller EC and a keyboard controller KBC . In this case the systems stop giving a notification to an OSs of equipment such as the keyboard and touchpad in the S0 iSCT state and accordingly control can be performed. However in a case where the equipment such as the keyboard and the touchpad are connected through the USB the system side can know the shift into S0 iSCT but it is difficult for the system side to perform control so as to disable a notification to the OSs of equipment such as the keyboard and touchpad.

Accordingly when shifting into the S0 iSCT state the PC according to the embodiment of the present disclosure gives a notification indicating that the state of the PC has shifted into the S0 iSCT state to a program referred to as a utility program that operates on the OS executed by the PC . Subsequently the utility program which received a notification indicating that the state of the PC has shifted into the S0 iSCT state performs control so as to disable input to the input device such as the touchscreen the keyboard and the touchpad. According to such operation the PC according to the embodiment can prevent shifting into the running state S0 even if input that the user does not intend is performed on the touchscreen the keyboard the touchpad and the like in the S0 iSCT state.

With reference to the appearance example of the PC according to the first embodiment of the present disclosure has been explained. Next a configuration example of the PC according to the first embodiment of the present disclosure will be explained.

As shown in the PC according to the first embodiment of the present disclosure includes an iSCT control module BIOS EC KBC a device control utility program a touchscreen and a wireless USB receiver controller .

The touchscreen is a device that is provided on the display unit and in which the display screen and the touchpad are integrated. The user of the PC can operate the PC by touching the touchscreen with the finger the stylus or the like or by approximating the finger the stylus or the like to the touchscreen .

In addition further shows that the PC connects with a USB keyboard a USB touchpad and a USB human interface device HID other than the keyboard and the touchpad.

The USB keyboard the USB touchpad and the USB HID are each a device connected with the PC through a USB and are each an input device for causing the user to perform certain input operation to the PC .

The iSCT control module is a module for controlling whether the PC shifts from the sleep state S3 to the S0 iSCT state in the case where the PC is in the sleep state S3 . When the iSCT control module receives from the BIOS EC KBC a notification that the PC is in the sleep state S3 the iSCT control module periodically for example every 15 minutes during a day and every 2 hours during a night determines whether a condition for a shift into the S0 iSCT state is satisfied.

For example a precondition for the shift into the S0 iSCT state is whether the PC has connected to a network such as the Internet or the wireless LAN. In a case where the PC has not connected to the network such as the Internet or the wireless LAN the PC does not shift into the S0 iSCT state because the PC cannot acquire information through the network. On the other hand in a case where the PC has satisfied the precondition for the shift into the S0 iSCT state the iSCT control module notifies the BIOS EC KBC to periodically shift into the S0 iSCT state. Note that the iSCT control module does not give the notification to the BIOS EC KBC in a case where the PC has not connected to the network such as the Internet or the wireless LAN and has not satisfied the condition for the shift into S0 iSCT state.

The BIOS EC KBC is a system for controlling hardware of the PC . The BIOS EC KBC changes an inner power supply state according to states of the sleep mode of the PC .

The PC according to the embodiment has the S0 iSCT state as the sleep mode. When receiving the notification to shift into the S0 iSCT state from the iSCT control module the BIOS EC KBC periodically shifts into the S0 iSCT state. Subsequently when the BIOS EC KBC shifted into the S0 iSCT state the BIOS EC KBC gives to the device control utility program a notification that the BIOS EC KBC shifted into the S0 iSCT state.

The device control utility program is software operating on an OS executed by the PC . According to a setting by the user the device control utility program switches enabling and disabling of an input device embedded in or connected with the PC . Alternatively the device control utility program switches enabling and disabling of input from the input device embedded in or connected with the PC in a wireless or wired manner according to a state of the sleep mode of the PC that is switched by the BIOS EC KBC . Here in an input device that is a target for the device control utility program to switch enabling and disabling of input the sleep mode is shifted from S0 iSCT state to the S0 state when the operation input is received.

Specifically when the BIOS EC KBC gives to the device control utility program a notification that the sleep mode has shifted into the S0 iSCT state the device control utility program disables input from a touchscreen a USB keyboard a USB touchpad and a USB HID that are managed by the device control utility program . For example the device control utility program disables the input from the touchscreen the USB keyboard the USB touchpad and the USB HID through an application programming interface API of the OS operating in the PC .

As a method for disabling input from the touchscreen the USB keyboard the USB touchpad and the USB HID the device control utility program may ignore input events performed on such input devices or may cause the events themselves not to occur by stopping power supply to such input devices.

As described above when the sleep mode has shifted into the S0 iSCT state input from the touchscreen the USB keyboard the USB touchpad and the USB HID are disabled. Accordingly the PC can prevent the sleep mode from shifting into the S0 state when input operation that the user does not intend is performed on the touchscreen the USB keyboard the USB touchpad and the USE HID in the case where the sleep mode is in the S0 iSCT state.

Note that the PC may include the wireless USB receiver controller for exchanging signals between various kinds of devices in a wireless manner. For example as shown in the wireless USB receiver controller exchanges signals with a wireless keyboard and a wireless touchpad in a wireless manner. In a case where the PC includes the wireless USB receiver controller and the sleep mode is S0 iSCT state the sleep mode shifts into the S0 state if the wireless keyboard and the wireless touchpad are not prevented from being input.

When the device control utility program receives from the BIOS EC KBC a notification that the sleep mode has shifted into the S0 iSCT state in the case where the PC includes the wireless USB receiver controller the device control utility program disables input from the input device connected with the wireless USE receiver controller . By disabling the input from the input device connected with the wireless USB receiver controller the PC can prevent a shift into the S0 state in the case of S0 iSCT state due to input operation to the wireless keyboard or the wireless touchpad that the user does not intend.

The device control utility program may decide an input device whose input is to be disabled according to the user setting in the case where the sleep mode is the S0 iSCT state. For example the device control utility program may decide that only the wireless USB receiver controller is not to be disabled according to the user setting in the case where the sleep mode is the S0 iSCT state.

Since the PC according to the first embodiment of the present disclosure includes the configuration shown in the PC can prevent the sleep mode from shifting into the S0 state in response to input operation that the user does not intend in the state where the sleep mode is S0 iSCT state. Accordingly the PC according to the first embodiment of the present disclosure can prevent an unexpected shift into a running state in a bag and can prevent heating and unnecessary consumption of battery from occurring in association with the running.

With reference to the configuration example of the PC according to the first embodiment of the present disclosure has been explained. Next an operation example of the PC according to the first embodiment of the present disclosure will be explained.

The flowchart in shows processing executed on a premise that the sleep mode of the PC is the sleep state S3 . As described above to put the sleep mode of the PC into the sleep state S3 for example the user keeps the PC unused for a while or the user presses the power button so as to turn off the display unit .

When the iSCT control module receives from the BIOS EC KBC a notification that the PC is in the sleep state S3 the iSCT control module periodically for example every 15 minutes during a day and every 2 hours during a night confirms whether the condition for a shift into the S0 iSCT state is satisfied Step S . Subsequently if the condition for a shift into the S0 iSCT state is satisfied the iSCT control module notifies the BIOS EC KBC to periodically shift into the S0 iSCT state. When the BIOS EC KBC receives from the iSCT control module the notification to shift into the S0 iSCT state the BIOS EC KBC shifts the sleep mode into the S0 iSCT state.

Next when the sleep mode has shifted into the S0 iSCT state the BIOS EC KBC gives to the device control utility program a notification that the sleep mode has shifted into the S0 iSCT state Step S . When the device control utility program receives from the BIOS EC KBC a notification that the sleep mode has shifted into the S0 iSCT state the device control utility program disables a device in this embodiment the touchscreen the wireless USB receiver controller the USB keyboard the USB touchpad or the USB HID that shifts from the S0 iSCT state to the S0 state in response to input operation among devices controlled by the device control utility program Step S .

The device control utility program disables input from the device that shifts from the S0 iSCT state to the S0 state in response to input operation among devices controlled by the device control utility program . Accordingly the sleep mode is prevented from shifting from the S0 iSCT state to the S0 state in response to input operation to the device that the user does not intend.

The sleep mode has shifted into the S0 iSCT state update processing of information such as receiving an e mail has been executed the update processing has been completed and then the PC shifts the sleep mode into the sleep state S3 again Step S . After shifting into the S3 state the BIOS EC KBC notifies the device control utility program of shifting into the S3 state Step S .

When the device control utility program receives from the BIOS EC KBC a notification that the sleep mode has shifted into the S3 state the device control utility program enables the device that has been disabled in Step S Step S . In a case where the sleep mode is the S3 state the PC maintains the S3 state even if input operation that the user does not intend is performed on the enabled device.

Since the PC according to the first embodiment of the present disclosure executes the operation shown in the PC can prevent the sleep mode from shifting into the S0 state in response to input operation that the user does not intend in the case where the sleep mode is S0 iSCT state. Accordingly the PC according to the first embodiment of the present disclosure can prevent an unexpected shift into a running state in a bag and can prevent heating and unnecessary consumption of battery from occurring in association with the running.

If the user wants to use the PC in a case where the sleep mode is S0 iSCT state the user may press the main button or the power button for example. When the user has pressed the main button or the power button the PC shifts the sleep mode from the S0 iSCT state to the S0 state and becomes the running state. That is in Step S input from the main button and the power button are not disabled. This is because if such buttons are disabled the user cannot explicitly tell the PC that the user has a will to use the PC in the case where the sleep mode is the S0 iSCT state.

The above processing is an example of a case where the PC is the tablet type apparatus. However the example according to embodiments of the present disclosure is not limited thereto. For example there is a laptop type apparatus having at least two forms a form in which a lid is closed in a state where the embedded display is not exposed and a form in which the lid is closed in a state where the embedded display is exposed. Such PC may be referred to as a convertible PC a transformable PC or the like. In the following descriptions the form in which the lid is closed in the state where the embedded display is not exposed may be referred to as a clamshell mode and the form in which the lid is closed in a state where the embedded display is exposed may be referred to as a tablet mode with regard to such apparatus having at least two forms.

When the PC adopts such forms the PC may determine whether input from the device is to be disabled in accordance with how the lid is closed. That is in the case of the clamshell mode as shown in touch that the user does not intend is not performed on the touchscreen. However in the case of the tablet mode as shown in the touch that the user does not intend may be performed. Accordingly only in the case of the tablet mode as shown in the PC disables the input from the device when the sleep mode is the S0 iSCT state.

The flowchart in shows processing executed on a premise that the sleep mode of the PC is the sleep state S3 in the same way as the flowchart shown in . In addition the flowchart in shows processing executed on a premise that the user closed the lid of the PC and the sleep mode of the PC is the sleep state S3 .

In the same way as the processing shown in the iSCT control module periodically confirms whether the condition for a shift into the S0 iSCT state is satisfied Step S . When the BIOS EC KBC receives from the iSCT control module the notification to shift into the S0 iSCT state the BIOS EC KBC shifts the sleep mode into the S0 iSCT state.

Next when the sleep mode has shifted into the S0 iSCT state the BIOS EC KBC gives to the device control utility program a notification that the sleep mode has shifted into the S0 iSCT state Step S . When the device control utility program receives from the BIOS EC KBC a notification that the sleep mode has shifted into the S0 iSCT state the device control utility program first determines whether the form of the PC is the tablet mode Step S . For example the BIOS EC KBC may know whether the form of the PC is the tablet mode. Accordingly the device control utility program may acquire information about the form of the PC from the BIOS EC KBC .

In the case where the form of the PC is the tablet mode Yes in Step S the device control utility program disables a device in this embodiment the touchscreen wireless USB receiver controller the USB keyboard the USB touchpad or the USB HID that shifts from the S0 iSCT state to the S0 state in response to input operation among devices controlled by the device control utility program Step S . On the other hand in a case where the form of the PC is not the tablet mode No in Step the device control utility program does not disable the device.

The sleep mode has shifted into the S0 iSCT state update processing of information such as receiving an e mail has been executed the update processing has been completed and then the PC shifts the sleep mode into the sleep state S3 again Step S . After shifting into the S3 state the BIOS EC KBC notifies the device control utility program of shifting into the S3 state Step S . When the device control utility program receives from the BIOS EC KBC a notification that the sleep mode has shifted into the S3 state the device control utility program enables the device that has been disabled in Step S Step S .

Since the PC according to the modification of the first embodiment of the present disclosure executes the operation shown in the PC can prevent the sleep mode from shifting into the S0 state in response to input operation that the user does not intend in the case where the sleep mode is S0 iSCT state and the form is the tablet mode. Accordingly the PC according to the modification of the first embodiment of the present disclosure can prevent an unexpected shift into a running state in a bag and can prevent heating and unnecessary consumption of battery from occurring in association with the running in the case where the form is the tablet mode.

In the above described first embodiment of the present disclosure the device control utility program operating on the OS executed in the PC disables the input from the input device in accordance with the state of the sleep mode. However embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited thereto. For example the OS or the device control utility program operating on the OS disables input from the input device by using a command prepared for each input device.

There are PCs which can realize a specification of Connected Standby. Connected Standby is a state where a state of a PC is S0 a processor and a communication module is in operation and a display is off. In the Connected Standby state the PC is led by an OS and sets each device in a sleep state referred to as Runtime D3 RTD3 . By setting the devices in the RTD3 state input operation from each device is disabled in the Connected Standby state.

Accordingly in the case where the PC can realize Connected Standby the BIOS EC KBC or the device control utility program may set each input device in the above described RTD3 state when the sleep mode is the S0 iSCT state. After the sleep mode becomes the S0 iSCT state by setting each input device in the RTD3 state the PC can prevent the sleep mode from shifting into the S0 state in response to input operation that the user does not intend.

Next a second embodiment of the present disclosure will be explained. In the first embodiment when the sleep mode had become the S0 iSCT state by disabling input from the input device the PC can prevent the sleep mode from shifting into the S0 state in response to input operation that the user does not intend.

On the other hand as described above when the display is turned off a state of the PC becomes the sleep state S3 and the input device is disabled in the sleep state. Alternatively in the iSCT a video standby state that is prepared for normal PCs remains. The Video Standby state is a state where systems are in operation S0 even if the screen is turned off.

The Video Standby state is a running state S0 for the systems and a touchscreen and other input devices are in a valid state. Accordingly the user can turn on the screen by touching the touchscreen in the Video Standby state.

In the above described first embodiment when the sleep mode becomes the S0 iSCT state input from the input device is disabled. Accordingly the user cannot turn on the screen by touching the touchscreen in the S0 iSCT state. On the other hand the user can turn on the screen by touching the touchscreen in the Video Standby state S3 state but not S0 iSCT state . Accordingly the states where the screen is off are the same but the behaviors are different in accordance with inner states when the user touches the touchscreens.

Accordingly the second embodiment of the present disclosure proposes a configuration or operation that prevents the sleep mode from shifting into the S0 state due to input operation that the user does not intend or a configuration or operation that prevents the screen from turning on and thereby prevents unnecessary consumption of battery from occurring by disabling input from an input device in the case where the screen is off.

The PC shown in is a tablet type apparatus similar to the PC according to the first embodiment of the present disclosure and has an appearance similar to the form shown in . As shown in the PC according to the second embodiment of the present disclosure includes a backlight control unit BIOS EC KBC a device control utility program a touchscreen and a wireless USB receiver controller . In the present embodiment the touchscreen is a combination of a liquid crystal display screen and a touchpad.

The backlight control unit controls backlight lighting that irradiates from a back face of the touchscreen . The backlight control unit transmits a backlight signal to the BIOS EC KBC when backlight radiates from the back face of the touchscreen . That is in a case where the screen is displayed the backlight control unit transmits the backlight signal to the BIOS EC KBC . In a case where the screen is not displayed the backlight control unit does not transmit the backlight signal to the BIOS EC KBC .

The BIOS EC KBC is a system for controlling hardware of the PC . In this embodiment the BIOS EC KBC gives to the device control utility program a notification that the backlight has not radiated in a case where the backlight control unit has not transmitted the backlight signal.

The device control utility program is software operating on an OS of the PC . According to a setting by the user the device control utility program switches enabling and disabling of an input device embedded in or connected with the PC . Alternatively the device control utility program switches enabling and disabling of the input device embedded in or connected with the PC according to presence or absence of backlight irradiation to the touchscreen . Here in an input device that is a target for the device control utility program to switch enabling and disabling the backlight control unit starts irradiating the touchscreen with the backlight when the operation input is received.

Specifically when the BIOS EC KBC gives to the backlight control utility program a notification that the backlight control unit has stopped irradiating the touchscreen with the backlight the device control utility program disables a touchscreen a USB keyboard a USB touchpad and a USB HID that are managed by the device control utility program . For example the device control utility program disables the touchscreen the USB keyboard the USB touchpad and the USB HID through an API of the OS operating in the PC . By disabling the touchscreen the USB keyboard the USB touchpad and the USB HID the PC can prevent the screen from turning on in response to input operation to such input devices that the user does not intend.

In a way similar to the first embodiment in the case where the PC includes the wireless USB receiver controller the device control utility program may disable the wireless USB receiver controller . By disabling the wireless USB receiver controller the PC can prevent the screen from turning on in response to input operation to the wireless keyboard or the wireless touchpad that the user does not intend.

Since the PC according to the second embodiment of the present disclosure includes the configuration shown in the PC can prevent the screen from turning on in response to input operation that the user does not intend in the state where the screen is in the off state. Accordingly the PC according to the second embodiment of the present disclosure can prevent the screen from turning on and can prevent heating and unnecessary consumption of battery from occurring in association with the screen lighting.

With reference to the configuration example of the PC according to the second embodiment of the present disclosure has been explained. Next an operation example of the PC according to the second embodiment of the present disclosure will be explained.

As described above the BIOS EC KBC gives to the device control utility program a notification that the backlight has not radiated in a case where the backlight control unit has not transmitted the backlight signal. Accordingly the device control utility program determines whether or not the screen is in the off state on the basis of whether BIOS EC KBC sends a notification that backlight has not radiated Step S .

In a case where the screen is in the off state Yes in Step S the device control utility program disables a device in this embodiment the touchscreen the wireless USB receiver controller the USB keyboard the USB touchpad or the USB HID whose screen is turned on in response to input operation among devices controlled by the device control utility program Step S .

Subsequently the PC determines whether the user has performed certain power on operation on the PC Step S . For example the power on operation of the PC is operation for pressing the main button or a power button shown in the first embodiment.

The PC waits until the user performed the certain power on operation on the PC No in Step S . When the user performed the certain power on operation on the PC Yes in Step S the BIOS EC KBC detects the certain power on operation and gives to the device control utility program a notification that the power on operation was performed. The device control utility program receives the notification and enables the device that was disabled in the Step S Step S .
