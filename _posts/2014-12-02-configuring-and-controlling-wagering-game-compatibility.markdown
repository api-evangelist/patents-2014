title: Configuring and controlling wagering game compatibility
abstract: A wagering game system and its operations are described herein. In some embodiments, the operations can include presenting a primary wagering game and receiving a request to present a secondary game in connection with the primary wagering game. The primary wagering game and the secondary game can be separate applications that require interactivity with each other (e.g., provide required functionality to each other, communicate shared data with each other, etc.). The operations can further include determining that an application programming interface (“API”) provides the required interactivity so that the secondary game can function in conjunction with the primary wagering game without problems (e.g., can successfully plug-in to the primary wagering game). The operations can further determine optional and non-optional requirements and determine compatibilities based on the optional and non-optional requirements. Further, the operations can add functionality to the primary wagering game, the secondary game, or the API, to enable compatibility.

Embodiments of the inventive subject matter relate generally to wagering game systems and networks that more particularly configure and control wagering game compatibility.

Wagering game machines such as slot machines video poker machines and the like have been a cornerstone of the gaming industry for several years. Generally the popularity of such machines depends on the likelihood or perceived likelihood of winning money at the machine and the intrinsic entertainment value of the machine relative to other available gaming options. Where the available gaming options include a number of competing wagering game machines and the expectation of winning at each machine is roughly the same or believed to be the same players are likely to be attracted to the most entertaining and exciting machines. Shrewd operators consequently strive to employ the most entertaining and exciting machines features and enhancements available because such machines attract frequent play and hence increase profitability to the operator. However sometimes the development of new games can become complex and present challenges for developers and game operators alike. Therefore there is a continuing need for wagering game machine manufacturers to continuously develop new games and gaming enhancements that will attract frequent play but that are also easy to use control and configure.

This description of the embodiments is divided into five sections. The first section provides an introduction to embodiments. The second section describes example operating environments while the third section describes example operations performed by some embodiments. The fourth section describes additional example operating environments while the fifth section presents some general comments.

As mentioned previously there is a continuing need for wagering game machine manufacturers to continuously develop new games and gaming enhancements that will attract frequent play but that are easy to use control and configure. Some gaming enhancements have included providing secondary e.g. bonus games that are associated with primary wagering games e.g. base games . Wagering game developers however have faced challenges developing secondary games in conjunction with primary wagering games as the secondary game content e.g. assets code etc. is programmed in conjunction with e.g. combined with compiled into etc. the primary wagering game s content thus extending the development cycle of the primary wagering game. Further when the programming for a secondary game is modified the potential for affecting the primary wagering game increases and vice versa because the game code assets content etc. for the primary wagering game are tied to the secondary game s code assets content etc.

Some embodiments describe examples of presenting one or more secondary applications e.g. secondary games secondary wagering games bonuses etc. in conjunction with a primary wagering game in a wagering game session. However the primary wagering game and the one or more secondary applications are separate such that their content code assets etc. are not programmed together and run as separate applications. Nevertheless in some embodiments the needs of the secondary application may need to integrate with functionality information or other features available from or through the primary wagering game. For instance the primary wagering game may have wagering functionality and other game control features. The one or more secondary applications may need to utilize the wagering functionality or other game control features of the primary wagering game to conduct wagers within the secondary game e.g. in a secondary wagering game associated with the primary wagering game . Further in other examples the primary wagering game may have access to financial data or account information that the secondary application needs to access also. Some embodiments therefore can provide the wagering functionality financial data account information or other features and information of the primary wagering game to the secondary application via application programming interfaces APIs available for the primary wagering game application and the secondary application. During the course of configuration play or at other times some embodiments can also determine whether primary wagering games and secondary applications are compatible. For example some embodiments can determine requirements of the secondary application to access or use the primary wagering game s functionality and or data and determine whether the primary wagering game s API can provide the necessary functionality and or data so that the secondary application can function without operational errors significant delays missing data or other problems.

In some embodiments a secondary application may be referred to more specifically as a secondary game as an example of a possible secondary application that is triggered requested supported etc. by a primary wagering game and which may require interaction with the primary wagering game. However it should be noted that the secondary application does not need to be limited to game applications but could also be related to other secondary applications e.g. promotional applications social networking applications player tracking applications etc. that may require interaction with the primary wagering game. Also in some embodiments herein a player may be referred to interchangeably as a player account or vice versa. Account based wagering systems often utilize player accounts when transacting and performing activities at the computer level that are initiated by players. Therefore a player account is often referred to herein as a representative of the player at a computerized level. Therefore for brevity to avoid having to describe the interconnection between player and player account in every instance a player account may be referred to herein in either context. Further in some embodiments herein the word gaming may be used interchangeably with the word gambling . Further the words wagering game are used to indicate electronic e.g. electromechanical digital computerized etc. games e.g. slot games electronic poker electronic bingo etc. that use e.g. process a form of are based on are funded by etc. a monetary bet or wager.

Although describes some embodiments the following sections describe many other features and embodiments.

This section describes example operating environments and networks and presents structural aspects of some embodiments. More specifically this section includes discussion about wagering game system architectures.

The wagering game system architecture can also include a wagering game server configured to control wagering game content provide random numbers and communicate wagering game information account information and other information to and from a wagering game machine . The wagering game server can include a content controller configured to manage and control content for the presentation of content on the wagering game machine . For example the content controller can generate game results e.g. win loss values including win amounts for games played on the wagering game machine . The content controller can communicate the game results to the wagering game machine . The content controller can also generate random numbers and provide them to the wagering game machine so that the wagering game machine can generate game results. The wagering game server can also include a content store configured to contain content to present on the wagering game machine e.g. primary wagering games . The wagering game server can also include an account manager configured to control information related to player accounts. For example the account manager can communicate wager amounts game results amounts e.g. win amounts bonus game amounts etc. to the account server . The wagering game server can also include a communication unit configured to communicate information to the wagering game machine and to communicate with other systems devices and networks.

The wagering game system architecture can also include the wagering game machine configured to present wagering games and receive and transmit information to configure and control wagering game compatibility. The wagering game machine can include a content controller configured to manage and control content and presentation of content on the wagering game machine . The wagering game machine can also include a content store configured to contain content to present on the wagering game machine . The wagering game machine can also include an operating system configured to control the operation and presentation of system objects and instructions. The wagering game machine can also include a compatibility controller configured to control the compatibility of primary wagering games and secondary applications e.g. secondary games including determining whether a primary wagering game and an independent secondary game can interface with each other s functionality information etc. e.g. via each other s application programming interfaces . The wagering game machine can also include a configuration store configured to store configurations made regarding compatibilities between primary wagering games and secondary applications including storing configuration files with compatibility lists secondary game type lists etc. The wagering game machine can also include an application programming interface controller configured to control communications and interface capabilities between primary wagering games and secondary applications.

The wagering game system architecture can also include a secondary content server configured to provide content and control information for secondary games and other secondary content available on a wagering game network e.g. secondary wagering game content promotions content advertising content player tracking content web content etc. . For example in the secondary game server may be a type of secondary content server that provides secondary games utilized in conjunction with primary wagering games. In some embodiments however other secondary applications can function in conjunction with primary wagering games such as player tracking applications promotional or advertising applications etc.

The wagering game system architecture can also include a compatibility configuration server configured to process and control information to configure and control application interfacing between primary wagering game applications and secondary applications. The compatibility configuration server can include a compatibility configuration controller configured to control the configuration of compatibilities between primary wagering games and secondary games. The compatibility configuration controller can determine features functionality requirements etc. from secondary games and provide types or categories for those games. The compatibility configuration controller can also determine functionality capabilities etc. of a primary wagering game. The compatibility configuration controller can compare the features functionality requirements etc. from the secondary game with the functionality capabilities etc. of the primary wagering game and determine whether they are compatible. For example the compatibility configuration controller can determine whether the primary wagering game s API can provide the functionality and capabilities that are required by the secondary game to access information from use functionality from or in other ways interact with the primary wagering game. The compatibility configuration controller can also determine whether the secondary game s API can communicate data and interface with the primary game s API. Further the compatibility configuration controller can determine whether primary wagering games and secondary games are partially compatible with each other and provide types for secondary games that indicate partial compatibility e.g. so that a secondary game may function in a partial compatibility mode having all necessary requirements met by the primary wagering game s API though not necessarily all optional requirements . The compatibility configuration controller can also store scripts or other mechanisms that can add functionality to primary wagering games that may be lacking from the primary wagering game or from the API capabilities so that the secondary game can function in full or partial compatibility modes at game run time. In some embodiments the system can also add functionality to secondary games or their APIs. The compatibility configuration server can store the scripts and mechanisms along with type lists and compatibility lists with devices on the wagering game network such as on the primary wagering game server the secondary content server and the wagering game machine . The compatibility configuration server can also include a configuration rules store configured to store rules concerning compatibilities of program functionality and access capabilities store rules concerning assigning types to secondary games store rules concerning adding functionality to primary wagering games and or to primary wagering game APIs etc.

Each component shown in the wagering game system architecture is shown as a separate and distinct element connected via a communications network . However some functions performed by one component could be performed by other components. For example the wagering game server can also be configured to perform functions of the compatibility controller the configuration store the application programming interface controller and other network elements and or system devices. Furthermore the components shown may all be contained in one device but some or all may be included in or performed by multiple devices as in the configurations shown in or other configurations not shown. For example the account manager and the communication unit can be included in the wagering game machine instead of or in addition to being a part of the wagering game server . Further in some embodiments the wagering game machine can determine wagering game outcomes generate random numbers etc. instead of or in addition to the wagering game server . The wagering game machine or other wagering game machines described herein can take any suitable form such as floor standing models handheld mobile units bar top models workstation type console models surface computing machines etc. Further the wagering game machines can be primarily dedicated for use in conducting wagering games or can include non dedicated devices such as mobile phones personal digital assistants personal computers etc.

In some embodiments wagering game machines and wagering game servers work together such that wagering game machines can be operated as a thin thick or intermediate client. For example one or more elements of game play may be controlled by the wagering game machines client or the wagering game servers server . Game play elements can include executable game code lookup tables configuration files game outcome audio or visual representations of the game game assets or the like. In a thin client example the wagering game server can perform functions such as determining game outcome or managing assets while the wagering game machines can present a graphical representation of such outcome or asset modification to the user e.g. player . In a thick client example the wagering game machines can determine game outcomes and communicate the outcomes to the wagering game server for recording or managing a player s account.

In some embodiments either the wagering game machines client or the wagering game server s can provide functionality that is not directly related to game play. For example account transactions and account rules may be managed centrally e.g. by the wagering game server s or locally e.g. by the wagering game machines . Other functionality not directly related to game play may include power management presentation of advertising software or firmware updates system quality or security checks etc.

Furthermore the wagering game system architecture can be implemented as software hardware any combination thereof or other forms of embodiments not listed. For example any of the network components e.g. the wagering game machines servers etc. can include hardware and machine readable media including instructions for performing the operations described herein. Machine readable media includes any mechanism that provides i.e. stores and or transmits information in a form readable by a machine e.g. a wagering game machine computer etc. . For example tangible machine readable media includes read only memory ROM random access memory RAM magnetic disk storage media optical storage media flash memory machines etc. Machine readable media also includes any media suitable for transmitting software over a network.

This section describes operations associated with some embodiments. In the discussion below some flow diagrams are described with reference to block diagrams presented herein. However in some embodiments the operations can be performed by logic not described in the block diagrams.

In certain embodiments the operations can be performed by executing instructions residing on machine readable media e.g. software while in other embodiments the operations can be performed by hardware and or other logic e.g. firmware . In some embodiments the operations can be performed in series while in other embodiments one or more of the operations can be performed in parallel. Moreover some embodiments can perform more or less than all the operations shown in any flow diagram.

The flow continues at processing block where the system receives a request to present a secondary game in connection with the primary wagering game. In some embodiments the system can generate and or determine triggering events that request and or cause the presentation of the secondary game. For example some triggering events that can request a secondary game to occur or that can activate e.g. run enable queue load download reserve etc. the secondary game may include 1 a result on a primary wagering game e.g. a slot reel combination 2 a buy in directly to the secondary game e.g. buying in directly to a group game or network game and 3 an automatic enrollment or a result of the buy in or from the primary where the primary wagering game funds the secondary game e.g. progressive games . In some embodiments the system can request to present the secondary game as a plug in to the primary game. In other embodiments the system can request to present the secondary game separate from but with interaction or connectivity to the primary wagering game In some embodiments the system can also request to utilize resources of the wagering game machine to present the secondary game e.g. obtain use of a display take over screen real estate obtain control of speakers obtain priority use of machine hardware etc. . The system can also determine that at least some portion of the primary wagering game e.g. some functionality some requirements some data etc. and at least some portion of the secondary game require interaction. For example the primary wagering game may need to communicate data to the secondary game and vice versa so that the primary wagering game and the secondary game can function properly e.g. perform the interactive functional requirements cross communicate data etc. . For example in the secondary game may require functionality with or access to data associated with any one or more of the game play elements e.g. slot reels the control objects e.g. bet meter spin control the informational display e.g. player tracking promotions panel etc. associated with the primary wagering game . Returning to another example of game interaction between primary games and secondary games is data exchange. For example primary games and secondary games can exchange game math data math data . A primary game and secondary game can utilize e.g. share mash up etc. math data for proper configuration and proper runtime operations. The following are just some examples reasons why primary and secondary games might exchange math data an outcome of a secondary game may be a function of the outcome of a primary game such as a multiplier a frequency of an event in a primary game like bonus symbol trigger frequency may affect the outcome or frequency of a secondary game a frequency of a feature in a secondary game may affect the outcome of a primary game a configuration module may require the math data to mash the math data between for the primary game and the secondary game.

The flow continues at processing block where the system determines a compatibility type for the secondary game. illustrates an example of a wagering game system system that determines a compatibility type for a secondary game using pre configured pre stored compatibility data. The system includes a compatibility data store which includes secondary game type data and game compatibility data . The secondary game type data includes unique secondary game identifiers e.g. titles game identification numbers etc. that uniquely identify specific secondary games. A secondary game server can provide the secondary games via a communications network to a wagering game machine . The secondary game type data can also include corresponding secondary game types. The types can be classified by unique identifiers e.g. Type A Type B etc. which uniquely identify a specific set of capabilities requirements etc. possessed e.g. shared in common by the secondary games that correspond to the type. The system can cross reference the requested secondary game with the secondary game type indicated in the secondary game type data to determine a compatibility type for the secondary game.

The flow continues at processing block where the system determines whether the compatibility type for the secondary game is fully compatible with a primary wagering game API. In some embodiments the system can determine capabilities of a primary wagering game API e.g. determine capabilities of primary wagering game API to present features of the secondary game and or provide information for the primary wagering game . The system can also determine capabilities for a secondary game API e.g. to present features of the primary wagering game and or to provide information from the secondary game . The system can also determine non optional or essential requirements for the secondary game i.e. features and or information that the secondary game has to present without operational error delay missing data disturbances etc. . The primary wagering game API can provide access to necessary information and provide control abilities to present necessary features of the secondary game so that the secondary game can present the features and information in needs to fully function without operational error missing information significant delays or disturbances. The system can determine compatibility at different times and in different ways. For example the system can determine compatibility between primary wagering games and secondary games using pre configured data. For example in the game compatibility data can indicate unique identifiers e.g. titles game identification numbers etc. that uniquely identify primary wagering games e.g. provided by a primary wagering game server . The game compatibility data can also include secondary game types that are compatible with the secondary games e.g. provided by the secondary game server . The secondary game types indicated in the game compatibility data match up to primary games that can provide a compatible link integration interface or other interconnectivity mechanism e.g. compatible APIs with the secondary game types. In other words the compatibility data indicates that a secondary game which matches up to the secondary game type that corresponds to a primary game can present content or other information in conjunction with the primary wagering game without experiencing operational error missing data or other problems. Therefore a compatibility checker can cross reference the secondary game type data with the game compatibility data to determine a game type for a requested secondary game and determine whether the active primary wagering game presented on the wagering game machine is compatible with the game type for the requested secondary game. In some embodiments a compatibility configuration server can pre configure the secondary game type data and the game compatibility data and store the data on the compatibility data store . Referring back to in other embodiments however the system can determine compatibility between primary wagering games and secondary games at game run time when the secondary game is requested but before the secondary game is presented. For example the system can automatically determine capabilities data for primary wagering games and requirements data for secondary wagering games e.g. via capabilities metadata stored with the primary wagering games and or requirements metadata stored with the secondary games and cross reference the capabilities data and requirements data with compatibility rules e.g. stored on a compatibility configuration server stored on the wagering game machine or stored in other locations accessible to the system . Based on the comparison the system can automatically determine compatibilities. It should be noted that the primary game may also need to access requirements and information from the secondary game. Therefore in some embodiments the system can also determine requirements for the primary wagering game and determine whether the secondary game API capabilities will meet the non optional essential requirements of the primary wagering game so that the primary wagering game can present content information features etc. in conjunction with the secondary game without operational error missing data delays disturbances or other problems.

The flow continues at processing block where the system determines whether the compatibility type for the secondary game is partially compatible. In some embodiments the system can determine a partial compatibility type assigned to secondary game. Sometimes a primary wagering game may not have a feature that a secondary game uses. However the feature that the secondary game uses is not a requirement per se in that the secondary game can still be compatible with the primary wagering game API except for the one or more non required or optional features. Consequently the primary wagering game API can be configured to match the secondary game API for partial compatibility meaning that the system can assign a compatibility type that is compatible with the primary wagering game API but with an indicator that some of the optional features are not usable. Thus the system can assign fully compatible types with metadata indicating non optional features that are not compatible or the system can assign different types that indicate partial compatibility. The partial compatibility types can be tagged or indicated as being subsets to fully compatible types e.g. the partial compatibility type can be assigned as type A 1 which indicates that it supports all of the required or non optional features available within type A but with a 1 sub identifier to indicate partial compatibility level 1 where certain optional features are not supported within the type A .

The flow continues at processing block where the system determines whether a feature can be added to make the primary wagering game and secondary game compatible. In some embodiments to make the primary wagering game fully or partially compatible with the secondary game the system can add a script file that may add the feature to the primary wagering game or enable an ability of the primary wagering game s API in some form or another to make the primary wagering game and secondary game compatible. In some embodiments the system may add a limited but functional add on that may permit the primary wagering game to provide a function similar to that required by the secondary game. In other words the limited add on feature may not present content or execute a feature exactly as the secondary game would but the limited add on would still present the content or execute the feature in a limited fashion e.g. the system may add on a limited help text present help text feature to a primary wagering game so that the primary wagering game presents help text in a tool bar or in plain text format instead of using animated pop ups and graphics as the secondary game feature would . In some embodiments the system can add features to make primary wagering games and secondary games either fully or partially compatible. In other words the system may only be able to add functionality to the primary wagering game or enable functionality via the primary wagering game s API sufficient to make the primary game only partially compatible with the secondary game. In other embodiments however the system may be able to add functionality that would make the primary wagering game and the secondary game fully compatible.

The flow continues at processing block where if the primary wagering game and secondary game are neither fully or partially compatible the system prevents the secondary game from being presented in conjunction with the primary wagering game. The system may instead select or request another secondary game that is potentially compatible with the primary wagering game. When requesting the other secondary game the system can repeat the flow to determine compatibility. It should be noted however that in some embodiments the system can still present the secondary game even if it is incompatible with the primary wagering game but the secondary game and the primary game may not be able to communicate properly and present data in conjunction with each other.

The flow continues at processing block where if the primary wagering game and secondary game are fully compatible the system presents the secondary game to function in full compatibility mode. Full compatibility mode may include presenting the optional and non optional features functionality and data of the primary wagering game and the secondary game.

The flow continues at processing block where if the primary wagering game and secondary game are partially compatible the system present the secondary game in partial compatibility mode using a portion of the secondary game features or data e.g. using only the essential non optional features and or data .

The flow continues at processing block where the system assigns a type for the secondary game on a type list based on the secondary game s requirements and capabilities. As mentioned previously the system classified the secondary games into common groups or types based on their common requirements and capabilities. The types can in some embodiments indicate a type of versioning for a primary wagering game API that is needed to make the secondary game work with the primary wagering game. In some embodiments the primary wagering game has an API element and the secondary game has an API element. The combination of the two elements that are compatible can constitute an API type . In some embodiments the system can store the type list on a secondary game provider or in another location accessible to devices on a wagering game network. In some embodiments the system can pre configure the type list with a configuration tool. illustrates an example of assigning and storing types of secondary games to a type list. In a wagering game system system includes a compatibility configuration server configured to assign types to secondary games based on requirements e.g. presentation requirements data access requirements functionality requirements etc. of the secondary games. The compatibility configuration server can present a secondary game configuration user interface user interface with a selection control configured to select one of various secondary games. For example in the selection control can select a secondary game called cannon ball shoot from a list of secondary games. The cannon ball shoot game may be a secondary game presented in conjunction with one or many different primary wagering games where a player can shoot a cannon ball at targets to obtain bonus awards e.g. extra game credits entertainment points free merchandise bet multipliers for use in the primary wagering game etc. . The compatibility configuration server can access information that describes the requirements of the secondary games for instance by reading from sources of information that contain the presentation needs data access needs functionality needs etc. The sources of information may include configuration files database records technical specifications help documentation or other sources of information related to the secondary games. The sources of information can be stored in a secondary game server which may also store the secondary game content assets etc. The user interface can also present the requirements in a requirements display . The compatibility configuration server can determine the requirements from the information sources and list them in the requirements display . The compatibility configuration server can organize the order of the requirements based on filter parameters search queries etc. The user interface can also present a type assignment console that an operator can use to select a specific type identifier e.g. select type A from a type identifier control . The type assignment console can also include an assignment control e.g. assignment control button that the operator can use to assign the selected secondary game e.g. the cannon ball shoot game to the type e.g. type A . The type assignment console can also suggest a specific type based on the requirements indicated in the requirements display . For example an operator can select a suggestion control button and the compatibility configuration server can populate already selected types into the type identifier control and exclude any other types that lack requirements which have conflicting requirements etc. The user interface can also present an assignment indicator that indicates the assigned type or types for the selected secondary game. The user interface can also present a warning display that can indicate problems with assigning types to the selected secondary game or that presents warnings about types that cannot be assigned to the selected secondary game. The compatibility configuration server can create a type list of the compatibility types similar to the secondary game type data illustrated in . The compatibility configuration server can store the type list on wagering game machines on the secondary game server on a primary wagering game server in other locations that are accessible to compatibility checking modules associated with the wagering game machines or in connection with other devices accessible on a communications network . Returning to in some embodiments the system can assign a secondary application to multiple types if the multiple types are compatible as subsets of each other. However in some embodiments the system can assign a secondary application to only one type. Assigning only one type to a secondary application can simplify compatibility checking procedures between primary and secondary games so that the system can quickly and efficiently determine whether a secondary game having only one type is compatible with a primary wagering game without having to consider complex compatibility subsets.

The flow continues at processing block where the system determines the capabilities of primary wagering game s API. In some embodiments the system can determine capabilities of a primary wagering game s API by ascertaining details stored in documentation associated with the API e.g. development documentation reference documentation etc. .

The flow continues at processing block where the system generates a compatibility list of each primary wagering game and compatible secondary game types based on the capabilities of the primary wagering game s API. For example in the system can store the compatibility data in a list e.g. a configuration file a database record etc. . In some embodiments the system can store the compatibility list with the primary wagering game provider.

The flow continues at processing block where the system assigns the compatibility list to the primary wagering game. The system can store the assignments into the compatibility list and associate the compatibility list with a primary wagering game. The compatibility list can indicate that the primary wagering game is compatible with certain types of secondary games. The system can look up the type list to determine whether the secondary game meets one of the types indicated as being compatible in the compatibility list. The compatibility list can be stored in a configuration file on a wagering game machine on a server or other location. In some embodiments the system can configure a wagering game machine using the information in the compatibility list. For example when a primary wagering game is requested an operator can determine and configure payout percentages that will be used for the primary wagering game and any secondary games that will work with the primary wagering game. The operator can refer to the compatibility list associated with the primary wagering game to determine which secondary games are compatible with the primary wagering game. The secondary games can indicate the types that they are associated with by querying a secondary game server by reading configuration files associated with the secondary games of interest by receiving parameters passed from the secondary games etc. The operator can then match the appropriate secondary games and primary wagering games and not allow matches of incompatible types. The operator can configure the primary wagering game to run one or more secondary games at certain times or based on triggers e.g. a progressive limit causes a trigger for secondary game to take over . Some triggers can be known e.g. know triggers such as visible goals that will indicate to the player that the secondary game is about to be triggered symbol triggers etc. . Other triggers can be unknown e.g. a mystery trigger that the player does not know about and just happens such as a wager threshold a random number etc. . The operator can then enable the games for play.

This section describes example operating environments systems and networks and presents structural aspects of some embodiments.

The CPU is also connected to an input output I O bus which can include any suitable bus technologies such as an AGTL frontside bus and a PCI backside bus. The I O bus is connected to a payout mechanism primary display secondary display value input device player input device information reader and storage unit . The player input device can include the value input device to the extent the player input device is used to place wagers. The I O bus is also connected to an external system interface which is connected to external systems e.g. wagering game networks . The external system interface can include logic for exchanging information over wired and wireless networks e.g. 802.11g transceiver Bluetooth transceiver Ethernet transceiver etc. 

The I O bus is also connected to a location unit . The location unit can create player information that indicates the wagering game machine s location movements in a casino. In some embodiments the location unit includes a global positioning system GPS receiver that can determine the wagering game machine s location using GPS satellites. In other embodiments the location unit can include a radio frequency identification RFID tag that can determine the wagering game machine s location using RFID readers positioned throughout a casino. Some embodiments can use GPS receiver and RFID tags in combination while other embodiments can use other suitable methods for determining the wagering game machine s location. Although not shown in in some embodiments the location unit is not connected to the I O bus .
