This disclosure relates to optical modulators for application in fiber optic communications systems and other electro optic systems.

Optical modulators are essential components for fiber optic communication RF photonics instrumentation and optical signal processing applications. Desired characteristics of optical modulators are a modulation bandwidth as high as possible while maintaining a drive voltage as low as possible. Usually achieving these two properties requires conflicting sets of design rules. For example ultra low drive voltage can be achieved using substrate removed SURE waveguides JaeHyuk Shin Yu Chia Chang and Nadir Dagli 0.3 V drive GaAs AlGaAs substrate removed Mach Zehnder intensity modulators Appl. Phys. Letters vol. 92 201103 2008 . SURE waveguides are formed in a semiconductor epitaxial layer that is removed from its original substrate. Both sides of the epitaxial layer can be processed enabling very novel designs. Such submicron thick waveguides have very high vertical index contrast and can guide the optical wave with very low loss of about a few dB cm JaeHyuk Shin Yu Chia Chang and Nadir Dagli Propagation loss study of very compact GaAs AlGaAs substrate removed waveguides Optics Express Vol. 171 No. 5 2009 . However metal electrodes cannot be used on such waveguides since overlap of the optical mode with the metal typically results in excessive optical propagation loss. This difficulty is circumvented using doped semiconducting layers as buried electrodes. Therefore very strong electric fields overlapping very well with optical mode in the waveguide can be generated. resulting in ultra low drive voltage. However finite sheet resistance of the doped semiconductor layers may create excessive resistance and electrode loss which in turn limits the bandwidth of the modulator to about 30 GHz Selim Dogru JaeHyuk Shin and Nadir Dagli Wide Bandwidth Design of Ultra Low Voltage Substrate Removed Electro Optic Mach Zehnder Intensity Modulators Integrated Photonics and Nanophotonics Research Conference Proceedings Paper IWA6 Honolulu Hi.

Throughout this description elements appearing in figures are assigned three digit reference designators where the most significant digit is the figure number and the two least significant digits are specific to the element. An element that is not described in conjunction with a figure may be presumed to have the same characteristics and function as a previously described element having the same reference designator.

A novel design for an ultra wide bandwidth very low drive voltage modulator is presented. This design combines buried electrodes made of doped semiconductors and dielectrics with very large dielectric constant dispersion. This approach bypasses the bandwidth limit due to large electrode loss originating from buried electrodes at microwave frequencies while allowing very low drive voltage due to much reduced electrode gap resulting from buried electrodes. A device with 0.4 volt or less operating voltage and bandwidth exceeding 100 GHz is possible.

Referring now to an ultra wide bandwidth very low drive voltage modulator may include a Mach Zehnder interferometer fabricated on a substrate . A Mach Zehnder interferometer is a well known waveguide device comprised of an input optical waveguide a splitter two branch optical waveguides a combiner and an output optical waveguide . The optical waveguides are shown as dashed lines in . All optical waveguides support a single propagating mode. Light coupled into the input optical waveguide is divided between the two branch optical waveguides by the y branch splitter which could also be a directional coupler or a multi mode interference coupler. After transiting the two branch optical waveguides the light is recombined and directed into the output optical waveguide by the y branch combiner which could also be a directional coupler or a multi mode interference coupler. The light is delayed or phase shifted by the transit along the two branch optical waveguides . When the phase shifts in the two branch optical waveguides are equal a maximum amount of light is directed into the output optical waveguide i.e. 100 less any losses inherent in the waveguides . When the phase shift between the two branch optical waveguides is 180 degrees the light from the two branch optical waveguides interferes at the combiner and little light is directed into the output optical waveguide .

A Mach Zehnder interferometer may be fabricated on an electro optical material which is to say a material where the index of refraction can be varied by applying an electric field. When a Mach Zehnder interferometer such as the Mach Zehnder interferometer is used as a modulator a time varying electric field may be applied to one or both of the two waveguide branches to vary the index of refraction of the waveguide branches. Varying the index of refraction changes the phase shift incurred by light transiting the waveguide branches and thus modulates the amount of light coupled into the output waveguide.

In the ultra wide bandwidth very low drive voltage modulator electric fields are applied to the two branch optical waveguides by a coplanar transmission line superimposed on the Mach Zehnder interferometer. The coplanar transmission line includes a signal trace S between two ground traces G . A microwave signal introduced at one end of the coplanar transmission line will propagate along the waveguide to the other end. Commonly the signal may then be dissipated in a load not shown that matches the impedance of the coplanar waveguide. A coplanar strip can also be used in place of the coplanar transmission line.

The ultra wide bandwidth very low drive voltage modulator as an example of what is commonly called a traveling wave modulator since the light exiting the Mach Zehnder interferometer is modulated by an electric wave as the wave travels down the coplanar transmission line. In order to effect maximum modulation of the light the propagation velocity of the microwave signal in the coplanar transmission line needs to be the same as the propagation velocity of the light in the branch optical waveguides .

The ultra wide bandwidth very low drive voltage modulator may be formed in a substrate removed compound semiconductor layer. In this patent a substrate removed semiconductor layer is a semiconductor layer that is attached to a supporting substrate by an adhesive as opposed to a semiconductor layer that is grown on or deposited directly on a substrate. The adhesive may be for example Benzocyclobutane BCB or another polymer material. The substrate removed compound semiconductor layer may be initially created as an epitaxial layer on a substrate and then removed from the substrate and glued onto a transfer substrate using a glue such as BCB. Details of the transfer and substrate removal processes will be provided subsequently.

The p doped layer the central i layer and the n doped layer also form a so called staircase waveguide indicated by the dashed oval in a region where the p doped layer and the n doped layer overlap. A similar staircase waveguide may also be formed using other electro optic materials such as bulk GaAs InP or Si. A staircase waveguide is similar to a rib waveguide but each side of the rib is etched on opposite sides of the substrate removed semiconductor layer. The staircase waveguide may support a single mode waveguide at a wavelength of operation of the ultra wide bandwidth very low drive voltage modulator . The single optical mode will have a Gaussian like electric field distribution and will not be precisely confined within the waveguide .

The refractive index of the central i layer and thus the phase shift of light propagating along the waveguide may be varied by applying an electric field across the a p i n diode formed by the p doped layer the central i layer and the n doped layer . Electrical connections may be made to the p doped layer and the n doped layer by a first ohmic contact and a second ohmic contact on the sides of the waveguide away from the optical mode. However when a microwave modulating signal is applied between the ohmic contacts AC currents will still flow laterally through the p doped layer and the n doped layer . The resistance of the p doped layer and the n doped layer and the capacitance of the central i layer will in over simplified terms form a low pass filter that may limit the bandwidth of ultra wide bandwidth very low drive voltage modulator due to attenuation of the microwave signal from resistive losses in the p doped layer and the n doped layer .

To increase the bandwidth of the ultra wide bandwidth very low drive voltage modulator first and second metal conductors may extend respectively from the first and second ohmic contacts . The first and second metal conductors may overlap the p doped layer and the n doped layer respectively. However to avoid attenuation of the optical mode traveling in the waveguide the optical mode should not overlap the first and second metal conductors or the first and second ohmic contacts . Thus the first and second metal conductors may be separated from the p doped layer and the n doped layer by respective first and second dielectric layers . The thickness of the first and second dielectric layers may be sufficient to ensure that the first and second metal conductors do not overlap the optical mode. The first and second metal conductors may be capacitively coupled to the p doped layer and the n doped layer through the respective first and second dielectric layers .

The first and second dielectric layers between first and second metal conductors and the p doped and n doped layers may be made from a dielectric material having a high dielectric constant at microwave and millimeter wave frequencies but a low refractive index at optical frequencies. A high dielectric constant at microwave and millimeter wave frequencies may ensure strong AC coupling from the first and second metal conductors to the p doped and n doped layers . The use of a dielectric material with a low dielectric constant and correspondingly low index of refraction at optical frequencies may assist in confining the optical mode such that the optical mode does not overlap the first and second metal conductors or the first and second ohmic contacts . To confine the optical mode the index of refraction of the first and second dielectric layers may be lower than the index of refraction of the central i layer and less than the index of refraction of the p doped and n doped layers . about 3.1 at 1.55 microns .

For example a central i layer composed of InAlAs InAlGaAs multi quantum wells will have an index of refraction about 3.5 at a wavelength of 1.55 microns. InP p doped and n doped layers will have an index of refraction about 3.1 at 1.55 microns.

The refractive index n of a material is given by the following equation square root over where is the relative permittivity or dielectric constant of the material and is the relative permeability of the material. For non magnetic material is very close to 1.0. Thus the relationship between dielectric constant and refractive index of the dielectric layers may be given by square root over or . The first and second dielectric layers may be a dielectric material having strong dielectric constant dispersion which is to say the dielectric constant of the material at microwave and millimeter frequencies may be substantially larger than the square of the refractive index of the material at optical frequencies. A dielectric material is considered to have strong dielectric constant dispersion if the following equation is satisfied 5 where is the dielectric constant of the material at a microwave frequency of operation of ultra wide bandwidth very low drive voltage modulator and nis the index of refraction for an optical wavelength of operation of the ultra wide bandwidth very low drive voltage modulator .

Some examples of materials suitable for the first and second dielectric layers are LiNbO TaO and BaTiO. For example bulk BaTiO has microwave dielectric constant of 2200. In thin films the microwave dielectric constant of BaTiOreduces to about 200. BaTiO has an index of refraction of about 2.3 for an operating wavelength of 1.55 m. An index of refraction of 2.3 is low enough to provide rapidly decaying optical mode in the dielectric layers . For an optical wavelength of 1.55 m the dielectric layers may be 0.6 m thick to confine the mode such that optical mode does not overlap with the first and second metal conductors . The index of refraction of LiNbOis about 2.2 at an optical wavelength of 1.55 microns and the microwave dielectric constant of thin film LiNbOis about 35.

A top schematic view of a portion of the ultra wide bandwidth very low drive voltage modulator is shown in and a cross sectional schematic view of the same portion is shown in . In branches are connected in parallel between signal and ground traces. They can also be connected in series. This arrangement may require a coplanar strip rather than a coplanar transmission line.

As shown in two optical waveguides L R formed in the substrate removed semiconductor layer are positioned adjacent to the gaps between the signal electrode and ground electrodes of a coplanar transmission line. The designators L and R refer to the left hand and right hand waveguides as shown in this drawing and have no other physical meaning. Short stubs extending from the signal electrode and ground electrodes connect to modulator electrodes that overlap the optical waveguides . Note that modulator electrodes shown as dashed lines are located beneath the optical waveguides L R. Modulator electrodes extending from the ground electrode are disposed on top of the left hand optical waveguide L. Modulator electrodes extending from the signal electrode are disposed beneath the left hand optical waveguide L and on top of the right hand optical waveguide R. Modulator electrodes extending from the ground electrode are disposed beneath the right hand optical waveguide R.

The waveguides optical waveguides R are periodically implanted to form short semi insulating sections . The implant material may be boron protons oxygen or any other suitable material. These semi insulating sections provide electrical isolation between adjacent modulator electrodes . These semi insulating sections ensure that currents cannot flow through the p doped and n doped layers along the length of the modulator. Hence these short modulator electrodes and the interposed lengths of not implanted p i n diode formed by the optical waveguides L R form small capacitive elements that periodically load the coplanar transmission line increasing its capacitance per unit length. The modulator electrodes may be configured to adjust the capacitance per unit length of the coplanar transmission line to equalize the group velocity of the coplanar transmission line and the optical waveguides L R.

When a microwave signal propagates along the coplanar transmission line of the ultra wide bandwidth very low drive voltage modulator there will be index changes in the substrate removed compound semiconductor layer due to linear electro optic LEO quadratic electro optic QEO and free carrier FC effects. The resultant differential phase shift between the arms of the interferometer is proportional to the difference of the index changes in each arm. During the operation arms of the interferometer are biased such that the same DC bias resulting in a bias field of Eexists across each p i n diode in each arm. But the polarity of the AC field is changed between the arms due to physical electrode connection shown in . Hence same magnitude and opposite direction AC fields of Eexist in each arm. As a result biasing electric field across the arms are E Eand E E. Then

The bandwidth of the ultra wide bandwidth very low drive voltage modulator may be determined by the microwave and millimeter wave characteristics of the coplanar transmission line. In traveling wave operation widest bandwidth is obtained when optical and microwave group velocities are matched. The coplanar transmission line should not have any dispersion or its group and phase velocities should be the same. Even under perfect velocity matching 3 dB bandwidth is reached when electrode loss becomes 6.4 dB. An electrical equivalent circuit of the coplanar transmission line is as shown in . Here L C Rand Gare the inductance capacitance resistance and conductance per unit length of the unloaded coplanar line. This coplanar transmission line is periodically loaded by electrically isolated modulator sections having admittance Yand the accurate modeling of these sections is essential.

A model of the modulator sections can be developed as shown in and the equivalent circuit shown in . Each modulator section is about 100 m long. So it can be modeled using lumped equivalent circuit elements. We take slices of x wide in the cross section and model each slice using appropriate resistance and capacitance per unit width of each slice. Ris the resistance per unit width of the first and second conductors . Ris the resistance per unit width of the p doped layer and the n doped layer . Cis the capacitance per unit width of the first and second dielectric layers . Cis the capacitance per unit width of the central i layer . In this circuit RCdue to very low sheet resistance of the metal and very high dielectric constant of the dielectric. At DC and low frequencies an external voltage applied to the ohmic contacts is applied across the central i layer through the p doped layer and the n doped layer that act as buried electrodes. Due to finite sheet resistance of the p doped layer and the n doped layer ohmic losses arise increasing the microwave loss of the electrode. This loss will eventually limit the bandwidth. However as frequency increases impedance of Cis very low effectively connecting the ohmic contacts to the p doped layer and the n doped layer through very low impedance Rand C. Hence the external voltage appears across the central i layer uniformly and the current flow in the p doped layer and the n doped layer is significantly limited. Therefore losses arising from these doped buried electrodes are reduced significantly. This in turn enhances the bandwidth drastically.

Modulator electrode characteristics and modulation response were calculated using the equivalent circuits shown in and . For unloaded line modeling existing empirical formulas are used. In the simulations W 100 m g 25 m and the BCB is 10 m thick. respectively show the characteristic impedance Z and attenuation coefficient of the electrode as well as the modulation response of the modulator up to 100 GHz for different relative dielectric constants of the dielectric. and Zshow mild dependence on . A tenfold increase in changes these quantities by about 10 and most of the change takes place when 200. Hence there is no need to obtain extremely large values. Modulation bandwidth exceeds 100 GHz for greater than about 150 demonstrating the ultra wide bandwidth of this design with very low drive voltage. also shows the result of a simulation without the dielectric and metal layers. In this case bandwidth is about 5 GHz. The techniques described herein improve the bandwidth more than 15 times.
