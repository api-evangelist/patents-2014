title: Wireless beacon devices providing crosswalk management through communication device connections
abstract: There are provided systems and methods for wireless beacon devices providing crosswalk management through communication device connections. A user may travel with a device, such as a communication device, that includes a communication module that may utilize specialized hardware features to establish short range wireless communications with nearby wireless beacons. The wireless beacons may be established at or nearby crosswalk locations. The beacon may provide the aforementioned communication services with the communication device and be utilized to triangulate a position, path of travel, and speed of travel of the user. Calendar, travel route, and other information for the user may also be determined using the beacons. Thus, a crosswalk signal may be changed in anticipation of the user crossing. Further, if the user requires additional time to cross based on triangulating the user's location in the crosswalk, the signal may be further changed based on the user's location.

The present application generally relates to wireless beacon devices providing crosswalk management through communication device connections and more specifically to utilizing wireless beacon devices near crosswalk intersections to regulate traffic crossing the crosswalk and travelling down the road corresponding to the crosswalk.

Users may bring mobile user devices with them as they travel including communication devices. Such devices may have schedules of the user travel routes and other user information that may be used to determine where the user is travelling and when the user needs to arrive at a location. However while travelling by foot or vehicle crosswalk lights and or stop lights may be unaware of the user s schedule thus may unnecessarily delay a user while they are trying to reach an endpoint. This is especially true in the case of crosswalks where a user often is required to be physically present at the crosswalk to press a button. Thus the user will nearly always incur some wait period when arriving at the crosswalk. Further crosswalks usually allow for a set amount of time for users to cross the crosswalk after the button is pressed which may be determined using the length of the crosswalk. Such set time amounts may consider the normal pace of a user but may not consider users who may need additional time or users who may accidentally step into the intersection and do not press the button for example young children . Thus users may incur safety risks when utilizing crosswalks.

Embodiments of the present disclosure and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure and not for purposes of limiting the same.

Provided are methods utilized by wireless beacon devices to provide crosswalk management through communication device connections. Systems suitable for practicing methods of the present disclosure are also provided.

Various crosswalk locations may provide short range wireless communications with a communication device such as through beacons using Bluetooth Low Energy BLE LTE Direct or other communication protocol. These beacons may be set up at the crosswalk location such as at or nearby the crosswalk and or crosswalk signal embedded in pavement below the crosswalk attached to road signals above the crosswalk and or placed in or nearby sidewalks associated with the crosswalk. The beacons may communicate with devices in possession of users in order to connect to the device and determine the user is in proximity to the beacon. The beacons may provide additional functionality such as establishing a connection with a crosswalk management device or server to provide the crosswalk management device server notifications of where the user is detected. Thus the beacons may provide proximity detection of users and triangulation of user s positions locations nearby or within the crosswalk.

Thus these beacons at the crosswalk location may communicate with the communication device in possession of the user through Bluetooth Low Energy BLE LTE Direct or another communication protocol receivable by the communication device. When establishing a connection the beacon may emit a communication signal including an identifier for the beacon the user and or the crosswalk management service administering the beacons e.g. a service provider transportation provider and or town city management . A check in module of the communication device may execute specialized hardware and or software to passively monitor for the short range wireless communications for example through a communication module. When the device detects the signal and verifies the one or more identifiers both the device and the beacon may ramp up in power and establish a connection where the connection may further enable the device to communicate additional information to the wireless beacon such as check in information e.g. an identifier and or other stored data. The beacon may be connected to a networked device at the crosswalk location or the beacon may include network functionality to communicate with other devices and or servers itself.

Thus the beacon enables the user device to establish a connection communicate check in information e.g. an identifier for the user and or user device and or complete a check in with the crosswalk location. The check in may be completed automatically when the user device is in range of the beacon or may be completed after prompting the user to check in when the user device is in range of the beacon. The wireless beacon s may be range limited to correspond to a sub area of the crosswalk location such as by limiting the signal strength and or directionality of the beacon and or utilizing the physical boundaries of the location. The sub area may correspond to one side of the crosswalk a center or other area within the crosswalk a sidewalk preceding or after a crosswalk or other area at or nearby a crosswalk. Thus the communication device may connect to one beacon in a sub area of the crosswalk location multiple beacons in more than one sub area of the crosswalk location and or one or more beacons corresponding to the entire crosswalk location.

Utilizing the one or more beacons the communication device is connected to a location of the user and or a path the user is travelling may be determined by a crosswalk management device server in communication with the wireless beacon s such as whether the user will travel through the crosswalk or if the user is crossing a road at the crosswalk location. The crosswalk management server may receive the connection information from the wireless beacon s utilizing a communication module and store the connection information to a non transitory memory of the crosswalk management device server. A crosswalk management module may then determine the path location using the connections between the communication device for the user and the wireless beacon s . For example the location and or path of the user may be determined using the beacon s the user s communication device has connected to triangulation of the user through the user s communication device connections with the beacon s and or information available about the user from the communication device. Thus once the user device connects to the beacon information about the user device may be accessed received and or retrieved by the wireless beacon. Such information may correspond to an identifier that associates the user s location with the beacon s location or may also correspond to a travel route of the user a calendar application having a schedule of the user e.g. a meeting schedule and location of the meeting and or personal information about the user e.g. a home work family friend and or vacation address of the user and age of the user a handicap status of the user items and or associated users the user may be travelling with etc. .

Thus once the location of the user the path of the user and or the personal information about the user is determined by the crosswalk management device server using received information e.g. the check in information for the communication device s connections with one or more wireless beacons and additional information communicated to the wireless beacons from the communication device the crosswalk management device server may determine a setting for one or more crosswalk and or road signal devices at the crosswalk for the user. Such setting may correspond to a change of the crosswalk light to allow the user to traverse the crosswalk a red light to stop traffic travelling through the crosswalk e.g. vehicle traffic and or an amount of time to allow the user to travel through the crosswalk. The amount of time to allow the user to travel through the crosswalk may be determined using personal information for the user such as an age handicap status average walking speed whether the user may be on or using a device for travel such as a bicycle skateboard skates tricycle inline skates and the like along with average travel speeds and or experience levels with such devices and or luggage others other humans and or animals with the user including strollers wagons carts etc. For example an average walking speed of a user may be determined based on historic walking speeds known about the user and or determined using the communication device of the user for example if the communication device includes a pedometer or other device to capture the walking speed. The walking speed may also be determined as the user approaches the crosswalk such as through a speed detection device and or wireless beacons at the crosswalk. The walking speed may also constitute a combination of elements such as a historic walking speed and a current walking speed for example if the user is presently travelling 7 miles an hour but speeds up to 10 miles an hour in a crosswalk. The aforementioned walking speed may therefore determine how long a crosswalk signal may be required to allow passage for the user. Once the setting is determined it may be transmitted to the signal device s at the crosswalk which may utilize the setting to change the light for the user. The setting may be determined to change the light s when the user is detected at the entrance to the crosswalk or may include a countdown timer to account for the time until the user arrives at the entrance to the crosswalk.

The setting may also be adjusted based on user actions and or information about surrounding circumstances such as traffic and or street closures. For example the user may correspond to a young child who runs into the crosswalk without waiting for the light to change. Thus on detection of the child in the crosswalk the lights may quickly or immediately change to provide safety to the young child. In other embodiments the user may correspond to an elderly person who may take longer to cross the crosswalk. Thus if the user is still detected in the crosswalk the amount of time for the signal to allow the user to cross the crosswalk may be extended. In still further embodiments traffic or street closures may route the users to certain crosswalks while preventing use of other crosswalks or cause increased delay for certain crosswalks to alleviate vehicle traffic concerns. Moreover the crosswalk management system may track user foot traffic utilizing the wireless beacons to determine traffic flows and other high traffic patterns. Such traffic patterns may be provided to nearby merchants businesses and or service providers to assist such employers with business decisions.

System includes a user a user device a crosswalk signal system having crosswalk signal devices and wireless beacons and crosswalk management server in communication over a network . User may travel through a crosswalk location corresponding to crosswalk signal system where crosswalk signal devices control traffic throughout the crosswalk location and wireless beacons connect with user device . User device may connect to wireless beacons in order to determine a location and or path of travel for user . Crosswalk management server may determine one or more settings light changes or other parameters for crosswalk signal devices based on the connections between user device and wireless beacons and transmit the setting s to crosswalk signal system for execution by crosswalk signal devices .

User device crosswalk signal system crosswalk signal devices wireless beacons and crosswalk management server may each include one or more processors memories and other appropriate components for executing instructions such as program code and or data stored on one or more computer readable mediums to implement the various applications data and steps described herein. For example such instructions may be stored in one or more computer readable media such as memories or data storage devices internal and or external to various components of system and or accessible over network .

User device may be implemented as a communication device that may utilize appropriate hardware and software configured for wired and or wireless communication with wireless beacons and or crosswalk management server . For example in one embodiment user device may be implemented as a personal computer PC a smart phone laptop tablet computer wristwatch with appropriate computer hardware resources eyeglasses with appropriate computer hardware e.g. GOGGLE GLASS other type of wearable computing device implantable communication devices and or other types of computing devices capable of transmitting and or receiving data such as an IPAD from APPLE . Although a user device is shown the user device may be managed or controlled by any suitable processing device. Although only one user device is shown a plurality of user devices may function similarly.

User device of contains a check in module other applications a database and a communication module . Check in module and other applications may correspond to executable processes procedures and or applications with associated hardware. In other embodiments user device may include additional or different hardware and software as required.

Check in module may correspond to one or more processes to execute modules and associated devices of user device to establish a connection with wireless beacons including a check in with a crosswalk location corresponding to crosswalk signal system . In this regard check in module may correspond to specialized hardware and or software utilized by user device with wireless beacons to establish a connection and complete a check in in order to provide user crosswalk management services. A connection by check in module with one or more of wireless beacons may provide and or verify the identity of user including transmission of an identifier for user and or user device . Thus check in information may be established when a connection is made by check in module with one or more of wireless beacons that includes one or more identifiers.

In various embodiments check in module receives short range wireless communications from one or more of wireless beacons through communication module at a crosswalk location and transmits information to wireless beacons including check in information for a check in process that associates user with the one or more of wireless beacons connected with user device . For example wireless beacons may be located at and throughout a crosswalk location e.g. at crosswalk entrances and exits within the crosswalk travelling path and at or nearby sidewalks approaching and departing from the crosswalk and set up to communicate with user device when user device is in proximity to wireless beacons . Wireless beacons may also correspond to a sub location area of the crosswalk location e.g. the aforementioned crosswalk entrances and exits within the crosswalk travelling path and at or nearby sidewalks approaching and departing from the crosswalk . Thus wireless beacons may be range limited to connect only with devices e.g. user device within the specified area such as a radius around wireless beacons a distance away from wireless beacons and or a signal direction for wireless beacons . When user device enters the proximity radius for one or more of wireless beacons user device and the one or more of wireless beacons may connect and check in information including an identifier for user and or user device may be transmitted to the connected beacons of wireless beacons .

Check in module may execute in the background of an operating system of user device and be configured to establish connections using communication module of user device with one or more of wireless beacons . The connection may be established with or without user input from user . For example wireless beacons may broadcast a token such as a universally unique identifier UUID for reception by check in module as will be explained in more detail herein. Check in module may utilize communication module of user device to receive the token from wireless beacons . If check in module acknowledges the UUID as identifying wireless beacons and or crosswalk management server e.g. if check in module determines the UUID corresponds to a request to establish a communication channel and or process and complete a check in check in module may transmit an identifier corresponding to user and or user device back to wireless beacons . Check in module may utilize communication module of user device to communicate with wireless beacons e.g. over near field communication Bluetooth Bluetooth Low Energy radio infrared LTE Direct or other communication protocol . The identifier from user device may include be transmitted with concatenated with or otherwise bundled with the identifier received from wireless beacons . In other embodiments different information may be transmitted to wireless beacons such as an identifier for user a name or other personal information for user or other identifying information. Thus the information transmitted to wireless beacons does not need to be utilized to process and or complete a check in in all embodiments.

Once a connection is established with wireless beacons the process may associate user with the one or more of wireless beacons used to connect to user device . For example wireless beacons may previous be registered as located at or nearby a specific area within a crosswalk location e.g. the aforementioned crosswalk entrances and exits within the crosswalk travelling path and at or nearby sidewalks approaching and departing from the crosswalk . Once user device connects to one or more of wireless beacons the check in information for the connection e.g. the check in information including an identifier and information for the check in such as the beacon s of wireless beacons that user device is connected to may be transmitted to crosswalk management server . Crosswalk management server may process the check in information to determine if user will utilize a crosswalk and a setting for a crosswalk signal device and or road signal device based on whether user will utilize the crosswalk as will be explained in more detail herein. Thus crosswalk management server may determine the position location and or path of travel for user utilizing user device s connections with one or more of wireless beacons established at specific areas of the crosswalk location. As previously discussed in other embodiments a check in need not be processed and or completed to associate user with the areas of the crosswalk location. Thus other connections and data transfers to wireless beacons may be sufficient to associate user with the areas sub areas and or crosswalk location.

Once a connection is established with wireless beacons by check in module check in module may be utilized to transmit further information to wireless beacons for use by crosswalk management server in determining user s location path of travel and or parameters for use of a crosswalk. For example check in module may access information stored to database such as user personal information e.g. an address for a work home vacation location friend family etc. an age of user a handicap of user average walking speed of the user and or associated user e.g. baby pet elderly etc. travelling with user or luggage cargo carried or being pushed by user including recently merchant purchases . Such information may be transmitted to crosswalk management server for processing as will be explained in more detail herein. Check in module may also interface with one or more API s for applications and or modules executed by user device to retrieve such information. Check in module may also receive information from wireless beacons and or crosswalk management server . Received information may correspond to crosswalk signal settings determined by crosswalk management server traffic issues street closures and or merchant advertisements and incentives as will be explained in more detail herein.

In various embodiments user device includes other applications as may be desired in particular embodiments to provide features to user device . For example other applications may include security applications for implementing client side security features programmatic client applications for interfacing with appropriate application programming interfaces APIs over network or other types of applications. Other applications may also include email texting voice and IM applications that allow a user to send and receive emails calls texts and other notifications through network . In various embodiments other applications may include financial applications such as banking online payments money transfer or other applications associated with a payment provider. As previously discussed other applications may include mapping applications for example through a GPS module that may identify user at a location and or calendaring scheduling applications which may be utilized to determine a route user is travelling. Other applications may include device interfaces and other display modules that may receive input from user and or output information to user . For example other applications may contain software programs executable by a processor including a graphical user interface GUI configured to provide an interface to the user.

User device may further include database stored to a transitory and or non transitory memory of user device which may store various applications and data and be utilized during execution of various modules of user device . Thus database may include for example identifiers such as operating system registry entries cookies associated with check in module and or other applications identifiers associated with hardware of user device or other appropriate identifiers such as identifiers used for payment user device authentication or identification. Database may include travel route information calendaring information personal information associated users travelling with user associated luggage cargo for user and or merchant purchases for user that may be utilized by crosswalk management server . Furthermore database may further include received information from crosswalk management server .

User device includes at least one communication module adapted to communicate with wireless beacons and or crosswalk management server . In various embodiments communication module may include a DSL e.g. Digital Subscriber Line modem a PSTN Public Switched Telephone Network modem an Ethernet device a broadband device a satellite device and or various other types of wired and or wireless network communication devices including microwave radio frequency infrared Bluetooth and near field communication devices. Communication module may communicate directly with wireless beacons using short range communications such as Bluetooth Low Energy LTE Direct WiFi radio frequency infrared Bluetooth and near field communications.

Crosswalk signal system may correspond to a system for use in providing safety signals used at a crosswalk and associated road where user and or vehicles may traverse various paths through the crosswalk and or road. In this regard crosswalk signal system may correspond to a single crosswalk and road or a plurality of crosswalks and or roads. Crosswalk signal system may include further specialized software and or hardware than displayed in environment such as crosswalk and or road sensors used to manipulate one or more safety signals located at the crosswalk location s . Crosswalk signal system may include safety signaling lights that manipulate the flow of traffic and prevent unsafe traffic conditions. Crosswalk signal system further includes wireless beacons utilized to provide crosswalk management utilizing connections with user devices. Crosswalk signal system may also include communication modules and or network interface components configured to communication with user device and or crosswalk management server directly and or over network . Thus crosswalk signal system includes crosswalk signal devices and wireless beacons .

Crosswalk signal devices may correspond to one or more traffic signals lights and or signs that regulate foot and or vehicle traffic surrounding and or travelling on a road. Thus crosswalk signal devices may regulate crosswalk traffic across a road street or other throughway utilized by vehicles. Crosswalk signal devices may also regulate vehicle traffic travelling on the road such as through an intersection with another road and or exiting and entering a road. Crosswalk signal devices may correspond to visual signal devices such as traffic lights having red yellow and green safety signals crosswalk signals have a hand gesture to stop and a walking person gesture to traverse a crosswalk and or similar visual devices. Crosswalk signal devices may also include auditory devices that instruct users on traffic flow.

Wireless beacons may be maintained for example by a service provider town city planner or other entity providing crosswalk management. Wireless beacons may be implemented using any appropriate hardware and software configured for wireless communication with user device and or crosswalk management server . For example in one embodiment wireless beacons may be implemented as a dongle device including a hardware processor and a communication module for example connected to a device at a crosswalk location e.g. a computing device having specialized hardware and or software for management of crosswalk signal devices . Wireless beacons may also be implemented as a device incorporated within a personal computer PC a smart phone laptop computer and or other types of computing devices capable of transmitting and or receiving data such as an IPAD from APPLE . Wireless beacons may also act as a stand alone device including a processor communication module and or network interface component configured to communicate with user device and or crosswalk management server . Although a plurality of wireless beacons are described a single wireless beacon may be utilized at the crosswalk location.

Wireless beacons may be located at a physical crosswalk location. Wireless beacons of contains processes procedures and or applications for example a software program executable by a hardware processor configured to interact with user device and or crosswalk management server . Thus regardless of the implementation of wireless beacons as discussed above each of wireless beacons utilize a check in module and a communication module . Check in module may correspond to executable processes procedures and or applications with associated hardware. In other embodiments wireless beacons may include additional or different software and devices as required.

Check in module may correspond to an executable module having specialized hardware and or software features for transmitting requests to establish a connection between a device e.g. user device and one of wireless beacons transmitting the request to establish the connection. Thus wireless beacons may utilize short range wireless communications of wireless beacons to transmit the requests to establish a connection including an identifier such as a Universally Unique Identifier UUID . If user device receives a request to establish the connection with wireless beacons and responds with a user device identifier potentially including the UUID and other information necessary to effectuate a check in of user device check in module may cause wireless beacons to ramp up in power and create a connection between user device and wireless beacons .

Each of wireless beacons may transmit the request to establish the connection with wireless beacons as a short range wireless communication e.g. a BLE protocol communication including a wake up process for check in module of user device and or a token for wireless beacons . In other embodiments the request and or connection may utilize near field communication radio communication infrared communication Bluetooth communication or WiFi communication. Additionally although wireless beacons may utilize BLE protocol communications to effectuate an always on type service where the UUID and wake up process are transmitted continuously other communication protocols used to provide an always on service may include QUALCOMM LTE Direct or similar device to device communication technology. BLE and LTE Direct may both be utilized to provide discovery of nearby devices to wireless beacons e.g. user device and establishment of a connection for data transfers.

The request may be specific to user device by including information that is specific to user such as a name identifier or user device identifier. The information specific to user may be determined from a user account of user or other information previously provided to crosswalk management server . Thus in certain embodiments only user device will pick up and authenticate the request. After check in module receives a user device identifier from user device check in module may determine user is in proximity to the beacon of wireless beacons connected to user device . The beacon of wireless beacons that connected to user device may pass the user device identifier to crosswalk management server using check in module . The identifier may be passed as check in information allowing crosswalk management server to determine user device is in proximity to the one or more of wireless beacons connected to user device through the connection between user device and the connected beacon of wireless beacons as will be discussed in more detail herein. As shown in wireless beacons may utilize communication module of one of wireless beacons to pass the identifier to crosswalk management server . Additionally check in module may cause wireless beacons to keep a communication channel open with user device for passing additional information between user device and crosswalk management server .

Check in module may also be utilized to request retrieve and or receive information from user device about user . For example once a connection is established between user device and one or more of wireless beacons check in module may pull receive scrape information from user device such travel routes calendar information and or personal information stored to database of user device . As previously discussed the information may include an address for a work home vacation location friend family etc. an age of user a handicap of user an average walking speed of user and or associated user travelling with user or luggage cargo carried by user including recently merchant purchases. Check in module may transmit information to user device such as traffic information street closures and or merchant advertisements offers nearby user .

In various embodiments each of wireless beacons include at least one communication module adapted to communicate with user device and or crosswalk management server . Communication module may include a DSL e.g. Digital Subscriber Line modem a PSTN Public Switched Telephone Network modem an Ethernet device a broadband device a satellite device and or various other types of wired and or wireless network communication devices including microwave radio frequency infrared Bluetooth and near field communication devices. Communication module may communicate with user device using short range communications such as radio frequency infrared Bluetooth and near field communications.

Crosswalk management server may be maintained for example by a service provider which may provide crosswalk management services. Thus crosswalk management server may be maintained by a town city entity a service provider providing services to the town city or other entity. Crosswalk management server includes one or more processing applications which may be configured to interact with user device crosswalk signal devices and or wireless beacons to provide crosswalk management services and crosswalk settings to user . Although only a single crosswalk management server is shown a plurality of crosswalk management servers and or devices may function similarly. Although crosswalk management server is described as a server device in various embodiments crosswalk management server may function as a specialized device local to or connected to crosswalk signal system . Thus in certain embodiments crosswalk management server may communicate through wired or short range wireless communication with crosswalk signal system to determine settings for crosswalk signal devices .

Crosswalk management server of includes a crosswalk management module a traffic flow module other applications a database and a communication module . Crosswalk management module traffic flow module and other applications may correspond to executable processes procedures and or applications with associated hardware. In other embodiments crosswalk management server may include additional or different hardware and software as required.

Crosswalk management module may correspond to one or more processes to execute modules and associated devices of crosswalk management server to determine one or more safety signal settings for crosswalk signal devices based on information received from wireless beacons corresponding to connections established by one or more of wireless beacons with user device . In this regard crosswalk management module may correspond to specialized hardware and or software utilized by crosswalk management server with wireless beacons to receive check in information having connections between user device and one or more of wireless beacons where the check in information may further include an identifier used for identification of user and or user device . Crosswalk management module may utilize communication module to receive the check in information and store the check in information to database in a non transitory memory of crosswalk management server . The connection s between user device and one or more of wireless beacons may further include information identifying the connected beacon s of wireless beacons that may be utilized by crosswalk management module to determine which of wireless beacons are connected to user device and the locations of those beacons. Utilizing such information with information received of the proximity areas for those beacons to connect with devices a location and or path of travel for user may be determined. For example through connections to wireless beacons a position for user may be triangulated. Further through additional connections established and ended between wireless beacons a path that user is travelling may be determined. Thus crosswalk management module may receive the connection information from wireless beacons and determine the path location using the connections between the user device and wireless beacons through one or more of the beacon s user device connected to and or triangulation of the user through the connected beacon s .

Crosswalk management module may further determine the location and or path of travel for user at the crosswalk location using information available about user from user device . Thus once user device connects to one or more of wireless beacons information about the user device may be accessed received and or retrieved by the beacon s . Such information may include a travel route of the user accessed from a map of the user or a planner of the user from a mapping planner module of user device a calendar having a schedule of the user e.g. a meeting schedule and location of the meeting from a calendar planner module of user device and or personal information about the user e.g. a home work family friend and or vacation address of the user etc. stored to database of user device or utilized by another application or module of user device . The location and or path of user may be utilized to determine if a user will attempt to cross a crosswalk the user is approaching or located at. Thus if user is for example travelling North on 1Street it can be assumed that user may wish to cross in any street intersecting 1Street while travelling North to user s destination. The scheduling calendar info nation may also be utilized to determine when to change a light such as prior to user arriving at street if user is on a tight schedule so as to assist user with arriving at a location timely and preventing user from engaging in risky behavior such as jaywalking. However if it appears that user has more time the light may cycle through as normal with user waiting for a crosswalk light to change. Weather time of day and or location may affect light cycles. For example rain late at night or in risky neighborhoods may cause a light to change and or cycle more quickly than normal. Thus crosswalk management module may access various information and parameters corresponding to a crosswalk that user is utilizing.

In addition to determining whether a user will cross a crosswalk an amount of time until the user arrives at the crosswalk to cross and an amount of time the user will spend crossing the crosswalk may be determined by crosswalk management module . The location of the user relative to arriving at the crosswalk may determine how long until the user arrives at the crosswalk. Further personal information received from user device may be processed to determine how long until the user arrives at the cross walk and how long the user will require to utilize cross the crosswalk. For example crosswalk management module may access an age of the user a handicap status of the user items and or associated users the user may be travelling with recent merchant purchases of the user transportation the user is utilizing e.g. bicycle skateboard etc. or other parameter. Such information may be processed to determine relative speed of user which may affect when user arrives at the crosswalk and or how long user will require traversing the crosswalk.

Thus once the location of the user the path of the user and or the personal information about user is determined by crosswalk management module using received information e.g. the check in information for user device connections with one or more of wireless beacons and additional information communicated to the beacon from user device the crosswalk management device server may determine a setting for one or more of crosswalk signal devices . Such setting may correspond to a change of a crosswalk light of crosswalk signal devices to allow user to traverse the crosswalk a red light of crosswalk signal devices to stop traffic travelling through the crosswalk e.g. vehicle traffic and or an amount of time for either the traffic light or the crosswalk light of crosswalk signal devices to allow the user to travel through the crosswalk. The amount of time to allow the user to travel through the crosswalk may be determined using personal information for the user such as an age handicap status and or luggage users with the user. Once the setting is determined it may be transmitted to one or more of crosswalk signal devices for execution which may utilize the setting to change the light for the user. The setting may immediately change the lights may include a countdown to change the lights at some future point or may require detection of user at the crosswalk entrance through pressure sensors and or wireless beacons .

The setting may also be adjusted based on user actions by user . For example user may be slow traversing the crosswalk and wireless beacons may still detect user in the crosswalk through user device even though crosswalk signal devices are changing or will soon change. Thus crosswalk management module may affect adjust or change the setting to account for additional time for user . In other embodiments user may correspond to a young child or pet who runs into the crosswalk without waiting for the light to change. Thus on detection of the child or pet in the crosswalk crosswalk management module and or wireless beacons detecting user in the crosswalk may cause the lights to quickly or immediately change to provide safety to the young child. Once user is detected as safely on the other side of the crosswalk e.g. through wireless beacons crosswalk management module may cause crosswalk signal devices to change in order to assist in the flow of traffic. Thus the crosswalk light may change more quickly to red than in a normal situation. However if additional users begin to arrive at the crosswalk managed using crosswalk signal devices crosswalk management module may determine whether to cause crosswalk signal device to extend their walk signal or change to don t walk red as required by the parameters of the users the crosswalk and or traffic flow through the crosswalk.

Setting may also be adjusted based on information about surround circumstances such as traffic and or street closure. Traffic flow module may correspond to one or more processes to execute modules and associated devices of crosswalk management server to access traffic flow information adjust settings of crosswalk signal devices based on traffic flow and or provide traffic flow information to a merchant. In this regard traffic flow module may correspond to specialized hardware and or software utilized by crosswalk management server with crosswalk signal devices to determine and utilize traffic flow information. Traffic flow information may be received by communication module from a third party source such as a traffic system or source e.g. a news company traffic monitoring source etc. and may correspond to flow patterns of pedestrians and or vehicles on sidewalks and or roads as well as traffic issues e.g. congestion accidents etc. and street road and or entrance exit closures e.g. for events maintenance etc. . Traffic flow information may also be determined by traffic flow module using connections between one or more communication devices e.g. user device and wireless beacons .

Traffic flow module may utilize the traffic flow information to affect settings for crosswalk signal device . Traffic flow module may route users and or vehicles to certain travel routes for example around traffic accidents congestion or to avoid street closures. Thus traffic or street closures may route the users to certain crosswalks while preventing other crosswalks or cause increased delay for certain crosswalks to alleviate vehicle traffic concerns. Traffic flow module may also monitor and track user foot traffic utilizing wireless beacons to determine traffic flows and other high traffic patterns.
