Computing devices such as smartphones laptop computers etc. can be equipped with various functionalities and capabilities. For example applications can be installed upon a computing device such as a game application enterprise application or other type of software application. Computing devices may also be equipped with one or more network interfaces that facilitate communication with other computing devices via a network.

The present disclosure is directed to enforcing proximity based policies on computing devices such as smartphones laptop computers desktop computers wearable computing devices or any other computing device. A proximity based policy in the context of the present disclosure comprises a policy whereby proximity to a certain geographic location or proximity to a particular computing device is required in order for certain functionality to be enabled in a computing device. In other words a companion device or a slave device can be required to be in proximity to an anchor device or master device in order for certain functionality to be enabled on the companion device. In some embodiments proximity or lack thereof to a companion device can also trigger the selection of a device management policy that can be imposed on or selected on behalf of the companion device.

An example of a scenario in which such a policy can be employed is the case of a parent wishing to facilitate the monitoring or metering of usage of a device by a child. For example a parent may wish to impose a policy in which a device associated with the child is able to use a browser application only when the device associated with the child is in proximity to another device that is associated with the parent. In such a scenario the parent s device can be designated as an anchor device and the child s device can be designated as a companion device. In order for a particular functionality to be enabled within the companion device embodiments of the disclosure can require proximity of the companion device to the anchor device. Proximity can be determined by a policy server that receives location indications from the anchor device and the companion device.

Such location indications can comprise geolocation data obtained from a positioning system associated with the respective devices. Such location indications can also include an indication of whether a particular device has received an acknowledgement or ping directly from the other device using a localized communication interface or a network connection. For example a localized communication interface can comprise a Bluetooth capability a near field communication NFC interface a radio frequency identification RFID read or write capability or any other localized communication interface as can be appreciated. If the devices are out of communication range via the localized communication interface one or both of the anchor device or companion device can communicate a location indication the policy server that the devices are no longer in proximity to one another.

With reference to shown is a networked environment according to various embodiments. The networked environment includes a computing environment an anchor device and a companion device which are in data communication with each other through a network . The network includes for example the Internet one or more intranets extranets wide area networks WANs local area networks LANs wired networks wireless networks other suitable networks or any combination of two or more such networks. For example such networks may comprise satellite networks cable networks Ethernet networks telephony networks and other types of networks.

The computing environment may comprise for example a server computer or any other system providing computing capability. Alternatively the computing environment may employ multiple computing devices that may be arranged for example in one or more server banks computer banks or other arrangements. Such computing devices may be located in a single installation or may be distributed among many different geographical locations. For example the computing environment may include multiple computing devices that together form a hosted computing resource a grid computing resource and or any other distributed computing arrangement. In some cases the computing environment may correspond to an elastic computing resource where the allotted capacity of processing network storage or other computing related resources may vary over time. The computing environment may also include or correspond to one or more virtualized server instances that are created in order to execute the functionality that is described herein.

Various systems and or other functionality may be executed in the computing environment according to various embodiments. Also various data is stored in a data store that is accessible to the computing environment . The data store may be representative of a plurality of data stores . The data stored in the data store for example is associated with the operation of the various systems and or functional entities described below.

A device management system and or other systems may be executed in the computing environment . The device management system may be executed to manage and or oversee the operation of multiple anchor devices and or companion devices . For example an employer may operate the device management system to ensure that the anchor devices and or companion devices of its employees are operating in compliance with various compliance rules. By ensuring that the devices of its employees are operated in compliance with the compliance rules the employer may control and protect access to various data. As another example a device manufacturer or software provider may operate the device management system and provide device management capabilities for consumers. For example a parent may wish to monitor or restrict usage of a device of a child or another user in a household. The device management system may also facilitate access to email calendar data contact information documents or other data to which an enterprise or other organization may wish to provide access by users via devices such as smartphones computing devices a device executing a browser application mobile application etc.

In one embodiment the device management system may provide a management console and or other components. The management console may facilitate operation and control of the device management system . For example the management console may generate one or more user interfaces that are rendered on a display device not shown or accessible using a browser executed by another computing device. Such user interfaces may facilitate entering commands or other information to facilitate configuration of the device management system . For example a user may configure a proximity policy using a user interface generated by the management console .

The computing environment may also execute a policy server that facilitates the management of proximity based policies on behalf of users or organizations. The policy server can obtain an indication of a location of various devices that are managed by the device management system as well as determine whether policies are in place with respect to proximity of a particular device relative to another device. The policy server can also transmit commands or a security command that specify a capability that can be enabled and or disabled in a companion device in response to detection of the proximity of a companion device to an anchor device . In some embodiments the policy server can be implemented as functionality or logic that is embedded within the device management system . In some embodiments the policy server can also be implemented as a library for which an application programming interface API is provided and with which the functionality of the policy server can be invoked by the device management system or any other application or service. Some embodiments may also include the functionality of the policy server being implemented within the anchor device or the companion device by an application executed therein.

The computing environment may also execute other applications to facilitate interactions with an anchor device or companion device such as an application distribution service that distributes applications and or updates for applications to the devices a mail server that provides email services and or functionality a document storage application that provides remote document storage capability for users or other applications or services that can be deployed to provide services for its users. Description of such applications or services is not necessary for a complete understanding of embodiments of the disclosure.

The data stored in the data store may include user account data and or other information. The user account data can include data associated with a user account such as user profile information as well as information device identifiers proximity policies and other user account data. User profile information can include information about a user s address or location permissions and or privileges with respect to usage of an enterprise device. User profile information can also include access settings such as authentication credentials delegation settings e.g. information about other users who may be provided access to the user account data of a particular user etc.

User account data can also include information about a user account within the computing environment . For example the user account may be associated with an email address or other identifier that is assigned by the computing environment . User account data can also include other account settings such as biographical or demographic information about a user password reset information multi factor authentication settings and other data related to a user account as can be appreciated. User account data can also include other forms of data associated with users of an enterprise s computing resources that are not shown such as a user s mailbox data calendar data contact data and other user data. For example mailbox data includes data associated with one or more mailboxes corresponding to a user account of a user.

The user account data may also include information regarding one or more devices that are associated with a user s account or device data . Such information can be stored as device identifiers which can comprise any information from which a particular computing device can be identified by the proxy server and or device management system . For example a device identifier may be a unique hardware identifier such as a GUID Globally Unique Identifier UUID Universally Unique Identifier UDID Unique Device Identifier serial number IMEI Internationally Mobile Equipment Identity Wi Fi MAC Media Access Control address Bluetooth MAC address a CPU ID and or the like or any combination of two or more such hardware identifiers. Accordingly a particular user account may be associated with multiple anchor devices and or companion devices for which proximity policies can be defined. Device data can also include for example the identification of the particular applications that are installed in the anchor devices and or companion devices historical data regarding the operation of the anchor devices and or companion devices and or other information.

User account data can also include proximity policies . A proximity policy can identify at least two devices associated with a particular user account. The proximity policy can identify one of the devices as an anchor device and another of the devices as a companion device . The proximity policy can further specify a policy that can be placed upon the anchor device and or the companion device when the devices are within proximity to one another. The proximity policy can also specify a different policy that can be placed upon the anchor device and or the companion device when the devices are not within proximity to one another.

The proximity policy can also define a level of proximity necessary in order for an anchor device and companion device identified by a proximity policy to be considered in proximity to one another. For example in one embodiment proximity of an anchor device to a companion device may be detected through a respective Bluetooth interface of the anchor device and companion device . Accordingly the proximity policy can specify that a periodic ping or acknowledgement must be exchanged by the devices and such a ping or acknowledgement must be associated with a minimum signal strength. As another example the proximity policy can specify that in order to be considered in proximity to one another that a ping or acknowledgement must be exchanged by the companion device and anchor device within a certain threshold time period.

The proximity policy can also specify that the anchor device and companion device be within a certain geographic distance of one another based upon geolocation data that is reported by respective positioning systems e.g. global positioning system capability . The proximity policy can also specify that the anchor device and companion device in order to be considered in proximity with one another should be associated with a common internet protocol IP address or an IP address within a certain range of one another. The proximity policy can also specify that the anchor device and companion device be connected to the same router switch or Internet gateway device in order to be considered in proximity with one another.

A proximity policy can also specify actions that should be taken in response to a determination that the anchor device and companion device identified by the proximity policy are not in proximity with one another to a degree specified by the proximity policy . For example a proximity policy can specify that if the devices are in proximity with one another then a particular application can be used or executed on the companion device but that the particular application cannot be used or executed if the devices are not in proximity. For example the proximity policy can specify that a browser application a particular game application or any other application can only be launched by the companion device when it is determined to be in proximity with the anchor device . Otherwise the particular application can be disabled.

As another example a proximity policy can specify that if an anchor device and companion device are not in proximity with one another that a hardware or software capability of the companion device should be disabled. For example the proximity rule can specify that a network capability or an ability to access a local or wide area network should be disabled. In other words the proximity rule can specify that Internet access of the companion device should be disabled. A proximity policy can specify that if the anchor device and companion device are not in proximity that a security requirement can be imposed upon the user such as locking the display of the companion device and requiring a password or personal identification number PIN to be entered in order for the companion device to be accessed by the user. As another example of security requirement one or more of various capabilities of the device can be disabled such as a camera Bluetooth interface or other capabilities of the companion device .

The anchor device and companion device are representative of multiple client devices that may be coupled to the network . The anchor device may comprise for example a processor based system such as a computer system. Such a computer system may be embodied in the form of a desktop computer a laptop computer a personal digital assistant a mobile phone e.g. a smartphone wearable computing device a set top box a music player a web pad a tablet computer system a game console an electronic book reader or any other device with like capability. The anchor device and companion device may include a display that comprises for example one or more devices such as liquid crystal display LCD displays gas plasma based flat panel displays organic light emitting diode OLED displays LCD projectors or other types of display devices.

The anchor device and companion device may be configured to execute one or more applications an agent application and or other components. An application may comprise for example one or more programs that perform various operations when executed in the anchor device or companion device . Such an operation may comprise for example storing data reading data controlling a component for an anchor device and or companion device and or other functionality. An application may perform some operations by initiating functions that are performed by an operating system in the anchor device and or companion device . An application may initiate operating system functions by for example performing API calls. An application can include any software that can be installed upon the anchor device and companion device such as a mail application a browser application a game and other types of applications.

The agent application may be executed on the anchor device and companion device to oversee monitor and or manage at least a portion of the resources for the anchor device and companion device . The agent application may be executed by the anchor device and companion device automatically upon startup of the respective device. Additionally the agent application may run as a background process in the anchor device and companion device . In other words the agent application may execute and or run without user intervention. Additionally the agent application may communicate with the device management system and policy server in order to facilitate the management of the respective devices by the policy server and or device management system . For example the agent application can enforce proximity policies that are specified for a particular anchor device and or companion device on behalf of the policy server . In one scenario the proximity policies can be stored on an anchor device or a companion device which can enforce the proximity policy by issuing a security command through the agent application in response to detecting that the companion device is no longer in proximity to the anchor device . In this scenario a proximity policy can be enforced upon an anchor device or a companion device without requiring a location indication to be provided to a policy server that is executed by the computing environment .

Next an additional description of the operation of the various components of the networked environment is provided. To begin a proximity policy can be defined that specifies a policy that can be applied to an anchor device and or companion device when the anchor device and companion device are in proximity to one another. In order to determine whether the anchor device and companion device are in proximity to one another the policy server can rely upon location indications that are received from the agent application or any other application executed by the anchor device and companion device . The agent application can be configured to periodically generate a location indication that corresponds to a location of the anchor device and or companion device respectively. The location indication can also comprise an indication of whether the anchor device and companion device are in proximity to one another irrespective of the geographic location of the anchor device and companion device .

A location indication can comprise geolocation data obtained by the agent application from a positioning system associated with the anchor device and companion device respectively. Accordingly the policy server can determine whether the anchor device and or companion device are in proximity to one another based upon whether the geolocation data reflects that the anchor device and or companion device are within a threshold distance from one another. In some embodiments the proximity policy associated with the anchor device and or companion device can also specify such a threshold distance.

A location indication can also comprise a network location of the anchor device and companion device respectively such as an IP address or IP address subnet a service set identification SSID of a wireless network to which the anchor device and companion device are respectively connected. A network location can also include any other aspects of a network interface or network connection of the anchor device and companion device respectively to the network . Accordingly the policy server can determine whether the anchor device and or companion device are in proximity to one another based upon the parameters of the network location of the anchor device and or companion device .

A location indication can also include information about whether a ping or acknowledgement sent through a localized communication interface such as Bluetooth has been sent or received to or from the anchor device and companion device respectively. The agent application can be configured to generate a ping that is transmitted from the anchor device to the companion device and vice versa. Such a ping can be answered by the anchor device and companion device by an acknowledgement. Such a ping and or acknowledgement can be transmitted by the agent application using a localized communication interface such that they can only be successfully received by the anchor device and or companion device when the devices are in proximity to one another.

Accordingly a corresponding location indication generated by the agent application can include an indication of whether a previous ping generated by the agent application executed by one of the anchor device and or companion device was acknowledged by the other device. The policy server can determine whether the anchor device and or companion device are in proximity to one another based upon whether a ping was not acknowledged by one or both of the anchor device and or the companion device . The policy server can also make this determination based upon whether a ping or acknowledgement of the anchor device and or companion device has not been received for a threshold amount of time. The policy server can also make a determination regarding proximity of the anchor device and companion device based upon a signal strength of a received acknowledgement. For example if a signal strength does not meet a signal strength threshold the policy server can determine that the anchor device and companion device are not in proximity to one another.

In some embodiments the agent application executed by the anchor device and or companion device can generate periodic transmissions that are sent to the other device using a localized communication interface. Accordingly in the event that a transmission has not been received for a threshold amount of time the agent application can generate a location indication that alerts the policy server that the device from which the transmission was expected has not been received.

In response to determining that an anchor device and companion device are in proximity or not in proximity to one another the policy server can issue a security command that instructs the agent application to apply a policy that is specified by the proximity policy associated with the anchor device and companion device . For example if the policy server determines that the anchor device and companion device are within proximity to one another based upon location indicators received from the anchor device and companion device the policy server can issue a security command to the companion device with respect a functionality that is to be either enabled or disabled within the companion device by the agent application . For example the security command can instruct the agent application of the companion device to enable access to a particular application if the anchor device and companion device are in proximity to one another.

Conversely if the policy server determines based upon the location indicators that the anchor device and companion device are no longer in proximity to one another the policy server can issue a security command to the agent application as specified by a respective proximity policy . Such a security command can include a restriction that the agent application can enforce upon the companion device or a security requirement enforced upon the companion device or the user of the companion device . In other words the security command can restrict a capability of the companion device as a result of a lack or proximity to the anchor device . For example the security command can instruct the agent application to disable a particular application installed on the companion device . The security command can also instruct the agent application to lock a display of the companion device or impose any other type of security measure. The security command can also restrict access by a user of the companion device to content that is stored on the companion device such as mail documents media or other content. Additionally the security command can restrict the ability of companion device to communicate with other devices through the network .

Should proximity to the anchor device be reestablished the policy server can issue another security command that removes a restriction or enables a particular disabled functionality of the companion device . Additionally in some embodiments the agent application executed by the anchor device can be configured to issue a security command directly to the companion device or instruct the policy server to issue a security command that enables or disables certain restrictions or functionality irrespective of proximity of the anchor device to the companion device . In other words the anchor device in some embodiments can override the policy server with respect to proximity policies .

Referring next to shown is an example of an anchor device and companion device that are in proximity to one another. Such proximity is indicated visually in by the overlapping circles and . In the scenario illustrated in the policy server can determine that the anchor device and companion device are in proximity to one another based upon location indicators and received from the anchor device and companion device . In the example shown in the policy server can determine that the anchor device and companion device are in proximity with one another and also determine whether a proximity policy is associated with the anchor device and companion device . If a proximity policy is associated with the anchor device and companion device the policy server can identify an action associated with the proximity policy and issue a security command to the companion device that enables or disables a particular restriction or capability of the companion device .

Continuing the example of reference is now made to which illustrates a scenario in which the anchor device and companion device are no longer within the prescribed proximity as defined by the proximity policy . As noted above the policy server can determine whether the anchor device and companion device are in proximity based upon location indicators and that are received from the anchor device and companion device .

Therefore referring to because the anchor device and companion device are no longer within proximity to one another as determined by the policy server the policy server can issue a security command to the companion device that comprises an action specified by a corresponding proximity policy . The proximity policy can specify a capability of the companion device that should be restricted or disabled now that the companion device is no longer in proximity to the anchor device. The proximity policy can also identify content stored on the companion device and or any other device that should be unavailable to the companion device as a result of the lack of proximity to the anchor device . Accordingly in the example of the policy server can issue a security command to the agent application executed by the companion device which can restrict or remove a capability of the companion device on behalf of the policy server .
