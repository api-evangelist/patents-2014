The present invention relates to a touch screen for a mobile device that enhances and enables use of the touch screen while it is in a surrounding of high humidity or is partially or entirely covered with water or submerged in water.

The user demands on mobile devices drive the development of touch screens to besides getting bigger and providing higher resolution to be more durable and water proof resistant. Since the display is representing most of the mechanical design it is quite significant that original equipment manufacturers OEMs are able to provide robust designs with displays that can take some hard impact and provide a rugged usability towards its users. This needs to be done without the costs of losing optical and touch performances and with a substantial industrial design maintaining a slim and integrated design appealing to the broad market.

However mobile devices that are promoted as water resistant claims to be able to provide touch detection on the display even with a small amount of water on them or at least after wiping away most of the water but the touch detection is still quite poor.

EP 2 464 099 discloses an electronic apparatus comprising liquid detection on the surface of a display in order to turn off the entire display or the part of the display that is covered with water.

There is therefore a need for a touch detection system that allows the entire touch screen to be used while it is in a surrounding of high humidity or partially or entirely covered with water or while submerged in water and that maintains the touch resolution of the capacitive touch screen while no water or only a partial covering of water is present on the touch screen without adding any additional build height.

With the above description in mind then an aspect of the present invention is to provide a touch screen for a mobile device that can be used while partially or entirely covered with water or submerged in water which seek to mitigate alleviate or eliminate one or more of the above identified deficiencies in the art and disadvantages singly or in any combination.

These and further objects are achieved by a method for controlling an input mode of a touch screen for an electronic device comprising at least one condition detection system. The method comprises the steps of monitoring humidity in the surrounding of the electronic device by means of the condition detection system determining based on the monitored humidity in relation to predetermined values if a first input mode using only capacitive sensing for the touch screen is to be used or if a second input mode using only Z force sensing for the touch screen is to be used for pressure detection or if a third input mode being a combination of the first and second input modes for the touch screen is to be used and using the determined input mode for the touch screen. By providing a method for controlling the input mode of a touch screen based on the surrounding humidity conditions a simple and efficient way of ensuring touch functionality in any humidity condition is provided by fast dynamic and automatic control of suitable input mode to be used for the touch screen making it easier for the user to operate the electronic device.

It should be added that the following description of the embodiments is for illustration purposes only and should not be interpreted as limiting the disclosure exclusively to these embodiments aspects.

Embodiments of the present invention will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings in which embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may however be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like reference signs refer to like elements throughout.

Embodiments of the present invention will be exemplified using a mobile communication device such as a mobile phone. However it should be appreciated that the invention is as such equally applicable to electronic devices which have touch detection capabilities. Examples of such devices may for instance be any type of mobile phone laptop such as standard ultra portables netbooks and micro laptops handheld computers portable digital assistants tablet computers gaming devices accessories to mobile phones etc. However for the sake of clarity and simplicity the embodiments outlined in this specification are exemplified with and related to mobile phones only.

The electronic device comprises a humidity condition handling and processing unit that may be constituted by any suitable Central Processing Unit CPU microcontroller Digital Signal Processor DSP etc. capable of executing computer program code for evaluating and comparing signals indicating humidity levels in the surrounding of the electronic device and altering the input mode of the electronic device . A software humidity state handler may be implemented utilizing the humidity condition handling and processing unit for determination and switching between different input modes. The electronic device further comprises a memory that can be used for storing computer program code old humidity values and threshold humidity values etc. The memory can be any combination of a Read and write Memory RAM and a Read Only Memory ROM. The memory may also comprise persistent storage which for example can be any single one or combination of magnetic memory optical memory or solid state memory or even remotely mounted memory. The electronic device also comprises components required for its operation e.g. a battery not shown but these components are not explained further as this is common knowledge for a skilled person.

The electronic device also comprises a touch screen that is an integrated combination of two separate touch detection systems one being a capacitive touch detection system and the other being a z force touch detection system capable of registering pressure and or touch position on the touch screen . The z force touch detection system is here illustrated as a plurality of pressure sensors arranged along the periphery of the touch screen but it should also be understood that the z force touch detection system can be constituted by a single pressure sensor a plurality of pressure sensors arranged according to a different pattern a pressure sensitive film etc. The functionalities of pressure sensors and positioning of input using pressure sensors is know in the art and will not be described in further detail.

The electronic device may further comprise a separate humidity sensor arranged to measure humidity in the surrounding of the device. The humidity sensor may in a preferred embodiment be a capacitive humidity sensor e.g. implemented by the touch screen itself. The humidity sensor is capable of measuring relative humidity in the range of 0 to 100 relative humidity with a reading rate of at least reading per second. There is a possibility of also detecting water on the display through the capacitive touch detection system but this could only be used for detecting abnormal signal areas caused by water and not provide a linear water percentage detection.

In a further embodiment both the capacitive touch driver and the z force driver can be active simultaneously for achieving a higher reliability while operating in conditions where the probability of a false input e.g. a water drop on the touch screen is high. In such an embodiment the z force touch detection system can be used to validate a touch input on the more accurate capacitive touch detection system by both systems reporting a detected finger position and using real time comparison of the positions registered by the respective system to ensure that the correct position is reported to the touch event handler .

Hence any X and Y positioning of where on the touch screen the input is done is improved and more accurate by the inventive device being able to switch to a more suitable input mode depending on the humid conditions around the electronic device by itself.

This detection of signals by means of the touch screen is done by profiling of water droplet patterns indicating presence of water on the touch screen in different amounts volumes and or patterns on the screen. This detection of signals generated by water by the touch screen and its associated circuitry being the condition detection system and the capacitive touch detection system and stored predefined water amounts volumes and or patterns may be done by probability calculations and comparing finger patterns with different water patterns water volumes and or water amounts on the screen. One example of such signal detection is embodied by defining an area of a finger touching the screen e.g. defining that a finger is not larger than 1 1 cm or 2 2 cm or the like wherefore any detected signals indicating a touching area being larger than that is not a finger. Moreover flowing water and or droplets are also easily detectable due to generated signals indicating an increasing area and or a changing touching area which would not be a finger with a constant touch area.

As a further embodiment manual selection of a preferred input mode being capacitive touch detection or z force touch detection alone or in combination that overruns the automatic selection is possible.

As an additional embodiment the invention could also utilize a barometric pressure sensor in the electronic device in order to keep track of critical depth levels under water and notifying the user prior to damage and or make sure to shut down the electronic device as a system rescue attempt.

The electronic device also comprises a capacitive touch integrated circuit physically connected to a traditional conductive indium tin oxide layer which handles capacitive touch detection on the display i.e. the touch screen and reports finger positions.

The electronic device also comprises a z force integrated circuit physically connected to a pressure sensing frame or similar which detects applied pressure on the touch screen and also is able to extract a finger position.

The electronic device also comprises a relative humidity integrated circuit that typically incorporates a sensing element i.e. a humidity sensor which needs to be mounted on the electronic device with a surface or opening exposed towards its surrounding so that it can detect the ambient humidity.

The first step S of the method in is to monitor humidity in the surrounding of the electronic device by means of the condition detection system preferably measuring a relative humidity in the surrounding of the electronic device . Retrieval of humidity values is performed at a preferred rate of 4 Hz however the rate can be varied depending on if the electronic device is in sleep mode or low in battery etc.

The second step S in is determining a preferred input mode based on the monitored humidity in relation to predetermined values. The humidity can be compared and evaluated on the basis of the relative humidity and the current change rate of the relative humidity. A high change rate could indicate that the electronic device has been submerged or retrieved from water indicating a need for a switch in input mode I II III. The monitored humidity conditions is evaluated to determine if a first input mode I using only capacitive sensing for the touch screen is to be used or if a second input mode II using only Z force sensing for the touch screen is to be used for pressure detection or if a third input mode III being a combination of the first and second input modes for the touch screen is to be used.

The input signals from the touch screen are affected by the humidity in the surrounding of the electronic device indicating the level of humidity in the surrounding of the electronic device whereby the determination of the humidity according to the invention is done by analyzing the distortion effect caused by the surrounding humidity. Hence too much distortion means that the current input mode of the touch screen is automatically switched to another input mode or if the distortion is not as high as predetermined the input mode of the touch screen is maintained.

The third step S in is to use the determined input mode I II III for the touch screen by allowing the humidity state handler to activate the required touch input drivers.

The first step S of the method is to monitor humidity in the surrounding of the electronic device by means of the condition detection system .

The second step S is to calculate the current humidity level change rate by comparing the current humidity level with stored humidity level values from the memory .

The third step S is to compare the current humidity level change rate with the change rate threshold values. The threshold values describe an allowed increase rate or decrease rate that is allowed before switching the input mode. A rapid increase in humidity level can e.g. indicate that the electronic device is suddenly submerged in water and thereby request a switch in input mode to the z force touch detection system. An increase or decrease in humidity in excess of 100 s is a preferred change rate threshold value for switching input mode.

The fourth step S is to compare the current humidity level with humidity level threshold values stored in the memory. A high humidity level could be an indicator that a switch of input mode from the capacitive touch detection system to the z force touch detection system is necessary. A preferred threshold value for when switching may be performed from capacitive touch detection to z force touch detection is when the relative humidity is equal to or greater than 100 . During humidity levels below 100 i.e. between 0 99 the capacitive touch detections system may be used. However other threshold values may also be applied according to sensitivity settings user preferences etc.

The fifth step S is to store the current humidity value together with system time to enable calculation of humidity change rate and deletion of a humidity value older than a predetermined value to ensure that the memory does not get overloaded.

The sixth step S is to determine based on the current humidity value humidity value change rate and the respective threshold values if a change in input mode is required.

The seventh and eighth step S and S is to switch the input mode by allowing the humidity state handler to activate the required touch driver or to maintain the current input mode.

The first step S is to monitor the humidity in the surrounding of the electronic device by means of the condition detection system .

The second step S is to compare the current humidity level with humidity level threshold values stored in the memory.

The third step S is to determine based on the current humidity value and humidity threshold value if a change in input mode is required.

The fourth and fifth step S and S is to switch the input mode by allowing the humidity state handler to activate the required touch driver or to maintain the current input mode.

The first step of S is to monitor the humidity in the surrounding of the electronic device by means of the condition detection system .

The second step of S is to calculate the current humidity level change rate by comparing the current humidity level with stored humidity level values from the memory .

The third step S is to compare the current humidity level change rate with the change rate threshold values stored in the memory .

The fourth step S is to determine based on the current humidity value change rate and the humidity value change rate threshold value if a change in input mode is required.

The fifth and sixth step S and S is to switch the input mode by allowing the humidity state handler to activate the required touch driver or to maintain the current input mode.

The first step of S is to monitor the humidity and or water in the surrounding of the electronic device by means of the condition detection system .

The second step of S is to compare the current water pattern volume amount on the touch screen with the water pattern volume amount values stored in the memory .

The third step of S is to determine based on the current pattern volume amount on the touch screen and stored values if a change in input mode is required.

The fourth and fifth step of S and S is to switch the input mode by allowing the humidity and water wetness state handler to activate the required touch driver or to maintain the current input mode.

This detection of signals by means of the touch screen is done by profiling of water droplet patterns indicating presence of water on the touch screen in different amounts volumes and or patterns and or with changing areas and directions when water flows over and on the screen. This detection of signals generated by water by the touch screen and its associated circuitry and stored predefined water amounts volumes and or patterns and their change rates e.g. when water flows over the touch screen may be done by probability calculations and comparing finger patterns with different water patterns water volumes and or water amounts on the screen to improve positioning of where on the touch screen the input is done and make the positioning more accurate by the inventive device. This signal detection of the touch screen may be utilized separately and in combination with the separate detection of signals that further enhance the switching making the switching seamless to the user and improving the switching to a more suitable input mode depending on the humid and wet conditions around the electronic device by itself.
