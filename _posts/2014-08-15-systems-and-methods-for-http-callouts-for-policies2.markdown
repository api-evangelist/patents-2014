This application is a continuation of and claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. non provisional application Ser. No. 12 277 759 entitled Systems and Methods For HTTP Callouts For Policies and filed on Nov. 25 2008 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

The present application generally relates to data communication networks. In particular the present application relates to systems and methods for providing an intermediary to determine an action of a policy using a request and a response specified by the policy.

In a networking environment users of client devices typically seek access to one or more network services of a plurality of servers. To manage network traffic bandwidth and connectivity between a client device and the plurality of servers such as for improving system administration intermediaries such as network appliances proxy servers routers or gateways may apply policies that direct actions on the user s access from a client device. In conventional systems such policies are typically static and driven by a fixed configuration.

The present solution provides systems and methods for incorporating and leveraging a request and response mechanism in a policy. This request and response may be referred to as a Callout Rule of the Policy and in the embodiments of an HTTP request and HTTP response may be referred to as an HTTP callout rule. An HTTP Callout provides a policy expression that can generated and send a specified or configurable HTTP request wait for the response and then parse and evaluate the response to produce a result. The result may be used like other policy expression evaluation results of a policy engine. As such the evaluation of a response from a request may be used to determine a condition or action of a policy. In the case of the intermediary the intermediary may apply an action on any network packet based on the evaluated result of the response from a requested generated and sent responsive to callout expression of the policy.

In one aspect the present invention relates to a method of using by an intermediary a policy having a callout rule. An intermediary receives communications between a client and one or more servers. A method for using a request and a response specified by a policy to determine an action of the policy includes identifying by the intermediary a policy for a communication between a client and one or more servers. The policy can specify a request and a server to communicate the request. Responsive to the policy the intermediary may transmit the request to the server specified by the policy. Based on the server response corresponding to the response the intermediary can determine an action of the policy.

In one embodiment the policy specifies a type of HyperText Transfer Protocol HTTP request. The policy may specify an expression for generating one of a host header or a portion of a uniform resource locator URL for the request. Further the policy may specify an internet protocol address domain name or port for the server. The policy may also specify a header name or header value for the request. The policy can specify a type of value to be received by the response. A parameter name or parameter value for the request may also be specified.

In some embodiments the intermediary generates the request as specified by one or more expressions of the policy. The intermediary may validate the generated request. An action of the policy can be determined by the intermediary from evaluating an expression based on content of the response.

In another aspect a system for using a request and a response specified by a policy to determine an action of the policy includes a policy engine. The policy engine may identify a policy. The policy can specify a request and a server to communicate the request. Further the system may include an intermediary receiving a communication between a client and one or more servers. Responsive to the policy transmitting the request specified by the policy to the server specified by the policy the intermediary can determine an action of the policy based on a server response corresponding to the request specified by the policy.

Further the policy may be configured via any type or form of interface locally on the network device executing the policy or remotely across the network such as at a client device . For example the policy may be configured via any of the CLI shell service or GUI as described herein such as in connection with .

The policy may comprise any type and form of attributes for specifying configuring or otherwise directing the operation and functionality of a callout or callout rule An attribute may be provided by an administrator or determined from an incoming network packet to the intermediary . A default set of attributes may also be provided and stored in the intermediary or configured within the policy . The intermediary or any other network element may provide storage such as memory main memory and storage described above in connection with for storing the one or more of the attributes and or callout rules . A combination of one or more attributes from an administrator an incoming network packet and the default set of attributes can be used to configure a request based on the at least one callout rule . Attribute values may be of any data type such as text numeral or Boolean. An attribute specified as an expression may be evaluated by the callout module into a value before using the value to generate a request . In other embodiments an attribute specified as an expression may be included in a request to be evaluated at a destination of the request .

The attributes may include any type or form of information or expressions. Expressions may be constructed using any programming scripting or expressive language which may be commercial proprietary open source or otherwise. For example in some embodiments CITRIX Policy Infrastructure PI expressions may be used to specify an attribute . Support for any particular version of a language may be updated by software and or hardware changes in the intermediary . In some embodiments one type of PI expression may be supported by some policies but not by others. For example asynchronous PI expressions may be supported by some policies .

An attribute may specify configure or any identify any portion of the request to be generated by the callout function. For example one or more attributes may specify define or configure a format command instruction header body parameter data value type version or protocol for generating the request. One or more attributes may also specify any authentication authorization and auditing configuration or information for generating and or transmitting the request. In some embodiments the attribute may identify a destination node such as a server to transmit the request to. The destination may be any network node connected to the network or any vserver provided by the intermediary or another network node. An attribute may specify an internet protocol address a domain name or a port of the destination node receiving the request . An attribute may also specify a header name or a header value for the request . A header name can be a string of any data type and has a corresponding header value. An attribute may also specify a vserver as a destination for directing a request . Further an attribute may specify at least a portion of a uniform resource locator URL for a HTTP type request . In some embodiments an attribute may specify an expression for generating any portion of the above destination values. PI expressions of any complexity may be used to generate any portion of the above destination values. For example an attribute may specify an expression for generating a host header or a portion of a URL for the request . Any combination of the above attributes may be used to specify a destination for a request .

In an embodiments of an HTTP callout an attribute may specify an HTTP submission method such as a GET method and a POST method. For example a GET method may be used if the HTTP form processing is idempotent or purely represents a query. A POST method may be used where there is at least one of a data retrieval storage or update.

An attribute may specify one of a parameter name or parameter value for the request . A parameter name or value may be included in a callout request . Each parameter name may have a corresponding parameter value. For example in a HTTP callout a parameter name may be included in a URL request if the request is specified with a GET method. In another example a parameter name may be included in the body of the request if the request is specified with a POST method. A parameter name may be a string of any data type. The order in which the parameter names are inserted into the request may or may not affect the callout response . Further parameter values can be evaluated from policy expressions of any complexity. A parameter value in an embodiment of an HTTP callout request may also be encoded encrypted or obfuscated.

A user may specify a type of HyperText Transfer Protocol HTTP protocol when configuring the policy to be used for communicating a request and a response . Protocols supported may include simple HTTP or Hypertext Transfer Protocol over Secure Socket Layer HTTPS . Instead of Secure Socket Layer SSL Transport Layer Security TLS may be used in HTTPS. HTTPS transactions may be used when sending sensitive data like authentication information. In such cases a HTTP vserver can be used as a front end system to the HTTPS communications and a SSL backend used to communicate with the destination node. As described above an attribute may specify a vserver for directing a HTTP type request . For example in an embodiment of a CITRIX NETSCALER environment a vServer may be added using the add lb cs cr vserver command.

An attribute may specify configure or identify any portion of the response for evaluation by the callout function or response evaluator. In some embodiments an attribute may specify an expected content code or value to be received from a successful response. In some embodiments an attribute may specify a name location or identifier of data value or content for which to evaluate the response. An attribute may specify any error codes or error messages that may occur via the response or included in the response. An attribute may specify a timeout period for waiting for a response. An attribute may specify any security or authentication information for authenticating and or authorizing a response.

A callout may support a response comprising variables in policy expressions where variable values may be stored and retrieved for later use. A callout may also have a parameter value hard coded as a constant value but not stored in which case a second callout may be required to get the parameter value at a later instant. For example in some embodiments policy expressions in a HTTP callout may have hard coded parameter values to be hard coded. In one embodiment a userid value is retrieved from a first HTTP callout and at another instant when the userid value is desired again a second HTTP callout is used to retrieve the userid value a second time.

One embodiment of an HTTP callout policy can be configured using a command in a CLI shell service or GUI of the following form to add the policy 

For example add policy httpCallout auth call may add an HTTP callout policy with a default behavior. The http callout name can be any valid entity name and may be used in the SYS.HTTP CALLOUT PI expression e.g. SYS.HTTP CALLOUT auth call . A default HTTP Callout configured in this manner may for example use a GET HTTP method in a request . In the event of an invalidly specified entity name or in any other failure scenario the SYS.HTTP CALLOUT PI expression may raise an undefined UNDEF event for handling by according to the policy .

A default HTTP Callout request may include any type and form of header information such as HTTP header information. Attributes for the policy may be specified to configure the policy or to modify the policy from a default behavior. For example a user may specify additional header names or values to override the standard header information. As an illustration attributes may be specified for a httpCallout policy using the following embodiment of command syntax 

The intermediary may via the callout function generate a request as specified by one or more expressions of the policy . For examples the one or more expressions may be specified as arguments to the fullReqExpr command line switch. If the one or more expressions are specified all other arguments or attributes may be ignored or may not be specified. In one embodiment it is a user s responsibility to configure the policy to generate a valid request when a full request expression is specified the system may not perform any validity checks. In another embodiment the intermediary may send a default request and evaluate a response to the request to check for validity. A user may also set the intermediary to validate a generated request for example by setting a variable ns hc validate request to 1 

A request may be generated responsive to communications between a client device and a plurality of servers e.g. a packet or message intercepted by the intermediary . Instead of processing the packets and routing the packets to the one or more servers the callout policy may generate a request to solicit for a response before determining an action . A request may also be generated responsive to an administrative action e.g. polling servers for load balancing purposes. Responsive to receiving a request from the callout function a network node such as the server may generate a response . The response is received by the callout function and may include any type or form of information such as a text string a numeral or a Boolean value or expression.

A response evaluation module in the callout function may perform a plurality of processing steps on a received response to a request . The response evaluation module may uncompress a packet representing the response . The response evaluation module may also decode data that is encoded in the response. For a HTTP type response message the response evaluation module may parse the message to extract a returned value or expression. Further a result may be determined from the returned value or expression by applying an expression such as a PI expression on the value or expression. An administrator can configure a PI expression to evaluate the result of a returned value or expression e.g. in the argument to the resultExpr command line switch mentioned above and described further below. Based on the one or more callout rules provided by the policy an action is identified from the result. Thus the intermediary determines via the response evaluation module the action of the policy from evaluating an expression based on content of the response . An identified action may include any number of process steps. The result may be cached for later processing or the identified action sent to a queue for processing or acted on immediately by the intermediary .

An attribute specified in association with the policy may identify a data type for the value or expression returned by a response to a request . In one embodiment the attribute is specified as an argument to the return type command line switch. Valid data types may include text numeral or Boolean. The data type of the PI expression specified in the resultExpr argument should match the return type argument specified in the set policy command Asynchronous PI expressions may be specified in the resultExpr argument. The data type can control how a SYS.HTTP CALLOUT PI expression may be extended in evaluating a result to identify an action. For example if the return type is text the following extension is valid SYS.HTTP CALLOUT auth call .CONTAINS foobar if the return type is numeral the following extension is valid 

A user may access a number of statistics associated with a configured callout policy . One or more of these statistics may be accessible via the CLI shell service or GUI . For example the following command provides counters for HTTP service callouts 

Referring now to a flow diagram depicting an embodiment of steps of a method for using by an intermediary a request and a response specified by a policy to determine an action is shown. In brief overview at step a user configures a policy and specifies attributes for a request including a server to receive the request.
