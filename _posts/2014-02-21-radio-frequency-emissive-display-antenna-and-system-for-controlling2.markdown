title: Radio frequency emissive display antenna and system for controlling
abstract: Apparatus and method improving the performance and allowing increased directionality and bandwidth via display-like software defined antenna. A surface is composed of an array of interconnected pixels which are capable of either becoming conducting or resistive allowing arbitrarily sized and shaped antenna structures. Each pixel is controlled by biasing the base which alters the conductivity on the top portion of the pixel. The specific pattern which is active on the display style antenna is based on the desired direction, frequency range, and waveform necessary for a required transmit and receive function.

This patent application claims the priority benefit of the filing date of provisional application Ser. No. 61 927 066 having been filed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office on Jan. 14 2014 and now incorporated by reference herein.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon.

This invention relates generally to software definable antennas capable of functioning across a wide range of frequency ranges and environmental conditions.

That there is a need for a software defined antenna system to pair with the growth in software based radios is well known across both government and industry. Efforts have been started through both public agencies such as DARPA as well as private corporate entities. In order to gain the full benefit of these novel radios flexible antenna hardware is urgently in need.

It is desirable to provide geometrically flexible antenna hardware capable of functioning efficiently across a broad range of frequencies signal types and environmental conditions.

An optimal solution to the problem of building communications hardware that is functional across a wide bandwidth with variable power transmit and receive and capable of functioning in degraded or cluttered environments is a maximally adaptive radio system. The prior art has embarked upon a quest to engineer this very approach but while it has succeeded in building a software defined thus highly adaptive radio it has failed to generate an antenna system which would allow the software radio to function to its full potential. Specifically the prior art still utilizes such standard hardware as patch antennas and as such the prior art forms are still unable to gain full usage from these novel software defined radio systems. Additionally the majority of the explorations into the field of reconfigurable antennas have been in one or two forms either a short antenna which can be connected to a longer antenna section via a switch see U.S. Pat. No. 6 195 065 B1 or narrow bandwidth antennas at the lower end of the size and power scale leaving unaddressed the needs of larger higher power applications.

The other background from which the motivation for this invention is drawn is nonemissive display technology as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 930 026 and utilized in several electronic book systems. These displays utilize electrically charged ink with opposite charges and different colors suspended in spheres of fluid. When an electrode beneath the sphere becomes positively or negatively charged it draws a specific color of ink to the bottom of the sphere while forcing the other color to the top. In this way each sphere becomes a pixel on the display controlled by the matrix of electrodes set beneath the spheres. While these displays are quite effective at visible wavelengths they are all completely ineffective at interfering with longer wavelength radio frequencies as used in communications antennas.

It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus that overcomes the prior art s dependency in reconfigurable antenna systems to perform precise on the fly geometrical alterations to the antenna.

It is a further object of the present invention to provide display type antennas capable of being any flat antenna system capable of taking on arbitrary two dimensional geometries analogous to optical class emissive and nonemissive displays.

It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide the capability of increasing the signal to noise ratio of received signals the directionality of both transmit and receive communications and broadening the functional bandwidth of the antenna in dynamically changing interference environments by adapting the antenna electrical geometry in real time to maximize these capabilities.

It is still a further object of the present invention to provide novel means to selectively switch individual antenna radiating pixels into and out of a radio frequency radiating or receiving mode.

Briefly stated the present invention a radio frequency emissive display antenna and system for controlling it provides an apparatus for improving the performance and allowing increased directionality and bandwidth via display like software defined antenna. A surface is composed of an array of interconnected pixels which are capable of either becoming conducting or resistive allowing arbitrarily sized and shaped antenna structures. Each pixel is controlled by biasing the base which alters the conductivity on the top portion of the pixel. The specific pattern which is active on the display style antenna is based on the desired direction frequency range and waveform necessary for a required transmit and receive function.

The present invention a Radio Frequency Emissive Display RFED and system for controlling it comprises in its preferred embodiment an array of addressable pixels with microwires connecting the top of each pixel as seen in with a control mechanism. A key feature is that when a pixel is switched it becomes a conductive connection between the wires attached to the top of the pixel.

In a preferred embodiment of the present invention an electronically directed antenna apparatus comprises an antenna having an array of radiating pixels each capable of being switched between conductive and resistive states so as to permit and inhibit radio frequency radiation respectively therefrom as well as an antenna control subsystem that cooperates with the antenna a radio frequency source and a data source to enable switching of the pixels.

In the preferred embodiment the radiating pixels comprise a pixel a biasing element and a column comprising a switching element where the biasing element receives control signals and transmits state signals to the antenna control subsystem.

In alternate embodiments the radiating pixels replace the biasing element with alternative means for switching the pixel into a conductive state.

The present invention is capable of an extremely wide range of antenna geometries and on the fly signal maximization and has the flexibility for use in highly mobile applications where weight is a major factor. It would be most apt for applications requiring flat profile quick response directionality and multi band capability as in high performance military aircraft for example. The dynamic capabilities of the present invention would enhance mitigation of atmospheric and environmental signal distortions and degradations while providing a high degree of angular directivity. Additionally the present invention could be layered and if properly controlled in parallel would yield three dimensional although still flat surfaced antenna geometries.

There are a variety of possible embodiments of the present invention most having to do with the mechanism for activation of each pixel once selected for conductivity. In non emissive displays the switching system relies on charged ink which moves to the bottom and top of each pixel see above mentioned patent . The emissive display proposed here must function quite differently to produce a conductive surface with similar responsiveness as its non emissive counterpart.

The above and other objects features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which like reference numerals designate the same elements.

Having described preferred embodiments of the invention with reference to the accompanying drawings it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to those precise embodiments and that various changes and modifications may be effected therein by one skilled in the art without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention as defined in the appended claims.
