A mobile terminal described herein may refer to a mobile device such as a personal digital assistant PDA a smartphone a mobile phone a tablet personal computer PC and a pad type computer that is carried by a user and equipped with a communication function.

Referring to in operation the mobile terminal receives a security level of a predetermined or defined location from a security control server. The mobile terminal may receive the security level from the security control server through a security application for example of a mobile terminal control system client installed in the mobile terminal. The security level may be newly received from the security control server every time the location information about the mobile terminal is determined to correspond to the predetermined location. Alternatively the security level may be information received from the security control server in advance and stored in the mobile terminal. When the security level is updated the security control server may transmit a new security level to the mobile terminal and allow the security level stored in the mobile terminal to be updated. The security level may further include version information or information about a date at which most recent update is achieved and thus a most recently updated security level may be reflected and implemented.

The security level may be set based on one or more of gate access information indicating a user of the mobile terminal entering or exiting a gate global positioning system GPS information about the mobile terminal and an identifier ID of a wireless network apparatus scanned in the mobile terminal.

The security level may have a defined level such as high security entry preferred exit preferred or low security. 

High security may refer to a security level to which a predetermined security policy is applied when a location of the mobile terminal obtained based on any one of the gate access information the GPS information or the ID corresponds to a predetermined location. When the security level is high security the security policy may be immediately applied when the mobile terminal receives the gate access information indicating an entry from the security control server. In this scenario the mobile terminal does not need to obtain the GPS information or the ID. When the security policy is applied while the security level is high security at least one function of the mobile terminal may be restricted in accordance with the security policy.

The entry preferred security level may refer to a security level to which a predetermined security policy is applied when the gate access information transmitted from the security control server to the mobile terminal indicates an exit and a location of the mobile terminal obtained based on the GPS information about the mobile terminal and the wireless network ID scanned in the mobile terminal corresponds to the predetermined location. The security policy may be immediately applied when the mobile terminal receives the gate access information indicating an entry from the security control server. In this scenario the mobile terminal does not need to obtain the GPS information about the mobile terminal or the wireless network ID. When the security policy is applied while the security level is entry preferred at least one function of the mobile terminal may be restricted in accordance with the security policy.

The exit preferred security level may refer to a security level to which a security policy is applied when the gate access information indicates an entry and a location of the mobile terminal obtained based on any one of the GPS information about the mobile terminal and the wireless network ID corresponds to the predetermined location. This security policy may be immediately cancelled when the mobile terminal receives the gate access information indicating an exit from the security control server. When the security policy is applied at the security level of the exit preferred at least one function of the mobile terminal may be restricted in accordance with the security policy.

Low security may refer to a security level to which a security policy is applied when a location of the mobile terminal obtained based on the gate access information the GPS information and the ID corresponds to the predetermined location. The low security level may be set in an area that may not require a relatively high level of security. The foregoing security levels will be described in more detail with later reference to .

Referring still to in operation the location information about the mobile terminal is obtained based on the security level. Here location determining logics used to obtain the location information about the mobile terminal include the gate access information indicating the user of the mobile terminal is entering or exiting the gate the GPS information about the mobile terminal and the ID for example a service set ID SSID of the wireless network apparatus scanned by the mobile terminal.

The gate access information may be obtained from the security control server when the user of the mobile terminal enters or exits the gate. The method of controlling the mobile terminal may be performed through a security application installed in the mobile terminal.

The gate access information may be obtained through interworking between an access control system of a workplace and a mobile terminal control system. The security control server may include the access control system and the mobile terminal control system. More particularly the access control system may detect whether the user of the mobile terminal enters or exits the gate. The user may pass through the access control system by allowing a radio frequency identification RFID card and the like to approach the access control system in a non contact manner. In this scenario the access control system may transmit the gate access information to the mobile terminal of the user identified by the RFID card through the mobile terminal control system. Thus the access control system may identify a party entering the gate trace a location and time at which the party enters and form and manage a database DB on details obtained by the tracing.

The gate access information may be transmitted to the mobile terminal through pushing. When the gate access information is transmitted to the mobile terminal the security application for example of a mobile terminal control system client installed in the mobile terminal may determine whether the user of the mobile terminal enters or exits the workplace. Here the access control system may manage a state of access to an area. The security application or the mobile terminal control system client may be installed in the mobile terminal of the user entering the area. The security application may be designed not to be arbitrarily deleted or stopped by the user but permanently operate in a background while power of the mobile terminal is maintained in an on state.

As for the location information about the mobile terminal the GPS information may include assisted GPS A GPS information. When the location information is obtained using the GPS information the security application of the mobile terminal may determine whether the location information corresponds to the predetermined location.

As for the location information about the mobile terminal the ID of the wireless network apparatus may be used for the mobile terminal to determine whether the mobile terminal is located in an area that is whether the location information corresponds to the predetermined location by scanning at least one wireless network apparatus located in the area and comparing the ID of the scanned wireless network apparatus to an ID list of the at least one wireless network apparatus located in the area. The wireless network apparatus may be for example an access point AP and the ID may include an SSID. For example when an AP having an SSID of AAA is located in area A to which a security policy is to be applied the security control server may transmit to the security application of the mobile terminal the ID list including the SSID of AAA of a wireless network apparatus to which the security policy is applied. Here when the mobile terminal is located in area A and the SSID of AAA of the AP is detected by scanning the AP in area A the security policy may be applied to the mobile terminal.

Operation determines whether the mobile terminal is at the predetermined location using for example the location information of the mobile terminal.

In operation when the mobile terminal is determined to be at the predetermined location a predetermined security policy is applied based on the security level. The mobile terminal may store the security level received from the security control server. When the mobile terminal is determined to be at the predetermined location a function of the mobile terminal may be restricted by applying the predetermined security policy based on the stored security level. Also when the mobile terminal is determined to be at the predetermined location the security application may transmit to the security control server an update request for the security level and the mobile terminal may receive the updated security level from the security control server. The security application installed in the mobile terminal may restrict a function of the mobile terminal by applying the predetermined security policy based on the updated security level.

Examples of functions of the mobile terminal include WiFi Bluetooth tethering camera microphone external memory access control screen capture and the like.

The ID list of the wireless network apparatuses installed at the predetermined location may be received from the security control server. The ID list of the wireless network apparatus may be obtained prior to obtaining the location information on the mobile terminal. Also in operation the mobile terminal compares the ID of the wireless network apparatus scanned by the mobile terminal to the ID list of the wireless network apparatuses. The ID list of the wireless network apparatuses may refer to a list of IDs of wireless network apparatuses present in an area for example a workplace. The ID list of the wireless network apparatuses may include an ID of at least one wireless network apparatus and location information about a location at which the wireless network apparatus is located.

A location of the mobile terminal may be obtained based on gate access information. For example an access control system may detect a user of the mobile terminal entering an access gate . When the user of the mobile terminal passes through the access gate and enters an area the gate access information may indicate an entry. The location of the user of the mobile terminal may thus be defined as the entered area for example a workplace.

Alternatively or additionally the location of the mobile terminal may be obtained based on GPS information. For example when the GPS information obtained by the mobile terminal is within a predetermined location for example a GPS coverage area the location of the user of the mobile terminal may be defined as the predetermined location for example a workplace.

Further the location of the mobile terminal may also be obtained based on an ID of a wireless network apparatus scanned in the mobile terminal. For example when the ID of the wireless network apparatus scanned in the mobile terminal matches any one of SSID 1 SSID 2 an SSID 3 in an ID list of wireless network apparatuses the location of the mobile terminal may be defined as the corresponding area for example a workplace.

Referring to in operation an access control system detects whether a user of the mobile terminal enters a gate. When the user of the mobile terminal enters the gate during a normal scenario the gate access information may indicate an entry and a location of the user of the mobile terminal may be determined to be the workplace. Here the mobile terminal does not need to obtain the GPS information or scan the ID of a wireless network apparatus. In operation when the location of the mobile terminal is determined to be in the workplace a security policy corresponding to the high security may be applied. When the security policy is applied at least one function of the mobile terminal may be restricted.

When the user of the mobile terminal passes through the gate abnormally for example without an RFID card the gate access information may indicate an exit. In this scenario the user may enter the workplace with the mobile terminal carried by the user and the mobile terminal may obtain the GPS information and the ID of the wireless network apparatus by scanning connectable wireless network apparatuses. When the GPS information obtained in the mobile terminal corresponds to a predetermined GPS coverage area for example in the workplace the location of the mobile terminal may be defined as that of the workplace. Also the mobile terminal may scan a connectable wireless network apparatus to obtain an ID of the wireless network apparatus. When the obtained ID corresponds to an ID included in the ID list of wireless network apparatuses stored in a security application the location of the mobile terminal may be defined as being in the workplace. When the location of the mobile terminal is determined to be in the workplace based on any one of the GPS information or the wireless network ID although the user passes through the gate abnormally a predetermined security policy may be applied to the mobile terminal.

In operation when the user of the mobile terminal exits the gate normally the mobile terminal may determine whether the GPS location is at a predetermined location. Here the predetermined location may refer to a GPS coverage area set in a security control server. A security application installed in the mobile terminal may determine whether the mobile terminal is at the predetermined location based on the GPS information obtained in the mobile terminal. When the location of the mobile terminal is determined to be at the predetermined location the location of the mobile terminal may be determined to be in the workplace. In operation a predetermined security policy may be applied to the mobile terminal.

In operation the mobile terminal scans IDs of connectable wireless network apparatuses although the GPS location of the mobile terminal is out of the predetermined location. In operation the security application of the mobile terminal compares the ID of the scanned wireless network apparatus to the ID list of wireless network apparatuses received from the security control server and determines whether the ID of the scanned wireless network apparatus is an ID of a wireless network apparatus located in the workplace. The ID list of wireless network apparatus may refer to a list of IDs of wireless network apparatuses located in the workplace.

The ID list of wireless network apparatuses may be received from the security control server. Alternatively when the ID list of the wireless network apparatus is modified the security control server may transmit an updated ID list to the mobile terminal.

The mobile terminal may compare the ID of the mobile terminal scanned at a current location to the ID list received from the security control server. In operation when the ID of the scanned wireless network apparatus is included in the ID list of wireless network apparatuses a predetermined security policy may be applied to the mobile terminal.
