No. 60 787 510 entitled An Intelligent Kiosk for Mobile Payment and filed on Mar. 31 2006 and which claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119 of previously filed provisional patent application Ser. No. 60 707 561 entitled A Novel Structure of Cellular System for Internet Access and filed on Aug. 12 2005. The entire contents of these applications are hereby incorporated by reference.

This invention relates generally to accessing content through a network and more particularly to localized content delivery that implements multiple networks.

Empowered by the next generation of wireless technology cellular networks can provide users with access to information from the Internet such as video on demand video conferences databases etc. The use of cellular phones is thus no longer limited to voice transmission.

However there are still some problems with the delivery of Internet content through cellular phones. For example even with the high bandwidth connection provided by advanced cellular systems there remains a bottleneck between the Internet and the cellular network CN as well as delays caused by the Internet itself. This condition hinders the ability of cellular phone users to fully exploit the capabilities of the advanced CN. Since smooth and effective data flow is important to users this bottleneck hinders the adoption of cellular phones for Internet access.

Making payment requests is another area of need. Although more and more individuals have become accustomed to purchasing goods and services online there is not a streamlined and consistent mechanism for securely making requests for such payments.

Still another area of need relates to alerts. Locations including homes offices and other environments typically include computing devices as well as at least some form of network connection. Despite all of this connectivity there are certain conditions for which adequate alerts remain unavailable. For example billions of children wear diapers and probably a quarter of them may suffer the effects of wet diapers at any given moment since caretakers e.g. parents baby sitters etc. are not apprised of the status of their diapers in real time.

Thus there remains a need for systems and corresponding devices and processes that avoid the shortcomings of existing networks for delivering Internet content using the CN. There also remains a need for systems and corresponding techniques for making payment requests. There also remains a need for systems and corresponding techniques for delivering alerts to individuals such as caregivers tasked with managing a child in diapers.

The present invention provides systems apparatus and methods for efficient delivery of Internet content in communications involving a CN and corresponding cellular device.

According to one aspect the present invention accommodates the optimized delivery of locally applicable Internet content to users. This aspect may for example be practiced in a system wherein a user equipment access Internet content through a wireless network. The locations for users respectively requesting Internet content are determined based upon an identification of wireless network base stations through which the requests for the Internet content are made. The Internet content requested by users from a particular location corresponding to a given wireless network base station can thus be monitored.

A cache of locally applicable content caches particular Internet content that is determined to be locally applicable based upon the monitoring of the Internet content accessed by users from the particular location. The particular Internet content is preferably cached at a local content server that is logically proximate to the given wireless network base station for the particular location. Logical proximity may be variously carried out such as through physical proximity or by provision of dedicated bandwidth and resources.

Requests for Internet content for the particular location may thus be served from the cache to optimize delivery where the cache contents the requested content.

The caching of locally applicable Internet content may be maintained on a layered basis such that a first layer of local applicability corresponds to Internet content requested by users in a first geographical area in which the particular location resides and at least one succeeding layer of local applicability corresponds to Internet content requested by users in at least one succeeding geographical area that encompasses and is larger than the first geographical area.

Merchants or other commercial entities may also be provided some form of access to information related to the locally applicable Internet content with commercial incentives such as coupons or advertisements being delivered to users based upon that information.

According to another aspect the present invention facilitates secure receipt and performance of action requests such as payment requests. A wireless HUB receives and recognizes a unique identifier corresponding to a user equipment through a short range wireless connection. This identifier may for example be based upon Near Field Communication or Radio Frequency ID technology.

Once this recognition is made the wireless HUB establishes a secure communication channel with the user equipment based upon the recognition of the unique identifier. The secure communication channel is separate from the short range wireless connection used to receive the unique identifier and preferably provides greater bandwidth and range to accommodate additional more detailed communications related to the action request. The action request is received from the user equipment through this secure communication channel and information related to the action request is communicated to an external server. The action request is completed and a confirmation of this is communicated to the user equipment.

According to still another aspect the present invention accommodates the delivery of diaper status updates through a wireless connection. A sensor detects the condition of the diaper and accommodates a status indication when the current indication requires an updated. By way of example the condition monitored may be wetness with a certain level of wetness as determined by a property such as pH triggering the communication of the status indication. The status information is preferably transmitted using a wireless connection to a device that delivers a corresponding alert to at least one caregiver.

A number of designated alert recipients may also be maintained and organized. Where multiple diapers are being monitored an identifier is associated with the status information and the identifier is correlated to a particular designated recipient so that the alert can be appropriately directed.

The present invention can be embodied in various forms including business processes computer implemented methods computer program products computer systems and networks user interfaces application programming interfaces and the like.

In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous details are set forth such as flowcharts and system configurations in order to provide an understanding of one or more embodiments of the present invention. However it is and will be apparent to one skilled in the art that these specific details are not required in order to practice the present invention.

According to one aspect of the present invention Internet content is requested and accessed by cellular users in correlation with their determined location. Provision of Internet content is customized according to location and provided in a series of locally customized networks. A given local network includes servers configured to include content believed appropriate for its location. The delivery of content is made from a particular local network configured as such to a user s cellular phone through the local base station.

For example information about Hollywood may be accessed through cellular network base station s in the Hollywood area when the cellular user is detected as being proximate to the Hollywood area. These base stations deliver Internet content that is relevant to the area such as web sites about film and movie stars. This Internet content is stored in servers that the base stations covering the area can access conveniently to provide faster and more efficient transmission to the cellular users in the service area.

By optimizing the location of the Internet content for the wireless network users this invention enables an optimum data flow for cellular users to access rich information and data of all kinds from the Internet.

The UE is a cellular phone configured to communicate with base station s of the RAN . Although the UE is preferably a cellular phone it should be understood that a variety of devices may be equipped with same communication functionality. Other examples of the UE include a Personal Digital Assistant PDA Set Top Box Kiosk or any personal computing device configured to include the wireless communication capability.

The RAN and CCN preferably implement conventional elements of a cellular network and are described further as follows. The RAN includes Base Station and Radio Network Controller RNC elements. The Base Station provides resource management and provides an interface that converts the data flow between the UE and RNC. The RNC controls radio resources for the Base Stations to which it is connected and also manages connections to the UE .

The CCN is connected with the EN . The most notable examples of the EN can be grouped into two kinds Circuit Switched CS networks and Packet Switched PS networks. The CS network provides circuit switched connections for circuit switched services such as telephony and ISDN. The PS network provides connections for package data services. The Internet is a significant and notable application of a PS network.

The CCN comprises MSC VLR GMSC HLR SGSN and GGSN elements. The HLR Home Location Register is a database that stores information such as user service profiles. The service profile includes information including allowed services roaming areas forwarding numbers and the like. The HLR stores the UE location to accommodate that routing of calls and other information to the UE .

The MSC VLR Mobile Services Switching Center and Visitor Location Register respectively provide switch operations and a database for the UE in its current location for Circuit Switch CS services. The VLR stores the user s service profile as well as more precise information on the UE s location within the serving system. CS connections go through the GMSC Gateway MSC which is the switch at the point of connection to the external CS network.

The SGSN Serving GPRS General Packet Radio Service Support Node functionality is similar to that of MSC VLR but is typically used for Packet Switch PS service. PS connections go through the GGSN Gateway GPRS Support Node .

The LCN comprises one or more computing devices configured to include memory processing capability and interfaces to provide the functionality described herein. The LCN includes local servers that are configured to provide custom Internet content. The LCN is also configured to include a content access monitoring module which monitors Internet access and determines content applicable to the designated location of the LCN .

The LCN thus performs monitoring and caching related to locally applicable content. With regard to the monitoring functionality the monitoring includes local access which determines which content users in the location are accessing. With regard to the caching functionality the LCN maintains a cache of locally applicable Internet content which includes refreshing to add new content and remove stale content as determined by information received from the monitoring functionality.

One technique for determining whether content is locally applicable is measuring access frequency. If many users in the location are determined to be accessing particular Internet content then that particular Internet content is determined to be locally applicable and is included in the cache during the next update.

In addition to monitoring and caching locally applicable content the LCN is configured to be logically proximate to the base station s of the cellular network at the particular location. In one example logical proximity is carried out by having the LCN physically proximate to the relevant base station s such as in the same geographical area. For example the LCN may be located in a metropolitan area or within an area the covers certain zip code s of a metropolitan area. Logical proximity may alternatively be carried out without requiring physical proximity. This for example may be done by providing dedicated resources including a high bandwidth connection between the LCN and the local users. In this example the LCN is configured to deliver locally applicable content more efficiently and rapidly because of the dedicated resources without necessarily requiring physical proximity.

According to another aspect to further increase efficiency the locally applicable content for a given LCN is organized in a layered architecture. A first layer of content is considered to be the content that has the highest local applicability. Additional layers are also provided upon the first layer with succeeding layers progressively covering larger geographical areas i.e. progressively larger numbers of base stations . According to one aspect the layering involves communication with neighboring LCNs covering increasing areas to determine the content that is locally applicable for the additional levels. Thus for example a first layer corresponds to locally applicable content at a first level of granularity e.g. as monitored determined only for the location of the LCN or a small local group of LCNs a second layer corresponds to locally applicable content at a second level of granularity e.g. the logical AND or intersection of content that is frequently accessed across a larger area as determined by the monitoring of access for several LCNs in the defined larger area and so on.

The operation of the system to update the LCN accordingly is described as follows with concurrent reference to and the flow diagram of . The process commences by monitoring Internet content accessed by users for a current location. This is done by monitoring the gateway of the connection between the CCN and PS networks to track the Internet content accessed by the cellular users.

It is noted that the monitored content may have two useful purposes. One is to accommodate the delivery of locally applicable content which may be determined by frequency of access for the given location. Another is to allow the providers of content e.g. merchants or other commercial entities to receive an indication which content is locally applicable. This allows the providers of content to assist or participate further in determining what is locally applicable. For example a merchant provided with an indication of local applicability for certain content may wish to make advertisements coupons or the like available to the users in that domain.

In conjunction with this monitoring determination s of the base station s from which requests for the Internet content are made. This may be performed by checking the VLR and HLR to discover the base stations from which the requests for the Internet content are sent from through. It is noted that base station discovery is just one way that physical location may be determined. Other examples include but are not limited to using GPS zip code telephone number and IP address information to make the determinations.

The next step comprises determining locally applicable content based upon the monitoring and determination s of the base station s . Determination of local applicability is performed by determining access frequency. Alternatively local applicability may be determined by comparing the location of the requesting user base station to a location that is identified in association with the requested content.

Then for the current e.g. first layer the content is loaded in servers that are logically proximate to users for the given location. This may be done by placing the current e.g. first layer server s loaded with the Internet content and or other information data to achieve an optimum and faster data transmission for the cellular users to access the data stored in the servers through the base stations. For example the servers can be placed logically close to the base station through which the cellular users access the data stored in the server s .

The process iterates through as many layers as desired. If it is determined that additional layers are to be updated then steps are performed to load the next e.g. second layer server s with locally applicable content. As described this preferably entails a broader geographical area as the layers increase. The process continues until it is determined that no more layers need to be determined and loaded. The number of layers in a given system will vary according to application and as desired. Layering will typically involve a trade off between maximizing locally available content and the processing resources required to generate and manage layers for progressively broader areas.

The content that is loaded into the base station s may be refreshed on any desired schedule or trigger. For a refresh operation the process described above repeats starting again with the first layer. Content that is stale or otherwise determined to no longer be locally applicable may be removed and of course new content may be added during a refresh cycle.

Additional servers may be added vertically and or horizontally as desired. Vertically means that servers may be added at a given physical location to cover first second third etc. layers. Horizontally refers to adding different sets of servers corresponding to different locations i.e. one set for the first layer a second set for the second layer and so on .

A regular schedule or certain amount of activity can be used to trigger a refresh of the layering. The Internet content in the LCN servers is modified according to the updated findings on the requests for the Internet content sent from the base stations. The Internet content stored in the servers is refreshed at a proper time such as when the servers are not overwhelmed by the users accessing the contents.

The servers are thus loaded with the information for broadcast and or multicast and or any data to be accessed by the cellular users for an optimum transmission to the users in service areas.

The locally applicable content may be sent and delivered upon request to the users. Examples of communication pathways for sending the locally applicable Internet content include the relatively direct pathway through the RAN the pathway through the CCN and then the RAN or others.

A variety of techniques may be used to implement the locally applicable content cached by the LCN in conjunction with requests for Internet content by UE or other device users. In one example the UE request for Internet content prompts an initial check for content in the locally applicable content followed by conventional Internet access should the content prove to be absent from the locally applicable content that is currently cached. Additionally based upon the layered approach described above the first attempt to satisfy the request may be made from the first layer followed by the second layer and so on. The number of layers searched to respond to a particular request may vary as desired. When the number of layers designated to be searched for the current request is exhausted conventional Internet access is used to retrieve content related to the request.

Various cache management and network optimization techniques may be used to manage the locally applicable content. For example fully associative FA direct mapped DM and set associative SA mechanisms are examples of techniques that can be used to determine where a specific content can be stored on the server. Additionally techniques to ensure block validity and to manage cache hits and misses can also be used. Random LRU Least Recently Used and FIFO First In First Out block replacement schemes are among those that can be used to manage the blocks in the cache.

According to another aspect the present invention facilitates a systematical solution for mobile payment or the communication of other information as well as the receipt of information such as alerts . Preferably this aspect of the present invention implements a cellular network a wireless personal area network WPAN and wireless identification technology. Various technologies may be used for these components including but not limited to 3G technology for the cellular network Zigbee Bluetooth or UWB technologies for the WPAN and RFID e.g. NFC for the wireless identification technology.

The wireless HUB WHUB may be located in a public or private location. For a public location the WHUB is preferably housed in a kiosk. The kiosk may be located on a street or in an airport shopping mall or any location that is perceived as convenient and likely to include user traffic. For private locations the WHUB is preferably configured for usage in locations like homes or hotel rooms. In these environments the WHUB may be provided in a smaller device such as part of a Set Top Box STB .

The handset is equipped with a tag that provides a unique identifier that can be wirelessly communicated to the WHUB . A preferred tag is a Near Field Communication NFC tag . NFC provides short range wireless connectivity that uses magnetic field induction to enable communication between the devices. It has a short range of a few centimeters which is believed to be advantageous for applications of this aspect of the present invention. Although NFC is preferred RFID or other substitutes may also be provided. The handset also includes a WPAN transceiver which allows additional communication channel between the handset and the WHUB .

The wireless WHUB is similarly equipped with an NFC reader a WPAN transceiver and a network adaptor . The NFC technology accommodates secure and automatic authentication and data exchange between the NFC tag and NFC reader. According to this aspect of the present invention the NFC is uniquely associated with other information that allows the appropriate action payment alert etc. to take place. For example where the system is being used to accommodate mobile payment the RFID tag is associated with the user s bank account. Further once the device is authenticated through the unique identifier a second secure communication channel with more capabilities is established between the handset and WHUB . This allows the action request and related communications to be reliably transmitted between the two devices.

Accordingly once the NFC based authentication is accomplished a secure wireless connection between the handset and WHUB is established. This communication can implement the WPAN transceiver which has a higher data rate and longer operational range compared to NFC. The secure communication allows the exchange of additional information related to the action such as price and credit card information for a purchase request and corresponding payment scenario to be sent between the handset and the WHUB . The secure communication can be implemented by hardware e.g. a dedicated hardware chipset and software e.g. data encryption algorithm .

The WHUB can also exchange data with other WPAN devices . It may be useful for the WHUB to communicate with these devices to exchange information related to the action. For example the WHUB may collect water usage information from a water meter equipped with the WPAN device functionality. This data may be stored locally by the WHUB or may be transmitted to the appropriate server through the network connection . The data does not necessarily need to be collected by the WHUB concurrently with the user requested action. For example the acquisition and transmission of water usage information may occur periodically and separate from the user s request to make a corresponding payment.

It is also noted that the WHUB may optionally be configured with a wireless communication capability such as that provided in a cellular phone. The WHUB is thus configurable to operate with a system that delivers locally applicable Internet content as described above in connection with .

The communication through the separate secure communication channel e.g. WPAN is then established. The WPAN functionality is used to communicate between the handset and the WHUB so that content related to a requested action may be securely exchanged. In this example the requested action is a purchase request .

It should be noted that the action may or may not immediately follow authentication . For example the cellular phone may be configured to include browsing capability which allows that interface of the cellular phone to be used to review items prior to making a purchase request.

Various purchase types may be made with the purchase request. Examples may include a physical item that is separately shipped to an address a download that is made available immediately possibly to the cellular phone a service etc.

Internet content may be accessed by the cellular phone in association with an action request. One example of providing content to the cellular phone may be the locally applicable Internet content as described above in connection with . Also the cellular phone may access Internet content through channels other than through the WHUB.

It is also noted that a purchase request is just one form of an action that may be carried out. Actions include but are not limited to bill payment populating an account with funds online shopping transactions and others.

The process of authentication may be based upon a Tag ID and password. The Tag ID and password are sent to the authentication server which then returns a notification confirming authentication. Preferably this authentication indicates whether the individual is who he or she claims to be but does not address the access rights of the individual. The authentication server may reside within or outside the WHUB.

As necessary additional information may also be required in association with a requested action. For example account identification information or passwords to access an online account may be required by an external server. In these circumstances the external server sends a request to the WHUB for the information. The WHUB may store such information and respond to such a request. Alternatively the WHUB may further exchange information with the user through the handset in order to obtain the additional information requested by the external server.

In connection with the purchase request a payment request is made between the WHUB and external server through the network connection. The payment request allows the user to complete the transaction related to the purchase request . To accommodate a satisfactory completion of the payment request the server corresponds with a payment gateway and a resolution indicating whether the payment request succeeds or fails follows.

Upon an indication of a successful payment request the WHUB receives a receipt or confirmation number from the external server relating to the requested action and passes that and or related information to the handset confirming completion of the action. This may be a receipt confirmation numbers coupon codes or the like.

According to still another aspect the present invention provides for wireless management of tasks and corresponding alerts. One such task is diaper management which is described in detail as follows.

This aspect of the present invention accommodates task management based upon wireless delivery of alerts to overcome the problem of estimating when the task requires completion. These alert based tasks include but are not limited to diaper management. For example home security monitoring may also be accommodated.

The diaper condition sensing module includes a sensor and a transmitter . The sensor is configured to monitor one or more of the following conditions whose results indicate whether the diaper is wet or not 

3. Chemical properties of urine volatilized air including volatile acid or ammonia pH starch enzymes ketone bodies and or urobilinogen may all be detected and analyzed to determine the presence of urine 

4. Feces the solid waste material the bilirubin or stercobilinogens in the feces the specific food decomposed material including starch fat plant fiber muscle fiber and so on and or

The sensor triggers the transmitter to establish a wireless communication channel between itself and the CRC . A signal is sent by the transmitter to inform the CRC that the diaper is wet. This wireless communication channel preferably uses wireless technologies such as UWB Bluetooth RFID Spread Spectrum or other conventional wireless communication technologies.

Each sensor preferably has a unique ID. Multiple access mechanisms such as TDMA CDMA FDMA or other conventional approaches may also be applied to allow the central receiver to communicate with multiple sensors at the same resource. It is believed that Zigbee Bluetooth may be useful for many applications in light of the competing demands of working range data rate and cost.

After the CRC receives the signal the receiver triggers sound light text and or other indications of the status of the diaper. These indications may be variously displayed broadcasted reflected etc. through speakers telephones pagers beepers computers and so on to inform the caregiver s so that they can remedy the situation.

The diaper condition sensing module may be variously provided. One example connects to the diaper using a probe that measures for desired criteria as described above and as shown in .

Another example provides the diaper condition sensing module within the diaper. In this example the sensor also includes interfaces probes for measuring the desired criteria within the confines of the diaper. The transmitter may use various communication techniques as described above. For an RFID embodiment the function may be provided by causing the circuit loop of the RFID tag to transition from open to close when the diaper condition e.g. wet is detected by the sensor which automatically causes the ID Tag to be sensed by the tag reader of the CRC.

Still further in this example the diaper condition sensing module may be placed within a diaper and reused. Diapers may be configured with pouches or the like to allow the placement of the diaper condition sensing module . In another alternative the diaper condition sensing module is manufactured and sold as an integrated part of each diaper so that caregivers do not have to be concerned about the placement of the module each time a diaper is changed.

In addition to assisting a caregiver with regard to an individual child s diaper a diaper management system may be configured to manage the diapers for groups of children such as a pre school class or a day care facility where many children may potentially wear diapers. An example of such a system is shown in . The CRC is configured to distinguish children in need of new diapers from those that are not and respectively sends messages to appropriate caregivers. To carry out this functionality the CRC is equipped with a database that associates the unique identifier corresponding to each diaper condition sensing module to at least one contact party. Alternative communication pathways phone e mail etc. multiple contacts caregiver 1 caregiver 2 and various other information may be associated to a given diaper condition sensing module in the database.

In addition to providing a status alert about the condition of the diaper the CRC also determines the location of the diaper by using wireless location techniques including but not limited to Angle of Arrival Time of Arrival and Received Signal Strength Indication. This allows the option of also giving the designated caregiver information about the location of the child having the soiled diaper.

In the situation where there are multiple children diapers being monitored the CRC provided alert may be to a PC having a display screen with a map of the room s and the estimated location of the wet diaper. Other CRC provided alerts may merely notify additional caregiver s as to the status of the diaper without the location so that the additional caregiver s may be apprised of the status. The CRC may also poll the DCSM after a given period of time to ensure that the diaper condition has been updated. The CRC may be configured with configuration settings that allow a caregiver to specify when and how they should be updated. For example if one caregiver is a baby sitter watching the child while the parents are out the parent may configure the CRC not to send an alert to them when the diaper is first detected as being wet but to wait until a certain period of time elapses. By contrast the baby sitter alert may be provided immediately. If the certain period of time passes and the diaper remains wet the CRC can then notify the parent about the diaper condition and the parent will realize that the diaper has not been changed.

Local Merchant Server s are also illustrated. As described in connection with the provision of locally applicable Internet content merchants are apprised as to the local applicability of content such as may be determined by frequency of access by users at a particular location corresponding to given base station s . The WHUB in addition to being configured to facilitate secure receipt and performance of an action such as a purchase request and corresponding payment request includes the CRC functionality that allows a response to diaper condition update as provided by the DCSM the diaper being just one example of an item for which updates may be provided .

With the system configured as such the delivery of locally applicable Internet content may be provided in conjunction with the diaper update. Also a local merchant and corresponding server that sells diapers is able to present a coupon or other incentive to the user in conjunction with the determination that a diaper is wet by the DCSM . Moreover in addition to having the capability of reminding the caregiver about this the WHUB may keep a database of household requirements and inventories. For example the WHUB may monitor the number of diapers detected as being used. When the amount of used diapers is close to the amount known to have been purchased previously an additional alert may be presented to the user so that they are aware that they need diapers and they can get the discount if they buy brand x based upon the information provided by the local merchant.

The process for providing such functionality may be as follows. Based upon historical activity relating to access of locally applicable Internet content as well as whatever merchant participation is desired in conjunction with the system the local merchant s information is cached at the relevant LCN Server s . A wet diaper is detected by the DCSM and this information is transmitted to the WHUB . The WHUB managing the diaper inventory for the household determines that the inventory of diapers is low and thus sends a purchase alert through the Base Station requesting information related to the current need. In response to this the LCN Server s determine that the local merchant information is relevant to the current need and thus retrieve and send the cached local merchant information to the WHUB .

In conjunction with the above exchange of information alerts of both the diaper condition and the low diaper inventory may be provided and retained for user review. When the user is ready to make a purchase this may be accommodated via the WHUB . This purchase request may be made by directly interfacing with the WHUB or by using the UE in the fashion described above. The latter option is shown. There the UE sends its Tag ID and purchase request to the WHUB . This of course may follow some browsing activity prior to the purchase request so as to review the possible purchase options. The authentication may be as described above based upon a Tag ID and password. The Tag ID and password are sent to the authentication server which returns a notification confirming authentication.

Once the authorization is obtained payment is sent to the Local Merchant server to complete the transaction and the receipt confirmation and other information may be fed back to the WHUB regarding the same. For physical product like diapers the WHUB will have provided or the Local Merchant may already have the shipping address. Additionally if the Local Merchant is a provider of several items such as a supermarket then items may be accumulated prior to completing a purchase and or making a shipment and or making the products available for pick up by the user. The WHUB is preferably configured with a shopping list that allows organization of periodic cumulative purchases to accommodate this functionality.

Thus embodiments of the present invention produce and provide improved delivery of Internet content to CN users facilities for accommodating task management through a portable terminal device and for providing alerts. Although the present invention has been described in considerable detail with reference to certain embodiments thereof the invention may be variously embodied without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Therefore the following claims should not be limited to the description of the embodiments contained herein in any way.
