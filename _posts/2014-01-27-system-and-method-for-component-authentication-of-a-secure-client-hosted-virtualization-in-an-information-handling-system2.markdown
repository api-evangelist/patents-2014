In a particular embodiment service processor includes a separate network channel similar to network channel for communicating with management services not illustrated that are external to information handling system . In another embodiment service processor is connected to network interface to gain access to network channel .

In a particular embodiment service processor is powered separately from the rest of information handling system and is implemented such that the service processor remains powered on when the rest of the information handling system is powered off.

Application programs and BIOS FW code can each be implemented as single programs or as separate programs carrying out the various features as described herein.

CHV manager operates from the platform level to initialize CHV system on power up to launch virtual machines and and to manage input and output interactions between virtual machines and and client platform hardware . In this respect CHV manager functions similarly to a combination of a platform BIOS and a virtual machine manager or hypervisor. As such CHV manager is stored in a non volatile memory not illustrated of client platform hardware such as a firmware ROM embedded on the system board that is separate from the mass storage device used to store the images for virtual machines and and that retains the code stored thereon when client system is powered. In a particular embodiment CHV manager provides that the launching of virtual machines and is secure using digital signatures to verify the authenticity of the virtual machine images for virtual machines and . For example client system can include hardware extensions with security capabilities to ensure secure launch and execution of virtual machines and such as Trusted Execution Technology TXT or other hardware extension technology. In a particular embodiment CHV manager operates with GPE to fully encrypt virtual machines and in storage. By operating CHV manager from the platform level client system is secure from malicious software or virus attacks that might otherwise affect the operations of client system . Moreover by encrypting virtual machines and CHV system provides a tamper resistant storage method for the images of virtual machines and .

In an optional embodiment virtual machine hypervisor can be operated at protection level to launch virtual machines and . Note that one of CHV manager or virtual machine hypervisor is selected to launch virtual machines and and that where one of the CHV manager or the virtual machine hypervisor is operating to manage the virtual machines the other is not operating to manage the virtual machines. When launched virtual machines and each include associated user data and associated user preference information and associated applications and and associated operating systems and respectively. Thus each virtual machine and is isolated from the others operates as an individual information handling system on client system and shares the resources of client platform hardware . The operating CHV manager or virtual machine hypervisor functions to manage the access of each of virtual machines and to the resources of client platform hardware . Virtual machines and can include anti virus software not illustrated that is tailored to the associated OSs and thus providing an additional layer of security to the operations of CHV system .

The configuration of client platform is determined by the particular devices and architecture of client platform hardware and the content of trusted platform firmware and CHV manager . The devices and architecture of client platform hardware is determined at the time of manufacture of client system . The content of trusted platform firmware and CHV manager is installed on a non volatile memory storage device not illustrated in client platform hardware at the time of manufacture. In a particular embodiment the manufacturer or a user of client platform determines that the client platform is intended for use as a client hosted virtualization platform and initiates a hardware function to toggle an element of fuse switch bank to enable CHV manager . For example the manufacturer can provide client platform with CHV manager enabled by toggling the element of fuse switch bank prior to shipment to the user. In another example the manufacturer can provide client platform with BIOS enabled by shipping the client platform to the user with the element of fuse switch bank intact such that client platform boots using BIOS . Here the manufacturer can provide a way for the user to toggle the element of fuse switch bank to enable CHV manager . For example the user can be presented with an option to enable CHV manager the first time client platform is turned on or client platform can include a BIOS option to enable the CHV manager.

In a particular embodiment toggling the element of fuse switch bank permanently enables CHV manager . Here each time client platform is booted trusted platform firmware performs low level system boot activities and then passes control to CHV manager . An example of permanently enabling CHV manager can include writing to a particular bit or set of bits in a write once device such as by blowing a hardware fuse in fuse switch bank that permanently provides for a boot path that passes control to CHV manager locking a boot block writing to a programmable ROM such as an EPROM or a flash device providing another type of hardware switch or a combination thereof. Another example can include providing a particular bit or set of bits in fuse switch bank in a platform ROM not illustrated that is not re writable. In the case of blowing a hardware fuse the hardware fuse can be blown at the time of manufacture of client system or by a user of client system at a later date. In the case of providing bits in a platform ROM the bits can be provided at the time of manufacture of client system . In another embodiment toggling the element of fuse switch bank can be performed by a software function. For example a hardware hash can be erased a state authentication certificate can be authenticated by TPM another software function can be performed or a combination thereof.

In another embodiment client platform includes a mechanism to selectively override the permanent enablement of CHV manager such that when client platform is booted BIOS performs low level system boot activities and then passes control to virtual machine hypervisor . For example the particular bit or set of bits in fuse switch bank can reside in a re writeable non volatile memory such that client platform can be reprogrammed to disable CHV manager . In another example a boot option provided by trusted platform firmware can prompt a user of client platform as to whether to boot to CHV manager control or to virtual machine hypervisor control. In yet another example a hardware jumper a hardware switch or a BIOS settable switch can be provided whereby in a first position client platform boots using BIOS and in a second position the client platform enables CHV manager .

When control of client system is passed to the CHV manager CHV manager launches service OS to establish the controlled virtualization environment including launching virtual machines and and controlling the elements of client platform hardware . Service OS supports I O port assignment between virtual machines and and client platform hardware and provides a secure interface to TPM USH and GPE for pre boot authentication platform hardware and software authentication secure biometric user authentication and other trusted computing features for the virtual machines. Service OS also supports task oriented devices and FVE storage for virtual machines and and provides access to common storage devices. Policy manager implements security policies between virtual machines and and the devices of client platform hardware . Because the content of trusted platform firmware and CHV manager resides on the non volatile memory storage device the trusted platform firmware code and the CHV manager code is executed securely within platform level and the basic operation of client system is less susceptible to attack from malicious program code viruses worms or other corrupting programs and client system embodies a secure CHV architecture.

If the information handling system has a BIOS boot option enabled the YES branch of decision block is taken and a decision is made as to whether or not the BIOS boot option has been selected in decision block . If not the NO branch of decision block is taken the boot process runs the CHV manager in block and the method ends in block . If the BIOS boot option is selected the YES branch of decision block is taken the boot process proceeds to boot in BIOS in block and the method ends in block . For example a user of client platform may select a boot option to boot client platform with BIOS and client platform can then boot using BIOS and can then launch virtual machine hypervisor or another conventional operating system on the bare system.

The content of trusted platform firmware and CHV manager is alterable by reprogramming the non volatile memory storage device permitting revision control of the contents of trusted platform firmware and CHV manager . For example firmware code associated with the devices of client platform hardware such as drivers application programming interfaces APIs or user interfaces UIs in trusted platform firmware or the BIOS code associated with BIOS can be periodically updated or modified. Similarly CHV manager code associated with service OS drivers or update manager or policy profile data associated with policy manager can be periodically updated or modified. Here the fact that trusted platform firmware and CHV manager are stored in the non volatile memory storage device ensures a level of security related to the ability to perform updates.

In another embodiment update manager functions in cooperation with TPM to provide an encryption and authentication capability with regard to updates to trusted platform firmware and CHV manager . Here the capability to perform an update is enabled by a locked platform feature where the key to unlock the feature is associated with a public key infrastructure PKI . Updates to trusted platform firmware or to CHV manager include key information. When update manager receives an update to trusted platform firmware or to CHV manager update manager provides the key information to TPM to authenticate the update. If the update is authenticated then update manager proceeds to implement the update. If the update is not authenticated the update manager does not implement the update. In a particular embodiment updates to trusted platform firmware or to CHV manager are also encrypted and TPM decrypts authenticated updates prior to being implemented by update manager .

CHV update system communicates with client system through network interface which is connected to network . In a particular embodiment CHV update system determines when a trusted platform firmware or a CHV manager in client system is in need of an update and CHV update system pushes the needed update to firmware or to CHV manager and an update manager not illustrated in CHV manager performs the update to client system . In another embodiment client system periodically polls CHV update system to determine if updates are available for firmware or for CHV manager . If an update is available then client system pulls the available update for firmware or for CHV manager and the update manager performs the update to client system .

CHV update system functions to create and maintain the updates for client system . As such the components that make up firmware and CHV manager are stored and maintained in a current state in CHV update manager . Thus the operating code for firmware and CHV manager is maintained and updated with new capabilities fixes to defective capabilities patches to insecure capabilities other updates or a combination thereof. For example a development team not illustrated can maintain the operating code for a service OS storing modified images in service OS image can store virus definitions for an anti virus capability of the service OS in virus definitions database and can store drivers associated with the various hardware components of client system in drivers database . CHV update manager combines the contents of service OS image virus definitions database and drivers database to provide updates for firmware and CHV manager and encodes the updates with PKI infrastructure to provide a secure update for client system . Client image compiler receives the secure update from CHV update manager and combines the secure update with updated virtual machine images from virtual machine image database and with updated user profiles from user profile database to create a client image for client system . Client image compiler stores the client image in client image database to be pushed to or pulled from client system .

In a particular embodiment client system includes a TPM similar to TPM that can provide PKI based authentication and encryption decryption functions for the client system a CHV manager similar to CHV manager and a service OS similar to service OS . Here the service OS accesses the TPM to establish a PKI session with PKI infrastructure in order to provide a secure communication channel between the service OS and CHV update system . When the secure communication channel is established client system is authenticated onto CHV update system and can receive updated firmware and CHV manager code. In another embodiment the service OS establishes a virtual private network VPN session with CHV update system to authenticate client system . The PKI session and the VPN session can be maintained while client system is connected to network . Additionally updates to the firmware and the CHV manager code can be digitally signed for example by applying a hash function to the update and the digital signature can be verified in client system prior to implementing the updates. The VPN can also be established using other cryptographic tunneling protocols such as Internet Protocol Security IPsec Secure Socket Layer SSL Datagram Transport Layer Security DTLS or another protocol as needed or desired.

In a particular embodiment CHV update system is provided by the manufacturer of client system such that updates related to the client system hardware or firmware are provided in a timely manner. In another embodiment CHV update system is provided by an information technology IT resource that is associated with the owner of client system . Here the owner can easily enforce policies in client system as described below.

Policy manager enforces granular control of access to Ethernet NIC WiFi NIC USB port and other I O resources. Policy manager permits certain types of access requests and denies other access requests and permits conditional access to the various resources of client platform hardware . As such I O policy information and can provide for unrestricted access blocked access or conditional access depending on the resource on the user of the respective virtual machine or on the content included in the access request on the target of the access request or on other conditions as needed. For example I O policy information may dictate that virtual machine has unrestricted access to Ethernet NIC may not access USB port and has conditional access to WiFi NIC such that only access to a corporate WiFi network is permitted. Other examples include permitting access to USB port only when the device connected to the USB port is an authenticated storage device or when the device connected to the USB port is a human interface device such as a mouse or a keyboard. I O policy information and can also provide for user consent each time a resource is accessed and for logging of file transfers to and from the resource. The content transferred into and out of the respective virtual machines and can also be filtered such that inbound transfers can be checked for malware or viruses and outbound transfers can be checked to prevent data leaks.

In a particular embodiment I O policy information and are provided to CHV system by a CHV update system similar to CHV update system . Thus in the above embodiment where the CHV update system is provided by the IT resource associated with the owner of CHV system the IT resource can log onto the CHV system to provide updates to I O policy information and to set the I O policies and to limit or expand the functionality of the CHV system as needed or desired. In a particular embodiment I O policy information and can include security policy information and update policy information. The security policy information sets the bounds for the capabilities of virtual machines and respectively. For example the security policy information can provide for the ability or inability of the associated virtual machine to access the Internet or particular locations on the Internet the ability to run or not run outside of a corporate network the ability to access change or delete information in a storage network or other security abilities. The update policy information sets the parameters for CHV system to access the CHV update system. For example the update policy can determine a frequency of connection to the CHV update system to check for updates set a patch prioritization for CHV system or set other parameters related to the connection to the CHV update system. Moreover the CHV update system can be utilized in conjunction with other features of CHV system . For example a service processor can detect the presence of a network connection prior to power on of CHV update system .

Pre boot authentication provides a way to authenticate CHV system prior to the launch of virtual machines and such that only authenticated users gain access to the devices and resources of CHV system . illustrates an embodiment of a method of providing pre boot authentication in CHV system . Here BIOS generates a pre boot authentication request to pre boot authentication module . Pre boot authentication module includes a sequestered operating environment that prompts the user for authentication. The user provides the authentication information via authentication device . Pre boot authentication module verifies the authenticity of the authentication information and if the authentication information is verified generates an authentication object and generates a pre boot authentication response that sends the authentication object to BIOS . BIOS generates an authentication object store that stores the authentication object in SMRAM . Upon completion of the authentication object store BIOS passes execution to CHV manager .

When CHV manager launches virtual machine the user of virtual machine needs the authentication object in order to gain access to the devices and resources of CHV system . To obtain the authentication object authenticator generates an authentication request to BIOS in system management mode SMM . In response to a first authentication request the BIOS generates an authentication object transfer sending the authentication object from SMRAM to secure post office box module in CHV manager . CHV manager then generates an authentication response to send the authentication object from secure post office box module to authenticator thus providing virtual machine with authenticated access to the devices and resources of CHV system . Secure post office box module retains the authentication object for subsequent authentication requests such as authentication request generated by authenticator in virtual machine in response to which CHV manager generates the authentication response to send the authentication object to authenticator . In another embodiment not illustrated SMRAM retains the authentication object and provides the authentication object to secure post office box module for each subsequent authorization request. In another embodiment not illustrated SMRAM and secure post office box module can represent a common secure memory space for CHV system thus eliminating the need for the authentication object transfer between SMRAM and secure post office box module .

When one or more of virtual machines and have need of the service of task oriented device they generate a task oriented device transaction from device drivers and that is received by device driver interface . The task oriented device transaction preferably includes a header and data. The header identifies the type of transaction the source of the transaction other information about the transaction instructions for the execution of the transaction or a combination thereof. For example where task oriented device is an encryption decryption engine or security processor the header can include an encryption key identifier a decryption algorithm identifier an action identifier other information used by an encryption decryption engine or security processor or a combination thereof. The data includes the information to be processed by task oriented device . Device driver interface generates a task oriented device request that is received by CHV task manager . The task oriented device request includes the header and data from the task oriented device transaction.

CHV task manager operates to identify the source of the task oriented device request to determine a priority and to place a prioritized task oriented device request into the virtual machine transaction queue or associated with the particular virtual machine or that generated the task oriented device transaction. The prioritized task oriented device request includes the header and the data from the task oriented device transaction a task identifier field and a priority field. When a particular prioritized task oriented device request reaches the head of the particular virtual machine transaction queue the virtual machine transaction queue issues a current task oriented device request to CHV device driver . CHV device driver generates an issued task oriented device transaction to task oriented device .

Task oriented device performs the requested task identified in the issued task oriented device request and issues a task oriented device response to CHV device driver . CHV device driver forwards the task oriented device response to CHV task manager . CHV device task manager matches the task oriented device response with the associated prioritized task oriented device request to determine the virtual machine or that issued the associated task oriented device transaction and forwards the task oriented device response to device driver interface for response to the associated virtual machine or .

When one or more of virtual machines or issue a storage request the virtual machine generates a storage transaction from storage drivers or that is received by storage driver interface . Device driver interface determines if the storage transaction is intended for FVE storage device or for an unencrypted storage device not illustrated . If the storage transaction is intended for FVE storage device device driver interface forwards the storage request to GPE driver which in turn forwards the storage request to GPE . If the storage request is a write request then GPE encrypts a data portion of the storage request in accordance with information in a header portion of the storage request and stores the encrypted data on FVE storage device . If the storage request is a read request then GPE issues the storage request to FVE storage device and FVE returns encrypted data to GPE . GPE decrypts the encrypted data based upon information in the header portion of the storage request and forwards decrypted data to GPE driver . GPE driver forwards the decrypted data to storage driver interface which returns the decrypted data to the requesting virtual machine or .

In binding the resources to virtual machine authentication certificates and user credentials are verified through TPM or through I O to storage devices not illustrated of CHV system or to external servers not illustrated that are connected to the CHV system. Access to the storage devices can be encrypted through GPE . A secure communication channel can be established to the external servers through a PKI infrastructure or a VPN connection. Where the authentication certificates are verified through TPM the authentication certificates can be pre loaded onto CHV system by the manufacturer alleviating the need to obtain the certificates when the CHV system is first powered on. Additionally when the resources of CHV system are fully assigned to virtual machine the configuration can be sealed and digitally signed such that each time CHV system is powered on tampering can be detected by comparing the configuration at boot with the signed configuration.

When CHV system is powered on CHV manager determines the configuration of client platform hardware in operation and receives authentication certificates and user credentials from the client platform hardware in operation . CHV manager assigns the resources of CHV system to virtual machine in operation . If CHV system is being powered on for the first time virtual machine digitally signs the resource bindings and provides the digital signature to CHV manager in step . CHV manager securely stores the digital signature to either TPM or to the storage device of external server in step . When virtual machine is launched virtual machine provides the bindings needed by virtual machine in step .

During system power up or when component is installed into CHV system CHV manager checks the validity of certificate . If certificate cannot be validated then CHV manager isolates component denying access to the functions of the component to users of CHV system or grants limited functionality to the features of the component. For example if the component is a storage device access may be granted to view a directory of the storage device but not to copy information from the storage device to CHV system .

In a particular embodiment certificate is checked locally to verify that certificate is authentic in operation . For example CHV system can be pre loaded with authenticated components and the authentication credentials can be stored in TPM . If no authentication credentials are available locally then CHV manager determines if CHV system is connected to authentication server in step . If so CHV manager obtains the authentication credential from authentication server in step . If there is no local copy of the authentication credential if there is no connection to authentication server or if certificate is not validated by the authentication server then the functionality of component is limited. In a particular embodiment when component is installed into CHV system but before the CHV system is powered on service processor checks locally to verify that certificate is authentic in operation . If no authentication credentials are available locally then service processor determines if CHV system is connected to authentication server and obtains the authentication credential from authentication server in step . In this way the authentication credential can be stored locally prior to power up of CHV system .
