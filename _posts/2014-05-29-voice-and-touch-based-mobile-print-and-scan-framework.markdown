title: Voice and touch based mobile print and scan framework
abstract: Initiating document management in an enterprise network from outside of the network can challenge information technology (IT) specialists because many solutions require altering security of the enterprise network. In an embodiment, a method includes polling, from an automated agent in an agent-side network, a server in a cloud-side network for a request to access a document management resource of the agent-side network via an interface between the agent-side network and cloud-side network The method further includes, responsive to the polling, downloading the request via the interface between the agent-side network and the cloud-side network. The method additionally includes issuing the request to the document management resource to cause the document management resource to access a document stored on a device of the agent-side network and perform an operation associated with the request. The method, therefore, enables a user access to the document management resource from outside of an enterprise network.

Previous mobile printing solutions do not comprehensively solve the challenges of enterprise mobile cloud printing. In an embodiment a print architecture of the present invention interfaces with enterprise internal user authentication systems links multiple users to multiple devices is available on mobile smart phones via a cloud side network e.g. the public Internet interfaces with any printer model from any vendor to provide selection of print attributes provides mobile print and mobile release tracks and controls printing provides voice control automation and integrates with cost recovery. Examples of print attributes include color depth simplex duplex pages per sheet paper tray selection multiple paper tray selection page ranges finishing options e.g. stapling hole punching .

The user device sends the DMR request to a cloud server in a cloud side network e.g. the Internet . The cloud server stores the DMR request in a data structure such as a queue or a database.

An agent of the agent side network then sends a periodic polling request to the cloud server . In response the cloud server sends a DMR request to the agent of the agent side network . The cloud server sends the DMR request to the agent of the agent side network over a socket opened by the same interface used in polling the cloud server from the agent of the agent side network . In this manner an information technology IT manager of the agent side network does not have to open up any Uniform Resource Locators URLs or ports in a firewall or change security settings of the agent side network because the cloud server simply responds to an outgoing request from the agent instead of having an always open port in the agent side network through which to send requests. The agent on the inside of the agent side network can then distribute the DMR request to DMRs or e.g. printers copiers all in one machines document storage resources etc. . The DMRs or can then execute the request .

The DMR request can be an opaque request. The cloud server is agnostic to the DMR requested by the DMR request . The DMR request is a packaging which the agent can download from the cloud server without opening a hole in the agent side network firewall. The agent upon downloading the DMR request from the cloud server can then unpackage the DMR request to determine which document management resource or the DMR request is directed. The agent can then either reformat the DMR request in a correct format for the DMR or or if the DMR request is already in a format to access the DMR or forward the unpackaged DMR request to the DMRs or .

The user device can also authenticate the user. The user can type in a password or passcode or graphical pattern on the user device . The user device can also authenticate the user by recording the user saying a password verbally which is then authenticated at a voice biometrics cloud server . The voice biometrics cloud server determines 1 whether the password is the correct password and 2 whether voice biometrics indicate that the person uttering the password is the correct person. This offers the user another layer of security for the user without adding additional login time. The user device can communicate with the voice biometrics cloud server directly or via cloud server .

The user device also indicates which document it wants to be in the DMR request. In an embodiment the user can load a document from a documents database thereby sending the data of the file to the cloud server . In other embodiments the user device can send a pointer or a location of a file on the agent side network where the user selects a document name from a list of documents but the user device may not have access to the document itself from the documents database . In an embodiment the documents database can be populated by a DMR request to the agent side network for a list of documents in a particular location or document management system and subsequent response sending the list or documents themselves to the user device or documents database .

An agent of the agent side network receives the DMR request. The agent is operatively coupled to a print ready queue a list of devices a print with attributes module an authentication module and a cost recovery clients module . Upon receiving a DMR request the agent can analyze and unpackage the DMR request and store it in the print ready queue . The agent can further access the print with attributes module to determine whether the requested device e.g. printer is available for a new job. If so the agent can pop the item from the print ready queue and send it to the device . In another embodiment each device of the agent side network can have its own print ready queue . Further the agent can bypass the print ready queue by determining the device is ready to receive print jobs and sending the job to the print with attributes module directly.

The print with attributes module is also operatively coupled with a cost and tracking module . The cost and tracking module tracks and calculates cost of each job executed at each device. Such calculations are stored in a transactions database . A cost recovery clients module coupled to the agent can use the data of the transactions database combined with client information for each job to assign costs to clients or other third parties.

An authentication module is coupled with the agent to provide authentication details to each user. Authentication determines whether the user is authorized to print to a given device .

Upon receiving the document resource request from the cloud the agent determines whether the document resource request is from an authenticated user by comparing it to entries in an authentication module . Then the agent sends a document resource request to the print ready queue to be sent to resources as described in relation to . The agent can further forward the document resource request to other components such as a cost tracking module or a non printing resource like a document management resource for loading and saving files on a network.

In an embodiment of the present invention a system provides an agent that is the middleware between a cloud server and an enterprise print management and authentication systems. Mobile and or desktop users can communicate document management requests to the cloud e.g. a cloud server . The enterprise print manager communicates with the Agent not directly with the cloud nor directly with the mobile devices.

The agent brokers requests from the cloud and indirectly from the user and requests back to the cloud and indirectly to the user . The agent therefore facilitates linking mobile devices to a private network authenticating users on the enterprise s authentication system accessing a list of available enterprise printers uploading new documents and accessing previously uploaded documents converting documents to a universal print ready format printing documents on any device tracking all print usage and limiting and controlling usage.

After installation on an enterprise network the agent automatically registers with the cloud server. The agent begins receiving document resource requests e.g. provide a list of all printers from the cloud server by the agent s polling the cloud server and the cloud server s responding to the polling request with the document resource request. The requests can be made using HTTPS and the Representational State Transfer REST protocol. The agent polling the cloud server eliminates the need to open additional URLs e.g. endpoints or ports from within the firewall to the public internet. IT managers can implement the system of the present invention easier with fewer security concerns. The agent handles all communications with other enterprise components.

A document available at a mobile device whether it comes from email the web or the mobile application can be transferred to the Cloud server or subsequently the agent via the mobile application. The cloud server may hold the request in a queue or send it to the agent to be printed acted upon. Prior to using the mobile application a user is authenticated using the same credentials used to print internal to the enterprise network. Document activity can be tracked according to multiple print attributes and the tracking can be stored in a transaction database. A user may print or release documents with print attributes such as color or black and white duplex paper tray or page range for any printer.

The agent of the present invention further is able to record cost and transactions for all printing activity based on the print attributes. The agent is further able to extend the mobile device s human interface by employing a Natural Language Understanding NLU Interface. The agent further can add authentication by employing voice biometrics. The agent can further charge back printing activity to a 3party.

NLU allows a user to mix voice and touch to use a single uninterrupted utterance to trigger an entire printing process including attributes. For example the user can say print three copies in color and double sided on my Xerox Printer that I call Big Guy of the last 3 documents from DropBox . The agent can also mix useful utterances with touch activity to select the printer and documents and then say print three copies in black and white on the bottom tray. The agent can also use a conversational exchange 

All Voice Requests are streamed to a voice cloud and converted to text using an Extensible Markup Language XML based grammar. Furthermore the grammar s parse sentence fragments into meaningful containers called agents. Each set of related agents are grouped together in an agency. All necessary agencies to fulfill a complete task are grouped into the conversation. Grammars agents and agencies combined with state aware graphical user interface GUI logic resolve ambiguous voice commands into meaningful actions. For example the command print two copies of the first two works when documents are in view on the device. Otherwise the device prompts for clarification.

One challenge with NLU systems is taking a customer supplied list of items such as contact lists or document names and making them available to be spoken and understood by current NLU Grammars. The agent provides a list phonetic cleanser to solve the issue. Take for example the Document Title AXE 13 2013.doc . How should a system understand what a user may say to identify this document The agent resolves this problem with a number of enhancements. First in one embodiment the agent removes the file extension e.g. reduces the example file name to AXE 13 2013 . Then the agent replaces any non alphanumeric or space with a space e.g. AXE 13 2013 . If two capital letters are adjacent the agent separates them with a space e.g. A X E 13 2013 . Then the agent adds a space after any number e.g. A X E 1 3 2 0 1 3 . The agent then removes trailing spaces or more than one consecutive space to give a final result of A X E 1 3 2 0 1 3 . The user can identify the title by voice by saying each letter and number. The user can phonetically say Ay Ex Ee one three two oh one three to identify the file.
