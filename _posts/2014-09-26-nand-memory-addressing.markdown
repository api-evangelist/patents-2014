Memory devices are typically provided as internal semiconductor integrated circuits in computers or other electronic devices. There are many different types of memory including random access memory RAM read only memory ROM dynamic random access memory DRAM synchronous dynamic random access memory SDRAM and flash memory.

Flash memory devices have developed into a popular source of non volatile memory for a wide range of electronic applications. Flash memory devices typically use a one transistor memory cell that allows for high memory densities high reliability and low power consumption. Changes in threshold voltage of the cells through programming of a charge storage node e.g. a floating gate or charge trap or other physical phenomena e.g. phase change or polarization determine the data state of each cell. Common uses for flash memory include personal computers personal digital assistants PDAs digital cameras digital media players digital recorders games appliances vehicles wireless devices cellular telephones and removable memory modules and the uses for flash memory continue to expand. These expanded uses in concert with the growing size of data generated or required by many operations continue to increase the demand for large memory size.

In general flash memories can use one of two basic architectures known as NOR flash and NAND flash. The designation is derived from the logic used to read the devices. In NOR flash architecture a logical column of memory cells is coupled in parallel with each memory cell coupled to a data line such as those typically referred to as bit lines. In NAND flash architecture a column of memory cells is coupled in series with only the first memory cell of the column coupled to a bit line.

As the performance and complexity of electronic systems increase the requirement for additional memory in a system also increases. However it is desirable that the parts count be minimized in order to continue to reduce the costs of the system. This can be accomplished by increasing the memory density of an integrated circuit by using such technologies as multilevel cells MLC . For example MLC NAND flash memory is a very cost effective non volatile memory.

Multilevel cells can take advantage of the analog nature of a traditional flash cell by assigning a data state e.g. a bit pattern to a specific threshold voltage Vt range of the cell. Multilevel levels can permit the storage of two or more bits of information per cell depending on the quantity of voltage ranges assigned to the cell and the stability of the assigned voltage ranges during the lifetime operation of the memory cell.

A technology is described for accessing individual memory units in a NAND memory. The memory units can be accessed via a particular address associated with each of the memory units. The memory units in the NAND memory can also be referred to as dies or logical unit number LUNs . The terms dies and LUNs can be used interchangeably herein. The memory units can be addressed in the NAND memory in order to perform a read operation a write operation or an erase operation with respect to the memory units. The memory controller can use a defined number of address cycles to address a particular column page block plane and logical unit number LUN in the NAND memory. Each address cycle can provide eight bits and therefore the memory controller can use up to 40 bits e.g. five address cycles or up to 48 bits e.g. six address cycles to address the individual memory units in the NAND memory.

In one example a memory controller can use a defined number of address cycles to address the individual memory units in the NAND memory e.g. five address cycles in a legacy mode or six address cycles . In other words in specific embodiments the memory controller is capable of supporting five or six address cycles. In other embodiments other numbers of address cycles may be used as required depending on the logic of the controller and or the NAND memory device. The memory controller can configure the NAND memory to operate at a selected number of address cycles wherein the selected number of address cycles corresponds with a capability of the NAND memory. In one configuration the NAND memory can be capable of switching from five address cycles to six address cycles via the switching element in the NAND memory e.g. a fuse when the defined number of address cycles supported at the memory controller is six address cycles. In another example the NAND memory can be capable of switching from six address cycles to five address cycles via the switching element when the defined number of address cycles supported at the memory controller is five address cycles. As further elaborate herein in some embodiments the memory controller can switch its level of address cycles to accommodate the number of cycles in the NAND memory.

In one configuration the NAND memory can be configured to support a memory controller that operates using a fixed number of address cycles e.g. 5 or 6 address cycles . For example the NAND memory may operate in a default mode of six address cycles but certain configurations of the NAND memory e.g. configurations that vary based on a density of the NAND memory may support five address cycles. In this case the NAND memory can be defaulted to using six address cycles but a legacy memory controller e.g. a memory controller that only supports five address cycles can be used with the NAND memory if the memory controller overwrites a switching device or element for example a fuse on the NAND memory thereby switching the NAND memory from six address cycles to five address cycles. Therefore the NAND memory can maintain backwards compatibility with memory controllers that operate in a legacy mode i.e. five address cycles . This principle in operation and configuration also applies if the number of address cycles in the memory controller is greater than the number of address cycles that is preset in the NAND memory device. For example the memory controller supports six address cycles and the NAND memory device configured to support either five or six address cycles but defaulted i.e. contains logic to five. In such case via the switching element or device the memory controller can re configure the NAND memory to operate in six address cycles.

In one example the memory controller can select the defined number of address cycles based on the density of the NAND memory. For example if the density of the NAND memory exceeds a defined threshold the memory controller can use six address cycles to address the individual memory units in the NAND memory. The density of the NAND memory can refer to a number of memory units per stack or per chip enable in the NAND memory. In addition the density can refer to whether the NAND memory supports single bit per cell SLC two bits per cell MLC or three bits per cell TLC . The memory controller can use a default number of address cycles e.g. 5 address cycles to address the individual memory units in the NAND memory when the density of the NAND memory does not exceed the defined threshold. Depending on the density of the NAND memory the memory controller can switch between using five address cycles and using six address cycles via the switching element in the NAND memory for addressing the memory units in the NAND memory. In other words the memory controller can overwrite a switching element or device i.e. a fuse in the NAND memory in order to switch between five address cycles and six address cycles or vice versa.

In one configuration the individual memory units can be addressed in the NAND memory using a multi die select MDS wherein each individual memory unit e.g. each LUN is addressable using a unique address that is generated based on a number of chip enables in the NAND memory and a number of memory units per chip enable.

In general individual memory units within the NAND memory e.g. dies or LUNs in the NAND memory can be addressed in order to perform read write or erase operations. For example during the write operation values can be written to the memory units in the NAND memory. A memory controller or an external controller can access the individual memory units in the NAND memory via addressing in order to perform the read write and erase operations. Alternatively a set of memory units that are together in a package within the NAND memory e.g. a package comprising 8 LUNs can be addressed in order to perform the read write or erase operations. Thus the read write or erase operations can be performed with respect to a plurality or an array of memory units in the NAND memory. In other words the memory controller can address the plurality of memory units in the NAND memory e.g. an entire page on a block at a given time. In addition to performing the addressing the memory controller can send a number of control signals to the NAND memory such as a chip enable CE a command latch enable CLE an address latch enable ALE and a write enable WE when performing memory related operations.

A standard convention can be used when addressing the NAND memory. For example a defined number of bits can be used to access the individual memory units or rows and columns of individual memory units in the NAND memory. In particular the bits can be used to access a defined number of columns pages blocks and LUNs within the NAND memory. As a non limiting example a NAND memory can include 16 000 columns 1000 pages 2000 blocks and 2 LUNs. The bits can be used to address each particular memory unit within the NAND memory i.e. each individual memory unit in the NAND memory is addressable and has a certain associated address. An address cycle can include 8 bits or one byte and multiple address cycles can be used to address the NAND memory. The address cycles can define which column which page which block and which LUN is to be used to perform read write or erase operations. In other words the five address cycles can be used for addressing a particular memory location within the NAND memory. Upon addressing the memory units via the multiple address cycles the memory controller can transmit a command to the NAND memory to direct the NAND memory to begin a particular operation.

As the density of NAND memory increases the number of columns pages blocks and or LUNs in a NAND memory device can also increase. In other words a greater number of bits are to be used for addressing all of the memory units within the NAND memory. As a non limiting example rather than using two bytes i.e. 16 bits to address the columns 18 bits can be used to address an increased number of columns in the NAND memory. In addition 10 bits can be used to address an increased number of pages in the NAND memory and 18 bits can be used to address an increased number of blocks and LUNs in the NAND memory. The number of bits 46 bits in this example for addressing the memory units in the NAND memory can exceed five address cycles and push into a sixth address cycle. Therefore in some situations six address cycles or up to 48 bits can be used to address the increased number of columns pages blocks and or LUNs in NAND memories with increased density. The density of the NAND memory can refer to a number of memory units per stack in the NAND memory e.g. 2 LUNs per stack or package and whether the NAND memory supports single bit per cell SLC two bits per cell MLC or three bits per cell TLC . Multiple LUNs or dies can be stacked together in a package within the NAND memory. In addition NAND memory can use multiple levels per cell so that additional bits can be stored using a same number of transistors. In general a greater number of bits are used to address NAND memories with TLC as opposed to NAND memories with SLC or MLC.

In one example six address cycles can be used to address NAND memories that are larger than 256 gigabits Gb . In another example the memory controller can use the six address cycles when the number of LUNs increases from two LUNs to 8 LUNs within a same package or chip enable in the NAND memory i.e. when the density of the NAND memory increases. In yet another example the memory controller can use the six address cycles when the NAND memory uses TLC and has 8 LUNs within the same chip enable or package in the NAND memory.

In one example the memory controller can perform an intelligent decision on the number of address cycles to use based on the density of the NAND memory. For example if the density of the NAND memory is below a defined threshold then the memory controller can determine to use five address cycles when performing the addressing. If the density of the NAND memory is above the defined threshold then the memory controller can determine to use six address cycles when performing the addressing. As a non limiting example the density can be above the defined threshold when the NAND memory uses TLC and has 8 LUNs within the same chip enable in the NAND memory. In addition the memory controller can use six cycles as a default mode but if the density of the NAND memory being addressed is below the defined threshold the memory controller can switch to using five cycles. Alternatively the memory controller can use five cycles as a default mode and if necessary the memory controller can switch to using six cycles. The memory controller can detect the number of LUNs or dies per chip enable or package and a mode that the NAND memory is operating at e.g. SLC MLC or TLC and then determine whether to use five address cycles or six address cycles to perform the addressing.

In one example the NAND memory can have a switching element or device such as a fuse that when powered automatically causes the NAND memory to start in a default mode of five address cycles or six address cycles. Although the fuse can cause the NAND memory to start at five address cycles the memory controller can overwrite the fuse in order to switch the NAND memory from operating in five address cycles to operating in six address cycles. Alternatively the fuse can cause the NAND memory to start at six address cycles but the memory controller can overwrite the fuse in order to switch the NAND memory from operating in six address cycles to operating in five address cycles. Therefore the NAND memory can be configured to support a capability of the memory controller. For example the NAND memory can be configured to operate in six address cycles when the memory controller is capable of only operating in six address cycles. Alternatively the NAND memory which operates using six address cycles as default can be reconfigured to operate in five address cycles when the memory controller is capable of only operating in five address cycles.

In one configuration the individual memory units in the NAND memory can be addressed using a multi die select MDS . Each individual memory unit can be addressable using a unique address that is associated with the individual memory unit. The unique address can be generated based on a number of memory units per chip enable and or package i.e. number of LUNs per chip enable and or package in the NAND memory. For example MDS can refer to a specific technique for addressing the different LUNs in a package within the NAND memory. An exemplary package in the NAND memory can include two or four or eight or sixteen LUNs or dies and each of the two or four or eight or sixteen LUNs have their own unique addressing. Therefore the memory controller can address particular LUNs in a package within the NAND memory by using a unique address associated with each of the LUNs in order to perform various operations e.g. read write or erase .

As previously discussed the address cycles can include a certain number of bits for addressing the LUNs. Based on the configuration of the MDS the LUNs can be given unique addressability within a target i.e. a chip enable in the NAND memory. If the target i.e. the chip enable in the NAND memory has one LUN there is no LUN addressability. When the NAND memory has four LUNs per target i.e. chip enable two bits can be used as part of the five or six address cycles to address one of the four LUNs. When the NAND memory has eight LUNs per target i.e. chip enable three bits can be used as part of the five or six address cycles to address one of the eight LUNs. When the NAND memory has sixteen LUNs per target i.e. chip enable four bits can be used as part of the five or six address cycles to address one of the sixteen LUNs.

In one example the NAND memory can have several LUNs per chip enable within a package. The chip enable can be a chip select i.e. a technique for selecting particular LUN s so that the LUN s are ready to accept commands from the memory controller. There can be several chip enables per package in the NAND memory. The memory controller can access a target i.e. a chip enable in the NAND memory and within that target there can be several addressable LUNs.

In one example the MDS and the chip enable can be input to the NAND memory. In other words these are input signals to the NAND memory that are communicated from an external controller such as the memory controller. The chip enable can be used to communicate with the different LUNs in the NAND memory. The memory controller can use the chip enable to enable a certain LUN or die in the NAND memory. If every LUN or die in the NAND memory has its own chip enable input e.g. a dedicated signal then MDS may not be used because each LUN or die has its own chip enable and the memory controller that enables that chip enable can make that particular LUN or die active. In this example there can be no need to distinguish between different LUNs or dies in a stack of LUNs or dies. However it can be costly to have chip enables for each LUN. Therefore chip enables can be shared between multiple LUNs. If one chip enable that enables the LUN is shared between four LUNs the MDS can be used to define which LUN is to be accessed by the memory controller. Therefore in a package with four LUNs the MDS can define a first LUN as die a second LUN as die a third LUN as die and a fourth LUN as die. The memory controller even if the LUNs share the same chip enable can use the address cycles included in program and read commands to address each LUN individually and to program and or read independently. Each LUN that is sharing a chip enable in the package can have an associated binary code e.g. a LUN address that provides unique addressability within that target i.e. the chip enable . The address can vary depending on whether the package has one chip enable or multiple chip enables.

In one example there can be four MDS pads for each LUN in the package. There can be a ground plane and a power plane in the package. Each one of the four paths can be bonded to either ground or Vcc either 0 or 1 . In other words if an MDS value is 0 then the path for that LUN is grounded and if the MDS value is 1 then the path for that LUN is tied to Vcc. Based on the four MDS paths that are set the binary code can be assigned to each LUN in the package thereby providing the LUN with unique addressability.

In one example the memory controller can operate using six address cycles. The NAND memory can be reconfigured via a fuse on the NAND memory to support the six address cycles that are used at the memory controller. Therefore the memory controller can use six cycles when the NAND memory is operating according to the MLC configuration and one two or four LUNs are included per chip enable in the NAND memory. In addition the memory controller can use six cycles when the NAND memory is operating according to the TLC configuration and one or two LUNs are included per chip enable in the NAND memory.

In one example the memory controller can operate in a six address cycle mode as default when the NAND memory is operating according to the MLC configuration and at least eight LUNs e.g. 8 or 16 LUNs are included per chip enable in the NAND memory. In addition the memory controller can operate in the six cycle mode as default when the NAND memory is operating according to the TLC configuration and four eight or sixteen LUNs are included per chip enable in the NAND memory.

In one example the memory controller can operate using five address cycles. The NAND memory can be reconfigured via a fuse on the NAND memory to support the five address cycles that are used at the memory controller. Therefore the memory controller can use five cycles when the NAND memory is operating according to the MLC configuration and one two or four LUNs are included per chip enable in the NAND memory. In addition the memory controller can use five cycles when the NAND memory is operating according to the TLC configuration and one or two LUNs are included per chip enable in the NAND memory.

In one example the memory controller can operate in a six cycle mode i.e. six address cycles as default when the NAND memory is operating according to the MLC configuration and at least eight LUNs e.g. 8 or 16 LUNs are included per target i.e. chip enable in the NAND memory. In addition the memory controller can operate in the six cycle mode as default when the NAND memory is operating according to the TLC configuration and four eight or sixteen LUNs are included per target i.e. chip enable in the NAND memory.

Another example provides functionality of circuitry of a memory controller operable to perform addressing in a NAND memory as shown in the flow chart in . The functionality can be implemented as a method or the functionality can be executed as instructions on a machine where the instructions are included on at least one computer readable medium or one non transitory machine readable storage medium. The memory controller can be configured to identify a defined number of address cycles supported at either the memory controller or the NAND memory to address individual memory units in the NAND memory as in block . The memory controller can be configured to select the defined number of address cycles in which to operate in order to address the individual memory units in the NAND memory as in block . The memory controller can be configured to configure either the memory controller or the NAND memory to operate at the selected number of address cycles as in block .

In one example the defined number of address cycles supported at the memory controller is five address cycles or six address cycles. In another example the defined number of address cycles supported at the NAND memory is five address cycles or six address cycles. In yet another example the memory controller can be further configured to modify a switching element in the NAND memory when configuring the NAND memory to operate at the selected number of address cycles.

In another example the memory controller can be further configured to address the individual memory units in the NAND memory in order to perform at least one of a read operation a write operation or an erase operation.

In one configuration the memory units in the NAND memory are one of dies logical unit number LUNs or chips. In another configuration the NAND memory is at least 256 gigabits Gb in size. In yet another configuration the address cycles for addressing the individual memory units in the NAND memory are included in a series of setup commands that are communicated from the memory controller to the NAND memory. In one example the defined number of address cycles are used to address a column a page a block a plane and a logical unit number LUN in the NAND memory. In addition each address cycle provides up to 8 bits for addressing the individual memory units in the NAND memory.

The switching device can have a first configuration allowing the memory structures to operate at the predetermined number of addressing cycles and a second configuration allowing the memory structures to operate at a number of addressing cycles that is different from the predetermined number of addressing cycles. In one example the predetermined number of addressing cycles in the first configuration is five address cycles or six address cycles. In another example the memory structures operate according to the second configuration in order to correspond with a capability of a memory controller that is communicating with the NAND memory device .

A row decode circuitry and a column decode circuitry are provided to decode address signals provided to the memory device . Address signals are received and decoded to access memory array . Memory device also includes input output I O control circuitry to manage input of commands addresses and data to the memory device as well as output of data and status information from the memory device . An address register is coupled between I O control circuitry and row decode circuitry and column decode circuitry to latch the address signals prior to decoding. A command register is coupled between I O control circuitry and control logic to latch incoming commands. Control logic controls access to the memory array in response to the commands and generates status information for an external processor also known as a memory controller as described earlier . The control logic is coupled to row decode circuitry and column decode circuitry to control the row decode circuitry and column decode circuitry in response to the addresses.

Control logic can be coupled to a sample and hold circuitry . The sample and hold circuitry latches data either incoming or outgoing in the form of analog data signals. For example the sample and hold circuitry could contain capacitors or other analog storage devices for sampling either an incoming data signal representing data to be written to a memory cell or an outgoing data signal indicative of the threshold voltage sensed from a memory cell. The sample and hold circuitry can further provide for amplification and or buffering of the sampled signal to provide a stronger data signal to an external device.

The handling of analog data signals can take an approach where charge levels generated are stored on capacitors. A charge can be stored on a capacitor in response to subjecting it to a data signal indicative of an actual or target threshold voltage of a memory cell for reading or programming respectively the memory cell. This charge could then be converted to an analog data signal using a differential amplifier having a grounded input or other reference signal as a second input. The output of the differential amplifier could then be passed to the I O control circuitry for output from the memory device in the case of a read operation or used for comparison during one or more verify operations in programming the memory device. It is noted that the I O control circuitry could optionally include analog to digital conversion functionality and digital to analog conversion DAC functionality to convert read data from an analog data signal to a digital bit pattern and to convert write data from a digital bit pattern to an analog signal such that the memory device could be adapted for communication with either an analog or digital data interface.

During a programming operation target memory cells of the memory array are programmed until voltages indicative of their Vt levels match the levels held in the sample and hold circuitry . This can be accomplished as one example using differential sensing devices to compare the held voltage level to a threshold voltage of the target memory cell. Much like traditional memory programming programming pulses could be applied to a target memory cell to increase its threshold voltage until reaching or exceeding the desired value. In a read operation the Vt levels of the target memory cells are passed to the sample and hold circuitry for transfer to an external processor not shown in either directly as analog signals or as digitized representations of the analog signals depending upon whether ADC DAC functionality is provided external to or within the memory device.

Threshold voltages of cells can be determined in a variety of manners. For example an access line such as those typically referred to as word lines voltage could be sampled at the point when the target memory cell becomes activated. Alternatively a boosted voltage could be applied to a first source drain side of a target memory cell and the threshold voltage could be taken as a difference between its control gate voltage and the voltage at its other source drain side. By coupling the voltage to a capacitor charge would be shared with the capacitor to store the sampled voltage. Note that the sampled voltage need not be equal to the threshold voltage but merely indicative of that voltage. For example in the case of applying a boosted voltage to a first source drain side of the memory cell and a known voltage to its control gate the voltage developed at the second source drain side of the memory cell could be taken as the data signal as the developed voltage is indicative of the threshold voltage of the memory cell.

Sample and hold circuitry can include caching i.e. multiple storage locations for each data value such that the memory device can be reading a next data value while passing a first data value to the external processor or receiving a next data value while writing a first data value to the memory array . A status register is coupled between I O control circuitry and control logic to latch the status information for output to the external processor.

Memory device receives control signals at control logic over a control link . The control signals can include a chip enable CE a command latch enable CLE an address latch enable ALE and a write enable WE . Memory device can receive commands in the form of command signals addresses in the form of address signals and data in the form of data signals from an external processor over a multiplexed input output I O bus and output data to the external processor over I O bus .

In a specific example commands are received over input output I O pins of I O bus at I O control circuitry and are written into command register . The addresses are received over input output I O pins of bus at I O control circuitry and are written into address register . The data can be received over input output I O pins for a device capable of receiving eight parallel signals or input output I O pins for a device capable of receiving sixteen parallel signals at I O control circuitry and are transferred to sample and hold circuitry . Data also can be output over input output I O pins for a device capable of transmitting eight parallel signals or input output I O pins for a device capable of transmitting sixteen parallel signals. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that additional circuitry and signals can be provided and that the memory device of has been simplified to help focus on the embodiments of the disclosure.

While has been described with respect to sample and hold circuitry it should be understood that the control logic could be coupled to data latches instead of sample and hold circuitry without departing from the scope of the disclosure. Data latches latch data either incoming or outgoing. During a write operation target memory cells of the memory array are programmed for example using two sets of programming pulses as described above until voltages indicative of their Vt levels match the data held in the data latches. This can be accomplished as one example using differential sensing devices to compare the held data to a threshold voltage of the target memory cell.

Additionally while the memory device of has been described in accordance with popular conventions for receipt and output of the various signals it is noted that the various embodiments are not limited by the specific signals and I O configurations described. For example command and address signals could be received at inputs separate from those receiving the data signals or data signals could be transmitted serially over a single I O line of I O bus . Because the data signals represent bit patterns instead of individual bits serial communication of an 8 bit data signal could be as efficient as parallel communication of eight signals representing individual bits.

Various techniques or certain aspects or portions thereof can take the form of program code i.e. instructions embodied in tangible media such as floppy diskettes CD ROMs hard drives non transitory computer readable storage medium or any other machine readable storage medium wherein when the program code is loaded into and executed by a machine such as a computer the machine becomes an apparatus for practicing the various techniques. Circuitry can include hardware firmware program code executable code computer instructions and or software. A non transitory computer readable storage medium can be a computer readable storage medium that does not include signal. In the case of program code execution on programmable computers the computing device can include a processor a storage medium readable by the processor including volatile and non volatile memory and or storage elements at least one input device and at least one output device. The volatile and non volatile memory and or storage elements can be a RAM EPROM flash drive optical drive magnetic hard drive solid state drive or other medium for storing electronic data. The node and wireless device can also include a transceiver module a counter module a processing module and or a clock module or timer module. One or more programs that can implement or utilize the various techniques described herein can use an application programming interface API reusable controls and the like. Such programs can be implemented in a high level procedural or object oriented programming language to communicate with a computer system. However the program s can be implemented in assembly or machine language if desired. In any case the language can be a compiled or interpreted language and combined with hardware implementations.
