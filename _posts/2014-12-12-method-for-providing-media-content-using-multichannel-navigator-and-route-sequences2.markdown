This application is a divisional application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 407 138 filed Feb. 28 2012 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

Embodiments of the present invention relate generally to providing media content. More particularly embodiments of the invention relate to providing media content using multi channel navigator and route sequences.

Prior to the advent and prolific use of distributed network environments such as the Internet customer service sessions typically occurred over a teleconference between a customer service agent or service specialist and a customer. These teleconferences which incidentally are still very popular today are initiated by a customer placing a phone call to a customer service agent. The customer service agent s phone receives the call through a public switched telephone network PSTN . Many support centers handle a large volume of inquiries usually by phone for sales information customer support and other services. Typical support centers provide the ability to route multiple incoming customer initiated calls to agents which provide sales information or support on behalf of an entity interested in establishing or maintaining a relationship with the customer.

Modern support center systems selectively route incoming calls based on a number of factors such as the number called or dialed the originating number the queued sequence of the caller the geographic location of the caller accumulated caller history and other relevant criteria. Once the system has evaluated the inbound caller s information if any the system searches for an available agent to service the call. Availability of agents may be dependent on any number of factors such as a skill area level of that skill and or a schedule of the agent. The number of agents within the contact center and available to the system may often be limited by the physical space available for the agents to operate. Contact centers have to deal with a limited number of agents to handle a large number of incoming customer calls. Typically when an end user initiates a contact with the service center the end user has to know or maintain the detailed information regarding how to reach people and or obtain services from the service center. Often more decisions have to be made at the point in time and sometimes it is time consuming. There has been a lack of user friendly mechanisms to manage such information such that fewer time consuming decisions are required during the time of contact to obtain the required service.

Various embodiments and aspects of the inventions will be described with reference to details discussed below and the accompanying drawings will illustrate the various embodiments. The following description and drawings are illustrative of the invention and are not to be construed as limiting the invention. Numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of various embodiments of the present invention. However in certain instances well known or conventional details are not described in order to provide a concise discussion of embodiments of the present inventions.

Reference in the specification to one embodiment or an embodiment means that a particular feature structure or characteristic described in conjunction with the embodiment can be included in at least one embodiment of the invention. The appearances of the phrase in one embodiment in various places in the specification do not necessarily all refer to the same embodiment.

According to some embodiments a platform is provided to allow a user or an administrator to configure a route sequence map to help in guiding a user to navigate through a selection of available resources provided by a service center such as obtaining support services from a support service agent concerning a product or service provided by a client of the service center. Resources provided by a service center may also include automated platforms or self service applications which provide support services to the user. A route sequence map is a collection of route sequences pulled together allowing a variety of operations to be performed via a service center and initiated from a single application. A route sequence map can logically represent a global route context of a user that can lead to a variety of actions performed and or one or more further route sequences of one or more related subject matters. Once a route sequence map has been configured a user can initiate from an application from a variety of platforms e.g. mobile phone laptop tablet and desktop to navigate or tour the preconfigured resources associated with the route sequence map available from the service center without having to provide detailed information regarding how to access those resources at runtime. As a result the user experience with the service center can be greatly enhanced.

According to one embodiment the service center provides a configuration interface such as an application programming interface API a locally or hosted installed application or a Web based interface e.g. Web portal via a variety of communication protocols to allow an end user or an administrator of a corporate client to configure and or create a route sequence map for the end user e.g. individual persons who choose to create personal or shared navigation maps or users associated with the corporate client e.g. employees of a corporation and or buyers of products associated with a retailer or manufacturer . A created route or sequence map is considered owned by the creator and may be private or shared to designated users or the general public. A route sequence map can be utilized as a road or navigation map allowing a user navigating elements or nodes of the route sequence map to reach certain resources available from the service center without requiring the user to specifically provide detailed information at runtime.

In one embodiment a route sequence map includes various context elements or nodes which when toured appear arranged in a hierarchical structure. Each context element includes a property having one or more property values or attributes that can be used to specify one or more actions and or one or more links to one or more other context elements e.g. child context elements . A user or administrator can configure via a configuration interface of the service center to populate the property values of each context element. A context element can be one of an action context element and a navigation context element. An action context element can be configured such that when activated will cause the service center to perform an action using a method specified by one or more property values of the action context element. For example an action context element can be configured to cause the service center to contact a particular person e.g. friend or family member of a user or a service support agent of the service center using a particular communication method e.g. voice email text such as short message system SMS or multimedia messaging service MMS video chat or a combination thereof . As a result when a user activates this action context element from an application such as a mobile phone application the service center can look up the property values of the corresponding action context element and to establish a communication session with a remote user associated with the action context element using a communication method specified by the action context element without having the local user to provide the detailed information regarding how to reach the remote user at runtime.

A navigation context element can be configured that when activated one or more related context elements can be identified that are related to the activated context element. During the configuration phase a user can specify what other context elements e.g. child context elements are related to the current context element. The related context elements can include an action context element and or another navigation context element that leads to one or more further context elements e.g. grandchild context elements . For example a context element Finance can be configured to be associated with one or more child context elements such as Chase Bank of America and Wells Fargo etc. In this way a user can group or associate all of the financial institutes under the Finance context element and navigate each of the associated child context elements from there without having to search and provide details how to each those entities. Alternatively the Finance context element can be associated with a child action context element such as a Call My Financial Advisor context element that when activated will make a voice call to the specified finance advisor which may be specified in one or more property values of the Call My Financial Advisor context element. As a result the user does not have to provide detailed information of how to call its financial advisor at run time. It is also possible to combine user information gathered during a registration activity which is contained in or managed by the users profile or by the provider of the navigation map to be included in the information provided to the financial advisor for the benefit of provided more efficient service and fostering an environment of relatedness. The configured route sequence map can then be stored in a database of the service center such as user database and or client database. Such a route sequence map can be retrieved subsequently by the service center in response to a request or command received from an application running at a remote device over a network.

According to one embodiment an application also referred to as a navigation application can be provided and installed at a device of a user such as a mobile phone laptop desktop or a Web based application. When the application is launched from a client device such as a mobile phone the application is to access the service center over a network for authenticating a user of the client device for example based on username and password of a user associated with the client device and or a unique device identifier ID of the client device. Once the user has been successfully authenticated by the service center the service center retrieves a route sequence map from a user database and or client database that has been previously configured and stored and transmits information representing the route sequence map to the client device to be presented at a display of the client device. The provider of the route sequence map may elect at their discretion to provide route sequence maps for users who have not been authenticated and are considered anonymous clients.

According to one embodiment a route sequence map is displayed in multiple rows of graphical representations each graphical representation corresponding to a context element of the route sequence map. An inner or lower row of the route sequence map represents a parent row to a child row displayed as an outer or upper row of the route sequence map. When a graphical representation of an inner or lower row is selected e.g. highlighted an ID of the selected graphical representation is transmitted by the application of the client device to the service center over a network. Based on the ID the service center is to identify a selected context element of the route sequence map. If the selected context element is an action context element the service center is to perform an action that is specified in a property value of the selected context element using a method specified in a property value of the selected context element. If the selected context element is a navigation context element the service center is to identify one or more child context elements associated with the selected context element and transmit the information of the child context elements to the client device. The client device is to display one or more graphical representations representing the one or more child context elements in an outer or upper row while the selected graphical representation remains highlighted in the inner or lower row. As a result the user can easily navigate context elements of the route sequence map via the application without the hassles of managing the individual elements of the route sequence and their detailed settings. The selection and delivery of child context elements may be controlled in many ways including but not limited to user profile information time of day geographic location and a variety of defined business rules.

Service center may be implemented in a centralized facility or server. Alternatively service center may be implemented in multiple facilities or servers in a distributed manner e.g. cloud based service platforms . Service center provides services to a variety of products or services from a variety of clients or vendors. A client may be a manufacturer a distributor a retailer a service provider or broker a purchasing facility e.g. Amazon Expedia or ISIS or a combination thereof. In one embodiment service center includes service APIs to communicate with other systems such as mobile device client s site social communities contact center including agents or experts client backend systems manufacturer backend systems eCommerce sites and other auxiliary systems e.g. billing system . Service center can handle service requests from customers of multiple clients. For example a service center may handle customer service requests for a number of retail sales companies sales calls for catalog sales companies and patient follow up contacts for health care providers. In such a structure the service center may receive service requests directly from the customers or through client support management systems.

In one embodiment service center further includes community service system support services system route sequence manager and data warehouse . Support services system is responsible for handling support services requests from the users including identifying and registering a product creating an instance case context selecting and assigning a customer representative also referred to herein as an agent specialist or expert to provide support services to the users and managing work flows etc. An agent may be selected based on a skill set or expertise of the agent in a skill as well as other factors such as geographic location of the agent. The term agent specialist or expert refers to a service center personnel or a computerized application in some cases that respond to customer requests. An agent may be locally situated at the service center or remotely situated over a network. Throughout this application the terms of agent specialist and expert are interchangeable terms dependent upon the circumstances. In most cases the term of agent collectively refers to a customer representative a support agent a support specialist a support expert or a combination thereof which may be a service center personnel and or a computerized application.

Service center further includes other components such as a post market service system not shown which is responsible for handling post market activities associated with the registered products including selling a registered product on eCommerce sites and arranging a disposal facility to dispose or recycle the product etc.

According to one embodiment in addition to registering a product with the service center a user can also register for example through the application running within a mobile device one or more social communities and or one or more eCommerce sites by storing the necessary credentials e.g. usernames and passwords of the servers hosting the social communities and eCommerce sites in a database e.g. user database of the service center where the database is associated with a user the mobile device. Subsequently the user can transmit a sales request to sell or dispose a registered product by specifying one or more of the eCommerce sites.

In response to the sales request a post market service system of service center is configured to retrieve the necessary credentials for the specified one or more eCommerce sites and arrange the specified eCommerce sites for selling the product together with the associated credentials to allow the eCommerce sites to authenticate the user for the purpose of selling the product such that the user does not have to provide the necessary credentials at the point in time of the sales request and the user does not have to provide detailed information of the product to be posted on the eCommerce sites describing the product to be sold. A single sales request received from the mobile device can specify multiple eCommerce sites. The service center can also arrange a disposal facility to dispose e.g. recycle a registered product without having a user to specifically contact the disposal facility.

Similarly a user can also post a message to one or more of the registered social communities from the application running within the mobile device without having to individually access the social communities. In one embodiment a user can transmit a request from mobile device to service center where the request includes a message to be posted and one or more community identifiers identifying one or more registered social communities. In response community service system of service center is configured to retrieve the associated credentials from the database and to post the message to the specified social communities together with the associated credentials allow the social communities to authenticate the user without having to prompt the user for the same credentials. Further detailed information concerning community service system and or post market service system can be found in co pending U.S. patent application Ser.

In one embodiment a user can configure a set of one or more rules to specify whether certain types of messages or advertisements received from vendors or parties e.g. retailers manufacturers social communities or other advertisement providers which may or may not be related to a registered product should be routed to the user. These rules serve as part of message delivery or filtering rules. The service center engages with the related parties to allow the related parties to get in touch with the user by sending certain messages such as product promotions rewards and or recalls etc. to the user. The service center may send a message to a user via one or more communications channels preferred by the user which may also be configured as a set of rules and stored in a database associated with the user.

According to another embodiment an advertisement received from a vendor is delivered by the service center to a mobile device of a user based on a set of delivery rules associated with the user. The advertisement is displayed on a display of the mobile device by an application running therein. In addition the service center and or the application are configured to track interactions of the user with respect to the displayed advertisement to determine user behaviors patterns or trends in view of the displayed advertisement. An analysis is performed on the user interaction and the result of the analysis may be utilized to configure further advertisement delivery by the service center and or the vendors.

According to another embodiment service center is configured to identify users that have at least one common product registered with the service center and are also members of a social community. The service center is configured to send a message to those users to invite them to connect e.g. becoming friends or following a friend with each other via the social community. The social community is hosted by a third party and communicatively coupled to the service center over a network. The service center may also deliver messages or items posted by one of those users to another one of those users on behalf of the social community without requiring such users to individually or directly accessing the social community. The service center can also deliver messages or items to a particular user posted by other users of the social community where the messages or items are related to a registered product of that particular user.

According to a further embodiment an application running on a mobile device provides a user friendly graphical user interface GUI to allow a user to configure a set of one or more delivery rules concerning whether certain types of messages or advertisements should be received at the mobile device from a service center. The service center is configured to deliver messages or advertisements on behalf of a message or advertisement provider which can be a client to the service center a retailer a manufacturer a social community or other content providers. A user can utilize the GUI to configure for each of the providers whether a message associated with a particular registered product of the user or all products in general related to the provider should be received by the mobile device. The settings of the delivery rules are then transmitted from the mobile device to the service center to allow the service center to deliver subsequent messages or advertisements on behalf of the message or advertisement providers accordingly. Further detailed information concerning the advertisement system can be found in co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 185 309 filed Jul. 18 2011 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

In one embodiment data warehouse includes product database client database user database and knowledgebase . Product database is configured to store any data related to the registered products including user manuals etc. Client database is configured to store information related to clients such as client s preferred communications mechanisms. User database is used to store information related users such as for example registered products associated with a user communications channel preference of a user credentials necessary for a user to access other sites and or messaging filtering settings of a user etc. Knowledgebase is used to store knowledge collected and compiled over a period of time which can be used by agents and or users for self support purposes.

In one embodiment service center further includes a multi channel communication and routing system to provide one or more communication channels to any user or client to concurrently access service center . Examples of communication channels include email chat texting e.g. SMS or MMS voice e.g. automated IVR real time or VoIP video Web e.g. Web conferencing and or online community forum e.g. Facebook or Twitter or a combination thereof. Note that the multi channel communication and routing system may be fully or partially integrated with service center or alternatively it may be maintained or provided by a third party or partner e.g. communicatively coupled via service API over a network . Service center further includes an automatic caller distribution ACD system not shown to receive route and manage voice calls exchanged via the multi channel communication system. A customer can obtain support services from service center via a variety of communication mechanisms. A customer can initiate a support request to contact a live agent such as agents in a live manner. Alternatively a customer may browse certain knowledgebase such as KB via a Web interface in an attempt to find a solution to a problem of a product he she purchased from a manufacturer via a client of service center .

According to one embodiment application is installed on mobile device of a customer or user where application can serve as a central service point or entry point to service center that provides support services to a variety of products or services provided by a variety of vendors. The vendors can be for example manufacturers distributors retailers service brokers purchasing houses etc. of the products. Vendors may be the clients of service center or entities having a business relationship with service center . A user also referred to herein as a customer can activate application from the user s mobile device to reach agents the service center or KB data center via a variety of communication channels or media such as for example email chat voice including automated interactive voice recognition or IVR voice over Internet protocol or VoIP video Web and or online community based forum etc. Application can be a thin thick client application or a Web based application.

According to one embodiment service center further includes guided support identification system configured to analyze user interaction or behaviors to predict or determine a support subject matter that a user may potentially need. Such a support subject matter may be determined based on user interaction while a user is navigating a presentation provided by a remote device such as a Web site or an application running at computing device where the presentation e.g. application includes information describing a possible solution to a problem of a product or service which may be related to or similar to a product or service the user is interested in.

The user interaction may be captured e.g. by a capturing logic integrated within or accessible by the presentation at the remote device and transmitted to guided support identification system over a network while the user is navigating the presentation at remote device . Based on the predicted subject matter also referred to as a support type a skill set also referred to as a skill route that is required to provide support services of the subject matter is identified. When the user subsequently requests a live support for example within the same user session an agent having the identified skill set is selected to provide support services to the user. The user interaction may be periodically captured and transmitted to the service center during navigation of the presentation. In response guided support identification system is configured to automatically update and maintain the subject matter determined based on the latest user interaction prior to the user s request for a live support.

As a result the guided support identification system is able to get users in need of assistance to a specific skill or expert specialist that is able to support their request or need even before the user initiates a live support. Once the support subject matter and the required skill set have been identified a route context e.g. touch plan can be generated by support service system as described in the above incorporated by reference applications where the routing context includes all the necessary information an agent needs in order to provide the best support services to the user. Such an agent is referred to herein as a recommended agent recommended by the service center. A communications session is then established by multi channel communications and routing system and the routing context is routed to the selected agent. Further detailed information concerning guided support identification system can be found in co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 213 002 filed Aug. 18 2011 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

According to one embodiment guided support identification system is configured to maintain which agents a particular user has interacted with during previous support sessions and to store such information in a user database associated with the user. Such information may include user ratings of the agent by the user or other users subject matters of the previous support sessions or others. Some of these agents e.g. those rated relatively high by the user may be considered as preferred agents by the user dependent upon their respective ratings and or other factors. When a user initiates a subsequent support session such as a live support session information concerning one or more recommended agents provided by guided support identification system and or one or more preferred agents retrieved from the user database are transmitted from service center to remote device to be presented to the user. The user can select one of the recommended agents and preferred agents to establish a live support session. Alternatively the user can simply not select any of the preferred agents or recommended agents and instead let the system randomly assign an agent to the user.

In one embodiment guided support identification system includes a survey module not shown to provide a survey to a user at the conclusion of a support session to allow the user to provide a feedback or rating concerning a quality of the agent. The feedback or rating information is also stored e.g. as a new preferred agent or updated e.g. updating ratings of an existing preferred agent in a user database associated with the user as well as general agent databases shared amongst other users. Such feedback or ratings from the user may affect subsequent selections of the subsequent preferred agents and or recommended agents by guided support identification system . As a result when a user initiates a live support session the user can actively select an agent he she prefers or is familiar with which may improve customer satisfaction experience or measures.

According to one embodiment route sequence manager is configured to manage route sequence maps for a variety of users and or a variety of clients. Route sequence manager is to allow a user or an administrator to configure a route sequence map to help guiding a user to navigate resources available from a service center such as obtaining support services from a support service agent concerning a product or service provided by a client of the service center. A route sequence map is a collection of route sequences pulled together allowing a variety of operations to be performed via a service center and initiated from a single application such as application of client device . A route sequence map can logically represent a global route context of a user that can lead to a variety of actions performed and or one or more further route sequences of one or more related subject matters. Once a route sequence map has been configured via route sequence manager and stored in one of the databases a user can initiate from application from device to navigate the preconfigured resources associated with the route sequence map available from service center without having to provide detailed information regarding how to access those resources at runtime.

According to one embodiment route sequence manager of service center provides a configuration interface such as an application programming interface API or a Web based interface e.g. Web portal via a variety of communication protocols which may be implemented as part of API to allow an end user or an administrator of a corporate client to configure and or create a route sequence map for the end user or users associated with the corporate client e.g. employees of a corporation and or buyers of products associated with a retailer or manufacturer . A route sequence map can be utilized as a road or navigation map allowing a user navigating elements or nodes of the route sequence map to reach certain resources available from service center without requiring the user to specifically provide detailed information at runtime.

In one embodiment a route sequence map includes various context elements or nodes arranged in a hierarchical structure as shown in . Each context element includes a property having one or more property values or attributes that can be used to specify one or more actions and or one or more links to one or more other context elements e.g. child context elements . A user or administrator can configure via a configuration interface of the service center to populate the property values of each context element. A context element can be one of an action context element and a navigation context element. An action context element can be configured such that when activated will cause the service center to perform an action using a method specified by one or more property values of the action context element. For example an action context element can be configured to cause the service center to contact a particular person e.g. friend or family member of a user or a service support agent of the service center using a particular communication method e.g. voice email text video chat . As a result when a user activates this action context element from an application such as a mobile phone application service center can look up the property values of the corresponding action context element and to establish a communication session with a remote user associated with the action context element using a communication method specified by the action context element without having the local user to provide the detailed information regarding how to reach the remote user at runtime.

A navigation context element can be configured based on a variety of factors set forth above that when activated one or more related context elements can be identified that are related to the activated context element. During the configuration phase a user can specify what other context elements e.g. child context elements are related to the current context element. The related context elements can include an action context element and or another navigation context element that leads to one or more further context elements e.g. grandchild context elements . For example a context element Finance can be configured to be associated with one or more child context elements such as Chase Bank of America and Wells Fargo etc. In this way a user can group or associate all of the financial institutes under the Finance context element and navigate each of the associated child context elements from there without having to search and provide details for each of those entities. Alternatively the Finance context element can be associated with a child action context element such as a Call My Financial Advisor context element that when activated will make a voice call to the specified finance advisor which may be specified in one or more property values of the Call My Financial Advisor context element. As a result the user does not have to provide detailed information on how to call its financial advisor at run time. The configured route sequence map can then be stored in a database of the service center such as a user database and or client database. Such a route sequence map can be retrieved subsequently by route sequence manager of service center in response to a request or command received from application running at remote device over a network.

According to one embodiment application also referred to as a navigation application can be provided and installed at a device of a user such as a mobile phone laptop desktop or a Web based application. When application is launched from client device application is to access service center over a network e.g. Internet for authenticating a user of the client device for example based on username and password of a user associated with client device and or a unique device identifier ID of client device . Once the user has been successfully authenticated by service center route sequence manager of service center retrieves a route sequence map from a user database and or client database that has been previously configured and stored and transmits information representing the route sequence map to the client device to be presented at a display of client device by application .

According to one embodiment a route sequence map is displayed in multiple rows of graphical representations each graphical representation corresponding to a context element of the route sequence map. An inner or lower row of the route sequence map represents a parent row to a child row displayed as an outer or upper row of the route sequence map. When a graphical representation of an inner or lower row is selected e.g. highlighted an ID of the selected graphical representation is transmitted by application of client device to service center over a network which may be a local area network LAN a wide area network e.g. Internet or a combination thereof. Based on the ID service center is to identify a selected context element of the route sequence map. If the selected context element is an action context element service center is to perform an action that is specified in a property value of the selected context element using a method specified in a property value of the selected context element. If the selected context element is a navigation context element route sequence manager of service center is to identify one or more child context elements associated with the selected context element and transmit the information of the child context elements to the client device. The client device is to display one or more graphical representations representing the one or more child context elements in an outer or upper row while the selected graphical representation remains highlighted in the inner or lower row. As a result the user can easily navigate context elements of the route sequence map via the application without the hassles of managing the individual elements of the route sequence and their detailed settings.

Note that a service center described throughout this application is not limited to a traditional service center or support center nor is it implemented in a single physical location. A service center described herein represents a collection of service logic or providers communicatively coupled to each other over a network in a distributed or a cloud based fashion. The term of a service center herein represents any kind of service providers that provide a variety of services to customers or users. As described throughout this application a service center can be a set of enabling cloud based service APIs which enable a variety of consumer product services and support offerings via an intelligent set of technologies providing automated and or live communications. In one embodiment services provided by a service center can include but not limited to 1 user product and loyalty registration and support services 2 product wish list reviews and comparisons 3 purchasing and accessorizing services 4 social community support and integration services 5 intelligent knowledge support services and 6 integrated sales and product disposition services etc.

Also note that an agent an expert or a customer representative described throughout this application is not limited to a real person. The term of an agent an expert or a customer representative can also refer to any processing logic or functional block that is configured or programmed to provide automated services to a customer for example via the services APIs of the service center without a need of a real person involved. Such processing logic and or functional blocks can be implemented in software hardware or a combination thereof.

Note that an individual user route sequence map may include a context element that links to another route sequence map such as a corporate client route sequence map or vice versa. For example an individual user may have some base navigation context elements such as My Family My Friends and My Business where the My Business context element may link to a specific bank such as Wells Fargo context element which further links to a route sequence map associated with the Wells Fargo bank as a corporate client where the context element associated with the corporate client may be configured by an administrator of the corporate client for example for specifically obtaining support services associated with the corporate client. User database associated with a user may store a variety of information or data associated with the user such as for example personal contacts asset store e.g. registered products and user preferences e.g. preferred agents preferred communication channels credentials to access other sites such as online communities .

A route sequence map can logically represent a global route context of a user that can lead to a variety of actions performed and or one or more further route sequences of one or more related subject matters. Once a route sequence map has been configured a user can initiate from an application from a variety of platforms e.g. mobile phone laptop tablet and desktop to navigate the preconfigured resources associated with the route sequence map available from the service center without having to provide detailed information regarding how to access those resources at runtime. As a result the user experience with the service center can be greatly enhanced.

According to one embodiment the service center provides a configuration interface such as an application programming interface API a Web based interface e.g. Web portal or a previously installed client or hosted application via a variety of communication protocols to allow an end user or an administrator of a corporate client to configure and or create a route sequence map for the end user or users associated with the corporate client e.g. employees of a corporation and or buyers of products associated with a retailer or manufacturer . A route sequence map can be utilized as a road or navigation map allowing a user navigating elements or nodes of the route sequence map to reach certain resources available from the service center without requiring the user to specifically provide detailed information at runtime.

In one embodiment a route sequence map includes various context elements or nodes arranged in a hierarchical structure. Each context element includes a property having one or more property values or attributes that can be used to specify one or more actions and or one or more links to one or more other context elements e.g. child context elements . A user or administrator can configure via configuration module of route sequence manager to populate the property values of each context element.

In one embodiment a context element can be configured as one of an action context element and a navigation context element. An action context element can be configured such that when activated will cause the service center to perform an action using a method specified by one or more property values of the action context element. For example context element is an action context element can be configured to cause the service center to contact a particular person e.g. friend or family member of a user or a service support agent of the service center using a particular communication method e.g. voice email text video chat . In this example context element has been configured via its property when activated causing the service center to establish a voice communication session with another user Greg using a phone number that has also been specified in a property value of context element . As a result when a user activates this action context element from an application such as a mobile phone application the service center can look up the property values of the corresponding action context element and to establish a communication session with a remote user associated with the action context element using a communication method specified by the action context element without having the local user to provide the detailed information in this example specifying a voice call and or a phone number for the voice call regarding how to reach the remote user at runtime.

A navigation context element can be configured that when activated one or more related context elements can be identified that are related to the activated context element. During the configuration phase a user can specify what other context elements e.g. child context elements are related to the current context element e.g. context element . The related context elements can include an action context element e.g. context element and or another navigation context element e.g. context element that leads to one or more further context elements e.g. grandchild context elements . The configured route sequence map can then be stored in a database of the service center such as user database and or client database. Such a route sequence map can be retrieved subsequently by the service center in response to a request or command received from an application running at a remote device over a network.

Note that each of the context elements can be stored in a variety of data structures and linked to each other e.g. using a linked list data structure . In one embodiment master context provides default settings for its child context elements . Each of the child context elements can inherit or override the default settings by specifically specifying the same property value in its property. Alternatively certain property values can be left blank or unspecified in which case the system may automatically determine the proper values at the point in time. For example a user may leave the phone number in the property of context element blank during the configuration stage. Subsequently when a user activates from its application running at a remote client device an instruction is sent to the service center. In response the service center automatically determines a proper phone number associated with the user Greg of context element to establish a voice call. In this example user Greg may have multiple phone numbers e.g. work home and mobile phone numbers to be utilized in different situations. The service center may determine at the point in time for example based on presence information obtained via presence services that the voice call should be made to Greg s mobile phone number provided Greg has published its presence information. In this way the local user does not need to know what phone number of Greg should be use to make the voice call. Further user Greg may dynamically change his phone number from time to time. By leaving the phone number blank in context element the system can dynamically determine the correct phone number for Greg without having to statically specify it in the property of context element . Similarly the same techniques can be applied to other communication methods such as chat text and video etc.

According to one embodiment an application running at a client device can be a navigation application to navigate context elements of route sequence map a configuration application to configure context elements of route sequence map or a combination of both. When an application is launched from a client device as a navigation application e.g. application the application connects to service center via published API s accessible over the Internet for authentication. Once the user of the application has been successfully authenticated the route sequence manager of the service center transmit data representing route sequence map via published APIs to the client device to be displayed at a display of the client device by the application. Route sequence map may be displayed as rows of graphical representations e.g. icons or thumbnail images each graphical representation representing a context element or in another presentation form the client has created. An inner or lower row represents a parent level of context elements while an outer or upper row represents a child level of context elements.

Initially according to one embodiment data representing only the root level of context elements in this example context elements is transmitted to the remote device via published APIs and the graphical representations are displayed as the most inner or lowest row. When a user selects one of the graphical representations an ID of the selected graphical representation is sent back to the service center. The route sequence manager determines whether the selected context element is an action context element or a navigation context element. If the selected context element is a navigation context element the route sequence manager identifies based on the ID of the graphical representation a context element associated with the ID and identifies one or more child context elements of the selected context element. Data representing the child context elements is then transmitted via published APIs to the remote device and an outer or upper row of graphical representations corresponding to the child context elements are then displayed at the remote device. For example if a user selects a graphical representation corresponding to context element data representing child context elements is then transmitted via published APIs from the service center to the remote device and graphical representations corresponding to context elements are then displayed as an outer or upper row at the remote device. The graphical representations of an outer or upper row can be scrolled rotated or spun around an inner or lower row while the selected context element is highlighted in the inner or lower row. If the selected context element is an action context element the route sequence manager invokes an appropriate component or system of the service center to perform an action defined in a property of the selected context element.

According to one embodiment an application such as application also referred to herein as Navigator App is a mobile and or Web based application providing a user an entry point into the vast world of support services contacts and the organization and management of that information. A user uses the Navigator App to guide them via a few simple clicks down a short context based path to a support service or other type of routing activity. A user once guided through a short sequence presses a One Touch button to execute the activity a routing sequence for any support or service required on behalf of a business or other party. Once the sequence is executed the user is taken into a variety of support and service models most pre defined by the companies they have requested contact with.

The Navigator App eases the user into a rich context based support or service session with a company instead of the basic and typical methods employed today. The Navigator App can direct dial or toll free calling from a traditional PSTN public switched telephone network or mobile device to a support queue without any context of the support or service need. A company utilizing this model typically collects information from a user just to ask for the same information once the user gets to a support person or somewhere else in the support process. The Navigator App can support click to call from a web page into a support queue without any context of the support or service need click to chat from a web page into a support queue without any context of the support or service need email from a web site requesting support or services where the email subject is typically all that is utilized to determine context of the request and SMS from a mobile device into a support queue without any context of the support or service need. This is very limited in use due to the lack of support by most support systems.

A Navigator App can be a Personal Navigator App that will allow a user to create modify and delete items customize from their instance of navigator data and metadata from their mobile device. Within this customization is the ability to change the appearance skins and tie into their personal and social communities. They can publish selected data so that others using a navigator can link to their information via a sharing model. A Navigator App can also be a Business Navigator App that is predesigned by a business entity company and is displayed as such in a custom branded version of the App that a user would use for support and services with a business. A company could integrate this custom Navigator App into their own for ease of support for the user. Business can also publish their navigator data for inclusion in Business and Personal navigators.

All Routing Sequence changes can be made from the Service Center by the Business company and does not require a new version of the Navigator App on a mobile device or via a web page thus making the Navigator a dynamic application subject to real time routing sequence changes and refinement. Navigator definition data may be defined so that it is populated from external data sources in a real time model or periodic update model. Once a communication session has been established by the user the user is transitioned to the conversation Canvas and a dialog between the user and the Support Center is established.

Web Routing Sequences are predefined Routing Sequences context based that can be called from anywhere within a business personal web site where a Navigator App is not required. The Web Sequence called is made up of a variety of but not limited to specifics about a particular product service other item a customer would be selecting from the web site. Once a Routing Sequence is executed from a One Touch button the web site can provide additional information collected to further refine if necessary the proper routing of the user request. The predefined piece of information sets the context of a one touch button and when selected is transmitted to the service center to set the specific action and context for a user s support request which can be carried out via variety of programming languages such as extensible markup language XML as shown in or other script language such as hypertext markup language HTML as shown in .

A Personal Navigator App is for a user to utilize as a multi purpose app allowing the user to not only access specific context based support and services added as needed but to also access all their contacts from their mobile device in which the app is loaded. It is possible for the user to transfer their contacts into navigator information which is managed in the cloud by servers providing navigator services. This information will be secured and protected. Contact information can be enriched to use features offered by the navigator application. Enrichments include items such as external system access asset and service information social communities social communication and presence acquisition abilities.

The user can setup the app to either access or restrict access to their personal information and contact information including social communities as preferred. If access is granted the user can then utilize a single app for all communications of various channel types to their communities and contacts from the My Contacts or My Communities selections. A user would be presented a list of the contacts found and allow access to the navigator for any and all contacts. If a user wishes contacts can be further separated via My Friends My Family or other selections to reduce the list of contacts to select from. A new selection can be added to the Navigator via the Navigator configuration menu. A search function is always available as an option. The labels for each can be changed to allow a user to further customize. The user can add specific pre created business routing sequences to their Navigator App organized via the My Business selection each of these Routing Sequence Maps made available to users will be listed allowing the user to select the one s they require. Once the selected Routing Sequences are committed the dialer will update the view showing all the new selections requested.

A Business Navigator App is for custom skinned and prepped versions. This allows a company to either provide a custom version of the Navigator App to their customers which is skinned and Routing Sequences defined they may not have a mobile presence or to integrate the Navigator into their current mobile app to leverage and access Routing Sequences. The Routing Sequences demonstrated in the Personal Navigator App can be leveraged in the company version without recreation. Routing Sequences created for the Navigator App can also be used as a Web Routing Sequence via a company Web site.

A Navigator App can leverage the power of the service center and its vast support and service capabilities to execute a routing sequence. The Navigator App leverages any and all communication channels as prescribed by a business in support of their customers. Routing channels supported via the Support Center include Voice inbound and outbound via a PSTN VoIP b Skype Gtalk and Facetime Intelligent Communication networks other Intelligent Communications networks can be supported future . There is no need to dial a number for anything. The Navigator App knows how to contact and connect the user to the Service Center for any support or service via any communication channel. The Navigator App takes the place of the traditional DTMF dialer of a traditional or mobile phone.

The routing channels further include video inbound and outbound via Skype Gtalk and Facetime Intelligent Communication networks other Intelligent Communications networks can be supported future . The routing channels further include email inbound and outbound. Email is recommended as an outbound notification only channel from the Service Center as a result of a customer activity. The Navigator App is positioned as a self help and real time communication method for users. Email still can be supported by the Service Center directly. The routing channels further include chat inbound and outbound. Chat is a recommended communication channel for real time communication with a customer and is a lower cost alternative to voice or video communications. A Web Routing Sequence is used to set the context of the support or service need when coming from a Navigator App or company web site.

The routing channels further include SMS inbound and outbound. SMS is recommended as an outbound notification channel from the Service Center but is being adopted by mobile users as a Chat type of communications for inbound service and support. SMS and Chat support function in the same manner when delivered to a support associate via the Support Center. The routing channels further include social inbound and outbound. Social is a must have channel for all modern businesses today. Social posts from such communities as Twitter and Facebook can be leveraged for inbound and outbound support and service communications. These are most often supported directly from the communities to the Support Center and not via the Navigator App. Future implementations will allow access to such communities without having to leave the Navigator App. Other information sources such as vehicle status telemetry home monitoring alarm applications and other signal emitting services can be used to update navigator information and the presentation of that information to the benefit of the user.

According to some embodiments a dynamic routing sequence is a series of selections made by a user leading to a specific action to be taken on their behalf via the Service Center. The action once selected communicates with the Support Center via published APIs to invoke the request. Routing Sequences never are stored on the mobile device or web client. The Service Center is leveraged in all cases in order to maintain the latest up to date copy of one or a combination of Routing Sequences allowing a single Routing Sequence to be leveraged for millions of users to make changes to a single Routing Sequence in a single place for immediate availability in the next use to back up and make available any user generated data in the event that their mobile device fails and the Navigator App is loaded onto a new device. By authenticating themselves via the Navigator App on their new device they will resume access to all data.

The Navigator App calls a set of public API s built custom to support the capabilities of the Navigator App. The information transmitted to the Service Center includes but not limited to context based on the specific sequence selected from the Navigator App specific information about the user when prompted for additional information such as a question that they may ask via the knowledge answer engine of the Service Center and specific user identity if known via a user authentication with the Service Center.

A personal based route sequence map is a collection of Routing Sequences added to the users authenticated account and saved by the Service Center. They are added to the users account by the user as needed to reach out to a company for support and services. A business based sequence map is a collection of routing sequences added to a custom company Navigator App that provides some or all of the same access of support and services for the user as the Routing Sequence they would add to their Personal Navigator App. Sequence Maps are multi entrant meaning that any sub sequence of a map can be executed without having to travel the same path. Entry points to maps may be shared and become discoverable via web pages directory services search engines or point to point sharing with others using the navigator application.

According to one embodiment a master context provides context about the sequence s or map in an application. The context is set as a default and is inherited if not overridden by a sequence when a user selects thus base lining the overall context of a user s request when passed to a live associate or an automated system workflow. In one embodiment a master context can be configured as follows 

A navigation context element is used to guide a user to the next context element selected by a user. An action context element is used to invoke one of many types of actions including for example 

According to some embodiments the Support Center warehouses a number of Routing Sequence Maps and Routing Sequences for inclusion within a company s productions setup. All Routing Sequences are multi tenant with contextual information collected stored and secure from all other companies on the Support Center. All the Routing Sequences are maintained in the Support Center and accessible via public API s. With this SaaS software as a service model it makes it easy to leverage for any Mobile or Web Navigator App as well as other such apps to leverage. Presentation of the routing sequences within an application mobile or web can take on many different looks and feels depending on the intended audience. The examples provided illustrate some concepts on how to display the information necessary for the user to make choices based on fixed and real time information. Fixed information may be the presentation of a name or directive. Real time information may be whether the intended endpoint is available or on line presence information. Routing sequences can be created dynamically or via configuration tools provided with the product. These sequences are based on published XML Schemas which can be defined by the clients or by the application developers so that complete data for the execution of a sequence is ensured. Routing sequences can be defined to ask the user for further information via controls rendered within a web page as dialogues selections or text input controls.

From any of the context tile e.g. navigation tiles according to one embodiment the user can create further child context tiles by selecting any of the context tiles . In this example context tile is selected which is illustrated by a solid box while an unselected context tile is shown in a dash box . Once context tile is selected at least one context tile is shown in an upper row in this example row . The user can then edit the property of each of the context tiles in row . Similarly when a context tile of row is selected in this example context tile row is displayed and the use can further edit the property of each context tile such as property for context tile .

Note that when a context tile is selected only context tiles that are associated with e.g. child context tiles the selected context tile are displayed as an upper row with respect to a lower row of the selected context tile. In the example as shown in when context tile of bottom row is selected upper row only shows the context tiles that are related to the selected context tile . Similarly when context tile is selected upper row only shows the context tiles that are associated with context tile . If a different context tile is selected in a lower row different context tiles may be shown in an upper row. As shown in in this example context tile is selected in row now its immediate upper row only shows the context tiles that are associated with the selected context tile replacing the context tiles associated with the previously selected context tile now unselected .

Similarly as shown in the user can create a route sequence for My Business context tile . As described above when context tile is selected in bottom row its immediate upper row shows only context tiles that are associated with context tile and so on. For each of the action context tiles the user can edit its property to specify an action to be performed as shown in . Referring to property is associated with a master context. Property is associated with context tile property is associated with context tile and property is associated with context tile . For example for context tile which is to ask a question a user creating a sequence map can populate in property of to specify the initial question to be asked a communication method override to be used e.g. chat a skill set of a service agent required and the buttons to display allowing a user to select e.g. chat and voice for support upchanneling to live support as needed. Upchanneling buttons can be displayed only when specific business rules are achieved such as a user has not received an answer to a question submitted or a user has asked an inordinate number of questions and appear to be poking around the answer system. At this point they may need live support to address their needs. Subsequently when context tile is activated from an application the service center can identify a service agent having the required skill set via the method override establish a communication session a chat session in this example and post the predefined question as an initial question all without requiring the user to specify at runtime.

Similarly for context tile which is to access a particular Web site a user can populate in property of to specify a URL of the Web site such that at runtime the user does not have to specify the address. All the user needs at runtime is to activate the corresponding graphical representation of context tile from its navigation application. Note that as shown in there can be many child context tiles of an upper row associated with a parent context tile of a lower row. The child context tiles of the upper row can be scrolled to show more context tiles while the corresponding parent context tile remains selected at the lower row.

Initially information of context elements of the root level of a route sequence map is received at the client device via a published API. In this example graphical representations of the context elements are displayed as the most inner or bottom row or ring in a stargate model. A graphical representation can be an icon a thumbnail image a logo etc. In this example ring includes multiple graphical representations such as School Vendor Family Support Friends Business and Nearby. A user can select any of these graphical representations which may represent one of a navigation context element or an action context element. When the user selects a graphical representation a message is transmitted from the application via a published API to the service center where the message includes an identifier of the selected graphical representation. The service center can identify the corresponding context element referred to herein as a selected context element based on the identifier. If the selected context element is an action context element the service center is to perform an action specified in a property of the selected context element.

If the selected context element is a navigation context element the service center identifies one or more child context elements associated with the selected context element. The service center returns data representing child context elements to the application via a published API. In this example as shown in it is assumed that the user selects Support graphical representation which may be displayed in an enlarged form higher resolution or a different color or shape compared to the unselected graphical representations. Once the Support graphical representation is selected the user can activate it by pressing the one touch button . If it is defined as an action tile only the center button will highlight when an action tile is reached allowing the user the ability to invoke the action as shown in . or alternatively via a voice interactive command enabled by button . Other applications designed as navigator applications may not use the one touch button and launch the action via some other user interface design. The information identifying the child context elements of the Support context element is then received from the service center and displayed via ring of graphical representations. The graphical representations of ring are displayed as an inner or upper ring while the selected graphical representation Support remains highlighted e.g. enlarged in this example . The graphical representations of ring can be scrolled spun or rotated for example by pressing the arrow buttons on either side of the ring or by swiping using a finger on a touch sensitive screen.

Similarly as shown in when graphical representation Banking is selected from ring its child context elements are identified and the corresponding graphical representations are displayed in an upper ring and further ring and so on. In addition when graphical representation Banking is selected ring is spun to align the selected graphical representation with its parent selected graphical representation Support. The user can further configure the behavior of the user interface via setting button . For example the stargate model of GUI as shown in can be configured into a donut launcher model where the launch button can be configured at a lower left corner or lower right corner e.g. dependent upon whether the user is a left handed person or a right handed person as shown in .

Referring to in one embodiment only a predetermined number of rings are currently displayed where the number of rings may be user configurable or client configurable . In this example only two rings of icons are displayed. When an icon is selected from a first ring as an inner ring icons representing the child context elements of the selected context element are displayed in a second ring that is an outer ring with respect to the first ring as shown in . In addition when an outer ring e.g. A to Z scrolling ring is displayed the inner ring e.g. the ring with icons is displayed in a reduced resolution or a reduced size while the outer ring is displayed in an enlarged resolution or enlarged size. Similarly from the second ring e.g. A to Z scrolling ring if a graphical representation is selected in this example letter C a third ring having graphical representations e.g. personal contacts associated with letter C is displayed as an outer ring. Meanwhile the first ring disappears while the second ring is displayed in a reduced form as shown in .
