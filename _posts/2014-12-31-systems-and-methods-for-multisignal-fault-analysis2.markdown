The fourth level REPLACE may be utilized to indicate at least one threshold was exceeded causing the sending of an alert to the user that includes a suggestion to repair or purchase a part and an urgent warning. For example the alert may suggest to the user to repair or purchase a part urgently warn the user that the part may fail because a likelihood of failure has exceeded a threshold e.g. fifty percent .

The OEM authentic information may include a flag that is asserted to signify the part is manufactured by an original equipment manufacturer OEM and not asserted to indicate otherwise e.g. knockoff authentication failed . For example the OEM authentic information may be updated based on characterization information that is received from a smart component the characterization information including results from a test that is performed on the part while it is in place in the vehicle . In one embodiment the test may generate characterization information that includes a part identifier that in turn is compared with OEM tracking information stored at the network based marketplace to identify whether the part in the smart component was manufactured by any one of multiple manufacturers. According to one embodiment the mobile device may perform the comparison. According to one embodiment the mobile device or the network based marketplace may identify indirectly or otherwise a certifiable cryptographic public key that is used to decrypt parts of the characterization information e.g. dynamic where identification of characterization information that is not encrypted or cannot be decrypted based on the public key causes the mobile device and or network based marketplace to not assert the OEM authentic information e.g. the part is fake because the fraudulent manufacturer does not possess the corresponding private key to encrypt the part type identifier in the characterization information .

The triggering event information may include a maintenance message triggering event. The maintenance message triggering event may be communicated by the processing module to the smart component engine responsive to receipt of the maintenance message at the network based marketplace . Recall that the mobile device may receive characterization information from a smart component e.g. part and sensor the mobile device in turn communicating a maintenance message including the characterization information to the network based marketplace including the processing module that in turn processes the maintenance message to communicate the maintenance message triggering event to the smart component engine . For example the processing module may process the maintenance message for the part e.g. engine hose to identify a new service level e.g. REPLACE WARN SUGGEST in the service level information for the part . Further the association information may be utilized by the smart component engine to associate the maintenance message triggering event with sub system scan rules and install time processing rules according to one embodiment. According to another embodiment additional or fewer sets of processing rules may be associated with the maintenance message triggering event. The sub system processing rules may be executed by the smart component engine to identify a service level e.g. REPLACE WARN SUGGEST other than OK in the service level information for the part . If a service level other than OK is identified then the sub system processing rules may further be executed to identify a sub system that includes the part and communicate a message to the mobile device that causes the mobile device to scan all of the smart components in the identified sub system. For example an engine hose in an engine that is identified with a service level other than OK may be identified by the smart component engine that causes a message to be communicated to the mobile device that causes the mobile device to scan all the parts in the identified engine sub system. In one embodiment related sub systems may be scanned responsive to identification of a service level other than OK for a part . In one embodiment the scan of the sub system is not performed if the engine sub system or the entire vehicle was scanned in a predetermined period of time e.g. five minutes prior to receipt of the maintenance message by the network based marketplace . In one embodiment the period of time may be configured. In another embodiment a part scan sub system part scan or vehicle part scan may optionally or automatically be delayed to enable the car to warm up or otherwise reach a stable operating condition.

The install time processing rules may be utilized by the smart component engine to identify a service level e.g. REPLACE WARN SUGGEST other than OK in the service level information for the part . If a service level other than OK is identified the sub system processing rules may further be executed to generate an estimated replacement time for the part and communicate an alert to the mobile device that includes the replacement time. In one embodiment the replacement time may be computed based on the location of the mobile device . For example responsive to the smart component engine identifying the mobile device as being located in a geographic circle that includes the garage of the user the smart component engine may compute the replacement time for the part based on the assumption that the user is performing the replacement and the competence level of the user. Further for example responsive to the smart component engine identifying the mobile device as being located within a geographic circle that includes a vehicle repair shop the smart component engine may compute the replacement time based on the competence level of the repair shop.

The alert configuration triggering event may include configuration information that is used to configure threshold information and maintenance policy information for a particular part . The association information may be utilized by the smart component engine to associate the alert configuration triggering event with the alert configuration processing rules that in turn are executed by the smart component engine to receive the configuration information process the configuration information to generate the threshold information and maintenance policy information store the threshold information in the part policy information that is identified for the part and store the maintenance policy information in the part policy information that is identified for the part .

The triggering event information may include an expert request triggering event. The expert request triggering event may be sent by the mobile device or client machine to the smart component engine via the network based marketplace responsive to receipt of a selection at the respective mobile device or client machine . The expert request triggering event may include a part type identifier and or sub system identifier and or vehicle identification information . The association information may be utilized by the smart component engine to associate the expert request triggering event with the alert expert processing rules that in turn are executed by the smart component engine to identify experts in the user information based on the expert information . For example the smart component engine may execute the alert expert processing rules to identify experts in the user information by matching the part type identifier and or sub system identifier and or vehicle identification information in the expert request triggering event with the expert information in the user information and communicating the results back to the respective mobile device or client machine that initiated the request.

The triggering event information may include a manual request triggering event. The manual request triggering event may be sent by the mobile device or client machine via the network based marketplace in response to receipt of a selection at the respective mobile device or client machine . For example a user who is operating his mobile device may be attempting to replace a part in his vehicle in his garage at home and make a selection on his mobile device to request a manual to repair a particular part . The manual request triggering event may include a part identifier and or a part type identifier and or sub system identifier and or vehicle identification information .

The triggering event information may include a maintenance history triggering event. The maintenance history triggering event may be sent by the mobile device or client machine to the smart component engine at the network based marketplace responsive to receipt of a selection at the mobile device of the client machine . For example a user who is operating his mobile device may want to know the maintenance history of one or more parts in his vehicle and make one or more selections on his mobile device which causes the mobile device to communicate the maintenance history triggering event to the network based marketplace . The maintenance history triggering event may include a part identifier and or a part type identifier and or sub system identifier and or vehicle identification information . The association information may be used by the smart component engine to associate the maintenance history triggering event with the maintenance history processing rules which in turn are executed by the smart component engine to retrieve one or more entries of maintenance history information from the corresponding entries part description information for one or more parts parts included in one or more sub systems and parts included in one or more vehicles and to communicate the maintenance history information that was retrieved to the mobile device or client machine .

The triggering event information may include an entry for a merchandise request triggering event. The merchandise request triggering event may be sent by a process in the network based marketplace to the smart component engine responsive to an identification of a presentation of merchandising information. For example a user who is operating his mobile device or the client machine may be targeted for a presentation of merchandising information e.g. presentation of purchase opportunities that is updated or modified by the smart component engine to include purchase opportunities for parts that are identified by the smart component engine . Responsive to receipt of the merchandise request triggering event the smart component engine may utilize the association information to associate the merchandise request triggering event with the merchandise suggestion processing rules which in turn are executed by the smart component engine to identify service level information in the vehicle information of the garage information that is associated with the user of the mobile device or client machine . Responsive to identifying service level information that is not OK e.g. SUGGEST WARN REPLACE for parts of vehicles in the garage information at the network based marketplace the smart component engine may utilize the associated maintenance history information to modify the merchandising information. For example the smart component engine may identify parts with service level information that are not OK and modify the merchandising information to include merchandising content for one or more of the identified parts where the merchandising content is modified to include buying opportunities for the identified parts that are filtered according to the brands that are preferred by the user as determined by the corresponding maintenance history information . For example the smart component engine may modify merchandising content to push unsolicited content to a user realize an intra purchase opportunity with a suggestion e.g. Do you also need X or Other users often purchase Y or Purchase Z at the same time and save XX realize a post purchase opportunity with a suggestion e.g. You might also like . For example the smart component engine may modify merchandising content to present a wish list of parts and send alerts to any device associated with the current user e.g. another device on which the user is running and signed into a marketplace connected app e.g. any device that has been indirectly associated with the user s profile for example given an operating system or environment in which the user profile information is associated with a cloud account .

The triggering event information may include an entry for a purchase request triggering event. The purchase request triggering event may be sent by a process in the network based marketplace to the smart component engine responsive to an identification of a presentation of merchandising information at the time of purchase. The purchase request triggering event operates similar to the merchandise request triggering event.

The triggering event information may include an entry for a search suggestion triggering event. The search suggestion triggering event may be sent by a process in the network based marketplace to the smart component engine responsive to an identification of a user entering a query from a mobile device or the client machine . In one embodiment an input box that receives a query from the user may include a drop down box immediately below the input box. The drop down box may contain search suggestions that may be selected by the user to overwrite the current query. Responsive to receiving a search suggestion triggering event the smart component engine may utilize the association information to associate the search suggestion triggering event to search suggestions processing rules that when executed by the smart component engine identify parts with service level information that is not OK e.g. SUGGEST WARN REPLACE for vehicles in the garage information or the user and modify the search suggestions in the drop down box to include search suggestions that target the identified parts . For example the smart component engine may modify the search suggestions to include categories brands performance characteristics and compatibility attributes based on the identified parts .

The triggering event information may include an entry for a location of mobile device triggering event. The location of mobile device triggering event may be sent by a scheduling process in the network based marketplace to the smart component engine responsive to the expiration of a mobile device timer. The mobile device triggering event may be sent to identify the location of the mobile device and initiate ecommerce activity. In one embodiment the mobile device timer may be reinitialized with a predetermined timeout of five minutes each time the triggering event is processed. In one embodiment the predetermined timeout may be configured by a user. Responsive to receiving a location of mobile device triggering event the smart component engine may utilize the association information to associate the mobile device triggering event with mobile device location rules that when executed by the smart component engine identify the current location of the mobile device identify parts with service level information that is respectively not OK e.g. SUGGEST. WARN. REPLACE for vehicles in the garage information of the user associated with a particular mobile device identify whether the current location of the mobile device is within a geographic area e.g. geographic circle that includes a facility that may repair the identified part s identify a wait time for the facility to perform the service identify an estimated repair time to repair the part communicate a message to the mobile device that prompts the user of the opportunity to repair the part at the facility including an estimated wait time for the facility to perform the service and an estimated repair time for the facility to repair the part and initialize the mobile device timer with the predetermined timeout. In one embodiment the center of the circle is the location of the mobile device and the radius of the circle is a predetermined length from the location of the mobile device . In one embodiment the length of the radius may be configured.

The triggering event information may include an entry for a third party notification triggering event. Information may be communicated to a third party responsive to receiving this event. Responsive to receiving a third party triggering event the smart component engine may utilize the association information to associate the third party notification triggering event with third party triggering event rules that when executed by the smart component engine generate third party information and communicate the third party information over a network e.g. network to a third party e.g. fleet management . For example the third party information may include service level information for a part maintenance history information for a part or any other information for a part subsystem or vehicle .

The triggering event information may include an entry for recall bulletin triggering event. A recall bulletin for one or more parts may be communicated to the mobile device or client machine responsive to receiving a request from one of these devices for such information. Responsive to receiving a recall bulletin triggering event the smart component engine may utilize the association information to associate the recall bulletin triggering event with recall bulletin rules that when executed by the smart component engine cause the smart component engine to identify garage information associated with a user associated with the client machine or mobile device identify one or more entries of vehicle information in the garage information associated with the user identify part type identifiers in the respective vehicle information for which recall bulletins have been published and communicate the recall bulletins to the mobile device or client machine .

At operation the processing module may identify the user profile information in the user table based on the maintenance message .

At operation the processing module may store the characterization information and the timestamp as part log information in the appropriate part description information e.g. part . For example the processing module may identify the vehicle information in the garage information in the user profile information based on the vehicle identification information in the maintenance message . In addition the processing module may identify the appropriate part description information in the identified vehicle information based on the part identifier or part type identifier in the maintenance message . Finally the processing module may copy the characterization information and the timestamp from the maintenance message to next available location in the part log information in the identified part description information . In one embodiment the processing module may create the vehicle information in the garage information responsive to receipt of the maintenance message .

At decision operation the processing module may identify whether a part has not previously been registered in the garage information . For example a part that is not registered in the garage information may include replacing a part that is old with a part that is new for a particular part type identifier . If the part identifier in the maintenance message is not found in the garage information then processing continues at operation . Otherwise processing continues at operation .

At operation the processing module performs multiple steps to register the part . First the processing module may identify an existing part in the garage information with a part type identifier that matches the part type identifier in the maintenance message . If found the processing module may utilize the existing entry by overwriting the part identifier that is old with the part identifier that is new. Otherwise the processing module may create a new entry of part description information in the vehicle information . Second the processing module may update the maintenance history information for the part type identifier by recording an entry chronicling the replacement of the part that is old with the part that is new. For example the brand names of the two parts the part identifiers the part type identifier the current date odometer reading vehicle identification information and part log information for the part that is old may be stored in the maintenance history information . Third the part identifier for the part that is being registered may be compared with the part identifiers in the OEM tracking information. If a match is found then the part is validated as an authentic OEM part. Otherwise the part is not validated as an authentic OEM part. In either instance at operation the processing module may store the appropriate status in the OEM authentic information in the part description information for the part and communicate the status to the associated client machine or mobile device . Fourth the processing module may communicate a recall bulletin triggering event to the smart component engine to identify whether recall bulletin notices are available for the part and responsive to such an identification communicate an alert to the mobile device or client machine that includes a notice of the recall bulleting for the part .

At operation the processing module may compute a derivative of part log information over time. The processing module may compute multiple derivatives of the part log information including a first derivative to generate first derivative information e.g. a simple change over time e.g. the average wear rate a second derivative to generate second derivative information e.g. an acceleration over time e.g. the rate at which the rate is changing acceleration may indicate partial failure failure in related parts conditions exceeding some elastic threshold etc. and or a third derivative to generate third derivative information e.g. a jerk the rate at which the acceleration is changing a sudden jerk possibly indicating a catastrophic failure or other transient but significant change not following the usual degradation . For example processing module may generate first derivative information for an aggregate often entries of characterization information . The quantity of time may be computed by subtracting a timestamp associated with the first entry e.g. earliest in the aggregate from the timestamp associated with the last entry e.g. latest in the aggregate. Further the quantity of wear may be computed by subtracting the characterization information associated with the first entry e.g. earliest in the aggregate from the characterization information associated with the last entry in the aggregate. Further where the first derivative is computed by dividing the quantity of wear by the quantity of time and optionally by smoothing the resulting derivative.

At decision operation the processing module may compare the first derivative information and or the second derivative information and or the third derivative information with respective threshold information in the part maintenance information associated with the part type identifier to identify whether a threshold has been exceeded. If a threshold is exceeded then processing continues at operation . Otherwise processing continues at operation . In one embodiment the threshold may be calculated dynamically at the time operation is executed by the processing module . At operation the processing module may register the one or more thresholds that have been exceeded.

At operation the processing module may interrogate the part log information to identify anomalous part log information . The processing module may identify anomalous part log information in many different ways. For some part types e.g. part type identifier s the processing module may expect the part log information to represent a discrete approximation or sampling of a continuous set whose ideal trend is expected to progress in one direction after accounting for measurement noise due to sensor and extreme environmental conditions. For example brake wear is ideally expected to trend smoothly from 0 to 100 wear. In this instance it is reasonable to apply averaging or outlier elimination to obtain a more accurate approximation of actual wear level. Consequently a single anomalous reading may not be considered actionable. In contrast other parts may supply measurements that result in part log information that is largely uncorrelated to other measurements except in very close temporal proximity. For example the part log information for boost pressure is expected to vary rapidly with no intrinsic trend. While for some measurement error is still expected a single reading that falls out of expected range by more than some value can indicate a gasket failure blowoff malfunction etc. The processing module may evaluate these measurements individually for such characteristics. According to another embodiment the processing module may evaluate the part log information for boost pressure relative to a continuous function derived from other contemporaneous readings such as throttle engine speed gear ratio etc. Yet according to another embodiment the processing module may identify sequences or combinations of individually valid values that are recognized as aberrant when evaluated together e.g. correlation of simultaneous or sequential signals vs. covariance models . For an example of a sequence of values that might be recognized as aberrant consider a leaf spring capable of reporting the apparent load on the spring as determined by the degree of deformation. Values may range freely between some well known extremes but are expected to maintain a constant average given a constant load. While the vehicle is in motion deflections in the spring should return via damped motion to a reasonable and stable center point. If an extreme but normal inflection returns to a stable center significantly different than the center prior to the inflection it may be an indication that a crack in the leaf spring has reduced the ability of the spring to hold a load. For an example of a sequence of values that might be recognized as aberrant when correlated to other values consider deflection compression measurements as reported by brake calipers. If a hydraulic line is faulty one caliper may experience considerably less deflection than the opposed caliper even though both deflection measurements are individually within tolerance. Similarly various signals could be correlated with those from related smart components with engine speed etc. . . . . In one embodiment the processing module may identify the lack or unexpected rate of appearance of an expected signal. For example if a previously recorded sensor fails to report a signal altogether the processing module may determine the part has failed catastrophically but may more plausibly be a signal that the sensor itself has failed or the part was replaced.

At decision operation the processing module may compare the anomalies in the part log information with threshold information in the part maintenance information as described above to identify whether any thresholds have been exceeded. If a threshold is exceeded then processing continues at operation . Otherwise processing continues at operation . In another embodiment the processing module may branch to operation based on an identification of one or more anomalies without making a comparison with the threshold information . At operation the processing module may register threshold s that have been exceeded. In another embodiment the processing module may register one or more anomalies that were identified notwithstanding the threshold information .

At operation the processing module may register the service level e.g. OK SUGGEST WARN REPLACE for the part in the service level information . For example the processing module may generate the service level based on identifying the one or more thresholds that were registered as exceeded in operations and . In one embodiment the processing module may identify the service level based on one or more thresholds that have been exceeded as registered in operation and or based on the identification anomalous part log information .

At operation the processing module may send a triggering event to the smart component engine . For example the processing module may send the maintenance message triggering event to the smart component engine . In one embodiment the maintenance message triggering event may include the maintenance message . The method ends.

The configure alerts user interface element may be selected to enter a set of user interfaces that enable configuring of threshold information e.g. threshold and maintenance policy information for a particular part type as identified by the network based marketplace with a part type identifier and vehicle as identified by the network based marketplace with vehicle identification information . In one embodiment the threshold information may be configured to enable the dynamic calculation of a threshold responsive to receiving characterization information .

Broadly the system may include a set of commands to add delete and configure the virtual parts and token parts processing to create virtual parts processing of the virtual parts and processing of the token parts. Processing to create virtual parts may include alerting a particular user to create a virtual part. For example an alert to create a virtual part may be sent to a user who has expressed interest in a part smart component by searching for the part . Further for example an alert to create a virtual part may be sent to a user for a smart component that reports excessive wear. Processing virtual parts may be proactive or reactive. Processing that is proactive may include alerting a particular user of a purchase opportunity related to the virtual part community content related to the virtual part and creating a token part based on the virtual part to prompt the acquisition of the part or smart component . Processing that is reactive may include modifying dynamically selected content based on a virtual part. For example the virtual parts for a particular user may be input to a mechanism that dynamically selects and ranks content. For example a search mechanism executing a search on behalf of a user is configured to receive virtual parts as input to select and rank listings that are returned in a search result to the user. Further for example an automatically invoked merchandising mechanism e.g. shopping cart being displayed is configured to receive virtual parts as input to select and rank listings that are merchandised in association with the shopping cart to the user. In both instances a user s implicit interest in a part is accommodated by utilizing the corresponding virtual part. Processing token parts may be proactive or reactive. Processing token parts that is proactive may include alerting a particular user of a sales opportunity to sell the part or smart component signified by the token part alerting a particular user of community content related to the token part alerting a particular user of installation of the part or smart component signified by the token part and alerting a particular user of deleting the token part. Processing of token parts that is reactive may include evaluating whether token parts are compatible with a vehicle that is added to a garage that is associated with a user. For example a vehicle may be added to vehicle garage information not shown that is associated with a user and responsive to the addition of the vehicle an analysis is performed to identify whether any of the token parts are compatible with the vehicle e.g. for repair . For example a token part that is identified as compatible signifies a part in the real world that is suitable to replace the corresponding part and or smart component in the vehicle .

The system may operate in conjunction with smart components as previously described with respect to the system in . Accordingly the same or similar references have been used to indicate the same or similar features unless otherwise indicated. While the vehicle is illustrated as an automobile it will be appreciated that trucks all terrain vehicles jeeps aircraft water born vessels space vessels and the like may embody the illustrated vehicle . Merely for example a smart component in a Ford Mustang may include a sensor for a brake pad that senses information and communicates the characterization information over the network e.g. NFC to an iPhone that in turn communicates a maintenance message including the characterization information and a timestamp to the network based marketplace that in turn stores the characterization information and the timestamp in garage information for the Ford Mustang in user profile information associated with a user and processes the characterization information to identify a REPLACE service level for the brake pad. Responsive to identifying a service level for the brake pad that is not OK e.g. REPLACE the network based marketplace may communicate an alert to the mobile device or the client machine to create a virtual part for the brake pad. The user may respond by entering a command to create a virtual part for the brake pad in the virtual part information . Next the network based marketplace may process the virtual part for the brake pad in the virtual part information to identify a purchase opportunity on the network based marketplace . For example an electronic storefront may be advertising a sale on the brake pad and the user may be alerted of the sale.

Further the network based marketplace may respond to an end of the test event by initiating an analysis operation C of the multi signal information that was collected to diagnose operation D the fault e.g. right front brake is worn out and communicate a message including the diagnosis of the fault to the first mobile device. In some embodiments the message may further include a prognosis operation E including an estimated cost for repair at a local service shop and a list of parts.

The collection device may be comprised of one or more mobile devices including mobile devices that are carried e.g. smart phones and other devices that are carried mobile devices that are worn e.g. smart glasses smart watches and other smart devices that are worn and mobile devices that are purpose built. The mobile devices that are purpose built are now further described. Mobile devices that are purpose built are designed for a particular purpose and location.

The test arming event may be received from one of the mobile devices as signal information to signal the network based marketplace to begin monitoring signal information for a test triggering event . For example the test arming event may be a tap on Google Glass. The test triggering event may further be received as signal information to signal the network based marketplace to begin collecting and storing the multi signal information . For example the test triggering event may be a squeaking sound that is sensed after the test arming event has been received. In some cases the test design information may describe the test arming event and the test triggering event as the same event. The test end event may be received as signal information or a system timeout that signals to the network based marketplace that the fault analysis test session has completed and to begin an analysis of the multi signal information that was collected. For example responsive to receipt of the test end event the network based marketplace may register the end of the fault analysis test session and analyze the multi signal information to identify whether the fault identified with the user test request information was diagnosed. The network based marketplace may analyze the multi signal information by comparing it with the multi signal information in the fault analysis repository to identify a one or more correlated events. Identification of one or more correlated events constitutes a diagnosis of the problem. On the other hand if the problem is not diagnosed the fault analysis test session may be repeated with a new set of test design information . For example the network based marketplace may alter the test conditions or add a new mobile device to collect additional signal information or add more signal information e.g. speed sound image motion picture etc. to an existing mobile device . The process described above may be iterated until the problem is diagnosed or until all available tests are exhausted. In some embodiments the network based marketplace may request expert manual intervention in response to identifying all available tests is exhausted.

The user test request information may include problem conditions problem symptoms and vehicle identification information . The problem conditions may describe conditions that are associated with the problem symptoms .

The vehicle identification information describes a make model and year of a vehicle as previously described. All or part of the vehicle identification information may be optionally entered.

Each of the signal information is further illustrated as representing different phenomena over time with different characteristics e.g. hill little ratchet big ratchet . The event information may store a registration of the test arming event a registration of the test triggering event a registration of correlated events e.g. A B C a registration of the test end event and annotations as described above though not shown. The correlated events are registered as such in the event information for a fault analysis test session responsive to an analysis that identifies a match with correlation information in the fault analysis repository not shown as described further below. A fuzzy match may be sufficient to constitute a match. For example the correlated event may be registered in the event information in the multi signal information responsive to correlated events e.g. A B C that differ in time magnitude periodicity etc. within respective and specified ranges as specified by correlation information in the user fault analysis information in the fault analysis repository .

Broadly the system may include a network based marketplace that utilizes a context including a context identifier initialization information and request information to process interactions between users who are collaborating online the interactions being received as requests via a user interface . For example the network based marketplace may utilize the context to process interactions in an online collaborative workspace to expose feature information and or augment feature information and or remove feature information from the user interface in addition to improving the relevancy and or enabling ecommerce activities that are presented via the user interface .

The network based marketplace may utilize the context to process interface information. Interface information may include information that is exposed or received via the user interface . For example the interface information may include requests interactions that are received via the online collaborative workspace . The interactions may include manipulating objects including documents videos illustrations wire frame diagrams and the like hosting real time audio visual online collaborative workspace sessions with other users and the like and facilitating general drop and drag facilities for links objects etc. and other typical digital whiteboard facilities and the like. The interface information may further include feature information . For example the feature information may include participant information metadata information search information tool information dialogue information shopping cart information context information including the context advertising information and promotional information . The feature information may be displayed as interface information according to panels on the user interface or as discrete user interface elements or as groups of user interface elements on the user interface .

As briefly mentioned above but now discussed the feature information may be hidden or exposed. For example the participant information may be added or removed to interact with expert users. Further for example the metadata information may be added or removed to manipulate objects in a separate workspace. Specifically the metadata information may be used to manipulate instances of objects presently displayed on another part of the user interface . Further the metadata information may be used to display instantiations of an archetypical object. For example the metadata information may display user interface elements rendering Fram or Napa oil filters for parallel viewing with an archetypical oil filter that is being displayed in a repair schematic in the online collaborative workspace . The search information may include search results queries saved searches and other search related information. Further the search information may be generated based on searches being performed for listings not shown on the network based marketplace . The tool information may include tools to operate the user interface and manipulate the contents of the user interface . The dialogue information may include scripts representing spoken words typed words messaged words etc. and generally any statement e.g. declarative question etc. submitted by any user from present and previous online collaborative sessions. The shopping cart information may include listings not shown and other elements supporting sales and other e commerce activity including merchandising activities. The context information may include the context as previously described. The advertising information may include advertisement elements merchandising elements e.g. listings and other elements supporting sales and other e commerce activity. The promotional information may include promotion elements e.g. discounts games etc. merchandising elements and other elements supporting sales and other e commerce activity.

More specifically the system may include a mobile device e.g. smart phone operated by a first user who enters an add context command operation on the mobile device to add the context . The mobile device may communicate the context over a network to a network based marketplace that in turn processes the add context command and the context to store the context in a directory in user profile information that is associated with the first user on the network based marketplace . Responsive to processing the add context command the network based marketplace may communicate a context identifier back to the mobile device . Further the first user may enter an attach context command operation and the context identifier with the mobile device to attach the context to the online collaborative workspace . To this end the mobile device may communicate the command and the context identifier over the network to the network based marketplace that in turn processes the command and the context identifier to attach the context to the online collaborative workspace generate the user interface by utilizing the context and communicate the user interface back over the network to the mobile device . Further one or more other users who are remotely located to the user may enter a request by touch or another activity that is received via the one or more instances of the touch sensitive user interface . The network based marketplace may receive the requests process the requests based on the context including the initialization information and all of the request information including the present and previous requests. Responsive to processing the requests the network based marketplace may re generate the user interface or parts of the user interface and communicate the user interface or parts thereof back over the network to the one or more mobile devices .

In one example the initialization information may include a description of vehicle not shown and a description of a repair for the vehicle. For example the initialization information may describe a 1967 Ford Mustang that needs a repair in the form of an oil filter replacement. Continuing with the example the context may be attached to the online collaborative workspace as previously described and the online collaborative workspace may be generated based on the initialization information in the context to include a repair schematic for replacing the oil filter. Subsequent to displaying the repair schematic requests may be received from the first second and other users who are collaborating to replace the oil filter and stored in the context as request information . For example the requests may include a request to invite a third user e.g. expert to collaborate a screen touch that selects an object e.g. gaskets in a repair schematic that is displayed in an online collaborative workarea spoken statements typed statements etc. Requests may be stored as request information in the context corresponding to communications received via the user interface from the mobile device .

A vehicle owner is changing an oil filter using their electronic tablet e.g. iPad to view maintenance instructions provided by online marketplace XYZ Motors. The user is experiencing problems. The user opens the whiteboard app WHITEBOARD APPLICATION provided by XYZ Motors on their tablet A adds a context describing the vehicle e.g. 1967 Ford Mustang and describing the repair OIL FILTER CHANGE to initiate a collaborative workspace session and B attaches the context to the online collaborative workspace .

Later that evening the user again launches the whiteboard app WHITEBOARD APPLICATION identifies the above mentioned context in the directory and reattaches the context by executing the add context command to initiate a second session for the same context . The user returns to the item in their shopping cart which is accessible via the user interface and selects a user interface element invoking an IN STORE PICK UP to purchase the item from a store that is located within a predetermined distance of the mobile device . The network based marketplace utilizes the context to suggest a different item e.g. second item e.g. another brand that is preferred by the user based on the context . For example the context may be accessed to identify a second item and present the second item as being available through a local merchant s IN STORE PICK UP feature of XYZ motors e.g. network based marketplace or directly from XYZ motors e.g. network based marketplace . The user purchases the second item via the shopping cart that is accessed via the user interface that is accessed via the whiteboard app.

In another embodiment the user does not re launch the whiteboard app but instead opens their shopping cart directly and is presented with the item and a presentation of a second item that is selected based on the context being associated with the user who opens the shopping cart e.g. a brand preferred by the user who opens the shopping cart . The user completes the purchase after selecting the IN STORE PICK UP feature picks up the part along their bus ride home the next day and receives a continue my repair notification on their tablet after the purchase is completed.

Returning to the general discussion further examples may include utilization of the add context command to create other contexts for different repairs of the same vehicle or for repairing other vehicles. Further examples may also include re launching the whiteboard application and reattaching a context that was previously initialized and or utilized. It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that a user may at any time open one or more instances of the whiteboard application on multiple devices including a mobile device and or a client machine . Further each device may display a different type of information e.g. participant information metadata information etc. in the user interface and receive different information. For example a first device e.g. mobile device may be utilized for camera voice and sensor functionality a second device e.g. laptop may be utilized for interactive chat and shopping cart information and a third device e.g. tablet or Google Glass may be utilized to view and interact with a repair schematic or document. It will further be appreciated by one skilled in the art that the interface information described above may be embodied in interfaces other than the user interface . For example the interface information may be embodied in an audio interface a machine interface application programming interface API a haptic interface or any other boundary across which two or more systems meet and act on each other or two or more users communicate with each other or any combination thereof.

Other embodiments may not utilize the context panel to display the context information . For example other embodiments may display all or part of the context information as discrete user interface elements on the user interface or as groups of user interface elements on the user interface . Further other embodiments of the present disclosure may display other types of information in the context panel . For example other embodiments of the present disclosure may display discrete user interface elements or groups of user interface elements of participant information metadata information elements from the online collaborative workarea search information tool information dialogue information shopping cart information advertising information and promotional information in the context panel .

The user profile information further includes context directory information and an online collaborative workplace marker . The content directory information may store the context for the user. For example the contexts created by the user with the add context command are stored in the user profile information until removed with a delete context command. The online collaborative workplace marker may be used to store a context identifier for a particular context . Responsive to execution of the attach context command the context identifier that is being received by the attach context command is stored in the online collaborative workplace marker constituting attachment of the context to the online collaborative workspace . Subsequent executions of the attach context command overwrite the context identifier stored by the previous execution of the attach context command. That is only a single context identifier is utilized by the network based marketplace for the whiteboard application.

At operation the processing module may process the request based on the context . For example the processing module may utilize the context identifier and the request to update the user interface or generate a new user interface and communicate the update or new user interface to the mobile device .

Additionally external sites may be sites coupled to networked system via network . External sites may be any desired system including ecommerce systems.

An Application Program Interface API server and a web server are coupled to and provide programmatic and web interfaces respectively to one or more application servers . The application server s host a publication system and a payment system each of which may comprise one or more modules applications or engines and each of which may be embodied as hardware software firmware or any combination thereof. The application servers are in turn coupled to one or more database servers facilitating access to one or more information storage repositories or database s . In one embodiment the databases are storage devices that store information to be posted e.g. publications or listings to the publication system . The databases may also store digital goods information in accordance with example embodiments.

In example embodiments the publication system publishes content on a network e.g. Internet . As such the publication system provides a number of publication and marketplace functions and services to users that access the networked system . The publication system is discussed in more detail in connection with . In example embodiments the publication system is discussed in terms of an online marketplace environment. However it is noted that the publication system may be associated with a non marketplace environment such as an informational e.g. search engine or social networking environment.

The payment system provides a number of payment services and functions to users. The payment system allows users to accumulate value e.g. in a commercial currency such as the U.S. dollar or a proprietary currency such as points miles or other forms of currency provide by a private entity in their accounts and then later to redeem the accumulated value for products e.g. goods or services that are made available via the publication system or elsewhere on the network . The payment system also facilitates payments from a payment mechanism e.g. a bank account PayPal or credit card for purchases of items via any type and form of a network based marketplace.

While the publication system and the payment system are shown in to both form part of the networked system it will be appreciated that in alternative embodiments the payment system may form part of a payment service that is separate and distinct from the networked system . Additionally while the example network architecture of employs a client server architecture a skilled artisan will recognize that the present disclosure is not limited to such an architecture.

Certain embodiments are described herein as including logic or a number of components modules or mechanisms. Modules may constitute software modules e.g. code stored or otherwise embodied on a machine readable medium or in a transmission medium hardware modules or any suitable combination thereof. A hardware module is a tangible e.g. non transitory unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain physical manner. In various example embodiments one or more computer systems e.g. a standalone computer system a client computer system or a server computer system or one or more hardware modules of a computer system e.g. a processor or a group of processors may be configured by software e.g. an application or application portion as a hardware module that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.

In some embodiments a hardware module may be implemented mechanically electronically or any suitable combination thereof. For example a hardware module may include dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured to perform certain operations. For example a hardware module may be a special purpose processor such as a field programmable gate array FPGA or an ASIC. A hardware module may also include programmable logic or circuitry that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. For example a hardware module may include software encompassed within a general purpose processor or other programmable processor. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware module mechanically in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry or in temporarily configured circuitry e.g. configured by software may be driven by cost and time considerations.

Accordingly the phrase hardware module should be understood to encompass a tangible entity and such a tangible entity may be physically constructed permanently configured e.g. hardwired or temporarily configured e.g. programmed to operate in a certain manner or to perform certain operations described herein. As used herein hardware implemented module refers to a hardware module. Considering embodiments in which hardware modules are temporarily configured e.g. programmed each of the hardware modules need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example where a hardware module comprises a general purpose processor configured by software to become a special purpose processor the general purpose processor may be configured as respectively different special purpose processors e.g. comprising different hardware modules at different times. Software e.g. a software module may accordingly configure one or more processors for example to constitute a particular hardware module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware module at a different instance of time.

Hardware modules can provide information to and receive information from other hardware modules. Accordingly the described hardware modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple hardware modules exist contemporaneously communications may be achieved through signal transmission e.g. over appropriate circuits and buses between or among two or more of the hardware modules. In embodiments in which multiple hardware modules are configured or instantiated at different times communications between such hardware modules may be achieved for example through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware modules have access. For example one hardware module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware module may then at a later time access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices and can operate on a resource e.g. a collection of information .

The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed at least partially by one or more processors that are temporarily configured e.g. by software or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured such processors may constitute processor implemented modules that operate to perform one or more operations or functions described herein. As used herein processor implemented module refers to a hardware module implemented using one or more processors.

Similarly the methods described herein may be at least partially processor implemented a processor being an example of hardware. For example at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or more processors or processor implemented modules. As used herein processor implemented module refers to a hardware module in which the hardware includes one or more processors. Moreover the one or more processors may also operate to support performance of the relevant operations in a cloud computing environment or as a software as a service SaaS . For example at least some of the operations may be performed by a group of computers as examples of machines including processors with these operations being accessible via a network e.g. the Internet and via one or more appropriate interfaces e.g. an application program interface API .

The performance of certain operations may be distributed among the one or more processors not only residing within a single machine but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments the one or more processors or processor implemented modules may be located in a single geographic location e.g. within a home environment an office environment or a server farm . In other example embodiments the one or more processors or processor implemented modules may be distributed across a number of geographic locations.

Some portions of the subject matter discussed herein may be presented in terms of algorithms or symbolic representations of operations on data stored as bits or binary digital signals within a machine memory e.g. a computer memory . Such algorithms or symbolic representations are examples of techniques used by those of ordinary skill in the data processing arts to convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. As used herein an algorithm is a self consistent sequence of operations or similar processing leading to a desired result. In this context algorithms and operations involve physical manipulation of physical quantities. Typically but not necessarily such quantities may take the form of electrical magnetic or optical signals capable of being stored accessed transferred combined compared or otherwise manipulated by a machine. It is convenient at times principally for reasons of common usage to refer to such signals using words such as data content bits values elements symbols characters terms numbers numerals or the like. These words however are merely convenient labels and are to be associated with appropriate physical quantities.

Unless specifically stated otherwise discussions herein using words such as processing computing calculating determining presenting displaying or the like may refer to actions or processes of a machine e.g. a computer that manipulates or transforms data represented as physical e.g. electronic magnetic or optical quantities within one or more memories e.g. volatile memory non volatile memory or any suitable combination thereof registers or other machine components that receive store transmit or display information. Furthermore unless specifically stated otherwise the terms a or an are herein used as is common in patent documents to include one or more than one instance. Finally as used herein the conjunction or refers to a non exclusive or unless specifically stated otherwise.
