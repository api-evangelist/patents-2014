title: System and method for gesture based control system
abstract: The system provides a gestural interface to various visually presented elements, presented on a display screen or screens. A gestural vocabulary includes ‘instantaneous’ commands, in which forming one or both hands into the appropriate ‘pose’ results in an immediate, one-time action; and ‘spatial’ commands, in which the operator either refers directly to elements on the screen by way of literal ‘pointing’ gestures or performs navigational maneuvers by way of relative or “offset” gestures. The system contemplates the ability to identify the users hands in the form of a glove or gloves with certain indicia provided thereon, or any suitable means for providing recognizable indicia on a user's hands or body parts. A system of cameras can detect the position, orientation, and movement of the user's hands and translate that information into executable commands.

This patent application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 572 698 filed Feb. 8 2006 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 830 168 which is incorporated herein in its entirety.

This invention relates to the field of computer system in general and in particular to a system and method for a gesture based control system.

A user may enter commands and interact with a computer system by manipulating data or images in a window on a display or by selecting operations from a menu associated with the window or an associated program using input devices such as a mouse keyboard joystick cross key or the like. Such input devices may also operate as position translating devices which can be used to position a graphical on screen pointer such as a cursor. A cursor functions for example to indicate a character to be revised or to indicate a position where data is to be entered or an operation is to be performed. A cursor in some form or appearance is typically present on the computer display. Manipulation of an input device by a user will result in a corresponding movement of the cursor. Thus for example movement of a mouse or other input device results in movement of the cursor in the same direction.

A cursor may have different appearances depending on its function and the state of the computer system. For example when positioned in a text field on a computer display the cursor may have the appearance of an I beam or a blinking vertical line. The position of the cursor in a text field indicates the location of the next character that will be entered by the user typically via a keyboard. The cursor may have other appearances depending on its function. In a drawing or painting program the cursor may be represented as a paint brush pencil eraser bucket or other graphic form.

The cursor may also take the shape of an arrow or pointer when positioned over user selectable operations or when it is used to select graphical elements such as windows. To select and activate a desired operation with the cursor it may be positioned over a graphical or text representation of the operation. A button located on a mouse input device may be depressed and or released to effectuate the operation. The user is notified of the acceptance of the operation for execution by visual feedback usually in the form of some change in an image on the computer s display. One or more of the programs in use typically generates this visual response. These programs generate drawing commands to update the display images in response to the selected operations.

A disadvantage of prior art systems is that the input device is often just that a device. The user is required to have a wired or wireless mouse or other input device and to use that device to manage selection position translation activation and other input functions. Often the use of these physical devices is not natural or intuitive. Another disadvantage is the need to go through certain steps to change the context of the input device so that different functions may be performed.

With the popularity of very large displays further disadvantages of prior art input devices and systems become apparent. When using a mouse for example to attempt to translate the position of a cursor across a large display the user must often lift the mouse and replace it on the mouse surface to enable the user to drag the cursor across even a portion of a large display. This is a wasted an unnatural motion.

There have been some prior art attempts to provide a solution to these problems. One prior art solution is the use of gloves on the users hand. These gloves deign to turn the users hand or hands into input devices. In one embodiment an input glove is hard wired to a computer system. This solution has the disadvantage of literally tying the user to the spot requiring a nearness to the computer system and a restriction on range of motion. In other cases the gloves are wireless. However such wireless implementations require an independent power supply for the glove. When the power supply needs to be recharged the gloves may not be used.

The system provides a gestural interface to various visually presented elements presented on a display screen or screens. The operator of the system navigates and manipulates these elements by issuing a continuous stream of gestural commands using the operators hands in one embodiment. In other embodiments a user s head feet arms legs or the whole user may be used to provide the navigation and control. The gestural vocabulary includes instantaneous commands in which forming one or both hands into the appropriate pose results in an immediate one time action and spatial commands in which the operator either refers directly to elements on the screen by way of literal pointing gestures or performs navigational maneuvers by way of relative or offset gestures. In addition to pointing gestures which are used for absolute or direct spatial gesturing the invention may also recognize another category of relative spatial navigation gestures in an XYZ space. This category of actions is sometimes referred to as XYZ techniques. By maintaining a high frame rate by guaranteeing a nearly imperceptible lag in the interpretation of operator gestures and by employing both carefully designed spatial metaphors and readily evident direct manipulation mechanism the system provides a vivid cognitive coupling between the operator and the information processes being represented. The system contemplates the ability to identify the user s hands. This system of identification may be in the form of a glove or gloves with certain indicia provided thereon or any suitable means for providing recognizable indicia on a user s hands. A system of cameras can detect the position orientation and movement of the user s hands and translate that information into executable commands.

A system and method for a gesture based control system is described. In the following description a number of features are described in detail in order to provide a more thorough understanding of the invention. It is apparent that the invention may be practiced without out these specific details. In other cases well known features have not been described in detail.

A block diagram of an embodiment of the invention is illustrated in . A user locates his hands and in the viewing area of an array of cameras A D. The cameras detect location orientation and movement of the fingers and hands and and generate output signals to pre processor . Pre processor translates the camera output into a gesture signal that is provided to the computer processing unit of the system. The computer uses the input information to generate a command to control one or more on screen cursors and provides video output to display .

Although the system is shown with a single user s hands as input the invention may also be implemented using multiple users. In addition instead of or in addition to hands the system may track any part or parts of a user s body including head feet legs arms elbows knees and the like.

In the embodiment shown four cameras are used to detect the location orientation and movement of the user s hands and . It should be understood that the invention may be used with more or fewer cameras without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. In addition although the cameras are disposed symmetrically in the example embodiment there is no requirement of such symmetry in the invention. Any number or positioning of cameras that permits the location orientation and movement of the user s hands may be used in the invention.

In one embodiment of the invention the cameras used are motion capture cameras capable of capturing grey scale images. In one embodiment the cameras used are those manufactured by Vicon such as the Vicon MX40 camera. This camera includes on camera processing and is capable of image capture at 1000 frames per second. A motion capture camera is capable of detecting and locating markers.

In the embodiment described the cameras are used for optical detection. In other embodiments the cameras or other detectors may be used for electromagnetic magnetostatic RFID or any other suitable type of detection.

Pre processor is used to generate three dimensional space point reconstruction and skeletal point labeling. The gesture translator is used to convert the 3D spatial information and marker motion information into a command language that can be interpreted by a computer processor to update the location shape and action of a cursor on a display. In an alternate embodiment of the invention the pre processor and gesture translator can be combined into a single device.

Computer may be any general purpose computer such as manufactured by Apple Dell or any other suitable manufacturer. The computer runs applications and provides display output. Cursor information that would otherwise come from a mouse or other prior art input device now comes from the gesture system.

The invention contemplates the use of marker tags on one or more fingers of the user so that the system can locate the hands of the user identify whether it is viewing a left or right hand and which fingers are visible. This permits the system to detect the location orientation and movement of the users hands. This information allows a number of gestures to be recognized by the system and used as commands by the user.

The marker tags in one embodiment are physical tags comprising a substrate appropriate in the present embodiment for affixing to various locations on a human hand and discrete markers arranged on the substrate s surface in unique identifying patterns.

The markers and the associated external sensing system may operate in any domain optical electromagnetic magnetostatic etc. that allows the accurate precise and rapid and continuous acquisition of their three space position. The markers themselves may operate either actively e.g. by emitting structured electromagnetic pulses or passively e.g. by being optically retroreflective as in the present embodiment .

At each frame of acquisition the detection system receives the aggregate cloud of recovered three space locations comprising all markers from tags presently in the instrumented workspace volume within the visible range of the cameras or other detectors . The markers on each tag are of sufficient multiplicity and are arranged in unique patterns such that the detection system can perform the following tasks 1 segmentation in which each recovered marker position is assigned to one and only one subcollection of points that form a single tag 2 labelling in which each segmented subcollection of points is identified as a particular tag 3 location in which the three space position of the identified tag is recovered and 4 orientation in which the three space orientation of the identified tag is recovered. Tasks 1 and 2 are made possible through the specific nature of the marker patterns as described below and as illustrated in one embodiment in .

The markers on the tags in one embodiment are affixed at a subset of regular grid locations. This underlying grid may as in the present embodiment be of the traditional Cartesian sort or may instead be some other regular plane tessellation a triangular hexagonal tiling arrangement for example . The scale and spacing of the grid is established with respect to the known spatial resolution of the marker sensing system so that adjacent grid locations are not likely to be confused. Selection of marker patterns for all tags should satisfy the following constraint no tag s pattern shall coincide with that of any other tag s pattern through any combination of rotation translation or mirroring. The multiplicity and arrangement of markers may further be chosen so that loss or occlusion of some specified number of component markers is tolerated After any arbitrary transformation it should still be unlikely to confuse the compromised module with any other.

Referring now to a number of tags A E left hand and A E right hand are shown. Each tag is rectangular and consists in this embodiment of a 5 7 grid array. The rectangular shape is chosen as an aid in determining orientation of the tag and to reduce the likelihood of mirror duplicates. In the embodiment shown there are tags for each finger on each hand. In some embodiments it may be adequate to use one two three or four tags per hand. Each tag has a border of a different grey scale or color shade. Within this border is a 3 5 grid array. Markers represented by the black dots of are disposed at certain points in the grid array to provide information.

Qualifying information may be encoded in the tags marker patterns through segmentation of each pattern into common and unique subpatterns. For example the present embodiment specifies two possible border patterns distributions of markers about a rectangular boundary. A family of tags is thus established the tags intended for the left hand might thus all use the same border pattern as shown in tags A E while those attached to the right hand s fingers could be assigned a different pattern as shown in tags A E. This sub pattern is chosen so that in all orientations of the tags the left pattern can be distinguished from the right pattern. In the example illustrated the left hand pattern includes a marker in each corner and on marker in a second from corner grid location. The right hand pattern has markers in only two corners and two markers in non corner grid locations. An inspection of the pattern reveals that as long as any three of the four markers are visible the left hand pattern can be positively distinguished from the left hand pattern. In one embodiment the color or shade of the border can also be used as an indicator of handedness.

Each tag must of course still employ a unique interior pattern the markers distributed within its family s common border. In the embodiment shown it has been found that two markers in the interior grid array are sufficient to uniquely identify each of the ten fingers with no duplication due to rotation or orientation of the fingers. Even if one of the markers is occluded the combination of the pattern and the handedness of the tag yields a unique identifier.

In the present embodiment the grid locations are visually present on the rigid substrate as an aid to the manual task of affixing each retroreflective marker at its intended location. These grids and the intended marker locations are literally printed via color inkjet printer onto the substrate which here is a sheet of initially flexible shrink film . Each module is cut from the sheet and then oven baked during which thermal treatment each module undergoes a precise and repeatable shrinkage. For a brief interval following this procedure the cooling tag may be shaped slightly to follow the longitudinal curve of a finger for example thereafter the substrate is suitably rigid and markers may be affixed at the indicated grid points.

In one embodiment the markers themselves are three dimensional such as small reflective spheres affixed to the substrate via adhesive or some other appropriate means. The three dimensionality of the markers can be an aid in detection and location over two dimensional markers. However either can be used without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.

At present tags are affixed via Velcro or other appropriate means to a glove worn by the operator or are alternately affixed directly to the operator s fingers using a mild double stick tape. In a third embodiment it is possible to dispense altogether with the rigid substrate and affix or paint individual markers directly onto the operator s fingers and hands.

The invention contemplates a gesture vocabulary consisting of hand poses orientation hand combinations and orientation blends. A notation language is also implemented for designing and communicating poses and gestures in the gesture vocabulary of the invention. The gesture vocabulary is a system for representing instantaneous pose states of kinematic linkages in compact textual form. The linkages in question may be biological a human hand for example or an entire human body or a grasshopper leg or the articulated spine of a lemur or may instead be nonbiological e.g. a robotic arm . In any case the linkage may be simple the spine or branching the hand . The gesture vocabulary system of the invention establishes for any specific linkage a constant length string the aggregate of the specific ASCII characters occupying the string s character locations is then a unique description of the instantaneous state or pose of the linkage.

Still referring to a number of poses are defined and identified using ASCII characters. Some of the poses are divided between thumb and non thumb. The invention in this embodiment uses a coding such that the ASCII character itself is suggestive of the pose. However any character may used to represent a pose whether suggestive or not. In addition there is no requirement in the invention to use ASCII characters for the notation strings. Any suitable symbol numeral or other representation may be used without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. For example the notation may use two bits per finger if desired or some other number of bits as desired.

A curled finger is represented by the character while a curled thumb by . A straight finger or thumb pointing up is indicated by I and at an angle by or . represents a thumb pointing straight sideways and x represents a thumb pointing into the plane.

Using these individual finger and thumb descriptions a robust number of hand poses can be defined and written using the scheme of the invention. Each pose is represented by five characters with the order being p r m i t as described above. illustrates a number of poses and a few are described here by way of illustration and example. The hand held flat and parallel to the ground is represented by 11111 . A fist is represented by . An OK sign is represented by 111 .

The character strings provide the opportunity for straightforward human readability when using suggestive characters. The set of possible characters that describe each degree of freedom may generally be chosen with an eye to quick recognition and evident analogy. For example a vertical bar would likely mean that a linkage element is straight an ell L might mean a ninety degree bend and a circumflex could indicate a sharp bend. As noted above any characters or coding may be used as desired.

Any system employing gesture vocabulary strings such as described herein enjoys the benefit of the high computational efficiency of string comparison identification of or search for any specified pose literally becomes a string compare e.g. UNIX s strcmp function between the desired pose string and the instantaneous actual string. Furthermore the use of wildcard characters provides the programmer or system designer with additional familiar efficiency and efficacy degrees of freedom whose instantaneous state is irrelevant for a match may be specified as an interrogation point additional wildcard meanings may be assigned.

In addition to the pose of the fingers and thumb the orientation of the hand can represent information. Characters describing global space orientations can also be chosen transparently the characters and v may be used to indicate when encountered in an orientation character position the ideas of left right up and down. illustrates hand orientation descriptors and examples of coding that combines pose and orientation. In an embodiment of the invention two character positions specify first the direction of the palm and then the direction of the fingers if they were straight irrespective of the fingers actual bends . The possible characters for these two positions express a body centric notion of orientation x and v describe medial lateral anterior forward away from body posterior backward away from body cranial upward and caudal downward .

In the notation scheme of and embodiment of the invention the five finger pose indicating characters are followed by a colon and then two orientation characters to define a complete command pose. In one embodiment a start position is referred to as an xyz pose where the thumb is pointing straight up the index finger is pointing forward and the middle finger is perpendicular to the index finger pointing to the left when the pose is made with the right hand. This is represented by the string x1 x .

 XYZ hand is a technique for exploiting the geometry of the human hand to allow full six degree of freedom navigation of visually presented three dimensional structure. Although the technique depends only on the bulk translation and rotation of the operator s hand so that its fingers may in principal be held in any pose desired the present embodiment prefers a static configuration in which the index finger points away from the body the thumb points toward the ceiling and the middle finger points left right. The three fingers thus describe roughly but with clearly evident intent the three mutually orthogonal axes of a three space coordinate system thus XYZ hand .

XYZ hand navigation then proceeds with the hand fingers in a pose as described above held before the operator s body at a predetermined neutral location . Access to the three translational and three rotational degrees of freedom of a three space object or camera is effected in the following natural way left right movement of the hand with respect to the body s natural coordinate system results in movement along the computational context s x axis up down movement of the hand results in movement along the controlled context s y axis and forward back hand movement toward away from the operator s body results in z axis motion within the context. Similarly rotation of the operator s hand about the index finger leads to a roll change of the computational context s orientation pitch and yaw changes are effected analogously through rotation of the operator s hand about the middle finger and thumb respectively.

Note that while computational context is used here to refer to the entity being controlled by the XYZ hand method and seems to suggest either a synthetic three space object or camera it should be understood that the technique is equally useful for controlling the various degrees of freedom of real world objects the pan tilt roll controls of a video or motion picture camera equipped with appropriate rotational actuators for example. Further the physical degrees of freedom afforded by the XYZ hand posture may be somewhat less literally mapped even in a virtual domain In the present embodiment the XYZ hand is also used to provide navigational access to large panoramic display images so that left right and up down motions of the operator s hand lead to the expected left right or up down panning about the image but forward back motion of the operator s hand maps to zooming control.

In every case coupling between the motion of the hand and the induced computational translation rotation may be either direct i.e. a positional or rotational offset of the operator s hand maps one to one via some linear or nonlinear function to a positional or rotational offset of the object or camera in the computational context or indirect i.e. positional or rotational offset of the operator s hand maps one to one via some linear or nonlinear function to a first or higher degree derivative of position orientation in the computational context ongoing integration then effects a non static change in the computational context s actual zero order position orientation . This latter means of control is analogous to use of a an automobile s gas pedal in which a constant offset of the pedal leads more or less to a constant vehicle Speed.

The neutral location that serves as the real world XYZ hand s local six degree of freedom coordinate origin may be established 1 as an absolute position and orientation in space relative say to the enclosing room 2 as a fixed position and orientation relative to the operator herself e.g. eight inches in front of the body ten inches below the chin and laterally in line with the shoulder plane irrespective of the overall position and heading of the operator or 3 interactively through deliberate secondary action of the operator using for example a gestural command enacted by the operator s other hand said command indicating that the XYZ hand s present position and orientation should henceforth be used as the translational and rotational origin .

It is further convenient to provide a detent region or dead zone about the XYZ hand s neutral location such that movements within this volume do not map to movements in the controlled context.

The present invention contemplates single hand commands and poses as well as two handed commands and poses. illustrates examples of two hand combinations and associated notation in an embodiment of the invention. Reviewing the notation of the first example full stop reveals that it comprises two closed fists. The snapshot example has the thumb and index finger of each hand extended thumbs pointing toward each other defining a goal post shaped frame. The rudder and throttle start position is fingers and thumbs pointing up palms facing the screen.

At step the information is translated to the gesture notation described above. At decision block it is determined if the pose is valid. This may be accomplished via a simple string comparison using the generated notation string. If the pose is not valid the system returns to step . If the pose is valid the system sends the notation and position information to the computer at step . At step the computer determines the appropriate action to take in response to the gesture and updates the display accordingly at step .

In one embodiment of the invention steps are accomplished by the on camera processor. In other embodiments the processing can be accomplished by the system computer if desired.

The system is able to parse and translate a stream of low level gestures recovered by an underlying system and turn those parsed and translated gestures into a stream of command or event data that can be used to control a broad range of computer applications and systems. These techniques and algorithms may be embodied in a system consisting of computer code that provides both an engine implementing these techniques and a platform for building computer applications that make use of the engine s capabilities.

One embodiment is focused on enabling rich gestural use of human hands in computer interfaces but is also able to recognize gestures made by other body parts including but not limited to arms torso legs and the head as well as non hand physical tools of various kinds both static and articulating including but not limited to calipers compasses flexible curve approximators and pointing devices of various shapes. The markers and tags may be applied to items and tools that may be carried and used by the operator as desired.

The system described here incorporates a number of innovations that make it possible to build gestural systems that are rich in the range of gestures that can be recognized and acted upon while at the same time providing for easy integration into applications.

1 a compact and efficient way to specify encode for use in computer programs gestures at several different levels of aggregation 

a. a single hand s pose the configuration and orientation of the parts of the hand relative to one another a single hand s orientation and position in three dimensional space

c. multi person combinations the system can track more than two hands and so more than one person can cooperatively or competitively in the case of game applications control the target system

2 a programmatic technique for registering specific gestures from each category above that are relevant to a given application context

3 algorithms for parsing the gesture stream so that registered gestures can be identified and events encapsulating those gestures can be delivered to relevant application contexts

The specification system 1 with constituent elements 1a to 1f provides the basis for making use of the gestural parsing and translating capabilities of the system described here.

Using relative joint orientations allows the system described here to avoid problems associated with differing hand sizes and geometries. No operator calibration is required with this system. In addition specifying poses as a string or collection of relative orientations allows more complex gesture specifications to be easily created by combining pose representations with further filters and specifications.

Using a small number of discrete states for pose specification makes it possible to specify poses compactly as well as to ensure accurate pose recognition using a variety of underlying tracking technologies for example passive optical tracking using cameras active optical tracking using lighted dots and cameras electromagnetic field tracking etc .

Gestures in every category 1a to 1f may be partially or minimally specified so that non critical data is ignored. For example a gesture in which the position of two fingers is definitive and other finger positions are unimportant may be represented by a single specification in which the operative positions of the two relevant fingers is given and within the same string wild cards or generic ignore these indicators are listed for the other fingers.

All of the innovations described here for gesture recognition including but not limited to the multi layered specification technique use of relative orientations quantization of data and allowance for partial or minimal specification at every level generalize beyond specification of hand gestures to specification of gestures using other body parts and manufactured tools and objects.

The programmatic techniques for registering gestures 2 consist of a defined set of Application Programming Interface calls that allow a programmer to define which gestures the engine should make available to other parts of the running system.

These API routines may be used at application set up time creating a static interface definition that is used throughout the lifetime of the running application. They may also be used during the course of the run allowing the interface characteristics to change on the fly. This real time alteration of the interface makes it possible to

iii to create applications in which the user is able to alter or extend the interface vocabulary of the running system itself.

Algorithms for parsing the gesture stream 3 compare gestures specified as in 1 and registered as in 2 against incoming low level gesture data. When a match for a registered gesture is recognized event data representing the matched gesture is delivered up the stack to running applications.

Efficient real time matching is desired in the design of this system and specified gestures are treated as a tree of possibilities that are processed as quickly as possible.

In addition the primitive comparison operators used internally to recognize specified gestures are also exposed for the applications programmer to use so that further comparison flexible state inspection in complex or compound gestures for example can happen even from within application contexts.

Recognition locking semantics are an innovation of the system described here. These semantics are implied by the registration API 2 and to a lesser extent embedded within the specification vocabulary 1 . Registration API calls include

If a gesture has been recognized its continuation conditions take precedence over all entry conditions for gestures of the same or lower priorities. This distinction between entry and continuation states adds significantly to perceived system usability.

The system described here includes algorithms for robust operation in the face of real world data error and uncertainty. Data from low level tracking systems may be incomplete for a variety of reasons including occlusion of markers in optical tracking network drop out or processing lag etc .

Missing data is marked by the parsing system and interpolated into either last known or most likely states depending on the amount and context of the missing data.

If data about a particular gesture component for example the orientation of a particular joint is missing but the last known state of that particular component can be analyzed as physically possible the system uses this last known state in its real time matching.

Conversely if the last known state is analyzed as physically impossible the system falls back to a best guess range for the component and uses this synthetic data in its real time matching.

The specification and parsing systems described here have been carefully designed to support handedness agnosticism so that for multi hand gestures either hand is permitted to satisfy pose requirements.

The system can provide an environment in which virtual space depicted on one or more display devices screens is treated as coincident with the physical space inhabited by the operator or operators of the system. An embodiment of such an environment is described here. This current embodiment includes three projector driven screens at fixed locations is driven by a single desktop computer and is controlled using the gestural vocabulary and interface system described herein. Note however that any number of screens are supported by the techniques being described that those screens may be mobile rather than fixed that the screens may be driven by many independent computers simultaneously and that the overall system can be controlled by any input device or technique.

The interface system described in this disclosure should have a means of determining the dimensions orientations and positions of screens in physical space. Given this information the system is able to dynamically map the physical space in which these screens are located and which the operators of the system inhabit as a projection into the virtual space of computer applications running on the system. As part of this automatic mapping the system also translates the scale angles depth dimensions and other spatial characteristics of the two spaces in a variety of ways according to the needs of the applications that are hosted by the system.

This continuous translation between physical and virtual space makes possible the consistent and pervasive use of a number of interface techniques that are difficult to achieve on existing application platforms or that must be implemented piece meal for each application running on existing platforms. These techniques include but are not limited to 

1 Use of literal pointing using the hands in a gestural interface environment or using physical pointing tools or devices as a pervasive and natural interface technique.

3 Graphics rendering that changes depending on operator position for example simulating parallax shifts to enhance depth perception.

4 Inclusion of physical objects in on screen display taking into account real world position orientation state etc. For example an operator standing in front of a large opaque screen could see both applications graphics and a representation of the true position of a scale model that is behind the screen and is perhaps moving or changing orientation .

It is important to note that literal pointing is different from the abstract pointing used in mouse based windowing interfaces and most other contemporary systems. In those systems the operator must learn to manage a translation between a virtual pointer and a physical pointing device and must map between the two cognitively.

By contrast in the systems described in this disclosure there is no difference between virtual and physical space except that virtual space is more amenable to mathematical manipulation either from an application or user perspective so there is no cognitive translation required of the operator.

The closest analogy for the literal pointing provided by the embodiment described here is the touch sensitive screen as found for example on many ATM machines . A touch sensitive screen provides a one to one mapping between the two dimensional display space on the screen and the two dimensional input space of the screen surface. In an analogous fashion the systems described here provide a flexible mapping possibly but not necessarily one to one between a virtual space displayed on one or more screens and the physical space inhabited by the operator. Despite the usefulness of the analogy it is worth understanding that the extension of this mapping approach to three dimensions an arbitrarily large architectural environment and multiple screens is non trivial.

In addition to the components described herein the system may also implement algorithms implementing a continuous systems level mapping perhaps modified by rotation translation scaling or other geometrical transformations between the physical space of the environment and the display space on each screen.

A rendering stack which takes the computational objects and the mapping and outputs a graphical representation of the virtual space.

An input events processing stack which takes event data from a control system in the current embodiment both gestural and pointing data from the system and mouse input and maps spatial data from input events to coordinates in virtual space. Translated events are then delivered to running applications.

A glue layer allowing the system to host applications running across several computers on a local area network.
