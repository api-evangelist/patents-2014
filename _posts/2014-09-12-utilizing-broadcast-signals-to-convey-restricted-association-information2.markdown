title: Utilizing broadcast signals to convey restricted association information
abstract: Systems and methodologies are described that facilitate transmitting access point types and/or restricted association parameters using broadcast signals, such as beacons, pilot signals, etc. The type or restricted association information can be indicated by one or more intrinsic aspects of the signal, such as specified parameters. In addition, the type or information can be indicated by one or more extrinsic signal aspects, such as frequency, interval, periodicity, etc. Using this information, a mobile device can determine whether an access point implements restricted association. If so, the mobile device can request an access point or related group identifier before determining whether to establish connection therewith. The identifier can be verified against a list of accessible access points and/or groups to make the determination.

The following description relates generally to wireless communications and more particularly to utilizing broadcast signals to transmit restricted association data in a wireless communication network.

Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various types of communication content such as for example voice data and so on. Typical wireless communication systems may be multiple access systems capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing available system resources e.g. bandwidth transmit power . . . . Examples of such multiple access systems may include code division multiple access CDMA systems time division multiple access TDMA systems frequency division multiple access FDMA systems orthogonal frequency division multiple access OFDMA systems and the like. Additionally the systems can conform to specifications such as third generation partnership project 3GPP 3GPP long term evolution LTE ultra mobile broadband UMB etc.

Generally wireless multiple access communication systems may simultaneously support communication for multiple mobile devices. Each mobile device may communicate with one or more base stations via transmissions on forward and reverse links. The forward link or downlink refers to the communication link from base stations to mobile devices and the reverse link or uplink refers to the communication link from mobile devices to base stations. Further communications between mobile devices and base stations may be established via single input single output SISO systems multiple input single output MISO systems multiple input multiple output MIMO systems and so forth. In addition mobile devices can communicate with other mobile devices and or base stations with other base stations in peer to peer wireless network configurations.

MIMO systems commonly employ multiple N transmit antennas and multiple N receive antennas for data transmission. The antennas can relate to both base stations and mobile devices in one example allowing bi directional communication between the devices on the wireless network. As mobile devices move throughout service areas cells utilized for communication by the devices can be reselected between one or more access points e.g. macrocells femtocells etc. . This can occur for example where an available access point or serving cell thereof can offer a better signal or service than a current access point. The mobile devices can measure parameters related to one or more cells such as signal quality service level etc. and rank the cells according to desirability which can be based on one or more of the parameters. In one example the available access point can relate to a home access point for a given mobile device offering desirable billing coverage service options etc. Accordingly cells utilized for communication can be reselected to the more desirable access point when within a specified range.

Referring now to a wireless communication system is illustrated in accordance with various embodiments presented herein. System comprises a base station that can include multiple antenna groups. For example one antenna group can include antennas and another group can comprise antennas and and an additional group can include antennas and . Two antennas are illustrated for each antenna group however more or fewer antennas can be utilized for each group. Base station can additionally include a transmitter chain and a receiver chain each of which can in turn comprise a plurality of components associated with signal transmission and reception e.g. processors modulators multiplexers demodulators demultiplexers antennas etc. as will be appreciated by one skilled in the art.

Base station can communicate with one or more mobile devices such as mobile device and mobile device however it is to be appreciated that base station can communicate with substantially any number of mobile devices similar to mobile devices and . Mobile devices and can be for example cellular phones smart phones laptops handheld communication devices handheld computing devices satellite radios global positioning systems PDAs and or any other suitable device for communicating over wireless communication system . As depicted mobile device is in communication with antennas and where antennas and transmit information to mobile device over a forward link and receive information from mobile device over a reverse link . In a frequency division duplex FDD system forward link can utilize a different frequency band than that used by reverse link for example. Further in a time division duplex TDD system forward link and reverse link can utilize a common frequency.

Each group of antennas and or the area in which they are designated to communicate can be referred to as a sector or cell of base station . For example antenna groups can be designed to communicate to mobile devices in a sector of the areas covered by base station . In communication over forward link the transmitting antennas of base station can utilize beamforming to improve signal to noise ratio of forward link for mobile device . Also while base station utilizes beamforming to transmit to mobile device scattered randomly through an associated coverage mobile devices in neighboring cells can be subject to less interference as compared to a base station transmitting through a single antenna to all its mobile devices. Moreover mobile devices and can communicate directly with one another using a peer to peer or ad hoc technology.

In addition the base station can communicate with a network which can be one or more networks including a wireless service access network e.g. a 3G network over a backhaul link connection. The network can store information regarding access parameters related to the mobile device and and other parameters of a wireless access network to provide service to the devices an . Furthermore a femtocell can be provided to facilitate communicating with the mobile device over forward link and reverse link similarly to forward link and reverse link as described supra . The femtocell can provide access to one or more mobile devices much like the base station but on a smaller scale. In one example femtocell can be configured in a residence business and or other close range setting e.g. theme park stadium apartment complex etc. . The femtocell can connect to the network utilizing a backhaul link connection which can be over a broadband Internet connection T1 T3 digital subscriber line DSL cable etc. in one example. The network can similarly provide access information for the mobile device .

According to an example mobile devices and can travel over service areas performing cell reselection among disparate base stations and or femtocells during travel. In this regard the mobile devices and can effectuate continuous wireless service seamless to users of the mobile devices and . In one example not shown mobile device can have been communicating with the base station similarly to the mobile device and can have moved into a specified range of the femtocell . In this regard the mobile device can have reselected one or more cells related to the femtocell to receive more desirable wireless service access. In one example the femtocell can be a home access point for the mobile device offering more desirable billing and or other access options. In another example the femtocell can be related to a business or venue offering options or data tailored to the respective business or venue. Thus mobile device can reselect one or more cells related to the femtocell in an idle and or connected mode to receive such tailored options. In addition as mobile device moves toward base station it can reselect a cell related thereto for a variety of reasons e.g. to mitigate interference on the femtocell to receive a more optimal signal or increased throughput etc. .

In traveling over the service area mobile devices and or can continually measure available base stations such as base station femtocells such as femtocell and or other access points to determine when cell reselection is beneficial to the mobile devices and or . The measuring can include for example evaluating signal quality throughput services available a wireless access provider related to the access point and or the like. Based on one or more of the measurements the mobile devices and or can rank access points for reselection. Upon determining the ranking the mobile devices and or can attempt cell reselection with the highest ranking access point. In addition the mobile devices and or can maintain a list of accessible access points and or groups of accessible access points. The accessible access points can relate to for example restricted association access points that the mobile devices and or are authorized to access and or to which access is preferred or otherwise favorable over other access points.

In one example the femtocell can be such a restricted association access point. Restricted association access points for example can be restricted in some aspects where each access point provides certain services to certain mobile devices e.g. mobile devices and or but not necessarily to other mobile devices or access terminals not shown . For example the femtocell can be restricted to not provide to the other mobile devices or access terminals registration signaling voice call data access and or additional services. Restricted association access points can be deployed in an ad hoc manner. For example a given homeowner can install and configure a restricted access point for the home.

In one example the mobile devices and or can identify one or more available access points based at least in part on one or more indicators in a broadcast signal related to the access point s . Upon receiving the one or more indicators the mobile devices and or can ensure the access point s is are in the list or that a related group identifier is in the list before attempting cell reselection. In another example the mobile devices and or can verify association of the access point with the list before measuring the parameters for ranking.

In one example the base station and or femtocell can transmit broadcast signals which can be received by one or more mobile devices and or . The broadcast signals can be beacon signals utilized to identify presence and or signal strength of a sector for communication pilot signals utilized to determine initial communication parameters for receiving subsequent signals and or the like. In addition the broadcast signals can include a restricted association indicator an access point identifier a group identifier related to a group of access points e.g. access points of common service providers access points related to a corporation or community etc. a sector identifier a type identifier and or additional indicators. The restricted association indicator can indicate for example whether access to the base station and or femtocell is restricted to certain mobile devices and or groups thereof. For example the access point can relate to a corporation where mobile devices owned by the corporation or employees thereof can utilize the access point. Additionally the restricted association indicator can indicate a level of restricted association the access point can restrict all access and or signaling access data access registration access service access and or the like. Upon receiving the broadcast signal one or more mobile devices and or can detect a restricted association indicator. It is to be appreciated that this can be a value such as a Boolean variable an enumeration of values a text identifier and or the like where a presence or absence of the indicator and or certain values thereof can be detected.

Where the indicator is present in the broadcast signal or of a given value such as to indicate that the base station and or femtocell implements restricted association the mobile devices and or can additionally evaluate an access point and or group identifier and compare the identifier to a list of accessible identifiers for example. Each access point such as base station and or femtocell can include an identifier in the broadcast signal in one example. The identifier can be compared to a maintained list of accessible access point and or group identifiers to ensure it is in the list. If so communication can be requested and or established with the base station and or femtocell this can be part of cell reselection in one example. It is to be appreciated that where the restricted association indicator is false or absent from the broadcast signal an identifier need not necessarily be evaluated or present since access to the base station and or femtocell is not restricted. Moreover a sector identifier can be evaluated to determine whether the access point implements restricted association in one example. In addition for instance the indicator and or access point or group identifier can be indicated by one or more extrinsic aspects of the broadcast signal such as a transmission time interval size periodicity frequency utilized and or the like. The mobile devices and or can evaluate one or more of the extrinsic aspects in this example to determine the indicators and or identifiers.

Now referring to a wireless communication system configured to support a number of mobile devices is illustrated. The system provides communication for multiple cells such as for example macrocells A G with each cell being serviced by a corresponding access point A G. As described previously for instance the access points A G related to the macrocells A G can be base stations. Mobile devices A I are shown dispersed at various locations throughout the wireless communication system . Each mobile device A I can communicate with one or more access points A G on a forward link and or a reverse link as described. In addition access points A C are shown. These can be smaller scale access points such as femtocells offering services related to a particular service location as described. The mobile devices A I can additionally communicate with these smaller scale access points A C to receive offered services. The wireless communication system can provide service over a large geographic region in one example e.g. macrocells A G can cover a few blocks in a neighborhood and the femtocell access points A C can be present in areas such as residences office buildings and or the like as described . In an example the mobile devices A I can establish connection with the access points A G and or A C over the air and or over a backhaul connection.

Additionally as shown the mobile devices A I can travel throughout the system and can reselect cells related to the various access points A G and or A C as it moves through the different macrocells A G or femtocell coverage areas. In one example the one or more of the mobile devices A I can be associated with a home femtocell related to at least one of femtocell access points A C. For example mobile device I can be associated with femtocell access point B as its home femtocell. Thus though mobile device I is in macrocell B and thus in coverage area of access point B it can communicate with the femtocell access point B instead of or in addition to access point B. In one example the femtocell access point B can provide additional services to the mobile device I such as desirable billing or charges minute usage enhanced services e.g. faster broadband access media services etc. . Thus when the mobile device I is in range of the femtocell access point B it can be reined in to communicate therewith by favoring the femtocell access point B in reselection.

For example mobile device D can be associated with femtocell access point C. As the mobile device D moves from macrocell C into D and closer to access points D and or C it can begin the cell reselection process as described herein. This can include for example measuring surrounding cell parameters e.g. related to access points C D and C to determine a desirable connection. The parameters can relate to for example signal quality connection throughput services offered a service provider related to the access point and or the like. The mobile device D can additionally verify an identifier of the access point as present in a list of accessible access points as described. The list can additionally or alternatively identify groups of access points where a group identifier of the access point can be verified with group identifiers in the list. In the foregoing example the mobile device D can measure parameters for access points C D and C and rank the cells to determine whether to perform cell reselection from access point C to one of the others if their rank is higher. As in the previous example where femtocell access point C relates to a home femtocell of the mobile device D it can favor it for reselection e.g. by evaluating an added parameter offset to increase its value and or hysteresis to decrease parameter values of other access points for example . If one or more of the disparate access points D and or C rank higher than the access point C mobile device D can reselect one or more cells related to the disparate access point D or C whether in an idle or connected mode.

In one example one or more of the disparate access points D and or C can implement restricted association where some mobile devices cannot connect thereto and or the access points D and or C can restrict certain mobile devices with respect to providing signaling data access registration service and or the like. This can be based at least in part on a service provider of the mobile device and the restricted associated access point for example. In another example the restricted association access point can relate to certain mobile devices such as a corporate access point restricting access only to corporate issued mobile devices. Thus if the mobile device D cannot reselect cells related to one or more of the disparate access points D and or C due to restricted association it can attempt cell reselection with one or more of the other ranked access points until it finds an access point to which it can connect. Where the mobile device D cannot connect to access point D and or C due to restricted association it can receive a restriction code indicating the reason for the restriction.

Furthermore as described the mobile devices A I can maintain a list of accessible access points and or groups thereof. In one example the list can include only certain types of access points such as femtocells since other types of access points such as macrocells can be accessible from substantially any mobile device. The list of accessible access points and or groups can be originally populated for example by one or more access points in communication with the mobile device A I which can retrieve the information from an underlying wireless network as described. As the mobile devices A I move throughout the coverage area of the wireless system and reselects cells as described it can first verify the cells as being present in the list where relevant. In one example if the mobile devices A I determine one or more femtocell access points A C to be the highest ranked cell based on measurements as described it can verify that the respective femtocell access point is in the list. If not the mobile devices A I can decide not to attempt access to the femtocell access point and can attempt connection with the next highest ranked access point and or attempt to locate another access point on a disparate frequency.

As described above the access points A G and or A C can transmit broadcast signals that can be utilized to indicate presence of the access point and or related sector specify initial communication parameters and or the like. In addition the broadcast signals can indicate whether the access points A G and or A C implement restricted association and or a related identifier for the access point and or a corresponding access point group as described. The broadcast signals can additionally identify a related sector type of access point etc. in an example. The mobile devices A I can utilize this information to determine if a highly ranked access point implements restricted association and if so whether that access point is in the maintained list of accessible access points. If in the list the mobile device s can request connection establishment and or establish a connection with the access point as described above. It is to be appreciated as described that extrinsic aspects of the broadcast signal can be utilized to indicate and determine the specified restricted association information the extrinsic aspects can include broadcast signal type duration periodicity interval length frequency and or the like.

Turning to illustrated is a communications apparatus for employment within a wireless communications environment. The communications apparatus can be a base station or a portion thereof a mobile device or a portion thereof or substantially any communications apparatus that receives data transmitted in a wireless communications environment. The communications apparatus can include a broadcast signal evaluator that analyzes one or more broadcast signals to determine restricted association parameters associated with an access point not shown transmitting the signals an access list controller that maintains a list of accessible access points to which connection can be established and a connection requestor that requests and or establishes a connection with one or more of the access points. In one example the connection requestor can request and or establish an initial connection additionally however the connection requestor can also request the connection during cell reselection.

According to an example the broadcast signal evaluator can analyze one or more broadcast signals transmitted by one or more access points to determine an access point to which to connect for receiving wireless communication services. For example the broadcast signal evaluator can determine one or more intrinsic and or extrinsic aspects of the signal that can be indicative of one or more indicators and or identifiers related to restricted association of an associated access point. In one example a restricted association indicator can be included in the broadcast signal e.g. as one or more parameters such that the broadcast signal evaluator can determine whether the associated access point implements restricted association based at least in part on the included indicator. It is to be appreciated that such an indication of restricted association can be determined based at least in part on a signal type duration periodicity interval frequency etc. as described.

If the broadcast signal evaluator determines that the access point implements restricted association the broadcast signal evaluator can further determine an access point identifier and or an identifier related to a group of access points present in the signal or identified by the extrinsic aspects as described. The identifier can be text based of a primitive type an enumeration and or the like for example. The access list controller can verify existence of the determined access point identifier and or group identifier in a maintained list of accessible access points and or groups. If the identifier is in the list the connection requestor can request connection with the access point. It is to be appreciated that the access list controller can additionally or alternatively maintain a list of access point and or associated groups to which connection is prohibited in this case the access list controller verifies that the access point and or group identifier is not in the list. If a restricted association indicator is not present within the broadcast signal as determined by the broadcast signal evaluator the connection requestor can request connection with the access point since the access point does not implement restricted association. Thus an access point and or group identifier can be read only when needed to conserve resources of the communications apparatus in one example.

The connection requestor can additionally request connection based at least in part on the broadcast signal during cell reselection as described supra. This can occur in an idle and or connected mode of the communications apparatus in one example. In addition a sector identifier can be determined from intrinsic and or extrinsic aspects of the broadcast signal as described by the broadcast signal evaluator . Based on the sector identifier for example the broadcast signal evaluator can determine a type and or restricted association aspect of a related access point. Thus in this example an explicit restricted association indicator need not be received or analyzed. In one example the access list controller caches the restricted association information of an access point based on the sector identifier of the access point and does not need to receive an explicit restricted association indicator. Moreover for example the sector identifier can be unique and or within a certain range such that the access list controller can associate the identifier as a restricted association access point or otherwise. As described if the sector identifier is determined as relating to a restricted association access point an access point or group identifier can be determined from the broadcast signal and the access list controller can determine that access is allowed to the restricted association access point as described. Moreover the restricted association indicator whether derived from extrinsic or intrinsic information by the broadcast signal evaluator can indicate restricted association with respect to signaling data access registration and service and or the like.

Now referring to illustrated is a wireless communications system that facilitates indicating restricted association information within broadcast signals. The wireless device access point and or restricted association access point can be a base station femtocell mobile device or portion thereof. In one example wireless device can transmit information to an access point and or restricted association access point over a reverse link or uplink channel further wireless device can receive information from access point or restricted association access point over a forward link or downlink channel. Moreover system can be a MIMO system. Also the components and functionalities shown and described below in the wireless device can be present in the access point and or restricted association access point as well and vice versa in one example the configuration depicted excludes these components for ease of explanation.

Wireless device includes a broadcast signal receiver that can receive one or more broadcast signals transmitted from one or more access points such as access point and restricted association access point a restricted association indicator identifier that can determine a restricted association indication related to the access point based at least in part on the broadcast signal an access point identifier determiner that can obtain an access point and or group identifier based on the broadcast signal an access list controller that can maintain a list of accessible access points and or groups of access points and a cell reselector that can reselect one or more cells related to access points and as described previously. In one example the cell reselector can additionally perform cell measurement ranking and reselection as described.

The restricted association access point can comprise a broadcast signal generator that can create a signal which can be broadcast such that a number of mobile devices can receive the signal e.g. as a beacon or pilot signal and a restricted association specifier that can integrate one or more restricted association indicators and or identifiers in the broadcast signal. In one example the restricted association specifier can specify the restricted association indicators and or identifiers as one or more parameters in a portion of the broadcast signal. Additionally or alternatively the restricted association specifier can modify one or more parameters related to transmission of the broadcast signal to indicate the indicators and or identifiers such as a frequency utilized one or more subcarriers or combination thereof duration interval periodicity and or the like. Moreover a combination of the foregoing examples can be utilized to convey the restricted association information.

According to an example the broadcast signal generator can create a broadcast signal for transmission that identifies one or more aspects of the restricted association access point . In one example the broadcast signal can be a beacon signal that allows devices to detect presence of the restricted association access point . In another example the broadcast signal can be a pilot signal that allows mobile devices to determine timing and other parameters to facilitate subsequent communication with the restricted association access point . The broadcast signal can comprise for example identification information such as a sector identifier in one example. The restricted association specifier can include additional information using the broadcast signal. For example an access point type identifier a restricted association identifier an access point identifier an identifier related to a group of related access points and or other information can be included as parameters of the broadcast signal. In another example the foregoing can be indicated by affecting one or more aspects of the broadcast signal as described e.g. duration periodicity frequency utilized subcarriers interval etc. . The restricted association access point can accordingly transmit the broadcast signal.

Additionally the wireless device can be communicating with the access point to receive wireless communication services. The cell reselector can continually monitor surrounding cells determining measurements related thereto and can rank cells for reselection as described. In one example the restricted association access point can rank highly this can be because the restricted association access point is a home access point for the wireless device is of a threshold signal strength has determined favorable services and or the like as described previously. In this regard the broadcast signal receiver can receive the broadcast signal transmitted by the restricted association access point identifier once the cell reselector determines to measure parameters associated therewith.

Upon receiving the broadcast signal the restricted association indicator identifier can be utilized to determine a restricted association indicator from the signal. In one example this can be an explicit parameter and or based on extrinsic aspects of the signal as described. In another example the restricted association indicator identifier can determine the indication based at least in part on a sector identifier. For example the sector identifier can be associated with such an indication by being within a range specified for restricted association access points. In addition upon initially establishing or being denied establishment with the restricted association access point the wireless device can store the sector identifier and utilize such in requesting or not requesting subsequent communication establishment.

If the restricted association indicator identifier determines that the restricted association access point implements restricted association the access point identifier determiner can be utilized to determine an access point identifier and or a related group identifier from the broadcast signal. The determined identifier can be compared with a list of accessible access points and or groups maintained by the access list controller . If the identifier is in the list the cell reselector can request connection establishment from the restricted association access point as described. If not the cell reselector can move to the next cell in the list and associated broadcast signals can be received by the broadcast signal receiver in one example. In addition it is to be appreciated that the wireless device can initially establish connection with the restricted association access point based at least in part on the determined restricted association information. As described the restricted association indicator can be a Boolean indicator in one example however it is to be appreciated that the indicator can also be a multi value variable that specifies restriction as to signaling data access registration service and or the like in one example. In addition the access point and or group identifier can be text based of a primitive type an enumeration data structure and or the like as mentioned.

Referring to methodologies relating to cell reselection and broadcasting access point types and or restricted association indicators are illustrated. While for purposes of simplicity of explanation the methodologies are shown and described as a series of acts it is to be understood and appreciated that the methodologies are not limited by the order of acts as some acts may in accordance with one or more embodiments occur in different orders and or concurrently with other acts from that shown and described herein. For example those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that a methodology could alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states or events such as in a state diagram. Moreover not all illustrated acts may be required to implement a methodology in accordance with one or more embodiments.

Turning to a methodology that facilitates cell reselection in wireless communications is displayed. At surrounding cells are measured to determine one or more parameters related thereto. As described the parameters can relate to communication metrics such as signal strength throughput etc. and or one or more additional considerations such as an access point identifier a group identifier sector identifier services offered a related access provider etc. In addition the parameters can relate to the cell being provided by a home access point which provides enhanced billing aspects additional service or speeds and or the like. The parameters can also relate to offsets or hysteresis to increase consideration of desirable access points such as a home access point for example and or decrease consideration of other access points. At the surrounding cells can be ranked according to the determined parameters. The ranking can indicate an order of desirable cells from which to receive wireless communication services.

At it can be determined whether the highest ranked cell is that currently utilized. Such a determination can be utilized to ensure connection with an optimal access point. If the highest ranked cell is the cell currently utilized to receive wireless communications the method proceeds back to step to again measure surrounding cells. This can be based on a timer in one example as to not flood the network with cell measurements or spend resources by constantly measuring the cells. If the highest ranked cell is not the currently utilized cell at cell reselection can be performed as described herein to perform cell reselection to the highest ranked cell. It is to be appreciated in one example that once cell reselection is complete the method in one example can proceed back to step to continue measuring surrounding cells. As described the access points can be base stations femtocells and or the like.

Turning to illustrated is a methodology that establishes communication with one or more access points in a wireless communications network. At a restricted association indicator can be determined from a received broadcast signal. For example as described the indicator can be determined based at least in part on one or more parameters specified within the broadcast signals and or one or more extrinsic aspects of the signal such as frequency utilized subcarriers interval periodicity length etc. as described. At an access point group identifier can be obtained from the broadcast signal based on the indicator. Thus where at least some restricted association is indicated by the indicator the group identifier can be determined to ensure access can be received from the access point. In this regard at it can be determined whether the group identifier is in a maintained list of accessible group identifiers. The list can be maintained to mitigate spending resources requesting connection with access points for which access will likely be denied based on the group identifier e.g. the identifier can be related to a provider of the access point which restricts devices to which it will provide access . At communication can be established with a related access point where the identifier is in the maintained list. This can be an initial communication establishment and or cell reselection as described previously.

Turning to illustrated is a methodology that transmits information regarding an access point and or a type thereof. At an access point type is determined this can be related to one or more restricted association implementations for example. The types can relate to restricted association or not restricted association or can be an enumeration of types indicating varying levels of restriction for example as described. At a broadcast signal can be generated for identifying the access point according to the type. The signal can include parameters related to the access point type in one example and or parameters related to identifying a related group of the access point. At the broadcast signal can be transmitted over a wireless network such to identify the access point and the type. Thus as described the broadcast signal can be transmitted in such a way to indicate a type of the access point. For example an interval periodicity frequency length etc. of a broadcast signal can indicate the type as determined by one or more mobile devices. This facilitates efficient identification such that a mobile device can interrogate further where a restricted association type is indicated as opposed to a non restricted type as described.

It will be appreciated that in accordance with one or more aspects described herein inferences can be made regarding many aspects of cell reselection such as measuring the parameters ranking the cells according to the parameters and or additional parameters and even aspects of actual reselection such as when to perform the reselection etc. as described. As used herein the term to infer or inference refers generally to the process of reasoning about or inferring states of the system environment and or user from a set of observations as captured via events and or data. Inference can be employed to identify a specific context or action or can generate a probability distribution over states for example. The inference can be probabilistic that is the computation of a probability distribution over states of interest based on a consideration of data and events. Inference can also refer to techniques employed for composing higher level events from a set of events and or data. Such inference results in the construction of new events or actions from a set of observed events and or stored event data whether or not the events are correlated in close temporal proximity and whether the events and data come from one or several event and data sources. In one example inferences can additionally be made in determining parameters of cells during measurement based at least in part on receiving further information from one or more mobile devices.

By way of illustration and not limitation nonvolatile memory can include read only memory ROM programmable ROM PROM electrically programmable ROM EPROM electrically erasable PROM EEPROM or flash memory. Volatile memory can include random access memory RAM which acts as external cache memory. By way of illustration and not limitation RAM is available in many forms such as synchronous RAM SRAM dynamic RAM DRAM synchronous DRAM SDRAM double data rate SDRAM DDR SDRAM enhanced SDRAM ESDRAM Synchlink DRAM SLDRAM and direct Rambus RAM DRRAM . The memory of the subject systems and methods is intended to comprise without being limited to these and any other suitable types of memory.

Processor can further be operatively coupled to an access list controller that can maintain a list of accessible access points. As described the list can comprise identifiers for restricted association access points and or groups related thereto. In this regard the access list controller can be consulted in requesting access to a restricted association access point. This can ensure that the mobile device does not expend resources requesting connection establishment with access points for which association is restricted with respect to the mobile device . In addition processor and or receiver can further be operatively coupled to a broadcast signal evaluator that can analyze broadcast signals received from disparate access points to determine restricted association information related to the access points.

For example the broadcast signal evaluator can determine a restricted association indicator as described based at least in part on one or more intrinsic aspects e.g. parameters and or extrinsic aspects e.g. frequency interval periodicity etc. of the broadcast signal. Using this information the mobile device can efficiently determine whether it needs to request additional information such as an access point group identifier which can also be indicated by the broadcast signal for verification by the access list controller . Mobile device still further comprises a modulator and transmitter that respectively modulate and transmit signals to for instance a base station another mobile device etc. Although depicted as being separate from the processor it is to be appreciated that the access list controller broadcast signal evaluator demodulator and or modulator can be part of the processor or multiple processors not shown .

According to an example the broadcast signal generator can create the broadcast signal such as a beacon and or pilot signal and the type indicator can specify parameters related to the type in the signal. The parameters can relate to specifying one or more restricted association implementations related to the base station. In addition or alternatively the type indicator can specify parameters for transmitting the broadcast signals based at least in part on type. The parameters can relate to for example intervals for transmitting the broadcast signal periodicity for transmission frequency subcarriers to utilize length and or the like as described. The transmitter can broadcast the signal according to the parameters. In either case the mobile device s as described can identify restricted association and or type information related to the base station . Furthermore although depicted as being separate from the processor it is to be appreciated that the broadcast signal generator type indicator demodulator and or modulator can be part of the processor or multiple processors not shown .

At base station traffic data for a number of data streams is provided from a data source to a transmit TX data processor . According to an example each data stream can be transmitted over a respective antenna. TX data processor formats codes and interleaves the traffic data stream based on a particular coding scheme selected for that data stream to provide coded data.

The coded data for each data stream can be multiplexed with pilot data using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing OFDM techniques. Additionally or alternatively the pilot symbols can be frequency division multiplexed FDM time division multiplexed TDM or code division multiplexed CDM . The pilot data is typically a known data pattern that is processed in a known manner and can be used at mobile device to estimate channel response. The multiplexed pilot and coded data for each data stream can be modulated e.g. symbol mapped based on a particular modulation scheme e.g. binary phase shift keying BPSK quadrature phase shift keying QPSK M phase shift keying M PSK M quadrature amplitude modulation M QAM etc. selected for that data stream to provide modulation symbols. The data rate coding and modulation for each data stream can be determined by instructions performed or provided by processor .

The modulation symbols for the data streams can be provided to a TX MIMO processor which can further process the modulation symbols e.g. for OFDM . TX MIMO processor then provides Nmodulation symbol streams to Ntransmitters TMTR through . In various embodiments TX MIMO processor applies beamforming weights to the symbols of the data streams and to the antenna from which the symbol is being transmitted.

Each transmitter receives and processes a respective symbol stream to provide one or more analog signals and further conditions e.g. amplifies filters and upconverts the analog signals to provide a modulated signal suitable for transmission over the MIMO channel. Further Nmodulated signals from transmitters through are transmitted from Nantennas through respectively.

At mobile device the transmitted modulated signals are received by Nantennas through and the received signal from each antenna is provided to a respective receiver RCVR through . Each receiver conditions e.g. filters amplifies and downconverts a respective signal digitizes the conditioned signal to provide samples and further processes the samples to provide a corresponding received symbol stream.

An RX data processor can receive and process the Nreceived symbol streams from Nreceivers based on a particular receiver processing technique to provide N detected symbol streams. RX data processor can demodulate deinterleave and decode each detected symbol stream to recover the traffic data for the data stream. The processing by RX data processor is complementary to that performed by TX MIMO processor and TX data processor at base station .

A processor can periodically determine which precoding matrix to utilize as discussed above. Further processor can formulate a reverse link message comprising a matrix index portion and a rank value portion.

The reverse link message can comprise various types of information regarding the communication link and or the received data stream. The reverse link message can be processed by a TX data processor which also receives traffic data for a number of data streams from a data source modulated by a modulator conditioned by transmitters through and transmitted back to base station .

At base station the modulated signals from mobile device are received by antennas conditioned by receivers demodulated by a demodulator and processed by a RX data processor to extract the reverse link message transmitted by mobile device . Further processor can process the extracted message to determine which precoding matrix to use for determining the beamforming weights.
