title: Managing interactive communications campaigns with reduced customer-to-agent connection latency
abstract: A web-based hosted solution through which business entities create and manage communications campaigns is described. To reduce latency of customer-to-agent connections, the system implements an agent stay-on-line function by which a persistent telephony connection is established and maintained between the system infrastructure and an available agent. In this manner, the agent may handle multiple customers while avoiding an ACD hold queue. In addition, preferably a service-side hold queue also is established and maintained on the service-side of the infrastructure. This hold queue maintains calls that are waiting to be connected to available agents. It ensures that any customer abandons do not impair the connections being established and maintained to the agents.

This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 620 762 filed on Sep. 15 2012 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 718 270 which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 350 738 filed on Jan. 8 2009 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 270 594 the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.

This disclosure relates generally to a method and system for managing interactive communication campaigns over a computer network such as the Internet.

It is known to provide a web based hosted solution through which business entities create and manage interactive or notification communications campaigns. An example of an interactive communications campaign is a telephone campaign to determine whether a target recipient desires to transfer a credit card balance to a new account a campaign to remind a recipient that a credit card payment is due and to offer the recipient an opportunity to speak with a customer representative concerning any payment issues or the like. The hosted solution typically is implemented as an application or managed service provider. One or more business entities clients that desire to use the service typically register and access the service through an on line e.g. web based portal. In one representative use scenario the managed service provider entity provides outbound telemarketing services on behalf of participating clients. The campaign typically is provisioned by the client. Thus for example using a web based interface a participating client defines a script for the campaign imports a set of contacts and defines one or more parameters that govern how the campaign is to be run. At a designated time the service provider initiates the campaign e.g. by providing the contacts to a set of telephone servers that set up and manage the telephone calls to the targets of the campaign. During a given outbound call as noted above a recipient a customer may be afforded an option to connect to a contact center e.g. to speak to a customer representative. In such implementations the hosted solution typically is integrated directly with the contact center s on premises automatic call distributor ACD .

The subject matter herein describes a web based hosted solution a managed service or system through which business entities create and manage communications campaigns such as interactive campaigns that afford target recipients an opportunity to be connected to a call center. To reduce latency of customer to agent connections the system implements an agent stay on line function by which a persistent telephony connection is established and maintained between the system infrastructure and an available agent. In this manner the agent may handle multiple customers while avoiding a contact center ACD automated call distributor hold queue. In addition preferably a service side hold queue also is established and maintained on the service side of the infrastructure. This hold queue maintains calls that are waiting to be connected to available agents. It ensures that any customer abandons on the service side do not impair the connections that are being established and maintained to the agents.

The managed service carries out a communications campaign on behalf of a client. A campaign may have associated therewith one or more sub campaigns . A campaign typically has a preset configuration that applies to all of its sub campaigns. Using a Web interface a client loads a list of contacts that will be called and associates that list with a script which defines what will happen during a phone call to a contact. A sub campaign refers to one or more passes through a contact list that has been bound to a script and that has been associated with a timeframe Thus a sub campaign associates a list of contacts a script and a timeframe. Preferably a given agent also is associated with a skill group which is a grouping based on one or more business requirements. When a new sub campaign is created a skill group is assigned to that sub campaign. The schedule for the skill group then determines the calling rate at any given time. As more agents come on duty typically the calling rate increases to keep those agents busy. When fewer agents are on duty however calling rate decreases to avoid long hold queues for the customers that are being contacted. A single skill group can be assigned to multiple sub campaigns at the same time. Calls from each sub campaign preferably are sent to any available agent in the skill group. Preferably there is a service side hold queue for a particular skill group running a particular sub campaign.

The foregoing has outlined some of the more pertinent features of the subject matter. These features should be construed to be merely illustrative. Many other beneficial results can be attained by applying the disclosed subject matter in a different manner or by modifying the subject matter as will be described.

A business entity a client user has a machine such as a workstation or notebook computer. Typically a business entity user accesses the service provider architecture by opening a web browser on the machine to a URL associated with a service provider domain. Access may also be through an automated process such as via a Web services application programming interface API . Where a web browser is used the client authenticates to the managed service in the usual manner e.g. by entry of a username and password. The connection between the business entity machine and the service provider infrastructure may be encrypted or otherwise secure e.g. via SSL or the like. Although connectivity via the publicly routed Internet is typical the business entity may connect to the service provider infrastructure over any local area wide area wireless wired private or other dedicated network. As seen in the service provider architecture comprises an IP switch a set of one or more web server machines a set of one more application server machines a database management system and a set of one or more telephony server machines . A representative web server machine comprises commodity hardware e.g. Intel based an operating system such as Linux and a web server such as Apache 2.x. A representative application server machine comprises commodity hardware Linux and an application server such as WebLogic 9.2 or later . The database management system may be implemented as an Oracle or equivalent database management package running on Linux. A representative telephony server machine is an application server that implements appropriate software applications for call set up voice processing and other call connection and management activities. An application may implement the Media Resource Control Protocol MRCP . In the alternative a telephony server machine may execute an application server in conjunction with one or more PSTN VoIP and or voice processing cards that provide interconnectivity for telephone based calling applications. In a card based embodiment a representative card is a CG 6565 or variant series available from Dialogic or an equivalent. Typically a voice processing application port or card has a finite number of supported ports. In a high volume call environment there may be several web server machines several application server machines and a large number of telephony server machines. Although not shown in detail the infrastructure may include a name service FTP servers MRCP Media Resource Control Protocol servers load balancing appliances other switches and the like. Each machine typically comprises sufficient disk and memory as well as input and output devices. The software environment on each machine includes a Java virtual machine JVM if control programs are written in Java. Generally the web servers handle incoming business entity provisioning requests and they export a management interface that is described in more detail below. The application servers manage the basic functions of generating campaign scripts managing contacts and executing campaigns. The telephony servers handle most telephony related functions including without limitation executing outbound calls and forwarding calls to a contact center. The particular hardware and software implementation details described herein are merely for illustrative purposes are not meant to limit the scope of the present invention.

In a representative embodiment a typical machine in the service infrastructure is a processor based server running Linux and the server includes a telephone interface. A typical interface has up to 200 ports and each port may be considered a separate telephone line. There are typically a set of such servers operating at a given location e.g. an Internet data center . The following is a typical operation of the service. Using a Web browser or the Web service API a client provisions a campaign provisioning a script to be played to a target customer. The scope and content of the script will depend on the campaign. The client also provides the service provider with contact information for a set of persons who are the target recipients of the campaign. In operation the system batches a subset of those contacts to one of the machines in the server farm. A control routine executing on the machine takes a first contact in the subset and assigns the contact to an available port. The script is then initiated and the interface card initiates a call over a port. When the recipient s phone is answered the system determines whether a human being has answered the call as opposed to an answering machine a fax or the like . If a human being has answered the script plays a set of prompts basically a set of scripted questions . During the call if the target recipient takes a given action a direct connect DC function is initiated. In particular the system places the call on hold opens up a separate line to a contact center telephone number typically provisioned by the client waits for an agent to respond places the responding agent on hold and then bridges the customer to the agent. The system then disconnects. In an alternative the DC function may take place whether or not the recipient actively initiates it e.g. by just having the system inform the recipient to please hold while the connection to the contact center is established by the service provider.

The contact center may be owned operated or managed by a third party. In such a scenario the agents may be described as being un owned agents. The service provider may own operate or manage the agents directly. A representative call center includes automatic call distribution ACD functions. As is well known an ACD is a computer implemented and controlled telephone system that distributes calls to call center agents equitably and gathers statistics about the agents. When the service provider controls and or manages the agents directly sometimes referred to as owned agents as contrasted with un owned agents the provider infrastructure may include a dialer which is an automatic telephone dialing system. A dialer initiates outbound call from a list of telephone numbers turns a call over to an agent when a human being responds and gathers statistics about agents. Such ACD and dialer technologies are well known. Using the service provider infrastructure a business entity can create execute and manage a campaign. As noted above a campaign may have associated therewith one or more sub campaigns. Using a Web interface a client loads a list of contacts who will be called and associates that list with a script. A sub campaign refers to one or more passes through a contact list that has been bound to a script and that has been associated with a given timeframe. Thus a sub campaign associates at least the following items a list of contacts a script and a timeframe. Additional details regarding sub campaigns are set forth below. As noted above a script determines what will happen during a phone call. Typically a script is formatted as XML and specifies a sequence of audio prompts that are played and what happens when the recipient takes certain actions such as pressing a button on the phone or speaking a response. As noted above a direct connect to the contact center may be carried out automatically merely when the system determines that the call has been answered by other than an answering machine and thus the script may designate this functionality. One or more contact lists are stored in a contact database and typically a contact list comprises a set of contacts. A contact typically is an individual in the contact database and this individual is sometimes referred to as the customer as technically the individual is a customer of the client using the managed service . A contact can include home work or cell numbers a client identifier an email address or the like. Also contacts typically include first name last name company and other information. With reference to and as described above a business entity connects to the service provider authenticates and then uses one or more applications to create execute and manage the campaign. These applications execute on the application server machines and operate in association with one or more databases that are supported within the database management system. These applications include for example a contact management application a campaign management engine a scheduling engine and a scripting engine . The contact management application handles the receipt and storage of the contact list s uploaded e.g. via FTP or otherwise to the system by or on behalf of the business entity client. The scripting engine handles the creation and managing of the campaign scripts using instructions entered by or on behalf of the business entity client via a web based interface or Web services API. The campaign management engine manages the campaign by interoperating with the scheduling engine which in turn interoperates with the telephony servers to execute the campaign. The business entity client evaluates or monitors the campaign from summary detail and or custom reports generated by a reporting engine application . Campaign evaluation and monitoring may also be performed via a Web based user interface or in an automated manner via an API. Notification campaigns are executed using email servers and SMS or MMS servers or by other means such as by telephone.

As also illustrated in after connecting an outbound call to a target customer the customer may elect to be connected to the contact center typically a third party call center or the system may perform that direct connect automatically once it determines that a human being as opposed to an answering machine has answered the outbound call. The system typically obtains information about the contact center s performance during a given communications campaign commonly without requiring a direct connection between the infrastructure and a contact center s on premises ACD. This enables the managed service provider to integrate with both its business entity clients and with their associated contact center environments rapidly and efficiently. The interconnectivity between the managed service provider and the contact center may be inferred from how calls that originate from the service provider to the target recipients who have expressed an interest in being connected to the contact center are actually handled. This indirect connectivity is illustrated in by the control engine which can be provided in software as a set of software instructions executable on a processor. The engine is responsible for dispatching calls at an appropriate rate while ensuring that all customer requested rule parameters as described below are honored. Examples of such parameters include number of agents available at the call center maximum hold time at the call center client abandon rate prior to speaking to a call center number of bad numbers reached on the outbound dial and so forth. Generally for a given client campaign or sub campaign the engine decides on an initial call dispatch rate based on the client requested parameters and optionally on historical data from like campaigns or sub campaigns . Once the campaign or sub campaign as the case may be starts running the engine monitors the parameters and ensures that they remain within tolerance. If an identified parameter exceeds the client defined value then a system action rule e.g. adjusting the call dispatch rate suspending the calls or the like is applied and any client notification requested is issued. Additional details regarding the functionality of the engine are described in U.S. Publication No. 2007 0172050 which is commonly owned.

As noted above preferably a web based interface is provided to enable a business entity client to create a set of one or more management rules that when triggered during the campaign cause the infrastructure and in particular certain control applications therein to take certain control actions in real time preferably based on campaign performance.

As used herein the following terms have the associated meanings. A campaign refers to an overall series of calls to a contact list using one or more sub campaigns that use a given script. Campaigns also act as templates for the sub campaigns that are created under them. A campaign typically has a preset configuration that applies to all of its sub campaigns. As noted above a sub campaign refers to one or more passes through a contact list using a script and that is constrained to a particular timeframe or at a set of one or more such times . A sub campaign typically runs under an existing campaign. A script as noted above determines what happens during a phone call. Typically the script specifies a sequence of audio prompts that are played to a client an end user who receives a call and what happens the contact center connection when the recipient takes certain actions such as pressing a button on the phone or speaking an answer to a query . The script may also specify other actions such as effecting a contact center connection automatically when detecting that a human being has answered. The nature and type of actions set forth in a script thus may be quite varied and this disclosure is not limited to any particular process flow within a script.

An agent typically is a call center operator. A skill group is a set of agents that are trained to handle a given script. In one embodiment a skill group defines the number of agents who are scheduled to be on duty at various times of the day on various days of the week as well as the phone number to use to contact those agents. A skill group can be shared across multiple sub campaigns or over multiple physical facilities e.g. telephone numbers . A script may cause the routing of direct connect calls to different skill groups based on the path through the script. A client of the service may assign a skill group to a sub campaign when it creates the sub campaign whereupon the agents in that skill group are then responsible for handling any incoming calls for that sub campaign. Agents in a skill group become live according to a schedule or upon login to the service provider. Thus in one embodiment a live agent is an agent that has been registered with the service provider e.g. using a supervisor dashboard or a contact center schedule. An unallocated agent is an agent that is not yet allocated to a sub campaign. An allocated agent is an agent that is allocated to a sub campaign. A busy agent is an agent on the telephone with a client. An available agent is an agent waiting for a call. A break is a state when the agent is away from his or her station. The acronym ACW refers to after call work or agent processing which occurs after a particular customer call is completed and before the agent is connected to a new customer call.

In one embodiment agents in a skill group are automatically allocated to a particular sub campaign based on a priority of each running sub campaign. Thus for example sub campaigns with a higher priority are given as many agents as they can use before a lower priority sub campaign is considered. Sub campaigns of equal priority are allocated agents according to a number of agents that can be used or the number of callable contacts in a next time period e.g. 5 minutes . In the alternative such prioritization of sub campaigns need not enforced across agents in a skill group thereby enabling more equal access to the agents. The agents allocated to each sub campaign typically changes over time as the number of callable contacts changes which affects the number of agents that can be used by each sub campaign . Preferably the system adjusts calling rate for a sub campaign based on several factors the number of agents currently allocated to the sub campaign the percentage of call attempts that result in a direct connect attempt and an average length of a successful direct connect call. Typically a skill group is based on one or more business requirements. For example skill groups may be based on skill type language skills skill level or other such factors. When a new sub campaign is created a skill group is assigned to that sub campaign. The schedule for the skill group then determines the calling rate at any given time. As more agents come on duty typically the calling rate increases to keep those agents busy. When fewer agents are on duty however calling rate decreases to avoid long hold queues for the customers. As noted above a single skill group can be assigned to multiple sub campaigns at the same time. Calls from each sub campaign preferably are sent to any available agent in the skill group so a given agent should be trained to handle calls from each of the sub campaigns.

There may be different types of skill groups a standard skill group an enhanced shared mode skill group and an enhanced agent mode skill group. The standard skill group typically is a skill group to which a single phone number is assigned and that number is a default phone number when there is no other number defined in the script. A standard skill group typically does not use a service side hold queue as defined below. With a standard skill group agents always hang up after the client call has completed. Caller ID or in the alternative whisper is used to generate an agent screen pop up window with the correct client information because agents hang up between calls. With an enhanced shared mode skill group the agents typically conform to a pre defined schedule and the schedule automatically changes the number of agents throughout the day. In this configuration agents share one or more telephone numbers and a schedule may be created for each phone number alternatively multiple phone numbers can share a schedule . Agents in the enhanced shared mode skill group use a service side hold queue as described in more detail below and agents have the option to stay on line remain connected and to receive a next customer after the last customer hangs up as described in more detail below . If agents remain connected caller ID typically is not used for the screen pop up because caller ID cannot be changed after the first call the agent s phone has been placed. In the enhanced agent mode skill group mode contacts connect directly to a specific agent who has his or her own unique telephone number. Thus when this type of skill group is configured individual agents are added by name together with the associated telephone numbers. In this configuration each agent has a unique phone number or each agent may be set up with a different extension where one or more agents share the unique phone number. As with the standard and enhanced shared mode configurations agent mode skill groups use a pre defined schedule. Individual agents however can each have a custom schedule or can participate in a common schedule group. The service provider can track individual agent activity in this mode and agents use the hold queue and can stay on line as described above. In this mode caller ID is not used for an agent screen pop up window and agents who are not actively allocated to a running sub campaign are identified as unassigned.

By way of background illustrates the customer side and agent connection latencies that may occur when a customer is contacted by the system and at the customer s request or otherwise such as automatically then connected to an un owned agent. In this figure the left side illustrates the typical details of the call and the associated call latencies from the dialer to the customer and the right side illustrates the typical details of the separate call that is made by the service provider to the agent typically at the third party contact center . The two sides of the figure are aligned from a temporal perspective. Looking first at the left side the customer call starts with a dispatch . After a queue time for the call set up and connection the call reaches a live person namely the client at . After a prompt time the time needed to prompt the customer with a particular request as indicated by the script it is assumed that the customer takes a given action to request a direct connect DC to the agent. This is indicated at . In the alternative as noted above the customer may simply be put on hold while the direct connect is initiated without requiring the prompt response sequence. Thus step might involve a no action situation . At this point the customer has to wait for the connection to be established. This is represented by the hold time at . After a determination that an agent is ready at a connect occurs at at which point the customer is connected bridged to the agent. After the customer or the agent hangs up the customer call is disconnected at .

Meanwhile and as shown in the right hand side of the figure the system places a call to an agent. This is shown at . Until the agent call is answered a ring time period exists. When the call is connected at the ACD it enters an ACD hold time followed by a wait time not shown . A determination then is made that there is a real customer ready to be handed off to an available agent. At a whisper time which is optional occurs during which the agent is provided information about the client and the call. Thereafter at the connect occurs and this corresponds to the connect on the left side of the figure. Thus the customer is now bridged to the agent. After the corresponding direct connect time expires the agent call is disconnected at . After the hang up the agent performs his or her after call work ACW . The agent then returns to his or her available state.

According to a feature of the described subject matter it is desired to reduce the client side latency and to provide more efficient use of agents. In particular it is desired to provide a nearly immediate handoff of the customer to an available agent whenever possible such that customer connect time is significantly reduced and the agent has the information he or she needs at the outset to facilitate the client interaction. This reduces the number of customer abandons reduces agent idle time and provides a more efficient and cost effective solution for both the business entity client and the service provider itself.

To this end preferably a persistent connection maintained between the service provider system and a given agent. This function is sometimes referred to herein as stay on line because it obviates making a separate agent call each time it might be desired to establish a customer agent interaction. The persistent connection may be established in an on demand or just in time manner i.e. when an available agent is first needed to handle a direct connect or the service provider may pre provision or pre configure the agent in advance such as when an agent first indicates his or her availability. In either case once the agent is on line to the service provider the agent connection is maintained for so long as possible so that a new customer direct connect can be provided to that agent as soon as the agent completes ACW from a prior just completed call . Thus and in the context of when an agent stays on line in this manner time periods and call set up ring time and ACD hold time in an ACD hold queue are advantageously avoided for subsequent calls or if the system calls the agent before the first customer request then for all calls . With the stay on line operation the agent logs into the service provider system e.g. via a web browser based application or simply logs into the native contact center system itself and the service provider system then establishes or can establish as needed and maintains a persistent telephony connection to the agent. The agent provides his or her status to the service provider system or the native contact center system. Upon a direct connect request from a customer either the service provider or the contact center system provides a screen pop up or other notification to the agent and then connects the customer to the agent. The screen pop up described in more detail below obviates the whisper time shown in because the customer call information can be provided visually via the pop up display window . In an alternative the stay on line feature may be used without the screen pop up in which case a whisper may be used. Upon completion of the call including any necessary ACW the agent then indicates e.g. by selecting a button he or she is ready for the next call which corresponds to . As can be seen then with stay on line functionality there is no requirement that the system place a separate new call to the agent or wait for a connection or ACD hold time.

A particular agent typically as provisioned by skill group may stay on line never when busy or always. When stay on line never is selected as an option the system will hang up on the agent after a call is completed and then call the agent back as necessary. The stay on line when busy or when work available option means that the feature is enabled for the agent when there is work to do i.e. a non zero hold queue. The stay on line always options means that the feature is enabled for the agent at all times after the agent has logged into the service provider or the contact center ACD . The preferred option is stay on line always. The particular stay on line option can be set on an per agent basis on a per skill group basis or on some other basis.

According to another feature the service provider infrastructure on its side in contrast to the third party call center includes a hold queue. Physically the hold queue is a portion of a service provider database structure or in the alternative some allocated physical memory that is associated with a given sub campaign and that is used to hold direct connect s waiting to be bridged to available agent s at the contact center. This queue has been referred to above as the service side hold queue which is in contrast to the ACD hold queue. While a hold queue is typically associated with a sub campaign this is not a requirement as there may be a hold queue associated with a set or subset of agents having a given skill group. Because there are often multiple sub campaigns and or skill groups as the case may be there are multiple hold queues. In one embodiment the service side hold queue is associated with a particular skill group running on a particular sub campaign. A particular call on the customer side is placed in the service side hold queue and maintained there after the customer requests a direct connect in the event the service provider ascertains upon the DC that no agent is then available to receive the particular call. The hold queue ensures that in the event the customer abandons the persistent agent connection is not wasted. Another benefit of the hold queue is that an agent that stays on the line can then get the next customer from the hold queue itself. By combining the service side hold queue with the stay on line agent the system provides reduced customer connect to agent latency and ensures that agents are used more effectively.

The system preferably executes a program to provide an agent portal by which an administrator e.g. a supervisor can administer and manage agents. The portal typically includes an agent screen and a supervisor screen. A server component executes in the service provider system infrastructure and a client component executes in the agent s desktop preferably in a web browser. As noted above when the system is operating in the enhanced agent mode skill group configuration the status of the individual agents can be viewed. This view contains information such as the client contact with whom the agent is being connected. In this embodiment a web page can be used as a screen pop to pass information to the agent about the contact. Typically an agent operating in this mode has the following mutable attributes skill group telephone number sub campaign and state e.g. unallocated available busy ACW handoff break hold queue or unavailable . The agent also can be visualized from the perspective of his or her identity authentication information permissions and access rights. Preferably upon connection to the service provider or the appropriate contact center system the agent s screen is refreshed periodically e.g. once per second . The server client screen pop functionality may be implemented in any convenient manner using existing technologies such as Comet AJAX XMPP and the like. Comet is a WWW architecture in which a web server sends data to a client program normally a web browser asynchronously without any need for the client to explicitly request it. This allows for the creation of an event driven web application. XMPP refers to eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol f k a Jabber which is an open XML based protocol for near real time extensible instant messaging IM and presence information a k a buddy lists . XMPP is extensible and can support other features such as voice over IP VoIP and file transfer. In a representative embodiment an agent has a telephony connection and an associated machine e.g. a desktop computer a laptop computer or other mobile computing device or the like that comprises a web browser or other rendering engine that is compatible with AJAX technologies e.g. XHTML XML CSS DOM JSON and the like . AJAX technologies include XHTML Extensible HTML and CSS Cascading Style Sheets for marking up and styling information the use of DOM Document Object Model accessed with client side scripting languages the use of an XMLHttpRequest object an API used by a scripting language to transfer XML and other text data asynchronously to and from a server using HTTP and use of XML or JSON Javascript Object Notation a lightweight data interchange format as a format to transfer data between the server and the client.

In operation each agent is associated at the server with an agent object. Every agentPortal.heartBeatlnterval the agent s browser sends the server an AJAX style message to update the server this represents a heartbeat. Periodically e.g. once per minute all agents that are logged in to the server are evaluated to see if their respective heartbeats are older than an agentPortal.sessionTimeOutSecs e.g. one minute . If the heartbeat for a particular agent is older then a poller transitions the agent to lostConnection. If the heartbeat thereafter reactivates the system will automatically transition the agent to an available state. If an agent object has been in a lostConnection state for more than agentPortal.autoLogOutSecs e.g. 15 minutes the system will automatically log the agent out after an agentPortal.sessionTimeOutSecs e.g. one minute . Also after an agent has been on a break for more than agentPortal.maxBreakSeconds he she will automatically be logged out.

The following describes a typical life cycle for an un owned agent. Once an agent enters the live state he or she is typically unallocated. Once the agent is allocated to a specific sub campaign he or she enters an available state. The system then establishes and maintains the persistent telephony connection to the agent as previously described. Once a customer request occurs a client has requested a direct connect the agent enters various states such as busy. After the call is completed the agent enters or may enter the ACW state after which the agent transitions back to the available state where he or she can receive a next call.

As previously noted the hardware and software systems in which the subject matter herein is illustrated are merely representative. The described functionality may be practiced typically in software on one or more machines. Generalizing a machine typically comprises commodity hardware and software storage e.g. disks disk arrays and the like and memory RAM ROM and the like . The particular machines used in the network are not a limitation. A given machine includes network interfaces and software to connect the machine to a network in the usual manner. As illustrated in the subject disclosure may be implemented as a managed service e.g. in an ASP model using the illustrated set of machines which are connected or connectable to one or more networks. More generally the service is provided by an operator using a set of one or more computing related entities systems machines processes programs libraries functions or the like that together facilitate or provide the inventive functionality described above. In a typical implementation the service comprises a set of one or more computers. A representative machine is a network based server running commodity e.g. Pentium class hardware an operating system e.g. Linux Windows OS X or the like an application runtime environment e.g. Java .ASP and a set of applications or processes e.g. Java applets or servlets linkable libraries native code or the like depending on platform that provide the functionality of a given system or subsystem. As described the service may be implemented in a standalone server or across a distributed set of machines. Typically a server connects to the publicly routable Internet a corporate intranet a private network or any combination thereof depending on the desired implementation environment.
