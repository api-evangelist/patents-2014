title: System and method for securing authentication information in a networked environment
abstract: This disclosure is directed to systems and methods for securely communicating authentication information in a networked environment such as one involving a client device, a cloud based computing platform, and an enterprise computing environment. Some embodiments may include encrypting, by a client device using a public key, authentication information provided by a user. The encrypted authentication information is sent to a cloud based service which then sends it to an on-premises component residing behind a firewall of an enterprise. The on-premises component decrypts the authentication information using a private key, validates the authentication information, and returns the result to the cloud based service over a network. If validated, the cloud based service establishes a secure connection between the client device and the on-premises component such that the user can access the enterprise's content without the enterprise having to share the authentication information with the cloud based service.

This application is a conversion of and claims a benefit of priority from U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 842 831 filed Jul. 3 2013 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR SECURING AUTHENTICATION INFORMATION IN A NETWORKED ENVIRONMENT which is fully incorporated by reference herein for all purposes.

This disclosure relates generally to systems and methods for security in a networked environment. More particularly this disclosure relates to systems and methods for the management of authentication information. Even more particularly this disclosure relates to the management of authentication information in a shared software as a service SaaS environment including the management of authentication information such as passwords related to the use of third party applications such as SaaS applications.

SaaS refers to a software delivery model in which software is centrally hosted for instance in a cloud by software vendors or application service providers ASPs . In cloud computing a cloud refers to a computing platform implemented by a network of distributed servers or the like. Examples of a cloud based computing platform may include for example Microsoft Windows Azure Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud etc.

An individual user who has permission to access a server machine running on a cloud based computing platform can use the server s processing power to run an application store data or perform any other computing task. In a SaaS system a user may access such a centrally hosted application referred to as a SaaS application using a thin client via a web based browser application running on a computing device connected to a network such as the Internet a Local Area Network LAN a Wide Area Network WAN etc.

In some cases authentication may be needed to allow access to certain data using a SaaS application. For example a company may use a SaaS application hosted in a cloud to manage the company s data. To access the company s data a user e.g. an employee of the company may need to authenticate through the SaaS application. More specifically the user may provide the SaaS application with authentication information such as user credentials the SaaS application may receive the authentication information verify the authentication information and if verified establish an authenticated session for the user. However this approach may present issues for some entities that are unwilling to share or that cannot share such authentication information with other entities such as a software vendor or application service provider providing the SaaS application. No solutions currently exist that address these issues. Consequently there is room for innovations and improvements.

Embodiments disclosed herein provide systems methods and computer program products for securely communicating authentication information in a networked environment such as one having client devices cloud based computing platforms and enterprise computing environments. Some embodiments of a method may include encrypting by a client device using a public key authentication information provided by a user. The encrypted authentication information is sent to a cloud based service which in turn sends it to an on premises component residing behind a firewall of an enterprise. The on premises component decrypts the authentication information using a private key validates the authentication information and returns the result to the cloud based service over a network. If validated the cloud based service establishes a secure connection such that the user can access the enterprise s content behind the firewall via the cloud based service without the enterprise having to share the authentication information with the cloud based service.

One embodiment of the invention comprises a system having at least one processor and at least one non transitory computer readable storage medium that stores computer instructions translatable by a processor to perform a method substantially as described herein. Another embodiment comprises a computer program product having a non transitory computer readable storage medium that stores computer instructions translatable by a processor to perform a method substantially as described herein.

It should be understood however that the following description while indicating various embodiments of the disclosure and numerous specific details thereof is given by way of illustration and not of limitation. Many substitutions modifications additions and or rearrangements may be made within the scope of the disclosure without departing from the spirit thereof and the disclosure includes all such substitutions modifications additions and or rearrangements.

The invention and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the non limiting embodiments that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description. Descriptions of well known starting materials processing techniques components and equipment are omitted so as not to unnecessarily obscure the invention in detail. It should be understood however that the detailed description and the specific examples while indicating some embodiments of the invention are given by way of illustration only and not by way of limitation. Various substitutions modifications additions and or rearrangements within the spirit and or scope of the underlying inventive concept will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure.

Before delving into more detail regarding the specific embodiments disclosed herein some context may be helpful. Turning to one embodiment of a topology for the provisioning of content or functionality collectively referred to herein as content is depicted. Here enterprise service or storage in cloud and device communicate via network which may be for example the Internet an intranet a LAN a WAN an Internet Protocol IP based network etc. These communications may be accomplished according to one or more protocols such as for example Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP Representational State Transfer REST Simple Object Access Protocol SOAP etc. and in one or more formats such as for example Extensible Markup Language XML Hypertext Markup Language HTML JavaScript Object Notation JSON etc. The Internet LANs WANs IP networks HTTP REST SOAP XML HTML and JSON are known to those skilled in the art and thus are not further described herein.

Enterprise such as a business individual or almost any other type of organization or entity may provide functionality or content e.g. almost any type of functionality provided by application or data stored in data store including provisioning aggregation etc. . Application s or data store s may be on the physical premises controlled by enterprise . Alternatively such application s or data store s may be kept or maintained at another location under control of enterprise or provided by a third party provider under control of enterprise . As such the term on premises as used herein should not be taken only to mean at a certain physical location associated with an enterprise but should also be taken to mean verified or otherwise trusted by the enterprise or operators thereof.

In some cases it may be desired to allow access to content of enterprise e.g. functionality of application or data of data store by remote users or users outside of enterprise . To facilitate this type of access service and storage may be provided in cloud or at a location remote from enterprise or by an entity distinct from enterprise .

Service may provide via one or more applications hosted on one or more server machines operating in cloud one or more services which may be accessed by user s at device s to in turn allow access to content of enterprise e.g. enterprise data stored in cloud storage on premises storage or a third party repository etc. . More specifically in some embodiments service may include one or more interfaces which may be accessed by a user at device e.g. using a browser a proprietary application etc. . Using interface a user of device may be provided with the ability to request receive or otherwise interact with application and or access manage view or otherwise take action on data residing in data store . For example a request for content may be received by service in cloud from device via interface . Service may then communicate the request for content with application to obtain the desired content and return the requested content to device through interface .

In some embodiments service may be provided by a SaaS application running on a server machine in cloud communicatively connected to a computer running application in a computing environment of enterprise . Service may be provided by a SaaS provider. In some instances the SaaS provider may be an entity independent of and distinct from enterprise and or an operator of a cloud based computing platform supporting cloud .

In many cases enterprise may wish to keep its content secure. Accordingly enterprise may require a user to be authenticated before access to content or a subset thereof of application is allowed. For example enterprise may require that authentication information e.g. a username password credentials or other identification information be provided by a user and verified before the user is allowed to access content in association with application .

As a user at device is attempting to access content at enterprise using service deployed in cloud however this presents issues. Specifically there is a need to provide the authentication information to service and hence to the SaaS provider providing service and have this authentication information for the user verified before a user at the device is granted access to content at enterprise . Understandably enterprise may not wish to have such authentication information transmitted to service in cloud and then to enterprise when the authentication information is to be verified in order to establish an authenticated session or the like where the user at device may access desired content. Complicating these issues from a security and in some cases regulatory perspective in many instances the provider of service may be an entity distinct and independent from enterprise . Such a situation may serve to increase anxiety of enterprise about the transmission of authentication information. Moreover in some instances additional security may be required by regulatory or governing agencies .

Moving now to an example of architecture for the transmission and use of authentication information in conjunction with use of a content provider service is depicted. Here a user may enter their authentication information e.g. a username and password via a web application login form etc. presented on interface of a user s device. Interface may transmit this authentication information to service which is hosted remotely for instance in a cloud. While this transmission usually occurs over a secure channel such as HTTPS service receives the user s password in plain text. Additionally a direct connection e.g. using HTTPS or the like may be opened from service to on premises system e.g. application or data store from which content is being provided or server associated with the application or data store such as an Active Directory server which may be internal to the enterprise e.g. behind a firewall or otherwise trusted or secured . The authentication information can then be passed from service to on premises system for validation. If the authentication information is validated an authenticated session or the like may be established by service in which the user can access on premises system using service .

As can be seen this architecture may not protect the user s password as it must be transmitted in plain text. Another example of architecture for the use of authentication information in conjunction with use of a content provider service is depicted in . Here authentication information may be encrypted using encryption keys controlled by the content service provider who controls the encryption keys. In other words in these embodiments asymmetric encryption may be utilized such that a user provides authentication information using interface presented at the user s device.

In this example interface is configured with a public key provided by service . This authentication information may be encrypted by interface using the public key and the encrypted password transmitted to service . Service may then decrypt the authentication information using a corresponding private key which belongs to an operator of service . Additionally a direct connection e.g. using HTTPS or the like may be opened from service to on premises system . The authentication information can then be passed in plain text form from service to on premises system for validation. If the authentication information is validated an authenticated session or the like may be established for the user as discussed above.

While this embodiment may reduce who can decrypt the authentication information to an operator of service or others with access to the operator s private key it is often difficult for the enterprise that controls on premises system to know the scope of who has access to the private key because the enterprise may not be in control of the private key . Transparency about the scope of risk may be provided by third party auditors who may manually confirm who has access to encryption keys with periodic audits. However there is a risk with this process that security of the process may be compromised between audits. Furthermore the audits may only provide transparency about the scope of the risk and do not eliminate the risk of others compromising access to the authentication information and or to the private key.

What is particularly desired therefore is to provide management of authentication information in conjunction with use of a content provider service such as pass through authentication and password resets without requiring the plain text authentication information to be visible in components of the environment hosted in an environment external to the enterprise e.g. in the cloud at the user s device etc. . In particular it is desired that the plain text password not be stored or logged anywhere outside the enterprise e.g. outside of a firewall provided by the enterprise or outside locations not trusted or verified by the enterprise etc. thereby reducing the risk in leveraging a content provider service e.g. hosted in the cloud or at a third party provider etc. .

To that end attention is now directed to embodiments of the systems and methods presented herein which utilize an on premises e.g. with respect to an enterprise component that is associated with a cloud based service to ensure the security of authentication information. In particular embodiments may leverage asymmetric cryptography to encrypt authentication information before it leaves a user s system with the corresponding decryption key available only to the on premise component. This allows the encrypted authentication information e.g. cipher text to be transmitted through any number of intermediary systems without revealing the plain text of the authentication information. Once the authentication information reaches the on premises component it can be decrypted and any operations that utilize this authentication information e.g. validation of the authentication information establishing an authenticated session etc. performed.

One example of the use of such systems and methods is pass through authentication via which a user can authenticate using authentication information stored in an on premises component which employs Active Directory or the like. A browser based Rich Internet Application RIA or mobile application or other code on the user device is used to authenticate the user allowing the input e.g. authentication information to be modified e.g. encrypted on the user s device before submission to the content provider service or on premises data store or application. This is in contrast to a traditional forms based application that submits the data as entered to the on premises data store or application for validation.

In such embodiments a public key is made available to a client application e.g. JavaScript executing in conjunction with an interface loaded on a user s browser a proprietary application etc. running on a user s device. Before the authentication information is transmitted to a cloud based service for verification it is encrypted to produce the cipher text. This cipher text is passed through the cloud based service or other intermediary systems before being provided to the on premises component that has access to the corresponding private key and the ability to validate the authentication information. The on premises component which hides behind a firewall of an enterprise decrypts the authentication information validates it and sends the appropriate success or failure message to the cloud based service. The private key can also be used to sign the response allowing for verification of the response. If the authentication information is validated an authenticated session or the like may be established.

As can be seen then utilizing embodiments as disclosed herein an enterprise can deploy advanced authentication information management functionality without reducing the operational security of their computing environment as neither plain text authentication information nor authentication information encrypted with keys not controlled by the enterprise are transferred through intermediary servers. Additionally both authentication information and keys are protected by disallowing direct connections to the enterprise s internal infrastructure components containing sensitive information.

Referring now to one embodiment of a topology for the provisioning of content is depicted. Similar reference numerals are used to refer to similar items described in e.g. storage shown in may be similar to storage shown in and thus will not be explained further. Notice with respect to the example embodiment depicted in on premises component is associated with enterprise and application and data store .

It should be noted again that on premises component as discussed herein does not have to be physically associated with enterprise application data store etc. Such an on premises component may be at a different physical location or under the control of a different entity than enterprise as long as such an on premises component or module is verified or otherwise trusted by providers of enterprise and service to protect authentication information. As on premises component may be deployed behind the firewall of enterprise and may have network access to systems internal to the computing environment of enterprise it may have a higher level of trust than external systems e.g. even higher than the systems of service hosted in cloud .

In any event on premises component may be configured to decrypt encrypted authentication information received from service over network and verify such authentication information such that an authenticated session may be established and access granted to application or content of data store through service . As such on premises component may be configured to communicate with service e.g. provide one or more web services application programming interfaces APIs etc. which may be accessed by content provider service etc. with its own private key. When a user enters their authentication information using interface at their device the authentication information may be encrypted at the user s device e.g. by JavaScript associated loaded or otherwise accessed in conjunction with interface using a public key corresponding to the private key of on premises component .

This encrypted authentication information is then sent from device to service in cloud where it is then transmitted still in encrypted form to on premises component along with an authentication request. On premises component may receive this authentication request with the encrypted authentication information decrypt the authentication information using its private key validate the authentication information and allow access to application or content of data store via service in association with that user so that service may provide content from application or data store to that user. Additionally this same key pair private public key pair can be used to sign the response to the authentication request sent by on premises component to service such that service can verify on premises component was the entity that validated the authentication information.

One embodiment of an architecture for the use of authentication information in conjunction with use of a content provider service is depicted in . Here on premises component is deployed behind an enterprise s firewall and has network access to the enterprise s internal systems. As on premises component is deployed into the enterprise s internal environment it has a higher level of trust than external systems outside of the enterprise s control.

In this example an asymmetric key pair has been created and provisioned such that on premises component has the private key and service has the public key. This allows service to encrypt data using this public key and only on premises component can decrypt the encrypted data using its private key.

This key pair may therefore be leveraged when storing or transmitting sensitive data such as authentication information. The use of such a key pair may be illustrated using a pass through authentication scenario once again. Here a user is once again presented with a login form though interface running on the user s device. However in this case interface also contains code executing on the user s device e.g. client side code such as JavaScript or the like from service or an operator of service that allows interface to manipulate the data before it is sent to service . This code executing on the user s device has access to the aforementioned public key step and when the user submits the authentication information e.g. a username and password interface encrypts the authentication information with this public key before sending it to service step .

The encrypted authentication information is transmitted from service to on premises component step . This could either be a direct connection between service and on premises component or another transmission mechanism. Once on premises component receives the encrypted authentication information it decrypts it using its private key. This provides on premises component with access to the original authentication information entered by the user. On premises component then validates the now decrypted authentication information against on premises system e.g. a data store or application and returns the result to service step .

While the above example and text describes a pass through authentication scenario similar embodiments may be equally effectively applied to other operations that utilize authentication information to access an application data store etc. depicts one such example. In such an example consider a provisioning operation where new data needs to be written into the on premises data store. The authentication information required to do this by definition have a high level of access and should be protected. Using embodiments as depicted the authentication information can be encrypted by interface at a user s device before it is sent to service for instance for storage. When a data store or application needs to be accessed the requested operation and the encrypted authentication information can be sent to on premises component that can decrypt the authentication information and perform the requested operation. In some embodiments in order to perform such a requested operation on premises component may utilize the decrypted authentication information or encrypted in some other way to access a third party service which may be provided by an entity or operator that is not controlled or provided by the enterprise or the provider or operator of service such as third party SaaS. Thus embodiments may apply equally well to provisioning of content accessed through the enterprise at third party sites.
