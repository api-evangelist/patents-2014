The Renal Outer Medullary Potassium ROMK channel Kir1.1 see e.g. Ho K. et al. Nature 1993 362 6415 p. 31 8.1 2 and Shuck M. E. et al. J Biol Chem 1994 269 39 p. 24261 70 is a member of the inward rectifier family of potassium channels expressed in two regions of the kidney thick ascending loop of Henle TALH and cortical collecting duct CCD see Hebert S. C. et al. Physiol Rev 2005 85 1 p. 319 713 . At the TALH ROMK participates in potassium recycling across the luminal membrane which is critical for the function of the Na K 2Clco transporter the rate determining step for salt reuptake in this part of the nephron. At the CCD ROMK provides a pathway for potassium secretion that is tightly coupled to sodium uptake through the amiloride sensitive sodium channel see Reinalter S. C. et al. Acta Physiol Scand 2004 181 4 p. 513 21 and Wang W. Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens 2004 13 5 p. 549 55 . Selective inhibitors of the ROMK channel also referred to herein as inhibitors of ROMK or ROMK inhibitors are expected to represent novel diuretics for the treatment of hypertension and other conditions where treatment with a diuretic would be beneficial with potentially reduced liabilities i.e. hypo or hyperkalemia new onset of diabetes dyslipidemia over the currently used clinical agents see Lifton R. P. A. G. Gharavi and D. S. Geller Cell 2001 104 4 p. 545 56 . Human genetics Ji W. et al. Nat Genet 2008 40 5 p. 592 9 and Tobin M. D. et al. Hypertension 2008 51 6 p. 1658 64 and genetic ablation of ROMK in rodents see Lorenz J. N. et al. J Biol Chem 2002 277 40 p. 37871 80 and Lu M. et al. J Biol Chem 2002 277 40 p. 37881 7 support these expectations. To our knowledge the first publicly disclosed small molecule selective inhibitors of ROMK including VU590 were reported from work done at Vanderbilt University as described in Lewis L. M. et al. 7.1 Mol Pharmacol 2009 76 5 p. 1094 1103. The compound VU591 was later reported in Bhave G. et al. 1.1 Mol Pharmacol 2011 79 1 p. 42 50 the text of which states that ROMK Kir1.1 is a putative drug target for a novel class of loop diuretics that would lower blood pressure without causing hypokalemia.

All structural Formulas and embodiments thereof described herein include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds defined therein.

As used herein except if noted otherwise alkyl is intended to include both branched and straight chain saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups having the specified number of carbon atoms. Commonly used abbreviations for alkyl groups are used throughout the specification. For example the term Calkyl or C Calkyl means linear or branched chain alkyl groups including all isomers having the specified number of carbon atoms and includes all of the hexyl and pentyl isomers as well as n iso sec and tert butyl butyl s butyl i butyl t butyl Bu butyl n and i propyl Pr propyl ethyl Et and methyl Me . Cycloalkyl is a cyclized alkyl ring having the indicated number of carbon atoms. Examples of cycloalkyl include cyclopropyl cyclobutyl cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl.

As is well known in the art the term double bond refers to a covalent bond where two pairs of electrons are shared between two atoms. The concept of aromaticity is likewise well known in the art as exemplified by benzene and phenyl which are commonly drawn as having 3 alternating double bonds but may also be considered as having carbon carbon bonds which are each a hybrid of a single bond and a double bond. As used herein an aromatic bond refers to the aromatic nature of the double bond between C R and C R when Rand Rare joined together to form a phenyl ring fused to the pyrrolidinyl ring as defined in Formulas I III and V.

Unless expressly depicted or described otherwise variables depicted in a structural formula with a floating bond such as R are permitted on any available carbon atom in the ring to which the variable is attached.

The compounds of Formula I may have one or more chiral asymmetric centers. The present invention encompasses all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of Formula I. Centers of asymmetry that are present in the compounds of Formula I can all independently of one another have R or S configuration. When bonds to a chiral carbon are depicted as straight lines in the structural Formulas of the invention or when a compound name is recited without an R or S chiral designation for a chiral carbon it is understood that both the R and S configurations of each such chiral carbon and hence each enantiomer or diastereomer and mixtures thereof are embraced within the Formula or by the name. The production of specific stereoisomers or mixtures thereof may be identified in the Examples where such stereoisomers or mixtures were obtained but this in no way limits the inclusion of all stereoisomers and mixtures thereof from being within the scope of this invention.

The invention includes all possible enantiomers and diastereomers and mixtures of two or more stereoisomers for example mixtures of enantiomers and or diastereomers in all ratios. Thus enantiomers are a subject of the invention in enantiomerically pure form both as levorotatory and as dextrorotatory antipodes in the form of racemates and in the form of mixtures of the two enantiomers in all ratios. In the case of a cistrans isomerism the invention includes both the cis form and the trans form as well as mixtures of these forms in all ratios. The preparation of individual stereoisomers can be carried out if desired by separation of a mixture by customary methods for example by chromatography or crystallization by the use of stereochemically uniform starting materials for the synthesis or by stereoselective synthesis. Optionally a derivatization can be carried out before a separation of stereoisomers. The separation of a mixture of stereoisomers can be carried out at an intermediate step during the synthesis of a compound of Formula I or it can be done on a final racemic product. Absolute stereochemistry may be determined by X ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates which are derivatized if necessary with a reagent containing a stereogenic center of known configuration. Alternatively absolute stereochemistry may be determined by Vibrational Circular Dichroism VCD spectroscopy analysis. Where compounds of this invention are capable of tautomerization all individual tautomers as well as mixtures thereof are included in the scope of this invention. The present invention includes all such isomers as well as salts solvates which includes hydrates and solvated salts of such racemates enantiomers diastereomers and tautomers and mixtures thereof.

Reference to the compounds of Formula I herein encompasses the compounds of Formulas I II III IV and V and all embodiments thereof. Reference to the compounds of this invention as those of a specific formula or embodiment e.g. Formula I II III IV or V or embodiments thereof or any other generic structural formula or specific compound described or claimed herein is intended to encompass the specific compound or compounds falling within the scope of the Formula or embodiment including salts thereof particularly pharmaceutically acceptable salts solvates including hydrates of such compounds and solvated salt forms thereof where such forms are possible unless specified otherwise.

In the compounds of Formula I the atoms may exhibit their natural isotopic abundances or one or more of the atoms may be artificially enriched in a particular isotope having the same atomic number but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number predominantly found in nature. The present invention is meant to include all suitable isotopic variations of the compounds of Formula I. For example different isotopic forms of hydrogen H include protium H and deuterium H . Protium is the predominant hydrogen isotope found in nature. Enriching for deuterium may afford certain therapeutic advantages such as increasing in vivo half life or reducing dosage requirements or may provide a compound useful as a standard for characterization of biological samples. Isotopically enriched compounds within Formula I can be prepared without undue experimentation by conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the Schemes and Examples herein using appropriate isotopically enriched reagents and or intermediates.

When the compounds of Formula I contain one or more acidic or basic groups the invention also includes the corresponding pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Thus the compounds of Formula I which contain acidic groups can be used according to the invention as for example but not limited to alkali metal salts alkaline earth metal salts or as ammonium salts. Examples of such salts include but are not limited to sodium salts potassium salts calcium salts magnesium salts or salts with ammonia or organic amines such as for example ethylamine ethanolamine triethanolamine or amino acids. Compounds of Formula I which contain one or more basic groups i.e. groups which can be protonated can be used according to the invention in the form of their acid addition salts with inorganic or organic acids as for example but not limited to salts with hydrogen chloride hydrogen bromide phosphoric acid sulfuric acid nitric acid benzenesulfonic acid methanesulfonic acid p toluenesulfonic acid naphthalenedisulfonic acids oxalic acid acetic acid trifluoroacetic acid tartaric acid lactic acid salicylic acid benzoic acid formic acid propionic acid pivalic acid diethylacetic acid malonic acid succinic acid pimelic acid fumaric acid maleic acid malic acid sulfaminic acid phenylpropionic acid gluconic acid ascorbic acid isonicotinic acid citric acid adipic acid etc. If the compounds of Formula I simultaneously contain acidic and basic groups in the molecule the invention also includes in addition to the salt forms mentioned inner salts or betaines zwitterions . Salts can be obtained from the compounds of Formula I by customary methods which are known to the person skilled in the art for example by combination with an organic or inorganic acid or base in a solvent or dispersant or by anion exchange or cation exchange from other salts. The present invention also includes all salts of the compounds of Formula I which owing to low physiological compatibility are not directly suitable for use in pharmaceuticals but which can be used for example as intermediates for chemical reactions or for the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts.

Furthermore compounds of the present invention may exist in amorphous form and or one or more crystalline forms and as such all amorphous and crystalline forms and mixtures thereof of the compounds of Formula I are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention. In addition some of the compounds of the instant invention may form solvates with water i.e. a hydrate or common organic solvents. Such solvates and hydrates particularly the pharmaceutically acceptable solvates and hydrates of the instant compounds are likewise encompassed within the scope of this invention along with un solvated and anhydrous forms.

Any pharmaceutically acceptable pro drug modification of a compound of this invention which results in conversion in vivo to a compound within the scope of this invention is also within the scope of this invention. For example esters can optionally be made by esterification of an available carboxylic acid group or by formation of an ester on an available hydroxy group in a compound. Similarly labile amides can be made. Pharmaceutically acceptable esters or amides of the compounds of this invention may be prepared to act as pro drugs which can be hydrolyzed back to an acid or COO depending on the pH of the fluid or tissue where conversion takes place or hydroxy form particularly in vivo and as such are encompassed within the scope of this invention. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable pro drug modifications include but are not limited to Calkyl esters and Calkyl substituted with phenyl esters.

Accordingly the compounds within the generic structural formulas embodiments and specific compounds described and claimed herein encompass salts all possible stereoisomers and tautomers physical forms e.g. amorphous and crystalline forms solvate and hydrate forms thereof and any combination of these forms as well as the salts thereof pro drug forms thereof and salts of pro drug forms thereof where such forms are possible unless specified otherwise.

The compounds of Formula I according to the invention are inhibitors of ROMK and therefore could be used as diuretic and or natriuretic agents. ROMK inhibitors may be used to help to increase urination and increase urine volume and also to prevent or reduce reabsorption of sodium in the kidneys leading to increased excretion of sodium and water. Therefore the compounds could be used for treatment or prophylaxis or both of disorders that benefit from increased excretion of water and sodium from the body. Accordingly the compounds of this invention could be used in a method for inhibiting ROMK comprising administering a compound of Formula I in a ROMK inhibitory effective amount to a patient in need thereof. This also encompasses the use of the compounds for inhibiting ROMK in a patient comprising administering a compound of claim in a therapeutically effective amount to a patient in need of diueresis natriuresis or both. The inhibition of ROMK by the compounds of Formula I can be examined for example in the Thallium Flux Assay and or Electrophysiology Assay described below. Moreover this invention also relates to the use of the compounds of Formula I or salts thereof to validate in vitro assays for example but not limited to the Thallium Flux and Electrophysiology Assays described herein.

The compounds of this invention could be used in a method for causing diuresis natriuresis or both comprising administering a compound of Formula I in a therapeutically effective amount to a patient in need thereof. Therefore the compounds of Formula I of this invention could be used in methods for treatment of prevention of or reduction of risk for developing medical conditions that benefit from increased excretion of water and sodium such as but not limited to one or more of hypertension such as essential hypertension also known as primary or idiopathic hypertension which is a form of hypertension for which no cause can be found heart failure which includes both acute heart failure and chronic heart failure the latter also known as congestive heart failure and or other conditions associated with excessive salt and water retention. The compounds could also be used to treat hypertension which is associated with any of several primary diseases such as renal pulmonary endocrine and vascular diseases including treatment of patients with medical conditions such as heart failure and or chronic kidney disease. Furthermore the compounds of Formula I could be used in methods for treatment of prevention of or reduction of risk for developing one or more disorders such as pulmonary hypertension particularly pulmonary arterial hypertension PAH cardiovascular disease edematous states diabetes mellitus diabetes insipidus post operative volume overload endothelial dysfunction diastolic dysfunction systolic dysfunction stable and unstable angina pectoris thromboses restenosis myocardial infarction stroke cardiac insufficiency pulmonary hypertonia atherosclerosis hepatic cirrhosis ascitis pre eclampsia cerebral edema nephropathy glomerulonephritis nephrotic syndrome acute kidney insufficiency chronic kidney insufficiency also referred to as chronic kidney disease or more generally as renal impairment acute tubular necrosis hypercalcemia idiopathic edema Dent s disease Meniere s disease glaucoma benign intracranial hypertension and other conditions for which a diuretic or natriuretic or both would have therapeutic or prophylactic benefit. The compounds of the invention may be administered to a patient having or at risk of having one or more conditions for which a diuretic or natriuretic or both would have therapeutic or prophylactic benefit such as those described herein.

The compounds of Formula I may potentially have reduced liabilities for example hypo or hyperkalemia new onset of diabetes dyslipidemia etc. over currently used clinical agents. Also the compounds may have reduced risk for diuretic tolerance which can be a problem with long term use of loop diuretics.

In general compounds that are ROMK inhibitors can be identified as those compounds which when tested have an ICof 5 M or less preferably 1 M or less and more preferably 0.25 M or less in at least one of the following assays 1 Thallium Flux Assay 2 Electrophysiology Assay. These assays are described in more detail further below.

The dosage amount of the compound to be administered depends on the individual case and is as is customary to be adapted to the individual circumstances to achieve an optimum effect. Thus it depends on the nature and the severity of the disorder to be treated and also on the sex age weight and individual responsiveness of the human or animal to be treated on the efficacy and duration of action of the compounds used on whether the therapy is acute or chronic or prophylactic or on whether other active compounds are administered in addition to compounds of Formula I. A consideration of these factors is well within the purview of the ordinarily skilled clinician for the purpose of determining the therapeutically effective or prophylactically effective dosage amount needed to prevent counter or arrest the progress of the condition. It is expected that the compound will be administered chronically on a daily basis for a length of time appropriate to treat or prevent the medical condition relevant to the patient including a course of therapy lasting days months years or the life of the patient.

In general a daily dose of approximately 0.001 to 100 mg kg preferably 0.001 to 30 mg kg in particular 0.001 to 10 mg kg in each case mg per kg of bodyweight is appropriate for administration to an adult weighing approximately 75 kg in order to obtain the desired results. The daily dose is preferably administered in a single dose or can be divided into several for example two three or four individual doses and may be for example but not limited to 0.1 mg 0.25 mg 0.5 mg 0.75 mg 1 mg 1.25 mg 2 mg 2.5 mg 5 mg 10 mg 20 mg 40 mg 50 mg 75 mg 100 mg 125 mg 150 mg 175 mg 200 mg etc. on a daily basis. In some cases depending on the potency of the compound or the individual response it may be necessary to deviate upwards or downwards from the given daily dose. Furthermore the compound may be formulated for immediate or modified release such as extended or controlled release.

The term patient includes animals preferably mammals and especially humans who use the instant active agents for the prophylaxis or treatment of a medical condition. Administering of the drug to the patient includes both self administration and administration to the patient by another person. The patient may be in need of treatment for an existing disease or medical condition or may desire prophylactic treatment to prevent or reduce the risk for developing said disease or medical condition or developing long term complications from a disease or medical condition.

The term therapeutically effective amount is intended to mean that amount of a drug or pharmaceutical agent that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue a system animal or human that is being sought by a researcher veterinarian medical doctor or other clinician. A prophylactically effective amount is intended to mean that amount of a pharmaceutical drug that will prevent or reduce the risk of occurrence of the biological or medical event that is sought to be prevented in a tissue a system animal or human by a researcher veterinarian medical doctor or other clinician. The terms preventing prevention prophylactic and derivatives of these terms as used herein refer to administering a compound to a patient before the onset of clinical symptoms of a condition not yet present in the patient. It is understood that a specific daily dosage amount can simultaneously be both a therapeutically effective amount e.g. for treatment of hypertension and a prophylactically effective amount e.g. for prevention or reduction of risk of myocardial infarction or prevention or reduction of risk for complications related to hypertension.

In the methods of treatment of this invention the ROMK inhibitors may be administered via any suitable route of administration such as for example orally parenterally or rectally in dosage unit formulations containing conventional non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers adjuvants and vehicles. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections intravenous IV intramuscular intrasternal injection or infusion techniques. Oral formulations are preferred for treatment of chronic indications such as hypertension or chronic heart failure particularly solid oral dosage units such as pills tablets or capsules and more particularly tablets. IV dosing is preferred for acute treatment for example for the treatment of acute heart failure.

This invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprised of a compound of Formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which is comprised of one or more excipients or additives. An excipient or additive is an inert substance used to formulate the active drug ingredient. For oral use the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention containing the active ingredient may be in forms such as pills tablets troches lozenges aqueous or oily suspensions dispersible powders or granules emulsions hard or soft capsules or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. The excipients may be for example inert diluents such as calcium carbonate sodium carbonate lactose mannitol calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate granulating and disintegrating agents for example corn starch or alginic acid binding agents for example starch gelatin or acacia and lubricating agents for example magnesium stearate stearic acid or talc.

Pharmaceutical compositions may also contain other customary additives for example but not limited to wetting agents stabilizers emulsifiers dispersants preservatives sweeteners colorants flavorings aromatizers thickeners buffer substances solvents solubilizers agents for achieving a depot effect salts for altering the osmotic pressure coating agents or antioxidants. Oral immediate release and time controlled release dosage forms may be employed as well as enterically coated oral dosage forms. Tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques for aesthetic purposes to mask taste or for other reasons. Coatings can also be used to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed.

Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent for example calcium carbonate calcium phosphate or kaolin or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredients is mixed with water or miscible solvents such as propylene glycol PEGs and ethanol or an oil medium for example peanut oil liquid paraffin or olive oil.

Aqueous suspensions contain the active material in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil for example arachis oil olive oil sesame oil or coconut oil or in mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent for example beeswax hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti oxidant such as ascorbic acid. Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents for example glycerol propylene glycol sorbitol or sucrose.

The instant invention also encompasses a process for preparing a pharmaceutical composition comprising combining a compound of Formula I with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Also encompassed is the pharmaceutical composition which is made by combining a compound of Formula I with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Furthermore a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of this invention can be used for the preparation of a medicament useful for inhibiting ROMK for causing diuresis and or natriuresis and or for treating preventing or reducing the risk for any of the medical conditions described herein in dosage amounts described herein.

The amount of active compound of Formula I and or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts in the pharmaceutical composition may be for example but not limited to from about 0.1 mg to 1 g particularly 0.1 mg to about 200 mg more particularly from about 0.1 mg to about 100 mg and even more particularly from about 0.1 to about 50 mg per dose on a free acid free base weight basis but depending on the type of the pharmaceutical composition potency of the active ingredient and or the medical condition being treated it could also be lower or higher. Pharmaceutical compositions usually comprise about 0.5 to about 90 percent by weight of the active compound on a free acid free base weight basis.

The compounds of Formula I inhibit ROMK. Due to this property apart from use as pharmaceutically active compounds in human medicine and veterinary medicine they can also be employed as a scientific tool or as aid for biochemical investigations in which such an effect on ROMK is intended and also for diagnostic purposes for example in the in vitro diagnosis of cell samples or tissue samples. The compounds of Formula I can also be employed as intermediates for the preparation of other pharmaceutically active compounds.

One or more additional pharmacologically active agents may be administered in combination with a compound of Formula I. The additional active agent or agents is intended to mean a medicinal compound that is different from the compound of Formula I and which is a pharmaceutically active agent or agents that is active in the body including pro drugs for example esterified forms that convert to pharmaceutically active form after administration and also includes free acid free base and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said additional active agents when such forms are sold commercially or are otherwise chemically possible. Generally any suitable additional active agent or agents including but not limited to anti hypertensive agents additional diuretics anti atherosclerotic agents such as a lipid modifying compound anti diabetic agents and or anti obesity agents may be used in any combination with the compound of Formula I in a single dosage formulation a fixed dose drug combination or may be administered to the patient in one or more separate dosage formulations which allows for concurrent or sequential administration of the active agents co administration of the separate active agents . Examples of the one or more additional active agents which may be employed include but are not limited to thiazide like diuretics e.g. hydrochlorothiazide HCTZ or HCT angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors e.g alacepril benazepril captopril ceronapril cilazapril delapril enalapril enalaprilat fosinopril imidapril lisinopril moveltipril perindopril quinapril ramipril spirapril temocapril or trandolapril dual inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme ACE and neutral endopeptidase NEP such as omapatrilat sampatrilat and fasidotril angiotensin II receptor antagonists also known as angiotensin receptor blockers or ARBs which may be in free base free acid salt or pro drug form such as azilsartan e.g. azilsartan medoxomil potassium EDARBI candesartan e.g. candesartan cilexetil ATACAND eprosartan e.g. eprosartan mesylate TEVETAN irbesartan AVAPRO losartan e.g. losartan potassium COZAAR olmesartan e.g olmesartan medoximil BENICAR telmisartan MICARDIS valsartan DIOVAN and any of these drugs used in combination with a thiazide like diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide e.g. HYZAAR DIOVAN HCT ATACAND HCT etc. potassium sparing diuretics such as amiloride HCl spironolactone epleranone triamterene each with or without HCTZ carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as acetazolamide neutral endopeptidase inhibitors e.g. thiorphan and phosphoramidon aldosterone antagonists aldosterone synthase inhibitors renin inhibitors e.g. urea derivatives of di and tri peptides See U.S. Pat.

Trademark names of pharmaceutical drugs noted above are provided for exemplification of the marketed form of the active agent s such pharmaceutical drugs could be used in a separate dosage form for concurrent or sequential administration with a compound of Formula I or the active agent s therein could be used in a fixed dose drug combination including a compound of Formula I.

Several methods for preparing the compounds of this invention are described in the following Schemes and Examples. Starting materials and intermediates are purchased made from known procedures or as otherwise illustrated. Some frequently applied routes to the compounds of Formula I are also described by the Schemes as follows. In some cases the order of carrying out the steps of reaction schemes may be varied to facilitate the reaction or to avoid unwanted reaction products. The R substituents in the Schemes correspond to the substituents defined in Formula I at the same positions on the structures.

Compound IA which is substituted at the benzylic position with an OH group can be prepared following the sequence detailed in Scheme 1. Coupling of epoxide 1 to spirocyclic amines 2 at elevated temperatures leads to the formation of alcohols IA Nomura Y. et al. Chemical Pharmaceutical Bulletin 1995 43 2 241 6 . The reaction can be carried out with conventional heating or by heating using a microwave apparatus. A number of solvents can be used in this reaction for example ethanol and 2 propanol. Spirocyclic amines may be free bases or they may be salts in which case a base such as triethylamine or N N diisopropylethylamine may be added. Note that when enantiopure chiral epoxides are employed such as R 1 in Scheme 1 epoxide opening occurs with retention of stereochemistry in the benzylic position and individual isomer R IA may be obtained and if the S epoxide is employed the alcohol produced will have the opposite stereochemistry to that shown . Alternatively chiral HPLC separation of enantiomers or diastereomers of IA may be performed to provide single enantiomers or diastereomers.

Compounds of formula IB can be prepared by the sequence detailed in Scheme 2. Aldhehydes or ketones 3 may be used in reductive alkylation reactions of spirocyclic amines 2 to afford ROMK inhibitors of the formula IB by using various reductive amination conditions for example using sodium cyanoborohydride sodium triacetoxy borohydride or titanium tetra isopropoxide followed by sodium borohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride .

The epoxides 1 and single enantiomers R 1 and S 1 can be prepared following the method detailed in Scheme 3. Treatment of 4 where X is chloride bromide iodide or trifluoromethane sulfonate with commercially available potassium vinyl trifluoroborate Molander G. Luciana A. Journal of Organic Chemistry 2005 70 10 3950 3956 under palladium catalyzed coupling conditions with an appropriate phosphine ligand gives rise to styrene 5 Molander G. Brown A. Journal of Organic Chemistry 2006 71 26 9681 9686 . Alternatively other methods may be employed for example using vinylstannane reagents and palladium catalysis. The resulting styrenes 5 can be converted to the corresponding epoxides 1 under various epoxidation conditions for example with mCPBA Fringuelli F. et al. Organic Preparations and Procedures International 1989 21 6 757 761 . The racemic epoxide 1 can be resolved under chiral HPLC chromatography conditions to afford its enantiomers which can be used in place of 1 according to Scheme 1.

Alternatively enantiopure epoxides R 1 or S 1 can be prepared as shown in Scheme 4. Treatment of 4 where X is bromide iodide or trifluoromethane sulfonate with commercial available vinyl butylether 6 under palladium catalyzed conditions with a suitable ligand for example Pd OAc DPPP can provide the enol ethers 7. Enol ethers may be prepared using other methods known to the chemist. Treatment of the resulting enol ethers 7 with NBS or other similar reagents affords the corresponding bromomethyl ketones 8. These can be subjected to a variety of asymmetric ketone reduction conditions for example with an enzyme that can affect such a transformation with high enantioselectivity. Subsequent treatment with a base such as triethylamine leads to cyclization affording the enantioenriched epoxides R 1 or S 1 depending upon the asymmetric reducing agent .

Aldehydes 3A may be prepared in numerous ways with two approaches described in Scheme 5. Treatment of 4 where X is bromide iodide or trifluoromethane sulfonate with bromo 1 3 dioxolan 2 ylmethyl zinc in the presence of an appropriate palladium catalyst and ligand such as palladium II acetate and tri t butylphosphine BFcomplex provides the corresponding aryl 1 3 dioxolan 2 ylmethyl derivative 9. Then the aldehydes 3A may be obtained by treatment with HCl in the presence of water and an organic solvent. Alternatively reaction of 4 where X is bromide iodide or trifluoromethane sulfonate with allyltributylstannane in the presence of palladium catalyst affords the allyl product 10. Oxidation for example with ozone followed by dimethyl sulfide provides aldehydes 3A.

Spirocyclic aminofuranones 2 can be prepared as described in Scheme 6. Spirocyclic diamines or amino lactams where Rand Rtogether represent a carbonyl group 11 protected as appropriate Greene T. Wuts P. G. M. John Wiley and Sons Inc. New York N.Y. 1991 can be coupled to furanone triflates or bromides 12 using a palladium catalyst and ligand for example palladium acetate and 4 5 Bis diphenylphosphino 9 9 dimethylxanthene. Some spirocyclic diamines or amino lactams 11 described herein are commercially available others can prepared as described in the experimental section below. 4 Bromofuran 2 5H one is commercially available other furanones 12 can be prepared as described in the examples below. Intermediates 13 are converted to spirocyclic aminofuranones 2 by removal of the protective group for example tert butoxycarbonyl can be removed with TFA or HCl.

Spirocyclic amino lactams 11A can be prepared in numerous ways including those described in Scheme 7. Commercially available aminoesters 14 can be alkylated with bromoacetonitrile 15 using a base such as lithium diisopropylamide to afford nitrile intermediates 16. Reduction for example using platinum oxide and hydrogen or Raney Nickel produces lactams 11A. Alternatively aminoesters may be alkylated with allyl halides 17 using a base such as lithium diisopropylamide to furnish allyl intermediates 18. Oxidative cleavage employing for example osmium tetroxide and sodium periodate provides ketones and aldehydes 19. Reductive amination with tandem lactam cyclization to 11A can be accomplished in several ways including by treatment with ammonium acetate and sodium cyanoborohydride in a solvent such as methanol as shown.

The spontaneously hypertensive rat SHR exhibits age dependent hypertension that does not require administration of exogenous agents to elevate blood pressure nor does it require the use of a high salt diet to elevate blood pressure. Thus it resembles human essential hypertension and provides an opportunity to assess the dose dependence of novel agents for their ability to lower blood pressure.

Experimental protocols for evaluating blood pressure lowering efficacy of compounds of the present invention in spontaneuously hypertensive rats SHR 

Spontaneously hypertensive rats SHR male 6 months Charles River were implanted with DSI TA11PA C40 telemetry device Data Sciences Inc. St. Paul Minn. under isoflurane or ketamine metomidine anesthesia. The telemetry unit catheter was inserted into the descending aorta via the femoral artery and the telemetry device was implanted subcutaneously in the left flank area. Animals were allowed to recover from surgery for 14 days before the start of any studies. Blood pressure heart rate and activity signals from conscious freely moving rats were recorded continuously for 30 seconds every 10 minutes. HCTZ 25 mg kg day PO was included as a reference diuretic at a dose giving approximately maximal efficacy in SHR. The blood pressure lowering efficacy of compounds of the present invention compared to vehicle control was evaluated following a single oral gavage each day for a typical duration of three to fourteen days. Data were collected as hourly averages and changes in blood pressure were calculated by subtracting vehicle control baseline data on an hourly basis. Example numbers 5 7 9 and 43 were evaluated at PO QD doses at one or more doses within the range of 0.3 to 10 mg kg and resulted in typical reductions in daily 24 h mean systolic blood pressure ranging from 6 mmHg to 24 mmHg at the doses used by the last day of the studies.

The Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat Assay is well known and often used in the art as an experimental model simulating human hypertension see e.g. Lerman L. O. et al. 2005 146 160 173 .
