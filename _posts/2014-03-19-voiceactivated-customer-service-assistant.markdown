The present disclosure generally involves mobile virtual assistants and more specifically voice activated customer service assistants that interact with customer data centers on behalf of a user.

Conventionally voice activated assistants may perform tasks such as download weather forecasts and show local show times for a movie or concert. These assistants typically rely on Internet search and localization technologies and access to calendar e mail and other applications on a mobile device and on the Internet. An assistant may add an appointment to a personal calendar but typically may not make an appointment with a personal service such as a doctor lawyer technician and the like. The tasks the voice activated assistants may perform are typically constrained to the applications available on the mobile device and publicly available Internet applications. Current voice activated assistants currently do not interact with the user s personal customer services like his her doctor auto mechanic bank ticket agent and the like.

In one embodiment a method comprises at least one of interpreting at least one input from a user via a wireless device receiving at least one user account with the at least one input deriving at least one representation of user intent identifying at least one task based on the at least one representation of user intent contacting at least one service to perform the identified at least one task and synthesizing speech to communicate a result of the contact to the wireless device.

In another embodiment an apparatus comprises at least one of a processor configured to interpret at least one input from a user via a wireless device receiving at least one user account with the at least one input derive at least one representation of user intent identify at least one task based on the at least one representation of user intent contact at least one service to perform the identified at least one task and synthesize speech to communicate a result of the contact to the wireless device.

In a further embodiment a non transitory computer readable storage medium configured to store instructions that when executed causes a processor to perform at least one of interpreting at least one input from a user via a wireless device receiving at least one user account with the at least one input deriving at least one representation of user intent identifying at least one task based on the at least one representation of user intent contacting at least one service to perform the identified at least one task and synthesizing speech to communicate a result of the contact to the wireless device.

Thus appearances of the phrases example examples in some examples in other examples or other similar language throughout this specification do not necessarily refer to the same group of examples and the described features structures or characteristics may be combined in a suitable manner in one or more examples.

The disclosure discusses an application resident on a wireless user device. The device may be a computer laptop mobile wireless or cellular phone a PDA a tablet a client a server or a device that contains a processor and or memory whether that processor or memory performs a function related to an example. The present application discussed throughout the disclosure may work with a device such as a personal computer with a touch screen a laptop with a touch screen a personal computing tablet a smartphone or a device with a processor memory and a touch screen.

The current disclosure allows interaction between a wireless user device and a customer service data center.

At the time of user registration speaker verification setup may have the user announce at least one phrase that may be compiled into a voice print file or the like. This voice print file may subsequently be utilized for comparison to verify the identity of the user.

At the time of business registration the business may provide access to its appointment calendar or the like through the Internet. This allows registered businesses to schedule business with registered users without the need for human intervention.

Utilizing the voiceprint of the registered user the system may search for a registered business that matches a particular sought after service such as Acme Car Repair wherein the system may access that businesses appointment calendar for scheduling.

One method by which a voice assistant may be used to register a user for a business is to inform the user that the service is available to associate the account to the user. The user therefore does not need to register with the voice assistant system beforehand. The registered business may access the assistant system and provide the assistant system with the account information. The voice assistant system may then perform verification by sending the user a welcome e mail for every service added to the user s account.

An example of the disclosure is comprised of the following the application runs on a mobile device with a speech and visual input and output user interface. The application posts or streams recorded audio renders synthesized speech displays visual data and sends visual input to the internal application environment. The user is registered securely with the mobile application and the internal application environment.

The internal application environment comprises at least one of the following the speech recognition engine having an acoustic model language model and grammars optimized for recognizing customer service requests and the Text to Speech TTS engine for synthesizing the audio rendered by the mobile device.

The application controller may access repositories of user accounts customer service accounts associated with the user and dynamic web service APIs associated with the customer service account.

The application controller listens for semantic interpretations from the speech recognition engine and data requests and updates submitted from the mobile application. A rules based search searches for the customer service account that best matches the interpretation and one or more data centers associated with a customer account registered with the user and accessible by a web service API or data connection. When the Application Controller matches the customer service to the users request it also searches the web service Application Programming Interface API to contact the data center. The data center may have APIs for getting available dates and times for an appointment setting an appointment requesting a notification and getting paying a bill balance and the like. The application as referenced to in the current disclosure resides on or in the user s mobile wireless device.
