title: System, method, and apparatus for the electronic operation, management, sponsorship, advertising, promotion, marketing, and regulation of games of chance on a network
abstract: The present invention is directed to a computer network system that allows a user to register for games of chances throughout the country and in accordance with national, state and local laws and ordinances. This system analyses the geographical location and residency information of a user in relation to the geographical access and participation areas permitted, excluded, and restricted for a game of chance as governed by jurisdictional laws, statutes, rules, and regulations. If the user is not located within a permitted area or falls within an excluded or restricted area, the user will not be allowed to access or participate in the game of chance. The ability of the system to limit participation by geographical location is based on user input, data, and variable analysis, and the comparison between the areas where games of chance are permitted, excluded, restricted, and user location and residency, filters data to determine user accessibility to a game of chance, listings, and advertising. The methods and apparatus of this system have applications on the Internet for raffles as well as other conventional games of chance.
