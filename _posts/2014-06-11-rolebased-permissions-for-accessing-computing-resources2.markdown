title: Role-based permissions for accessing computing resources
abstract: Mechanisms for controlling access to a computing resource are disclosed. A request to initiate an action against a computing resource of a plurality of computing resources is received from a user. A plurality of permission definitions that identify a plurality of corresponding permissions that grant access to the plurality of computing resources is accessed. Based on a set of permissions comprising at least one permission associated with the user and at least one permission associated with a team of which the user is a member, it is determined that at least one permission in the set of permissions grants the user access to the computing resource. The request to initiate the action against the computing resource is processed.
