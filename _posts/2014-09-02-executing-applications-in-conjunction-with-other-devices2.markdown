This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119 a of a Korean patent application filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on Sep. 3 2013 and assigned Serial No. 10 2013 0105772 the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.

Various examples of the present disclosure relate to a method for working in conjunction with among electronic devices and electronic devices thereof.

Short range wireless communication heretofore may support real time communication between electronic devices without needing complex electrical wiring therebetween. Short range wireless communication may be convenient when signal exchange is needed between electronic devices located within a short distance of each other such as in a house or an office. Such communication may be carried out without going through a network relay device such as a base station which may be located far away from the devices themselves. Thus short range wireless communication may relieve the work load imposed on network relay devices.

Short range wireless communication makes high speed data transmission possible with very little delay thus short range communication is commonly used in for example mobile devices e.g. portable phones tablets etc. . For example short range wireless communication is now used to provide many functions on mobile devices e.g. telephony audio playback etc. through an accessory e.g. a headset and an earphone which connects with the mobile device using short range communication protocols such as Blue Tooth.

There is a need a solution for working in conjunction with among electronic devices and electronic devices thereof.
