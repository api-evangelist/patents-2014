title: System and method for culture mapping
abstract: Systems and methods for culture mapping and intelligence include software tools to collect, analyze, and categorize data based on behavior archetypes to produce information visualizations from the data. In one embodiment, a user query relative to a topic of interest may include a word, a combination of words, or a set of words for a particular field, such as a byline or hashtag of an online or networked community. One or more data sources, which may include social media and other websites are selected by the user or the system and a list of accounts ordered by one or more selected criteria, such as frequency of occurrence of the query words, for example, is produced. One or more weighting factors may then be associated with each account. A matrix is generated with accounts positioned to illustrate the account relative to behavior attributes along selected continuums.

This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 61 760 773 filed Feb. 5 2013 the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference herein.

A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.

This disclosure relates to systems and methods for culture mapping based on curating of semiotic data for use in characterizing behavior and or sentiment of archetypical groups.

Various strategies have been used over the years to identify target markets for consumer goods and services. Product planning development manufacturing and distribution often require significant investments of time and resources to provide a successful new product. Miscues may seriously impact a company s financial performance and could even lead to the demise of the company or allow competitors to capitalize on a misinterpretation of market demand. Similarly companies are continually seeking new consumers for their goods and services by improving market penetration in existing markets and or expanding to new market sectors or geographic areas. Successful companies typically gather and attempt to analyze tremendous quantities of consumer data from diverse sources to try to understand the behavior of a target market or segment for an existing or yet to be developed product or service.

The ubiquity of personal communication devices such as cell phones and the internet have led to rapidly emerging and evolving market dynamics that are often well ahead of the ability of a company to recognize the changes and adapt accordingly. Conventional strategies for market data gathering and analysis are limited in their ability to identify and collect relevant data and to analyze and present the data in a manner that is easily understood by business decision makers.

Systems and methods for culture mapping according to various embodiments of the present disclosure use semiotic analysis to reveal patterns of functional signs and connect consumer sentiment and or behavioral actions to these signs. In one embodiment semiotic analysis informs data collection from social media including but not limited to social networking websites. Data may include pictures videos and text related to a particular query topic such as a product or activity for example. The data is processed or analyzed to reveal patterns of functional signs and connect behavioral actions and or sentiments to these signs. The data may be displayed or visualized in a cultural map or consumer segmentation map. In one embodiment the data are arranged organized or plotted in a matrix based on functional archetypes. Representative archetypes may be assigned labels based on position within the matrix to convey a generalized behavior of the members of a particular archetype with quadrants separated by axes representing vertical and horizontal continuums. A code may be assigned to each member to facilitate tracking over time and to detect migration of the topic through the matrix.

Various embodiments include software tools to collect and analyze the data and to produce an information visualization from the data. In one embodiment the software tool accepts a user query relative to a topic of interest. The user query may include a word a combination of words or a set of words for a particular field such as a byline or hashtag. One or more data sources are selected by the user or the system. The data sources may include social media websites or other websites designated by the user or selected by the system. The system then produces a list of accounts ordered by one or more selected criteria such as frequency of occurrence of the query words for example. A weighting factor may then be associated with each account either manually by the user or automatically by the system. Accounts can accumulate multiple weights from multiple queries. The multiple weights may be combined using an average or similar mathematical operation. The system then generates a matrix or grid with each account positioned or plotted according to its weight.

Embodiments according to the present disclosure provide various advantages. For example rather than analyzing and organizing data by numbers and frequency of occurrence which represents the loudest or most prevalent signals in the data associated with a particular behavior embodiments according to the present disclosure curate data by personality archetypes or cultures and subcultures within a sample population. The present disclosure provides a semiotic insight tool to curate and visualize cultural data across social media to capture or characterize the flow or kinetics of unstructured expression. Data categorization and visualization using a two dimensional quadrant reveals insights based on a behavior archetype using the signals in the data to identify codes that can be used to predict behavior. Tracking over a period of time can be used to present two dimensional or three dimensional visualizations that show migration of a particular member within the matrix of archetypes. Various embodiments provide new insights into behavior by organizing and filtering members of a monitored population into likeminded groupings and tracking migration patterns of visual cues in collected imagery and dimensions associated with the context of monitored words phrases and images.

As required detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein however it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention that may be embodied in various and alternative forms. The figures are not necessarily to scale some features may be exaggerated or minimized to show details of particular components. Therefore specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting but merely as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present invention.

Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that any block diagrams or flow charts of the present disclosure generally illustrate operation of a system or method for cultural mapping and include various steps functions systems or subsystems. While some functions or steps may be illustrated or described in a linear or sequential order the particular order or sequence illustrated is not necessarily required for the system or method to achieve the stated objectives. Various functions or steps may be repeated may be omitted or may be performed in a different order or sequence that illustrated depending on the particular application and implementation.

Various embodiments are implemented as a thick client that runs on a laptop or desktop computer or microprocessor based device having similar resources while other embodiments are implemented as a thin or stateless client on a device with more limited resources such as a mobile device that may communicate via a wired or wireless network with one or more servers.

A system or method for culture mapping and intelligence according to one embodiment includes a dashboard application or app implemented primarily in software. Dashboard includes a user interface to facilitate data input or mining from users as stored on one or more servers or websites connected to network or internet such as servers or websites and for example. The input module or function of dashboard may include various menus and forms to facilitate formation of queries related to a particular topic or phrase. Input module or function may also be used to identify or select one or more websites and or user accounts for data mining and monitoring over time as explained in greater detail herein. For example in one embodiment dashboard may be used to select or specify user accounts on social networking websites such as Twitter LinkedIn or Facebook. A URL associated with each user account may be stored in a database or table accessible by device or hosting dashboard app for monitoring of a selected topic and its context over time. The URLs may be used to download or collect data available for a particular user using a standard data interchange format such as JavaScript Object Notation JSON for example.

The input module of the dashboard application may also be used to generate or form queries via drop down menu and input fields for example. The queries may be formatted in one or more standard formats derived from one or more input forms and may be customized for particular types of accounts. For example in one embodiment the query forms are used to generate structured query language SQL queries based on the particular types of accounts selected the fields of data provided for those accounts and the keywords that can be entered to query against those accounts. The input form and or related processes will generate one or more SQL queries to run against the data collected on the user accounts. In one embodiment a user interface control such as a button allows for a popup list to display all queries run so far.

Each account selected by a query may be assigned a weight. Because one of the end visualizations in various embodiments is a two dimensional grid or matrix each weighting factor or function may include two numbers that can be either positive or negative and represented as a vertical value and horizontal value in the grid or matrix. For example a set that is positive negative such as 47 12 may be displayed in the top left hand corner of the grid. A set that is negative positive such as 99 87 may be displayed in the bottom right hand corner of the grid. Multiple weights may be combined using various mathematical or statistical functions to produce a combined or final weight for each account. In one embodiment the user interface includes a final processing button that averages the weights for each account that is used by display function to plot all accounts on a graph. Input system may also provide various fields to document who is using the system for what client or program and at what time. Data entered in all of these forms may be input validated before submission can be accepted.

As also illustrated in dashboard may include a processing component or module . This component collects data and downloads the accounts via the internet and associated APIs of websites and provided by the input system . Processing module stores the collected data in a database and runs the queries and tracks the weighting for each result for each account as determined by the input module . Each monitored account scores a value set for each query that it fits and for which it is assigned a value by the dashboard user or automatically by the system. In the end of the process those values are averaged to produce the account s position within the matrix or grid.

Dashboard may also include a display or visualization module or component . This component takes the weighting for each account and displays them in a grid or matrix as illustrated and described in greater detail herein. In one embodiment hovering over any particular point displayed in the grid or matrix brings up a summary from each account associated with the data point as well as a hyperlink to that account. Workroom module or function may provide various tools for working with the data. For example a file capture or archiving function may be provided for storing the queries process data and raw results to a file such as a flat text file for example. Tools may be provided to annotate data queries etc. or to compare and contrast multiple graphs for example.

The user interface provided by dashboard may include various tools or features accessed by associated drop down menus or by selecting or hovering over a data point. In one embodiment the user interface provides popup account summaries showing each field for the account such as Twitter Facebook or LinkedIn for example as well as dynamic links to any link in any of the fields for images etc. . Popup account lists sorted by number of hits for that query may also be provided. Each popup list may include a one line identifier of the account such as the account name in addition to the field that the query selected and an entry field to enter the assigned value. Clicking the identifier produces the popup account summary. The user interface may also provide a popup list of all queries processed with the option to copy and modify or delete any of the queries for example. A popup word cloud for a quadrant of the matrix or grid may be displayed by clicking on an icon on the corner of each quadrant of the grid. The word clouds may be generated from all the words in all the queries used to assign weighting.

Additional user interface features of dashboard may include a popup thumbnail list of images associated with each account in a particular quadrant of the matrix or grid produced by clicking on an icon on the corner of each quadrant of the grid a dynamic grid graph showing all the accounts positioned according to their scoring by query which may also be exported or downloaded as an .xls or .png file for example. In one embodiment dashboard may include tools or options to display various information associated with processing module such as data on time to process number of accounts processed complete list of weighted results for each account as well as all the queries executed and their raw results which may be exportable as a downloadable .csv file for example. This output file may be provided as a downloadable link accompanying each graph output and can be used to re input the entire case. i.e. by saving this file the user can later upload the file s contents to run the same queries against the same accounts producing a historic comparison of the same examination. This information may be used to generate a two dimensional or three dimensional representation of the matrix or grid over time to illustrate migration of a particular account within the matrix or grid as illustrated and described in greater detail herein.

In one embodiment the dashboard application or app is implemented primarily in software and may rely on commercially available or open source components or libraries to perform various functions. For example input function or module may include features and or code of RedQueryBuilder for the query generator which is implemented in pure JavaScript. This provides reduced processing load on the server side easy application integration including non GWT integration support with event handlers and JavaScript object configuration and easy customization. In addition this tool or a similar tool may be used with simple metadata JavaScript JSON or Google Web Toolkit GWT interfaces and supports loading existing SQL queries within limits of the user interface . Various other open source solutions may be integrated into dashboard so that the code is exportable and extensible. In one embodiment the platform consists of a Java application that runs customized code to produce an information visualization from a data set gathered cleaned and normalized by a third party.

Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the user interface and features of dashboard may vary depending on the particular implementation. While the user interface may be used to simplify query generation this may result in compromises on what can be extracted from the data as it may only accept binary positive results and may be designed under SQL query language constraints. Of course the dashboard may include features such as a command line for more sophisticated users to bypass more basic input forms and menus to provide additional functionality. While flexible to query the categories of data imported into the database may limit the data that can be queried in some applications.

While the representative embodiment described above may display the number of hits per query the account summary data and any images associated with the account various other data may also be displayed depending on the particular application and implementation. Similarly while some embodiments average each account s values to produce the account s position on the matrix or grid more complex weighting mechanisms or functions may also be used in some applications so that the results are not over simplified.

The behavioral matrices represented in plot behavioral networks and pattern ongoing relationships of the users represented by the curated data.

The representative user interface includes display areas for exploratory data data visualizations and a workroom. The exploratory data may include raw data collected and stored in the cloud i.e. on a remote server accessible via the internet. The exploratory data may also include metadata associated with particular social media. In the representative embodiment and project illustrated in metadata may include hashtags related to the occupy movement.

The user interface may cooperate with data processing algorithms executed by the same device hosting the user interface. Alternatively the user interface may be executed by a mobile device in communication with one or more back end data programs that generate the various data visualizations and provide associate results for display on the user interface. Available data visualizations may vary by application and implementation. In the representative embodiment illustrated data visualizations may be used to illustrate migration of a particular theme in a two dimensional representation or a three dimensional representation. Data visualizations may also include pictures images emoticons emoji pictographs or similar signals associated with a particular query topic or theme.

The representative user interface or dashboard illustrated in also includes a workroom portion having a bulletin board or posting board to provide space for notes and annotations related to a particular project which may include images in various formats such as JPG for example. The workroom may include a scratch pad area or function to track unused queries user accounts. Similarly a private and shared area or function may be provided with the private area restricted for use and viewing by authorized users and the shared area used to compare and contrast multiple graphs with other projects or users for example.

With reference to in operation a representative embodiment of a system or method for culture mapping and intelligence may be used in an exemplary application where a new client wants to understand which subgroups of pig farmers are likely to be fans of a new pig food as well as how these subgroups may differ in characteristic behavior. The user of the system provides a few hundred examples of the type of accounts from websites exemplary of these subgroups. The user forms a query using input module of dashboard . For example the query may include a word a combination of words or a set of words for a particular field like the byline or in tweets for example . The system then produces a list of all accounts ordered by the frequency in which those words appear. The user then goes through each account on the list which can each be individually brought up in its entirety in a popup for preview and assigns a weight before submitting the list to the system. Each account can accumulate multiple weights from multiple queries which are averaged at the final processing. A grid is produced with each account plotted according to its weight to allow for an overview i.e. the user selects whole grain and tweets and gets a list of 324 accounts ordered from 1 occurrence of the words whole grain in a tweet to 775 occurrences. The user then assigns weights to selected accounts and may repeat for as many queries as desired. When all queries are submitted the system produces a set of accounts with varied weights each of which is the average from all its queries which all get plotted on a grid . The accounts may be monitored over a number of days weeks or months with time slices plotted as described with reference to for example.

While exemplary embodiments are described above it is not intended that these embodiments describe all possible forms of the invention. Rather the words used in the specification are words of description rather than limitation and it is understood that various changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Additionally the features of various implementing embodiments may be combined to form further embodiments of the invention. While the best mode has been described in detail those familiar with the art will recognize various alternative designs and embodiments within the scope of the following claims. While various embodiments may have been described as providing advantages or being preferred over other embodiments with respect to one or more desired characteristics as one skilled in the art is aware one or more characteristics may be compromised to achieve desired system attributes which depend on the specific application and implementation. These attributes include but are not limited to cost life cycle cost marketability appearance packaging size serviceability ease of use etc. The embodiments discussed herein that are described as less desirable than other embodiments or prior art implementations with respect to one or more characteristics are not outside the scope of the disclosure and may be desirable for particular applications.
