In certain embodiments as a port provisioning system allocates ports the port provisioning system may eliminate each piece of hardware used until all available hardware has been used.

In many embodiments a port provisioning system may utilize one or more algorithms to analyze a data storage system and filter available data storage ports to determine a balanced and or equal usage of ports across a given data storage system. In various embodiments a port provisioning system may query a data system to determine which switches are available and which ports are connected to each available switch. In some embodiments if a port is not currently connected to a switch the port may be eliminated from the list of available ports. In certain embodiments a port provisioning system may keep track of allocated ports allocated engines allocated directors and or allocated switches used while allocating ports to enable port provisioning system to allocate ports to maximize redundancy across each engine director and or switch rather than allocating each port on a single entity.

In some embodiments a port provisioning system may be enabled to allocate one or more available ports by filtering the available ports to enable a determination of a balanced and or equal distribution of ports across each engine director and or switch. In various embodiments one or more filters may be applied in a precedence order from most important to least important consideration. In certain embodiments the number of filters used may be adjusted. In many embodiments a port provisioning system may use one or more filters where each filter may operate on a data storage system entity such as a VMAX engine VMAX director VNX processor SAN switch and or other data storage system component. In some embodiments each filter may require inputs including a current list of candidate ports the filtering entities that have already been allocated or used and a map from the contextual object that contains entries of an entity based on a key to the set of storage ports hosted by or associated with the entity. In many embodiments as a port provisioning system starts allocating ports each of the filters may have no allocated entities. In some embodiments as the port provisioning system allocates ports the port provisioning system includes the entities from where the port was allocated into its respective filter. In certain embodiments the port provisioning system may continue to allocate ports while continually filtering out available ports using the specified filters. In some embodiments once all entities are contained within each specified filter and no ports are available each filter may be purged and the process repeated until the requested number of ports may be allocated.
