The field of the present invention relates to the delivery of energy impulses and or fields to bodily tissues for therapeutic purposes. The invention relates more specifically to devices and methods for treating conditions associated with stroke and or transient ischemic attacks. The energy impulses and or fields that are used to treat those conditions comprise electrical and or electromagnetic energy delivered non invasively to the patient.

The use of electrical stimulation for treatment of medical conditions is well known. For example electrical stimulation of the brain with implanted electrodes deep brain stimulation has been approved for use in the treatment of various conditions including pain and movement disorders such as essential tremor and Parkinson s disease Joel S.

Acta Neurochir Suppl 97 Pt 1 2007 21 29 . The type of electrical stimulation that is most relevant to the present invention is vagus nerve stimulation VNS also known as vagal nerve stimulation . It was developed initially for the treatment of partial onset epilepsy and was subsequently developed for the treatment of depression and other disorders. The left vagus nerve is ordinarily stimulated at a location within the neck by first implanting an electrode about the vagus nerve during open neck surgery and by then connecting the electrode to an electrical stimulator circuit a pulse generator . The pulse generator is ordinarily implanted subcutaneously within a pocket that is created at some distance from the electrode which is usually in the left infraclavicular region of the chest. A lead is then tunneled subcutaneously to connect the electrode assembly and pulse generator. The patient s stimulation protocol is then programmed using a device a programmer that communicates with the pulse generator with the objective of selecting electrical stimulation parameters that best treat the patient s condition pulse frequency stimulation amplitude pulse width etc. U.S. Pat.

Prior art vagal nerve stimulators typically have treatment paradigms that require continuous stimulation of the vagus nerve. The term continuous stimulate as defined herein means stimulation that either literally remains ON for 24 hours day and seven days week or follows a certain ON Off pattern continuously for 24 hours day and seven days week. For example existing implantable vagal nerve stimulators continuously stimulate the vagus nerve with a typical pattern of 30 seconds ON 5 minutes OFF or the like for 24 hours day and seven days week. Unfortunately this not only involves a continuous drain on the power supply of the vagal nerve stimulator but it makes it very difficult if not impossible to provide treatment with a vagal nerve stimulator that is not implanted on the nerve.

The present invention provides systems apparatus and methods for selectively applying electrical energy to body tissue particularly to a vagus nerve at a location in a patient s neck. Methods are provided to apply an electrical impulse to modulate stimulate inhibit or block electrical signals in nerves within or around the carotid sheath to prevent or treat a condition or symptom of a patient. The electrical signal may be adapted to reduce stimulate inhibit or block electrical signals in a vagus nerve to treat many conditions such as bronchoconstriction associated with asthma COPD or the like hypotension associated with sepsis or anaphylaxis allergic rhinitis chronic sinusitis stroke hypertension diabetes hypovolemic shock sepsis epilepsy depression obesity anxiety disorders migraine cluster headache tension headache post concussion headache post traumatic stress disorder GI disorders autism stroke modulation of liver function to alter cholesterol production neurodegenerative disorders such Alzheimer s disease and the like and any other ailment affected by vagus nerve transmissions.

In certain aspects of the invention a device or system comprises an energy source of magnetic and or electrical energy that is transmitted to or in close proximity to the vagus nerve to temporarily stimulate and or modulate the signals in the nerve.

In certain embodiments the vagal nerve stimulator of the present invention is non invasive. In one preferred embodiment a method of treatment includes positioning the coil of a magnetic stimulator non invasively on or above a patient s neck and applying a magnetically induced electrical impulse non invasively to the target region within the neck to stimulate or otherwise modulate selected nerve fibers. In another embodiment surface electrodes are used to apply electrical impulses non invasively to the target region within the neck to likewise stimulate or otherwise modulate selected nerve fibers. Preferably the target region is adjacent to or in close proximity with the carotid sheath that contains a vagus nerve.

In another embodiment of the invention the stimulator comprises a source of electrical power and two or more remote electrodes that are configured to stimulate a deep nerve. The stimulator may comprise two electrodes that lie side by side on the surface of a hand held enclosure to form an interface between the enclosure and the patient s skin. The enclosure preferably also includes a power source and a signal generator coupled to the electrode interface. However it should be understood that either of these elements the power source and or the signal generator may be located exterior to the enclosure and coupled to the electrodes either directly e.g. through wires or wirelessly. A filter is provided within the enclosure to electrically couple the electrode interface with the signal generator. The filter is configured to filter out or eliminate high frequency components of the electrical impulse or signal generated by the signal generator before these components reach the electrode.

Filtering the high frequency components from the signal results in a smoother cleaner signal through the electrodes. This filtered signal causes less discomfort or pain to the patient particularly at the skin surface where the signal is being applied. Thus a sufficiently high amplitude signal may be applied to the patient to cause the electrical impulse to reach a deeper nerve such as the vagus nerve and cause that nerve to fire an action potential.

In one embodiment the filter comprises an electrically conducting medium that extends from the electrode interface element of the stimulator to the signal generator or at least the output stage of the signal generator . The electrically conductive medium may comprise solution of electrolytes or a conductive gel. Because the conductive medium is located between the signal generating electronics of the device and the electrodes it acts as a low pass filter that reduces or eliminates most if not all of the undesired high frequency components of the signal before the electrical impulse reaches the electrodes.

In another embodiment the filter comprises a low pass filter electrically coupled in series between the signal generator and the electrode interface. In this embodiment the low pass filter may comprise a digital or analog filter. In certain embodiments the low pass filter comprises a capacitor.

Current passing through an electrode may be about 0 to about 40 mA with voltage across the electrodes of about 0 to about 30 volts. The current is passed through the electrodes in bursts of pulses. There may be 1 to 20 pulses per burst preferably five pulses. Each pulse within a burst has a duration of about 20 to about 1000 microseconds preferably about 200 microseconds. A burst followed by a silent inter burst interval repeats at 1 to 5000 bursts per second bps similar to Hz preferably at 15 50 bps and even more preferably at 25 bps. The preferred shape of each pulse is a full sinusoidal wave.

A source of power supplies a pulse of electric charge to the electrodes or magnetic stimulator coil such that the electrodes or magnetic stimulator produce an electric current and or an electric field within the patient. The electrical or magnetic stimulator is configured to induce a peak pulse voltage sufficient to produce an electric field in the vicinity of a nerve such as a vagus nerve to cause the nerve to depolarize and reach a threshold for action potential propagation. By way of example the threshold electric field for stimulation of the nerve may be about 8 V m at 1000 Hz. For example the device may produce an electric field within the patient of about 10 to about 600 V m preferably less than about 100 V m and an electrical field gradient of greater than about 2 V m mm. Electric fields that are produced at the vagus nerve are generally sufficient to excite all myelinated A and B fibers but not necessarily the unmyelinated C fibers. However by using a reduced amplitude of stimulation excitation of A delta and B fibers may also be avoided.

The preferred stimulator shapes an elongated electric field of effect that can be oriented parallel to a long nerve such as a vagus. By selecting a suitable waveform to stimulate the nerve along with suitable parameters such as current voltage pulse width pulses per burst inter burst interval etc. the stimulator produces a correspondingly selective physiological response in an individual patient. Such a suitable waveform and parameters are simultaneously selected to avoid substantially stimulating nerves and tissue other than the target nerve particularly avoiding the stimulation of nerves in the skin that produce pain.

In one or more embodiments of the present invention electrical energy is applied in a patient to a target region within or around the carotid sheath also called the carotid neurovascular bundle to treat a patient s ailment. The invention is particularly useful for applying electrical impulses that ultimately interact with the signals of a vagus nerve which lies within the carotid sheath to achieve a therapeutic result. The nerve stimulation may result in benefits to the patient such as relaxation of the smooth muscle of the bronchia for treatment of bronchoconstriction associated with asthma COPD and or exercised induced bronchoconstriction increase in blood pressure associated with orthostatic hypotension reduction in blood pressure treatment of epilepsy treating ileus conditions depression anxiety anaphylaxis obesity a neurodegenerative disorder such as Alzheimer s disease migraine tension type cluster MOH and other types of headache rhinitis sinusitis stroke atrial fibrillation autism modulation of liver function gastroparesis and other functional gastrointestinal disorders and or any other ailment that may be affected by nerve transmissions of a vagus nerve.

The fact that electrical stimulation of a vagus nerve can be used to treat so many disorders may be understood as follows. The vagus nerve is composed of motor and sensory fibers. The vagus nerve leaves the cranium passes down the neck within the carotid sheath to the root of the neck then passes to the chest and abdomen where it contributes to the innervation of the viscera. A human vagus nerve tenth cranial nerve paired left and right consists of over 100 000 nerve fibers axons mostly organized into groups. The groups are contained within fascicles of varying sizes which branch and converge along the nerve. Under normal physiological conditions each fiber conducts electrical impulses only in one direction which is defined to be the orthodromic direction and which is opposite the antidromic direction. However external electrical stimulation of the nerve may produce action potentials that propagate in orthodromic and antidromic directions. Besides efferent output fibers that convey signals to the various organs in the body from the central nervous system the vagus nerve conveys sensory afferent information about the state of the body s organs back to the central nervous system. Some 80 90 of the nerve fibers in the vagus nerve are afferent sensory nerves communicating the state of the viscera to the central nervous system.

The largest nerve fibers within a left or right vagus nerve are approximately 20 m in diameter and are heavily myelinated whereas only the smallest nerve fibers of less than about 1 m in diameter are completely unmyelinated. When the distal part of a nerve is electrically stimulated a compound action potential may be recorded by an electrode located more proximally. A compound action potential contains several peaks or waves of activity that represent the summated response of multiple fibers having similar conduction velocities. The waves in a compound action potential represent different types of nerve fibers that are classified into corresponding functional categories with approximate diameters as follows A alpha fibers afferent or efferent fibers 12 20 m diameter A beta fibers afferent or efferent fibers 5 12 m A gamma fibers efferent fibers 3 7 m A delta fibers afferent fibers 2 5 m B fibers 1 3 m and C fibers unmyelinated 0.4 1.2 m . The diameters of group A and group B fibers include the thickness of the myelin sheaths.

The vagus or vagal afferent nerve fibers arise from cell bodies located in the vagal sensory ganglia which take the form of swellings near the base of the skull. Vagal afferents traverse the brainstem in the solitary tract with some eighty percent of the terminating synapses being located in the nucleus of the tractus solitarius or nucleus tractus solitarii nucleus tractus solitarius or NTS . The NTS projects to a wide variety of structures in the central nervous system such as the amygdala raphe nuclei periaqueductal gray nucleus paragigantocellurlais olfactory tubercule locus ceruleus nucleus ambiguus and the hypothalamus. The NTS also projects to the parabrachial nucleus which in turn projects to the hypothalamus the thalamus the amygdala the anterior insula and infralimbic cortex lateral prefrontal cortex and other cortical regions JEAN A. The nucleus tractus solitarius neuroanatomic neurochemical and functional aspects. Arch Int Physiol Biochim Biophys 99 5 1991 A3 A52 . Thus stimulation of vagal afferents can modulate the activity of many structures of the brain and brainstem through these projections.

With regard to vagal efferent nerve fibers two vagal components have evolved in the brainstem to regulate peripheral parasympathetic functions. The dorsal vagal complex consisting of the dorsal motor nucleus and its connections controls parasympathetic function primarily below the level of the diaphragm while the ventral vagal complex comprised of nucleus ambiguus and nucleus retrofacial controls functions primarily above the diaphragm in organs such as the heart thymus and lungs as well as other glands and tissues of the neck and upper chest and specialized muscles such as those of the esophageal complex. For example the cell bodies for the preganglionic parasympathetic vagal neurons that innervate the heart reside in the nucleus ambiguus which is relevant to potential cardiovascular side effects that may be produced by vagus nerve stimulation.

The vagus efferent fibers innervate parasympathetic ganglionic neurons that are located in or adjacent to each target organ. The vagal parasympathetic tone resulting from the activity of these fibers is balanced reflexly in part by sympathetic innervations. Consequently electrical stimulation of a vagus nerve may result not only in modulation of parasympathetic activity in postganglionic nerve fibers but also a reflex modulation of sympathetic activity. The ability of a vagus nerve to bring about widespread changes in autonomic activity either directly through modulation of vagal efferent nerves or indirectly via activation of brainstem and brain functions that are brought about by electrical stimulation of vagal afferent nerves accounts for the fact that vagus nerve stimulation can treat many different medical conditions in many end organs. Selective treatment of particular conditions is possible because the parameters of the electrical stimulation frequency amplitude pulse width etc. may selectively activate or modulate the activity of particular afferent or efferent A B and or C fibers that result in a particular physiological response in each individual.

As ordinarily practiced the electrodes used to stimulate a vagus nerve are implanted about the nerve during open neck surgery. For many patients this may be done with the objective of implanting permanent electrodes to treat epilepsy depression or other conditions Arun Paul AMAR Michael L. Levy Charles Y. Liu and Michael L.

In other patients a vagus nerve is electrically stimulated during open neck thyroid surgery in order to confirm that the nerve has not been accidentally damaged during the surgery. In that case a vagus nerve in the neck is surgically exposed and a temporary stimulation electrode is clipped about the nerve SCHNEIDER R Randolph G W Sekulla C Phelan E Thanh P N Bucher M Machens A Dralle H Lorenz K.

It is also possible to electrically stimulate a vagus nerve using a minimally invasive surgical approach namely percutaneous nerve stimulation. In that procedure a pair of electrodes an active and a return electrode are introduced through the skin of a patient s neck to the vicinity of a vagus nerve and wires connected to the electrodes extend out of the patient s skin to a pulse generator Publication number US20100241188 entitled Percutaneous electrical treatment of tissue to J.

In one embodiment the stimulation device is introduced through a percutaneous penetration in the patient to a target location within adjacent to or in close proximity with the carotid sheath that contains the vagus nerve. Once in position electrical impulses are applied through the electrodes of the stimulation device to one or more selected nerves e.g. vagus nerve or one of its branches to stimulate block or otherwise modulate the nerve s and treat the patient s condition or a symptom of that condition. For some conditions the treatment may be acute meaning that the electrical impulse immediately begins to interact with one or more nerves to produce a response in the patient. In some cases the electrical impulse will produce a response in the nerve s to improve the patient s condition or symptom in less than 3 hours preferably less than 1 hour and more preferably less than 15 minutes. For other conditions intermittently scheduled or as needed stimulation of the nerve may produce improvements in the patient over the course of several days weeks months or years. A more complete description of a suitable percutaneous procedure for vagal nerve stimulation can be found in commonly assigned co pending US patent application titled Percutaneous Electrical Treatment of Tissue filed Apr. 13 2009 Ser. No. 12 422 483 the complete disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

In another embodiment of the invention a time varying magnetic field originating and confined to the outside of a patient generates an electromagnetic field and or induces eddy currents within tissue of the patient. In another embodiment electrodes applied to the skin of the patient generate currents within the tissue of the patient. An objective of the invention is to produce and apply the electrical impulses so as to interact with the signals of one or more nerves in order to prevent or avert a stroke and or transient ischemic attack to ameliorate or limit the effects of an acute stroke or transient ischemic attack and or to rehabilitate a stroke patient.

Much of the disclosure will be directed specifically to treatment of a patient by electromagnetic stimulation in or around a vagus nerve with devices positioned non invasively on or near a patient s neck. However it will also be appreciated that the devices and methods of the present invention can be applied to other tissues and nerves of the body including but not limited to other parasympathetic nerves sympathetic nerves spinal or cranial nerves. As recognized by those having skill in the art the methods should be carefully evaluated prior to use in patients known to have preexisting cardiac issues. In addition it will be recognized that the treatment paradigms of the present invention can be used with a variety of different vagal nerve stimulators including implantable and or percutaneous stimulation devices such as the ones described above.

The vagus nerve tenth cranial nerve paired left and right is composed of motor and sensory fibers. The vagus nerve leaves the cranium passes down the neck within the carotid sheath to the root of the neck then passes to the chest and abdomen where it contributes to the innervation of the viscera.

A vagus nerve in man consists of over 100 000 nerve fibers axons mostly organized into groups. The groups are contained within fascicles of varying sizes which branch and converge along the nerve. Under normal physiological conditions each fiber conducts electrical impulses only in one direction which is defined to be the orthodromic direction and which is opposite the antidromic direction. However external electrical stimulation of the nerve may produce action potentials that propagate in orthodromic and antidromic directions. Besides efferent output fibers that convey signals to the various organs in the body from the central nervous system the vagus nerve conveys sensory afferent information about the state of the body s organs back to the central nervous system. Some 80 90 of the nerve fibers in the vagus nerve are afferent sensory nerves communicating the state of the viscera to the central nervous system. Propagation of electrical signals in efferent and afferent directions are indicated by arrows in . If communication between structures is bidirectional this is shown in as a single connection with two arrows rather than showing the efferent and afferent nerve fibers separately.

The largest nerve fibers within a left or right vagus nerve are approximately 20 m in diameter and are heavily myelinated whereas only the smallest nerve fibers of less than about 1 m in diameter are completely unmyelinated. When the distal part of a nerve is electrically stimulated a compound action potential may be recorded by an electrode located more proximally. A compound action potential contains several peaks or waves of activity that represent the summated response of multiple fibers having similar conduction velocities. The waves in a compound action potential represent different types of nerve fibers that are classified into corresponding functional categories with approximate diameters as follows A alpha fibers afferent or efferent fibers 12 20 m diameter A beta fibers afferent or efferent fibers 5 12 m A gamma fibers efferent fibers 3 7 m A delta fibers afferent fibers 2 5 m B fibers 1 3 m and C fibers unmyelinated 0.4 1.2 m . The diameters of group A and group B fibers include the thickness of the myelin sheaths. It is understood that the anatomy of the vagus nerve is developing in newborns and infants which accounts in part for the maturation of autonomic reflexes. Accordingly it is also understood that the parameters of vagus nerve stimulation in the present invention are chosen in such a way as to account for this age related maturation PEREYRA P M Zhang W Schmidt M Becker L E.

The vagus or vagal afferent nerve fibers arise from cell bodies located in the vagal sensory ganglia. These ganglia take the form of swellings found in the cervical aspect of the vagus nerve just caudal to the skull. There are two such ganglia termed the inferior and superior vagal ganglia. They are also called the nodose and jugular ganglia respectively See . The jugular superior ganglion is a small ganglion on the vagus nerve just as it passes through the jugular foramen at the base of the skull. The nodose inferior ganglion is a ganglion on the vagus nerve located in the height of the transverse process of the first cervical vertebra.

Vagal afferents traverse the brainstem in the solitary tract with some eighty percent of the terminating synapses being located in the nucleus of the tractus solitarius or nucleus tractus solitarii nucleus tractus solitarius or NTS see . The NTS projects to a wide variety of structures in the central nervous system such as the amygdala raphe nuclei periaqueductal gray nucleus paragigantocellurlais olfactory tubercule locus ceruleus nucleus ambiguus and the hypothalamus.

The nucleus tractus solitarius neuroanatomic neurochemical and functional aspects. Arch Int Physiol Biochim Biophys 99 5 1991 A3 A52 . Such central projections are discussed below in connection with the interoception and resting state neural networks.

With regard to vagal efferent nerve fibers two vagal components have evolved in the brainstem to regulate peripheral parasympathetic functions. The dorsal vagal complex consisting of the dorsal motor nucleus and its connections see controls parasympathetic function primarily below the level of the diaphragm e.g. gut and its enterochromaffin cells while the ventral vagal complex comprised of nucleus ambiguus and nucleus retrofacial controls functions primarily above the diaphragm in organs such as the heart thymus and lungs as well as other glands and tissues of the neck and upper chest and specialized muscles such as those of the esophageal complex. For example the cell bodies for the preganglionic parasympathetic vagal neurons that innervate the heart reside in the nucleus ambiguus which is relevant to potential cardiovascular side effects that may be produced by vagus nerve stimulation.

With the foregoing as preliminary information about the vagus nerve the topics that are presented below in connection with the disclosure of the invention include the following 1 Overview of physiological mechanisms through which the disclosed vagus nerve stimulation methods may be used to modulate the neuronal circuitry of individuals at risk for or who have experienced a stroke and or transient ischemic attack 2 Description of Applicant s magnetic and electrode based nerve stimulating devices describing in particular the electrical waveform used to stimulate a vagus nerve 3 Preferred embodiments of the magnetic stimulator 4 Preferred embodiments of the electrode based stimulator 5 Application of the stimulators to the neck of the patient 6 Use of the devices with feedback and feedforward to improve treatment of individual patients.

Overview of physiological mechanisms through which the disclosed vagus nerve stimulation methods may be used to modulate the neuronal circuitry of individuals individuals at risk for or who have suffered a stroke and or transient ischemic attack.

We now disclose methods and devices for electrically stimulating a vagus nerve noninvasively in order to provide medical treatment to an individual at risk for or who has suffered a stroke and or transient ischemic attack. The disclosed methods and devices are an extension of methods and devices that have been developed for the treatment of other conditions as follows. Non invasive stimulation of the cervical vagus nerve nVNS is a novel technology for treating various central nervous system disorders primarily by stimulating specific afferent fibers of the vagus nerve to modulate brain function. This technology has been demonstrated in animal and human studies to treat a wide range of central nervous system disorders including headache chronic and acute cluster and migraine epilepsy bronchoconstriction anxiety disorders depression rhinitis fibromyalgia irritable bowel syndrome stroke traumatic brain injury PTSD Alzheimer s disease autism and others. Applicants have discovered that a two minute stimulation has effects that may last up to 8 hours or longer depending on the type and severity of indication.

Broadly speaking applicant has determined that there are three components to the effects of nVNS on the brain. The strongest effect occurs during the two minute stimulation and results in significant changes in brain function that can be clearly seen as acute changes in autonomic function e.g. measured using pupillometry heart rate variability galvanic skin response or evoked potential and activation and inhibition of various brain regions as shown in fMRI imaging studies. The second effect of moderate intensity lasts for 15 to 180 minutes after stimulation. Animal studies have shown changes in neurotransmitter levels in various parts of the brain that persist for several hours. The third effect of mild intensity lasts up to 8 hours and is responsible for the long lasting alleviation of symptoms seen clinically and for example in animal models of migraine headache.

Thus depending on the medical indication whether it is a chronic or acute treatment and the natural history of the disease different treatment protocols may be used. In particular applicant has discovered that it is not necessary to continuously stimulate the vagus nerve or to in order to provide clinically efficacious benefits to patients with certain disorders. The term continuously stimulate as defined herein means stimulation that follows a certain On Off pattern continuously 24 hours day. For example existing implantable vagal nerve stimulators continuously stimulate the vagus nerve with a pattern of 30 seconds ON 5 minutes OFF or the like for 24 hours day and seven days week. Applicant has determined that this continuous stimulation is not necessary to provide the desired clinical benefit for many disorders. For example in the treatment of acute migraine attacks the treatment paradigm may comprise two minutes of stimulation at the onset of pain followed by another two minute stimulation 15 minutes later. For epilepsy three 2 minute stimulations three times per day appear to be optimal. Sometimes multiple consecutive two minute stimulations are required. Thus the initial treatment protocol corresponds to what may be optimum for the population of patients at large for a given condition. However the treatment may then be modified on an individualized basis depending on the response of each particular patient.

The present invention contemplates three types of interventions involving stimulation of a vagus nerve prophylactic acute and compensatory rehabilitative . Among these the acute treatment involves the fewest administrations of vagus nerve stimulations which begin upon the appearance of symptoms. It is intended primarily to enlist and engage the autonomic nervous system to inhibit excitatory neurotransmissions that accompany the symptoms. The prophylactic treatment resembles the acute treatment in the sense that it is administered as though acute symptoms had just occurred even though they have not and is repeated at regular intervals as though the symptoms were reoccurring even though they are not . The rehabilitative or compensatory treatments on the other hand seek to promote long term adjustments in the central nervous system compensating for deficiencies that arose as the result of the patient s disease by making new neural circuits.

A vagus nerve stimulation treatment according to the present invention is conducted for continuous period of thirty seconds to five minutes preferably about 90 seconds to about three minutes and more preferably about two minutes each defined as a single dose . After a dose has been completed the therapy is stopped for a period of time depending on the treatment as described below . For prophylactic treatments such as a treatment to avert a stroke or transient ischemic attack the therapy preferably comprises multiple doses day over a period of time that may last from one week to a number of years. In certain embodiments the treatment will comprise multiple doses at predetermined times during the day and or at predetermined intervals throughout the day. In exemplary embodiments the treatment comprises one of the following 1 3 doses day at predetermined intervals or times 2 two doses either consecutively or separated by 5 min at predetermined intervals or times preferably two or three times day 3 3 doses either consecutively or separated by 5 min again at predetermined intervals or times such as 2 or 3 times day or 4 1 3 doses either consecutively or separated by 5 min 4 6 times per day. Initiation of a treatment may begin when an imminent stroke or TIA is forecasted or in a risk factor reduction program it may be performed throughout the day beginning after the patient arises in the morning.

In an exemplary embodiment each treatment session comprises 1 3 doses administered to the patient either consecutively or separated by 5 minutes. The treatment sessions are administered every 15 30 60 or 120 minutes during the day such that the patient could receive 2 doses every hour throughout a 24 hour day.

For certain disorders the time of day can be more important than the time interval between treatments. For example the locus correleus has periods of time during a 24 hour day wherein it has inactive periods and active periods. Typically the inactive periods can occur in the late afternoon or in the middle of the night when the patient is asleep. It is during the inactive periods that the levels of inhibitiory neurotransmitters in the brain that are generated by the locus correleus are reduced. This may have an impact on certain disorders. For example patients suffering from migraines or cluster headaches often receive these headaches after an inactive period of the locus correleus. For these types of disorders the prophylactic treatment is optimal during the inactive periods such that the amounts of inhibitory neurotransmitters in the brain can remain at a higher enough level to mitigate or abort an acute attack of the disorder.

In these embodiments the prophlatic treatment may comprise multiple doses day timed for periods of inactivity of the locus correleus. In one embodiment a treatment according to the present invention comprises one or more doses administered 2 3 times per day or 2 3 treatment sessions per day. The treatment sessions preferably occur during the late afternoon or late evening in the middle of the night and again in the morning when the patient wakes up. In an exemplary embodiment each treatment session comprises 1 4 doses preferably 2 3 doses with each dose lasting for about 90 seconds to about three minutes.

For other disorders the intervals between treatment sessions may be the most important as applicant has determined that stimulation of the vagus nerve can have a prolonged effect on the inhibitor neurotransmitters levels in the brain e.g. at least one hour up to 3 hours and sometimes up to 8 hours. In one embodiment a treatment according to the present invention comprises one or more doses i.e. treatment sessions administered at intervals during a 24 hour period. In a preferred embodiment there are 1 5 such treatment sessions preferably 2 4 treatment sessions. Each treatment session preferably comprises 1 3 doses each lasting between about 60 seconds to about three minutes preferably about 90 seconds to about 150 seconds more preferably about 2 minutes.

For an acute treatment such as treatment of acute stroke the therapy according to the present invention may comprise one or more embodiments 1 1 dose at the onset of symptoms 2 1 dose at the onset of symptoms followed by another dose at 5 15 min or 3 1 dose every 15 minutes to 1 hour at the onset of symptoms until the acute attack has been mitigated or aborted. In these embodiments each dose preferably last between about 60 seconds to about three minutes preferably about 90 seconds to about 150 seconds more preferably about 2 minutes.

For long term treatment of an acute insult such as one that occurs during the rehabilitation of a stroke patient the therapy may consist of 1 3 treatments day 2 2 treatments either consecutively or separated by 5 min 3 day 3 3 treatments either consecutively or separated by 5 min 2 day 4 2 or 3 treatments either consecutively or separated by 5 min up to 10 day or 5 1 2 or 3 treatments either consecutively or separated by 5 min every 15 30 60 or 120 min.

For all of the treatments listed above one may alternate treatment between left and right sides or in the case of stroke or migraine that occur in particular brain hemispheres one may treat ipsilateral or contralateral to the stroke hemisphere or headache side respectively. Or for a single treatment one may treat one minute on one side followed by one minute on the opposite side. Variations of these treatment paradigms may be chosen on a patient by patient basis. However it is understood that parameters of the stimulation protocol may be varied in response to heterogeneity in the symptoms of patients. Different stimulation parameters may also be selected as the course of the patient s condition changes. In preferred embodiments the disclosed methods and devices do not produce clinically significant side effects such as agitation or anxiety or changes in heart rate or blood pressure.

The prophylactic treatments may be most effective when the patient is in a prodromal high risk bistable state. In that state the patient is simultaneously able to remain normal or exhibit symptoms and the selection between normal and symptomatic states depends on the amplification of fluctuations by physiological feedback networks. For example a thrombus may exist in either a gel or fluid phase with the feedback amplification of fluctuations driving the change of phase and or the volume of the gel phase. Thus a thrombus may form or not depending on the nonlinear dynamics exhibited by the network of enzymes involved in clot formation as influenced by blood flow and inflammation that may be modulated by vagus nerve stimulation PANTELEEV M A Balandina A N Lipets E N Ovanesov M V Ataullakhanov F I. Task oriented modular decomposition of biological networks trigger mechanism in blood coagulation. Biophys J 98 9 2010 1751 1761 Alexey M SHIBEKO Ekaterina S Lobanova Mikhail A Panteleev and Fazoil I Ataullakhanov. Blood flow controls coagulation onset via the positive feedback of factor VII activation by factor Xa. BMC Syst Biol 2010 4 2010 5 pp. 1 12 . Consequently the mechanisms of vagus nerve stimulation treatment during prophylaxis for a stroke are generally different than what occurs during an acute treatment when the stimulation inhibits excitatory neurotransmission that follows the onset of ischemia that is already caused by the thrombus. Nevertheless the prophylactic treatment may also inhibit excitatory neurotransmission so as to limit the excitation that would eventually occur upon formation of a thrombus and the acute treatment may prevent the formation of another thrombus.

The circuits involved in such inhibition are illustrated in . Excitatory nerves within the dorsal vagal complex generally use glutamate as their neurotransmitter. To inhibit neurotransmission within the dorsal vagal complex the present invention makes use of the bidirectional connections that the nucleus of the solitary tract NTS has with structures that produce inhibitory neurotransmitters or it makes use of connections that the NTS has with the hypothalamus which in turn projects to structures that produce inhibitory neurotransmitters. The inhibition is produced as the result of the stimulation waveforms that are described below. Thus acting in opposition to glutamate mediated activation by the NTS of the area postrema and dorsal motor nucleus are GABA and or serotonin and or norepinephrine from the periaqueductal gray raphe nucei and locus coeruleus respectively. shows how those excitatory and inhibitory influences combine to modulate the output of the dorsal motor nucleus. Similar influences combine within the NTS itself and the combined inhibitory influences on the NTS and dorsal motor nucleus produce a general inhibitory effect.

The activation of inhibitory circuits in the periaqueductal gray raphe nucei and locus coeruleus by the hypothalamus or NTS may also cause circuits connecting each of these structures to modulate one another. Thus the periaqueductal gray communicates with the raphe nuclei and with the locus coeruleus and the locus coeruleus communicates with the raphe nuclei as shown in PUDOVKINA O L Cremers T I Westerink B H. The interaction between the locus coeruleus and dorsal raphe nucleus studied with dual probe microdialysis. Eur J Pharmacol 7 2002 445 1 2 37 42. REICHLING D B Basbaum A I. Collateralization of periaqueductal gray neurons to forebrain or diencephalon and to the medullary nucleus raphe magnus in the rat. Neuroscience 42 1 1991 183 200 BEHBEHANI M M. The role of acetylcholine in the function of the nucleus raphe magnus and in the interaction of this nucleus with the periaqueductal gray. Brain Res 252 2 1982 299 307 . The periaqueductal gray raphe nucei and locus coeruleus also project to many other sites within the brain including those that would be excited during ischemia. Therefore in this aspect of the invention vagus nerve stimulation during acute stroke or transient ischemic attack has a general neuroprotective inhibitory effect via its activation of the periaqueductal gray raphe nucei and locus coeruleus.

In particular the vagus nerve stimulation may be neuroprotective to a part of the brain known as the insula also known as the insulary cortex insular cortex or insular lobe and its connections with the anterior cingulate cortex ACC . Neural circuits leading from the vagus nerve to the insula and ACC are shown in . Protection of the insula is particularly important for stroke patients because damage to the insula is known to cause symptoms that are typical in stroke patients involving motor control hand and eye motor movement motor learning swallowing speech articulation the capacity for long and complex spoken sentences sensation and autonomic functions ANDERSON T J Jenkins I H Brooks D J Hawken M B Frackowiak R S Kennard C.

Devices of the invention that are used to stimulate a vagus nerve will now be described. Either a magnetic stimulation device or an electrode based device may be used for that purpose. is a schematic diagram of Applicant s magnetic nerve stimulating modulating device for delivering impulses of energy to nerves for the treatment of medical conditions. As shown device may include an impulse generator a power source coupled to the impulse generator a control unit in communication with the impulse generator and coupled to the power source and a magnetic stimulator coil coupled via wires to impulse generator coil . The stimulator coil is toroidal in shape due to its winding around a toroid of core material.

Although the magnetic stimulator coil is shown in to be a single coil in practice the coil may also comprise two or more distinct coils each of which is connected in series or in parallel to the impulse generator . Thus the coil that is shown in represents all the magnetic stimulator coils of the device collectively. In a preferred embodiment that is discussed below coil actually contains two coils that may be connected either in series or in parallel to the impulse generator .

The item labeled in as is a volume surrounding the coil that is filled with electrically conducting medium. As shown the medium not only encloses the magnetic stimulator coil but is also deformable such that it is form fitting when applied to the surface of the body. Thus the sinuousness or curvature shown at the outer surface of the electrically conducting medium corresponds also to sinuousness or curvature on the surface of the body against which the conducting medium is applied so as to make the medium and body surface contiguous. As time varying electrical current is passed through the coil a magnetic field is produced but because the coil winding is toroidal the magnetic field is spatially restricted to the interior of the toroid. An electric field and eddy currents are also produced. The electric field extends beyond the toroidal space and into the patient s body causing electrical currents and stimulation within the patient. The volume is electrically connected to the patient at a target skin surface in order to significantly reduce the current passed through the coil that is needed to accomplish stimulation of the patient s nerve or tissue. In a preferred embodiment of the magnetic stimulator that is discussed below the conducting medium with which the coil is in contact need not completely surround the toroid.

The design of the magnetic stimulator which is also adapted herein for use with surface electrodes makes it possible to shape the electric field that is used to selectively stimulate a relatively deep nerve such as a vagus nerve in the patient s neck. Furthermore the design produces significantly less pain or discomfort if any to a patient at the site of stimulation on the skin than stimulator devices that are currently known in the art. Conversely for a given amount of pain or discomfort on the part of the patient e.g. the threshold at which such discomfort or pain begins the design achieves a greater depth of penetration of the stimulus under the skin.

An alternate embodiment of the present invention is shown in which is a schematic diagram of an electrode based nerve stimulating modulating device for delivering impulses of energy to nerves for the treatment of medical conditions. As shown device may include an impulse generator a power source coupled to the impulse generator a control unit in communication with the impulse generator and coupled to the power source and electrodes coupled via wires to impulse generator . In a preferred embodiment the same impulse generator power source and control unit may be used for either the magnetic stimulator or the electrode based stimulator allowing the user to change parameter settings depending on whether coils or the electrodes are attached.

Although a pair of electrodes is shown in in practice the electrodes may also comprise three or more distinct electrode elements each of which is connected in series or in parallel to the impulse generator . Thus the electrodes that are shown in represent all electrodes of the device collectively.

The item labeled in as is a volume contiguous with an electrode that is filled with electrically conducting medium. As described below in connection with particular embodiments of the invention conducting medium in which the electrode is embedded need not completely surround an electrode. As also described below in connection with a preferred embodiment the volume is electrically connected to the patient at a target skin surface in order to shape the current density passed through an electrode that is needed to accomplish stimulation of the patient s nerve or tissue. The electrical connection to the patient s skin surface is through an interface . In one embodiment the interface is made of an electrically insulating dielectric material such as a thin sheet of Mylar. In that case electrical coupling of the stimulator to the patient is capacitive. In other embodiments the interface comprises electrically conducting material such as the electrically conducting medium itself or an electrically conducting or permeable membrane. In that case electrical coupling of the stimulator to the patient is ohmic. As shown the interface may be deformable such that it is form fitting when applied to the surface of the body. Thus the sinuousness or curvature shown at the outer surface of the interface corresponds also to sinuousness or curvature on the surface of the body against which the interface is applied so as to make the interface and body surface contiguous.

The control unit controls the impulse generator to generate a signal for each of the device s coils or electrodes. The signals are selected to be suitable for amelioration of a particular medical condition when the signals are applied non invasively to a target nerve or tissue via the coil or electrodes . It is noted that nerve stimulating modulating device or may be referred to by its function as a pulse generator. Patent application publications US2005 0075701 and US2005 0075702 both to SHAFER contain descriptions of pulse generators that may be applicable to the present invention. By way of example a pulse generator is also commercially available such as Agilent 33522A Function Arbitrary Waveform Generator Agilent Technologies Inc. 5301 Stevens Creek Blvd Santa Clara Calif. 95051.

The control unit may also comprise a general purpose computer comprising one or more CPU computer memories for the storage of executable computer programs including the system s operating system and the storage and retrieval of data disk storage devices communication devices such as serial and USB ports for accepting external signals from the system s keyboard computer mouse and touchscreen as well as any externally supplied physiological signals see analog to digital converters for digitizing externally supplied analog signals see communication devices for the transmission and receipt of data to and from external devices such as printers and modems that comprise part of the system hardware for generating the display of information on monitors that comprise part of the system and busses to interconnect the above mentioned components. Thus the user may operate the system by typing instructions for the control unit at a device such as a keyboard and view the results on a device such as the system s computer monitor or direct the results to a printer modem and or storage disk. Control of the system may be based upon feedback measured from externally supplied physiological or environmental signals. Alternatively the control unit may have a compact and simple structure for example wherein the user may operate the system using only an on off switch and power control wheel or knob.

Parameters for the nerve or tissue stimulation include power level frequency and train duration or pulse number . The stimulation characteristics of each pulse such as depth of penetration strength and selectivity depend on the rise time and peak electrical energy transferred to the electrodes or coils as well as the spatial distribution of the electric field that is produced by the electrodes or coils. The rise time and peak energy are governed by the electrical characteristics of the stimulator and electrodes or coils as well as by the anatomy of the region of current flow within the patient. In one embodiment of the invention pulse parameters are set in such as way as to account for the detailed anatomy surrounding the nerve that is being stimulated Bartosz SAWICKI Robert Szmuro Przemysaw Ponecki Jacek Starzy ski Stanisaw Wincenciak Andrzej Rysz. Mathematical Modelling of Vagus Nerve Stimulation. pp. 92 97 in Krawczyk A. Electromagnetic Field Health and Environment Proceedings of EHE 07. Amsterdam 105 Press 2008 . Pulses may be monophasic biphasic or polyphasic. Embodiments of the invention include those that are fixed frequency where each pulse in a train has the same inter stimulus interval and those that have modulated frequency where the intervals between each pulse in a train can be varied.

In addition or as an alternative to the devices to implement the modulation unit for producing the electrical voltage current profile of the stimulating blocking and or modulating impulse to the electrodes or coils the device disclosed in patent publication No. US2005 0216062 may be employed. That patent publication discloses a multifunctional electrical stimulation ES system adapted to yield output signals for effecting electromagnetic or other forms of electrical stimulation for a broad spectrum of different biological and biomedical applications which produce an electric field pulse in order to non invasively stimulate nerves. The system includes an ES signal stage having a selector coupled to a plurality of different signal generators each producing a signal having a distinct shape such as a sine wave a square or a saw tooth wave or simple or complex pulse the parameters of which are adjustable in regard to amplitude duration repetition rate and other variables. Examples of the signals that may be generated by such a system are described in a publication by LIBOFF A. R. LIBOFF. Signal shapes in electromagnetic therapies a primer. pp. 17 37 in Bioelectromagnetic Medicine Paul J. Rosch and Marko S. Markov eds. . New York Marcel Dekker 2004 . The signal from the selected generator in the ES stage is fed to at least one output stage where it is processed to produce a high or low voltage or current output of a desired polarity whereby the output stage is capable of yielding an electrical stimulation signal appropriate for its intended application. Also included in the system is a measuring stage which measures and displays the electrical stimulation signal operating on the substance being treated as well as the outputs of various sensors which sense prevailing conditions prevailing in this substance whereby the user of the system can manually adjust the signal or have it automatically adjusted by feedback to provide an electrical stimulation signal of whatever type the user wishes who can then observe the effect of this signal on a substance being treated.

The stimulating and or modulating impulse signal preferably has a frequency an amplitude a duty cycle a pulse width a pulse shape etc. selected to influence the therapeutic result namely stimulating and or modulating some or all of the transmission of the selected nerve. For example the frequency may be about 1 Hz or greater such as between about 15 Hz to about 100 Hz preferably between about 15 50 Hz and more preferably between about 15 35 Hz. In an exemplary embodiment the frequency is about 25 Hz. The modulation signal may have a pulse width selected to influence the therapeutic result such as about 1 microseconds to about 1000 microseconds preferably about 100 400 microseconds and more preferably about 200 400 microseconds. For example the electric field induced or produced by the device within tissue in the vicinity of a nerve may be about 5 to about 600 V m preferably less than about 100 V m and even more preferably less than about 30 V m. The gradient of the electric field may be greater than about 2 V m mm. More generally the stimulation device produces an electric field in the vicinity of the nerve that is sufficient to cause the nerve to depolarize and reach a threshold for action potential propagation which is about 8 V m at 1000 Hz. The modulation signal may have a peak voltage amplitude selected to influence the therapeutic result such as about 0.2 volts or greater such as about 0.2 volts to about 40 volts preferably between about 1 20 volts and more preferably between about 2 12 volts.

An objective of the disclosed stimulators is to provide both nerve fiber selectivity and spatial selectivity. Spatial selectivity may be achieved in part through the design of the electrode or coil configuration and nerve fiber selectivity may be achieved in part through the design of the stimulus waveform but designs for the two types of selectivity are intertwined. This is because for example a waveform may selectively stimulate only one of two nerves whether they lie close to one another or not obviating the need to focus the stimulating signal onto only one of the nerves GRILL W and Mortimer J T. Stimulus waveforms for selective neural stimulation. IEEE Eng. Med. Biol. 14 1995 375 385 . These methods complement others that are used to achieve selective nerve stimulation such as the use of local anesthetic application of pressure inducement of ischemia cooling use of ultrasound graded increases in stimulus intensity exploiting the absolute refractory period of axons and the application of stimulus blocks John E. SWETT and Charles M. Bourassa. Electrical stimulation of peripheral nerve. In Electrical Stimulation Research Techniques Michael M. Patterson and Raymond P. Kesner eds. Academic Press. New York 1981 pp. 243 295 .

To date the selection of stimulation waveform parameters for nerve stimulation has been highly empirical in which the parameters are varied about some initially successful set of parameters in an effort to find an improved set of parameters for each patient. A more efficient approach to selecting stimulation parameters might be to select a stimulation waveform that mimics electrical activity in the anatomical regions that one is attempting stimulate indirectly in an effort to entrain the naturally occurring electrical waveform as suggested in U.S. Pat. No. 6 234 953 entitled Electrotherapy device using low frequency magnetic pulses to THOMAS et al. and application number US20090299435 entitled Systems and methods for enhancing or affecting neural stimulation efficiency and or efficacy to GLINER et al. One may also vary stimulation parameters iteratively in search of an optimal setting U.S. Pat. No. 7 869 885 entitled Threshold optimization for tissue stimulation therapy to BEGNAUD et al . However some stimulation waveforms such as those described herein are discovered by trial and error and then deliberately improved upon.

Invasive nerve stimulation typically uses square wave pulse signals. However Applicant found that square waveforms are not ideal for non invasive stimulation as they produce excessive pain. Prepulses and similar waveform modifications have been suggested as methods to improve selectivity of nerve stimulation waveforms but Applicant did not find them ideal Aleksandra VUCKOVIC Marco Tosato and Johannes J.

Applicant also found that stimulation waveforms consisting of bursts of square pulses are not ideal for non invasive stimulation M. I. JOHNSON C. H. Ashton D. R. Bousfield and J. W. Thompson. Analgesic effects of different pulse patterns of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation on cold induced pain in normal subjects. Journal of Psychosomatic Research 35 1991 313 321 U.S. Pat. No. 7 734 340 entitled Stimulation design for neuromodulation to De Ridder . However bursts of sinusoidal pulses are a preferred stimulation waveform as shown in . As seen there individual sinusoidal pulses have a period of and a burst consists of N such pulses. This is followed by a period with no signal the inter burst period . The pattern of a burst followed by silent inter burst period repeats itself with a period of T. For example the sinusoidal period may be between about 50 1000 microseconds equivalent to about 1 20 KHz preferably between about 100 400 microseconds equivalent to about 2.5 10 KHz more preferably about 133 400 microseconds equivalent to about 2.5 7.5 KHZ and even more preferably about 200 microseconds equivalent to about 5 KHz the number of pulses per burst may be N 1 20 preferably about 2 10 and more preferably about 5 and the whole pattern of burst followed by silent inter burst period may have a period T comparable to about 10 100 Hz preferably about 15 50 Hz more preferably about 25 35 Hz and even more preferably about 25 Hz a much smaller value of T is shown in to make the bursts discernable . When these exemplary values are used for T and the waveform contains significant Fourier components at higher frequencies 1 200 microseconds 5000 sec as compared with those contained in transcutaneous nerve stimulation waveforms as currently practiced.

Applicant is unaware of such a waveform having been used with vagus nerve stimulation but a similar waveform has been used to stimulate muscle as a means of increasing muscle strength in elite athletes. However for the muscle strengthening application the currents used 200 mA may be very painful and two orders of magnitude larger than what are disclosed herein. Furthermore the signal used for muscle strengthening may be other than sinusoidal e.g. triangular and the parameters N and T may also be dissimilar from the values exemplified above A. DELITTO M.

High frequency electrical stimulation is also known in the treatment of back pain at the spine Patent application US20120197369 entitled Selective high frequency spinal cord modulation for inhibiting pain with reduced side effects and associated systems and methods to ALATARIS et al.

Those methods involve high frequency modulation in the range of from about 1.5 KHz to about 50 KHz which is applied to the patient s spinal cord region. However such methods are different from the present invention because for example they is invasive they do not involve a bursting waveform as in the present invention they necessarily involve A delta and C nerve fibers and the pain that those fibers produce whereas the present invention does not they may involve a conduction block applied at the dorsal root level whereas the present invention may stimulate action potentials without blocking of such action potentials and or they involve an increased ability of high frequency modulation to penetrate through the cerebral spinal fluid which is not relevant to the present invention. In fact a likely explanation for the reduced back pain that is produced by their use of frequencies from 10 to 50 KHz is that the applied electrical stimulus at those frequencies causes permanent damage to the pain causing nerves whereas the present invention involves only reversible effects LEE R C Zhang D Hannig J.

Consider now which nerve fibers may be stimulated by the non invasive vagus nerve stimulation. The waveform disclosed in contains significant Fourier components at high frequencies e.g. 1 200 microseconds 5000 sec even if the waveform also has components at lower frequencies e.g. 25 sec . Transcutaneously A beta A delta and C fibers are typically excited at 2000 Hz 250 Hz and 5 Hz respectively i.e. the 2000 Hz stimulus is described as being specific for measuring the response of A beta fibers the 250 Hz for A delta fibers and the 5 Hz for type C fibers George D. BAQUIS et al. TECHNOLOGY REVIEW THE NEUROMETER CURRENT PERCEPTION THRESHOLD CPT . Muscle Nerve 22 Supplement 8 1999 S247 S259 . Therefore the high frequency component of the noninvasive stimulation waveform will preferentially stimulate the A alpha and A beta fibers and the C fibers will be largely unstimulated.

However the threshold for activation of fiber types also depends on the amplitude of the stimulation and for a given stimulation frequency the threshold increases as the fiber size decreases. The threshold for generating an action potential in nerve fibers that are impaled with electrodes is traditionally described by Lapicque or Weiss equations which describe how together the width and amplitude of stimulus pulses determine the threshold along with parameters that characterize the fiber the chronaxy and rheobase . For nerve fibers that are stimulated by electric fields that are applied externally to the fiber as is the case here characterizing the threshold as a function of pulse amplitude and frequency is more complicated which ordinarily involves the numerical solution of model differential equations or a case by case experimental evaluation David BOINAGROV Jim Loudin and Daniel Palanker.

For example REILLY describes a model the spatially extended nonlinear nodal model or SENN model that may be used to calculate minimum stimulus thresholds for nerve fibers having different diameters J. Patrick REILLY. Electrical models for neural excitation studies. Johns Hopkins APL Technical Digest 9 1 1988 44 59 . According to REILLY s analysis the minimum threshold for excitation of myelinated A fibers is 6.2 V m for a 20 m diameter fiber 12.3 V m for a 10 m fiber and 24.6 V m for a 5 m diameter fiber assuming a pulse width that is within the contemplated range of the present invention 1 ms . It is understood that these thresholds may differ slightly from those produced by the waveform of the present invention as illustrated by REILLY s figures for example because the present invention prefers to use sinusoidal rather than square pulses. Thresholds for B and C fibers are respectively 2 to 3 and 10 to 100 times greater than those for A fibers Mark A. CASTORO Paul B. Yoo Juan G. Hincapie Jason J. Hamann Stephen B. Ruble Patrick D. Wolf Warren M. Grill. Excitation properties of the right cervical vagus nerve in adult dogs. Experimental Neurology 227 2011 62 68 . If we assume an average A fiber threshold of 15 V m then B fibers would have thresholds of 30 to 45 V m and C fibers would have thresholds of 150 to 1500 V m. The present invention produces electric fields at the vagus nerve in the range of about 6 to about 100 V m which is therefore generally sufficient to excite all myelinated A and B fibers but not the unmyelinated C fibers. In contrast invasive vagus nerve stimulators that have been used for the treatment of epilepsy have been reported to excite C fibers in some patients EVANS M S Verma Ahuja S Naritoku D K Espinosa J A. Intraoperative human vagus nerve compound action potentials. Acta Neurol Scand 110 2004 232 238 .

It is understood that although devices of the present invention may stimulate A and B nerve fibers in practice they may also be used so as not to stimulate the largest A fibers A delta and B fibers. In particular if the stimulator amplitude has been increased to the point at which unwanted side effects begin to occur the operator of the device may simply reduce the amplitude to avoid those effects. For example vagal efferent fibers responsible for bronchoconstriction have been observed to have conduction velocities in the range of those of B fibers. In those experiments bronchoconstriction was only produced when B fibers were activated and became maximal before C fibers had been recruited R. M. McALLEN and K. M. Spyer. Two types of vagal preganglionic motoneurones projecting to the heart and lungs. J. Physiol. 282 1978 353 364 . Because proper stimulation with the disclosed devices does not result in the side effect of bronchoconstriction evidently the bronchoconstrictive B fibers are possibly not being activated when the amplitude is properly set. Also the absence of bradycardia or prolongation of PR interval suggests that cardiac efferent B fibers are not stimulated. Similarly A delta afferents may behave physiologically like C fibers. Because stimulation with the disclosed devices does not produce nociceptive effects that would be produced by jugular A delta fibers or C fibers evidently the A delta fibers may not be stimulated when the amplitude is properly set.

To summarize the foregoing discussion the delivery of an impulse of energy sufficient to stimulate and or modulate transmission of signals of vagus nerve fibers will result in the inhibition of excitatory neurotramsmitters and to a more normal activity within higher centers of the brain many of which are components of resting state networks. The most likely mechanisms do not involve the stimulation of C fibers and the stimulation of afferent nerve fibers activates neural pathways causes the release of norepinephrine and or serotonin and or GABA.

The use of feedback to generate the modulation signal may result in a signal that is not periodic particularly if the feedback is produced from sensors that measure naturally occurring time varying aperiodic physiological signals from the patient see . In fact the absence of significant fluctuation in naturally occurring physiological signals from a patient is ordinarily considered to be an indication that the patient is in ill health. This is because a pathological control system that regulates the patient s physiological variables may have become trapped around only one of two or more possible steady states and is therefore unable to respond normally to external and internal stresses. Accordingly even if feedback is not used to generate the modulation signal it may be useful to artificially modulate the signal in an aperiodic fashion in such a way as to simulate fluctuations that would occur naturally in a healthy individual. Thus the noisy modulation of the stimulation signal may cause a pathological physiological control system to be reset or undergo a non linear phase transition through a mechanism known as stochastic resonance B.

So in one embodiment of the present invention the modulation signal with or without feedback will stimulate the selected nerve fibers in such a way that one or more of the stimulation parameters power frequency and others mentioned herein are varied by sampling a statistical distribution having a mean corresponding to a selected or to a most recent running averaged value of the parameter and then setting the value of the parameter to the randomly sampled value. The sampled statistical distributions will comprise Gaussian and 1 f obtained from recorded naturally occurring random time series or by calculated formula. Parameter values will be so changed periodically or at time intervals that are themselves selected randomly by sampling another statistical distribution having a selected mean and coefficient of variation where the sampled distributions comprise Gaussian and exponential obtained from recorded naturally occurring random time series or by calculated formula.

In another embodiment devices in accordance with the present invention are provided in a pacemaker type form in which electrical impulses 410 are generated to a selected region of the nerve by a stimulator device on an intermittent basis to create in the patient a lower reactivity of the nerve.

A preferred embodiment of magnetic stimulator coil comprises a toroidal winding around a core consisting of high permeability material e.g. Supermendur embedded in an electrically conducting medium. Toroidal coils with high permeability cores have been theoretically shown to greatly reduce the currents required for transcranial TMS and other forms of magnetic stimulation but only if the toroids are embedded in a conducting medium and placed against tissue with no air interface Rafael CARBUNARU and Dominique M. Durand. Toroidal coil models for transcutaneous magnetic stimulation of nerves. IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering 48 4 2001 434 441 Rafael Carbunaru FAIERSTEIN Coil Designs for Localized and Efficient Magnetic Stimulation of the Nervous System. Ph.D. Dissertation Department of Biomedical Engineering Case Western Reserve May 1999 UMI Microform Number 9940153 UMI Company Ann Arbor Mich. .

Although Carbunaru and Durand demonstrated that it is possible to electrically stimulate a patient transcutaneously with such a device they made no attempt to develop the device in such a way as to generally shape the electric field that is to stimulate the nerve. In particular the electric fields that may be produced by their device are limited to those that are radially symmetric at any given depth of stimulation into the patient i.e two variables z and rho are used to specify location of the field not x y and z . This is a significant limitation and it results in a deficiency that was noted in of their publication at large depths of stimulation the threshold current in the device s coil for long axons is larger than the saturation current of the coil. Stimulation of those axons is only possible at low threshold points such as bending sites or tissue conductivity inhomogeneities . Thus for their device varying the parameters that they considered in order to increase the electric field or its gradient in the vicinity of a nerve may come at the expense of limiting the field s physiological effectiveness such that the spatial extent of the field of stimulation may be insufficient to modulate the target nerve s function. Yet such long axons are precisely what we may wish to stimulate in therapeutic interventions such as the ones disclosed herein.

Accordingly it is an objective of the present invention to shape an elongated electric field of effect that can be oriented parallel to such a long nerve. The term shape an electric field as used herein means to create an electric field or its gradient that is generally not radially symmetric at a given depth of stimulation in the patient especially a field that is characterized as being elongated or finger like and especially also a field in which the magnitude of the field in some direction may exhibit more than one spatial maximum i.e. may be bimodal or multimodal such that the tissue between the maxima may contain an area across which induced current flow is restricted. Shaping of the electric field refers both to the circumscribing of regions within which there is a significant electric field and to configuring the directions of the electric field within those regions. The shaping of the electric field is described in terms of the corresponding field equations in commonly assigned application US20110125203 application Ser. No. 12 964 050 entitled Magnetic stimulation devices and methods of therapy to SIMON et al. which is hereby incorporated by reference.

Thus the present invention differs from the device disclosed by CARBUNARU and Durand by deliberately shaping an electric field that is used to transcutaneously stimulate the patient. Whereas the toroid in the CARBUNARU and Durand publication was immersed in a homogeneous conducting half space this is not necessarily the case for our invention. Although our invention will generally have some continuously conducting path between the device s coil and the patient s skin the conducting medium need not totally immerse the coil and there may be insulating voids within the conducting medium. For example if the device contains two toroids conducting material may connect each of the toroids individually to the patient s skin but there may be an insulating gap from air or some other insulator between the surfaces at which conducting material connected to the individual toroids contact the patient. Furthermore the area of the conducting material that contacts the skin may be made variable by using an aperture adjusting mechanism such as an iris diaphragm. As another example if the coil is wound around core material that is laminated with the core in contact with the device s electrically conducting material then the lamination may be extended into the conducting material in such a way as to direct the induced electrical current between the laminations and towards the surface of the patient s skin. As another example the conducting material may pass through apertures in an insulated mesh before contacting the patient s skin creating thereby an array of electric field maxima.

In the dissertation cited above Carbunaru FAIERSTEIN made no attempt to use conducting material other than agar in a KCl solution and he made no attempt to devise a device that could be conveniently and safely applied to a patient s skin at an arbitrary angle without the conducting material spilling out of its container. It is therefore an objective of the present invention to disclose conducting material that can be used not only to adapt the conductivity of the conducting material and select boundary conditions thereby shaping the electric fields and currents as described above but also to create devices that can be applied practically to any surface of the body. The volume of the container containing electrically conducting medium is labeled in as . Use of the container of conducting medium allows one to generate induce electric fields in tissue and electric field gradients and electric currents that are equivalent to those generated using current magnetic stimulation devices but with about 0.001 percent to about 0.1 percent of the current conventionally applied to a magnetic stimulation coil. This allows for minimal heating of the coil s and deeper tissue stimulation. However application of the conducting medium to the surface of the patient is difficult to perform in practice because the tissue contours head arms legs neck etc. are not planar. To solve this problem in the preferred embodiment of the present invention the toroidal coil is embedded in a structure which is filled with a conducting medium having approximately the same conductivity as muscle tissue as now described.

In one embodiment of the invention the container contains holes so that the conducting material e.g. a conducting gel can make physical contact with the patient s skin through the holes. For example the conducting medium may comprise a chamber surrounding the coil filled with a conductive gel that has the approximate viscosity and mechanical consistency of gel deodorant e.g. Right Guard Clear Gel from Dial Corporation 15501 N. Dial Boulevard Scottsdale Ariz. 85260 one composition of which comprises aluminum chlorohydrate sorbitol propylene glycol polydimethylsiloxanes Silicon oil cyclomethicone ethanol SD Alcohol 40 dimethicone copolyol aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly and water . The gel which is less viscous than conventional electrode gel is maintained in the chamber with a mesh of openings at the end where the device is to contact the patient s skin. The gel does not leak out and it can be dispensed with a simple screw driven piston.

In another embodiment the container itself is made of a conducting elastomer e.g. dry carbon filled silicone elastomer and electrical contact with the patient is through the elastomer itself possibly through an additional outside coating of conducting material. In some embodiments of the invention the conducting medium may be a balloon filled with a conducting gel or conducting powders or the balloon may be constructed extensively from deformable conducting elastomers. The balloon conforms to the skin surface removing any air thus allowing for high impedance matching and conduction of large electric fields in to the tissue. A device such as that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7 591 776 entitled Magnetic stimulators and stimulating coils to PHILLIPS et al. may conform the coil itself to the contours of the body but in the preferred embodiment such a curved coil is also enclosed by a container that is filled with a conducting medium that deforms to be contiguous with the skin.

Agar can also be used as part of the conducting medium but it is not preferred because agar degrades in time is not ideal to use against skin and presents difficulties with cleaning the patient and stimulator coil. Use of agar in a 4M KCl solution as a conducting medium was mentioned in the above cited dissertation Rafael Carbunaru FAIERSTEIN Coil Designs for Localized and Efficient Magnetic Stimulation of the Nervous System. Ph.D. Dissertation Department of Biomedical Engineering Case Western Reserve May 1999 page 117 UMI Microform Number 9940153 UMI Company Ann Arbor Mich. . However that publication makes no mention or suggestion of placing the agar in a conducting elastomeric balloon or other deformable container so as to allow the conducting medium to conform to the generally non planar contours of a patient s skin having an arbitrary orientation. In fact that publication describes the coil as being submerged in a container filled with an electrically conducting solution. If the coil and container were placed on a body surface that was oriented in the vertical direction then the conducting solution would spill out making it impossible to stimulate the body surface in that orientation. In contrast the present invention is able to stimulate body surfaces having arbitrary orientation.

That dissertation also makes no mention of a dispensing method whereby the agar would be made contiguous with the patient s skin. A layer of electrolytic gel is said to have been applied between the skin and coil but the configuration was not described clearly in the publication. In particular no mention is made of the electrolytic gel being in contact with the agar.

Rather than using agar as the conducting medium the coil can instead be embedded in a conducting solution such as 1 10 NaCl contacting an electrically conducting interface to the human tissue. Such an interface is used as it allows current to flow from the coil into the tissue and supports the medium surrounded toroid so that it can be completely sealed. Thus the interface is material interposed between the conducting medium and patient s skin that allows the conducting medium e.g. saline solution to slowly leak through it allowing current to flow to the skin. Several interfaces are disclosed as follows.

One interface comprises conducting material that is hydrophilic such as Tecophlic from The Lubrizol Corporation 29400 Lakeland Boulevard Wickliffe Ohio 44092. It absorbs from 10 100 of its weight in water making it highly electrically conductive while allowing only minimal bulk fluid flow.

Another material that may be used as an interface is a hydrogel such as that used on standard EEG EKG and TENS electrodes Rylie A GREEN Sungchul Baek Laura A Poole Warren and Penny J. Martens. Conducting polymer hydrogels for medical electrode applications. Sci. Technol. Adv. Mater. 11 2010 014107 13 pp . For example it may be the following hypoallergenic bacteriostatic electrode gel SIGNAGEL Electrode Gel from Parker Laboratories Inc. 286 Eldridge Rd. Fairfield N.J. 07004.

A third type of interface may be made from a very thin material with a high dielectric constant such as those used to make capacitors. For example Mylar can be made in submicron thicknesses and has a dielectric constant of about 3. Thus at stimulation frequencies of several kilohertz or greater the Mylar will capacitively couple the signal through it because it will have an impedance comparable to that of the skin itself. Thus it will isolate the toroid and the solution it is embedded in from the tissue yet allow current to pass.

The preferred embodiment of the magnetic stimulator coil in reduces the volume of conducting material that must surround a toroidal coil by using two toroids side by side and passing electrical current through the two toroidal coils in opposite directions. In this configuration the induced current will flow from the lumen of one toroid through the tissue and back through the lumen of the other completing the circuit within the toroids conducting medium. Thus minimal space for the conducting medium is required around the outside of the toroids at positions near from the gap between the pair of coils. An additional advantage of using two toroids in this configuration is that this design will greatly increase the magnitude of the electric field gradient between them which is crucial for exciting long straight axons such as the vagus nerve and certain other peripheral nerves.

This preferred embodiment of the magnetic stimulation device is shown in . respectively provide top and bottom views of the outer surface of the toroidal magnetic stimulator . respectively provide top and bottom views of the toroidal magnetic stimulator after sectioning along its long axis to reveal the inside of the stimulator.

As seen in the coils and cores around which they are wound are mounted as close as practical to the corresponding mesh with openings through which conducting gel passes to the surface of the patient s skin. As seen in each coil and the core around which it is wound is mounted in its own housing the function of which is to provide mechanical support to the coil and core as well as to electrically insulate a coil from its neighboring coil. With this design induced current will flow from the lumen of one toroid through the tissue and back through the lumen of the other completing the circuit within the toroids conducting medium.

Different diameter toroidal coils and windings may be preferred for different applications. For a generic application the outer diameter of the core may be typically 1 to 5 cm with an inner diameter typically 0.5 to 0.75 of the outer diameter. The coil s winding around the core may be typically 3 to 250 in number depending on the core diameter and depending on the desired coil inductance.

Signal generators for magnetic stimulators have been described for commercial systems Chris HOVEY and Reza Jalinous THE GUIDE TO MAGNETIC STIMULATION The Magstim Company Ltd Spring Gardens Whitland Carmarthenshire SA34 0HR United Kingdom 2006 as well as for custom designs for a control unit impulse generator and power source Eric BASHAM Zhi Yang Natalia Tchemodanov and Wentai Liu. Magnetic Stimulation of Neural Tissue Techniques and System Design. pp 293 352 In Implantable Neural Prostheses 1 Devices and Applications D. Zhou and E. Greenbaum eds.

No. 5 718 662 entitled Apparatus for the magnetic stimulation of cells or tissue to Reza Jalinous U.S. Pat. No. 5 766 124 entitled Magnetic stimulator for neuro muscular tissue to Poison . Conventional magnetic nerve stimulators use a high current impulse generator that may produce discharge currents of 5 000 amps or more which is passed through the stimulator coil and which thereby produces a magnetic pulse. Typically a transformer charges a capacitor in the impulse generator which also contains circuit elements that limit the effect of undesirable electrical transients. Charging of the capacitor is under the control of a control unit which accepts information such as the capacitor voltage power and other parameters set by the user as well as from various safety interlocks within the equipment that ensure proper operation and the capacitor is then discharged through the coil via an electronic switch e.g. a controlled rectifier when the user wishes to apply the stimulus.

Greater flexibility is obtained by adding to the impulse generator a bank of capacitors that can be discharged at different times. Thus higher impulse rates may be achieved by discharging capacitors in the bank sequentially such that recharging of capacitors is performed while other capacitors in the bank are being discharged. Furthermore by discharging some capacitors while the discharge of other capacitors is in progress by discharging the capacitors through resistors having variable resistance and by controlling the polarity of the discharge the control unit may synthesize pulse shapes that approximate an arbitrary function.

The design and methods of use of impulse generators control units and stimulator coils for magnetic stimulators are informed by the designs and methods of use of impulse generators control units and electrodes with leads for comparable completely electrical nerve stimulators but design and methods of use of the magnetic stimulators must take into account many special considerations making it generally not straightforward to transfer knowledge of completely electrical stimulation methods to magnetic stimulation methods. Such considerations include determining the anatomical location of the stimulation and determining the appropriate pulse configuration OLNEY R K So Y T Goodin D S Aminoff M J.

Furthermore a potential practical disadvantage of using magnetic stimulator coils is that they may overheat when used over an extended period of time. Use of the above mentioned toroidal coil and container of electrically conducting medium addresses this potential disadvantage. However because of the poor coupling between the stimulating coils and the nerve tissue large currents are nevertheless required to reach threshold electric fields. At high repetition rates these currents can heat the coils to unacceptable levels in seconds to minutes depending on the power levels and pulse durations and rates. Two approaches to overcome heating are to cool the coils with flowing water or air or to increase the magnetic fields using ferrite cores thus allowing smaller currents . For some applications where relatively long treatment times at high stimulation frequencies may be required neither of these two approaches are adequate. Water cooled coils overheat in a few minutes. Ferrite core coils heat more slowly due to the lower currents and heat capacity of the ferrite core but also cool off more slowly and do not allow for water cooling since the ferrite core takes up the volume where the cooling water would flow.

A solution to this problem is to use a fluid which contains ferromagnetic particles in suspension like a ferrofluid or magnetorheological fluid as the cooling material. Ferrofluids are colloidal mixtures composed of nanoscale ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic particles suspended in a carrier fluid usually an organic solvent or water. The ferromagnetic nanoparticles are coated with a surfactant to prevent their agglomeration due to van der Waals forces and magnetic forces . Ferrofluids have a higher heat capacity than water and will thus act as better coolants. In addition the fluid will act as a ferrite core to increase the magnetic field strength. Also since ferrofluids are paramagnetic they obey Curie s law and thus become less magnetic at higher temperatures. The strong magnetic field created by the magnetic stimulator coil will attract cold ferrofluid more than hot ferrofluid thus forcing the heated ferrofluid away from the coil. Thus cooling may not require pumping of the ferrofluid through the coil but only a simple convective system for cooling. This is an efficient cooling method which may require no additional energy input U.S. Pat.

Riehl et al. Riehl et al. and Ghiron et al. .

Magnetorheological fluids are similar to ferrofluids but contain larger magnetic particles which have multiple magnetic domains rather than the single domains of ferrofluids. U.S. Pat. No. 6 743 371 Magneto sensitive fluid composition and a process for preparation thereof to John et al. . They can have a significantly higher magnetic permeability than ferrofluids and a higher volume fraction of iron to carrier.

Commercially available magnetic stimulators include circular parabolic figure of eight butterfly and custom designs that are available commercially Chris HOVEY and Reza Jalinous THE GUIDE TO MAGNETIC STIMULATION The Magstim Company Ltd Spring Gardens Whitland Carmarthenshire SA34 0HR United Kingdom 2006 . Additional embodiments of the magnetic stimulator coil have been described U.S. Pat. No. 6 179 770 entitled Coil assemblies for magnetic stimulators to Stephen Mould Kent DAVEY. Magnetic Stimulation Coil and Circuit Design. IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering Vol. 47 No. 11 November 2000 1493 1499 . Many of the problems that are associated with such conventional magnetic stimulators e.g. the complexity of the impulse generator circuitry and the problem with overheating are largely avoided by the toroidal design shown in .

Thus use of the container of conducting medium allows one to generate induce electric fields in tissue and electric field gradients and electric currents that are equivalent to those generated using current magnetic stimulation devices but with about 0.001 percent to about 0.1 percent of the current conventionally applied to a magnetic stimulation coil. Therefore with the present invention it is possible to generate waveforms shown in with relatively simple low power circuits that are powered by batteries. The circuits may be enclosed within a box as shown in or the circuits may be attached to the stimulator itself to be used as a hand held device. In either case control over the unit may be made using only an on off switch and power knob. The only other component that may be needed might be a cover to keep the conducting fluid from leaking or drying out between uses. The currents passing through the coils of the magnetic stimulator will saturate its core e.g. 0.1 to 2 Tesla magnetic field strength for Supermendur core material . This will require approximately 0.5 to 20 amperes of current being passed through each coil typically 2 amperes with voltages across each coil of 10 to 100 volts. The current is passed through the coils in bursts of pulses as described in connection with shaping an elongated electrical field of effect.

In another embodiment of the invention electrodes applied to the surface of the neck or to some other surface of the body are used to non invasively deliver electrical energy to a nerve instead of delivering the energy to the nerve via a magnetic coil. The vagus nerve has been stimulated previously non invasively using electrodes applied via leads to the surface of the skin. It has also been stimulated non electrically through the use of mechanical vibration HUSTON J M Gallowitsch Puerta M Ochani M Ochani K Yuan R Rosas Ballina M et al 2007 .

However that application pertains to the control of heart rate and is unrelated to the treatment of stroke or transient ischemic attacks. In patent publication US20080208266 entitled System and method for treating nausea and vomiting by vagus nerve stimulation to LESSER et al. electrodes are used to stimulate the vagus nerve in the neck to reduce nausea and vomiting but this too is unrelated to the treatment of stroke or transient ischemic attacks.

Patent application US2010 0057154 entitled Device and method for the transdermal stimulation of a nerve of the human body to DIETRICH et al. discloses a non invasive transcutaneous transdermal method for stimulating the vagus nerve at an anatomical location where the vagus nerve has paths in the skin of the external auditory canal.

Embodiments of the present invention may differ with regard to the number of electrodes that are used the distance between electrodes and whether disk or ring electrodes are used. In preferred embodiments of the method one selects the electrode configuration for individual patients in such a way as to optimally focus electric fields and currents onto the selected nerve without generating excessive currents on the surface of the skin. This tradeoff between focality and surface currents is described by DATTA et al. Abhishek DATTA Maged Elwassif Fortunato Battaglia and Marom Bikson. Transcranial current stimulation focality using disc and ring electrode configurations FEM analysis. J. Neural Eng. 5 2008 163 174 . Although DATTA et al. are addressing the selection of electrode configuration specifically for transcranial current stimulation the principles that they describe are applicable to peripheral nerves as well RATTAY F.

Considering that the nerve stimulating device in and the nerve stimulating device in both control the shape of electrical impulses their functions are analogous except that one stimulates nerves via a pulse of a magnetic field and the other stimulates nerves via an electrical pulse applied through surface electrodes. Accordingly general features recited for the nerve stimulating device apply as well to the latter stimulating device and will not be repeated here. The preferred parameters for each nerve stimulating device are those that produce the desired therapeutic effects.

A preferred embodiment of an electrode based stimulator is shown in . A cross sectional view of the stimulator along its long axis is shown in . As shown the stimulator comprises two heads and a body that joins them. Each head contains a stimulating electrode. The body of the stimulator contains the electronic components and battery not shown that are used to generate the signals that drive the electrodes which are located behind the insulating board that is shown in . However in other embodiments of the invention the electronic components that generate the signals that are applied to the electrodes may be separate but connected to the electrode head using wires. Furthermore other embodiments of the invention may contain a single such head or more than two heads.

Heads of the stimulator are applied to a surface of the patient s body during which time the stimulator may be held in place by straps or frames or collars or the stimulator may be held against the patient s body by hand. In either case the level of stimulation power may be adjusted with a wheel that also serves as an on off switch. A light is illuminated when power is being supplied to the stimulator. An optional cap may be provided to cover each of the stimulator heads to protect the device when not in use to avoid accidental stimulation and to prevent material within the head from leaking or drying. Thus in this embodiment of the invention mechanical and electronic components of the stimulator impulse generator control unit and power source are compact portable and simple to operate.

Details of one embodiment of the stimulator head are shown in . The electrode head may be assembled from a disc without fenestration or alternatively from a snap on cap that serves as a tambour for a dielectric or conducting membrane or alternatively the head may have a solid fenestrated head cup. The electrode may also be a screw . The preferred embodiment of the disc is a solid ordinarily uniformly conducting disc e.g. metal such as stainless steel which is possibly flexible in some embodiments. An alternate embodiment of the disc is a non conducting e.g. plastic aperture screen that permits electrical current to pass through its apertures e.g. through an array of apertures fenestration . The electrode also in seen in each stimulator head may have the shape of a screw that is flattened on its tip. Pointing of the tip would make the electrode more of a point source such that the equations for the electrical potential may have a solution corresponding more closely to a far field approximation. Rounding of the electrode surface or making the surface with another shape will likewise affect the boundary conditions that determine the electric field. Completed assembly of the stimulator head is shown in which also shows how the head is attached to the body of the stimulator .

If a membrane is used it ordinarily serves as the interface shown as in . For example the membrane may be made of a dielectric non conducting material such as a thin sheet of Mylar biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate also known as BoPET . In other embodiments it may be made of conducting material such as a sheet of Tecophlic material from Lubrizol Corporation 29400 Lakeland Boulevard Wickliffe Ohio 44092. In one embodiment apertures of the disc may be open or they may be plugged with conducting material for example KM10T hydrogel from Katecho Inc. 4020 Gannett Ave. Des Moines Iowa 50321. If the apertures are so plugged and the membrane is made of conducting material the membrane becomes optional and the plug serves as the interface shown in .

The head cup is filled with conducting material in for example SIGNAGEL Electrode Gel from Parker Laboratories Inc. 286 Eldridge Rd. Fairfield N.J. 07004. The head cup and body of the stimulator are made of a non conducting material such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene. The depth of the head cup from its top surface to the electrode may be between one and six centimeters. The head cup may have a different curvature than what is shown in or it may be tubular or conical or have some other inner surface geomety that will affect the Neumann boundary conditions that determine the electric field strength.

In certain embodiments the disc interface actually functions as the electrode and the screw is simply the output connection to the signal generator electronics. In this embodiment electrically conductive fluid or gel is positioned between the signal generator and the interface or electrode . In this embodiment the conductive fluid filters out or eliminates high frequency components from the signal to smooth out the signal before it reaches the electrode s . When the signal is generated power switching and electrical noise typically add unwanted high frequency spikes back into the signal. In addition the pulsing of the sinusoidal bursts may induce high frequency components in the signal. By filtering the signal just before it reaches the electrodes with the conductive fluid a smoother cleaner signal is applied to the patient thereby reducing the pain and discomfort felt by the patient and allowing a higher amplitude to be applied to the patient. This allows a sufficiently strong signal to be applied to reach a deeper nerve such as the vagus nerve without causing too much pain and discomfort to the patient at the surface of their skin.

In other embodiments a low pass filter may be used instead of the electrically conductive fluid to filter out the undesirable high frequency components of the signal. The low pass filter may comprise a digital or analog filter or simply a capacitor placed in series between the signal generator and the electrode interface.

If an outer membrane is used and is made of conducting materials and the disc in is made of solid conducting materials such as stainless steel then the membrane becomes optional in which case the disc may serve as the interface shown in . Thus an embodiment without the membrane is shown in . This version of the device comprises a solid but possibly flexible in some embodiments conducting disc that cannot absorb fluid the non conducting stimulator head into or onto which the disc is placed and the electrode which is also a screw. It is understood that the disc may have an anisotropic material or electrical structure for example wherein a disc of stainless steel has a grain such that the grain of the disc should be rotated about its location on the stimulator head in order to achieve optimal electrical stimulation of the patient. As seen in these items are assembled to become a sealed stimulator head that is attached to the body of the stimulator . The disc may screw into the stimulator head it may be attached to the head with adhesive or it may be attached by other methods that are known in the art. The chamber of the stimulator head cup is filled with a conducting gel fluid or paste and because the disc and electrode are tightly sealed against the stimulator head cup the conducting material within the stimulator head cannot leak out. In addition this feature allows the user to easily clean the outer surface of the device e.g. with isopropyl alcohol or similar disinfectant avoiding potential contamination during subsequent uses of the device.

In some embodiments the interface comprises a fluid permeable material that allows for passage of current through the permeable portions of the material. In these embodiments a conductive medium such as a gel is preferably situated between the electrode s and the permeable interface. The conductive medium provides a conductive pathway for electrons to pass through the permeable interface to the outer surface of the interface and to the patient s skin.

In other embodiments of the present invention the interface in is made from a very thin material with a high dielectric constant such as material used to make capacitors. For example it may be Mylar having a submicron thickness preferably in the range about 0.5 to about 1.5 microns having a dielectric constant of about 3. Because one side of Mylar is slick and the other side is microscopically rough the present invention contemplates two different configurations one in which the slick side is oriented towards the patient s skin and the other in which the rough side is so oriented. Thus at stimulation Fourier frequencies of several kilohertz or greater the dielectric interface will capacitively couple the signal through itself because it will have an impedance comparable to that of the skin. Thus the dielectric interface will isolate the stimulator s electrode from the tissue yet allow current to pass. In one embodiment of the present invention non invasive electrical stimulation of a nerve is accomplished essentially substantially capacitively which reduces the amount of ohmic stimulation thereby reducing the sensation the patient feels on the tissue surface. This would correspond to a situation for example in which at least 30 preferably at least 50 of the energy stimulating the nerve comes from capacitive coupling through the stimulator interface rather than from ohmic coupling. In other words a substantial portion e.g. 50 of the voltage drop is across the dielectric interface while the remaining portion is through the tissue.

In certain exemplary embodiments the interface and or its underlying mechanical support comprise materials that will also provide a substantial or complete seal of the interior of the device. This inhibits any leakage of conducting material such as gel from the interior of the device and also inhibits any fluids from entering the device. In addition this feature allows the user to easily clean the surface of the dielectric material e.g. with isopropyl alcohol or similar disinfectant avoiding potential contamination during subsequent uses of the device. One such material is a thin sheet of Mylar supported by a stainless steel disc as described above.

The selection of the material for the dielectric constant involves at least two important variables 1 the thickness of the interface and 2 the dielectric constant of the material. The thinner the interface and or the higher the dielectric constant of the material the lower the voltage drop across the dielectric interface and thus the lower the driving voltage required . For example with Mylar the thickness could be about 0.5 to about 5 microns preferably about 1 micron with a dielectric constant of about 3. For a piezoelectric material like barium titanate or PZT lead zirconate titanate the thickness could be about 100 400 microns preferably about 200 microns or about 0.2 mm because the dielectric constant is 1000.

One of the novelties of the embodiment that is a non invasive capacitive stimulator hereinafter referred to more generally as a capacitive electrode arises in that it uses a low voltage generally less than 100 volt power source which is made possible by the use of a suitable stimulation waveform such as the waveform that is disclosed herein . In addition the capacitive electrode allows for the use of an interface that provides a more adequate seal of the interior of the device. The capacitive electrode may be used by applying a small amount of conductive material e.g. conductive gel as described above to its outer surface. In some embodiments it may also be used by contacting dry skin thereby avoiding the inconvenience of applying an electrode gel paste or other electrolytic material to the patient s skin and avoiding the problems associated with the drying of electrode pastes and gels. Such a dry electrode would be particularly suitable for use with a patient who exhibits dermatitis after the electrode gel is placed in contact with the skin Ralph J. COSKEY. Contact dermatitis caused by ECG electrode jelly. Arch Dermatol 113 1977 839 840 . The capacitive electrode may also be used to contact skin that has been wetted e.g. with tap water or a more conventional electrolyte material to make the electrode skin contact here the dielectric constant more uniform A L ALEXELONESCU G Barbero F C M Freire and R Merletti.

As described below capacitive biomedical electrodes are known in the art but when used to stimulate a nerve noninvasively a high voltage power supply is currently used to perform the stimulation. Otherwise prior use of capacitive biomedical electrodes has been limited to invasive implanted applications to non invasive applications that involve monitoring or recording of a signal but not stimulation of tissue to non invasive applications that involve the stimulation of something other than a nerve e.g. tumor or as the dispersive electrode in electrosurgery.

Evidence of a long felt but unsolved need and evidence of failure of others to solve the problem that is solved by the this embodiment of the present invention low voltage non invasive capacitive stimulation of a nerve is provided by KELLER and Kuhn who review the previous high voltage capacitive stimulating electrode of GEDDES et al and write that Capacitive stimulation would be a preferred way of activating muscle nerves and fibers when the inherent danger of high voltage breakdowns of the dielectric material can be eliminated. Goal of future research could be the development of improved and ultra thin dielectric foils such that the high stimulation voltage can be lowered. L. A. GEDDES M. Hinds and K. S. Foster.

Journal of Automatic Control University of Belgrade 18 2 2008 35 45 on page 39 . It is understood that in the United States according to the 2005 National Electrical Code high voltage is any voltage over 600 volts. U.S. Pat.

This embodiment of the present invention uses a different method to lower the high stimulation voltage than developing ultra thin dielectric foils namely to use a suitable stimulation waveform such as the waveform that is disclosed herein . That waveform has significant Fourier components at higher frequencies than waveforms used for transcutaneous nerve stimulation as currently practiced. Thus one of ordinary skill in the art would not have combined the claimed elements because transcutaneous nerve stimulation is performed with waveforms having significant Fourier components only at lower frequencies and noninvasive capacitive nerve stimulation is performed at higher voltages. In fact the elements in combination do not merely perform the function that each element performs separately. The dielectric material alone may be placed in contact with the skin in order to perform pasteless or dry stimulation with a more uniform current density than is associated with ohmic stimulation albeit with high stimulation voltages L. A. GEDDES M. Hinds and K. S. Foster. Stimulation with capacitor electrodes. Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing 25 1987 359 360 Yongmin K I M H. Gunter Zieber and Frank A. Yang. Uniformity of current density under stimulating electrodes. Critical Reviews in Biomedical Engineering 17 1990 6 585 619 . With regard to the waveform element a waveform that has significant Fourier components at higher frequencies than waveforms currently used for transcutaneous nerve stimulation may be used to selectively stimulate a deep nerve and avoid stimulating other nerves as disclosed herein for both noncapacitive and capacitive electrodes. But it is the combination of the two elements dielectric interface and waveform that makes it possible to stimulate a nerve capacitively without using the high stimulation voltage as is currently practiced.

Another embodiment of the electrode based stimulator is shown in showing a device in which electrically conducting material is dispensed from the device to the patient s skin. In this embodiment the interface in is the conducting material itself. respectively provide top and bottom views of the outer surface of the electrical stimulator . provides a bottom view of the stimulator after sectioning along its long axis to reveal the inside of the stimulator.

Individual wires not shown connect the impulse generator in to the stimulator s electrodes . The two electrodes are shown here to be elliptical metal discs situated between the head compartment and rear compartment of the stimulator . A partition separates each of the two head compartments from one another and from the single rear compartment . Each partition also holds its corresponding electrode in place. However each electrode may be removed to add electrically conducting gel in to each head compartment . An optional non conducting variable aperture iris diaphragm may be placed in front of each of the electrodes within the head compartment in order to vary the effective surface area of each of the electrodes. Each partition may also slide towards the head of the device in order to dispense conducting gel through the mesh apertures . The position of each partition therefore determines the distance between its electrode and mesh openings which is variable in order to obtain the optimally uniform current density through the mesh openings . The outside housing of the stimulator as well as each head compartment housing and its partition are made of electrically insulating material such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene so that the two head compartments are electrically insulated from one another. Although the embodiment in is shown to be a non capacitive stimulator it is understood that it may be converted into a capacitive stimulator by replacing the mesh openings with a dielectric material such as a sheet of Mylar or by covering the mesh openings with a sheet of such dielectric material.

For example the stimulator s conducting materials may be nonmagnetic and the stimulator may be connected to the impulse generator by long nonmagnetic wires in so that the stimulator may be used in the vicinity of a strong magnetic field possibly with added magnetic shielding. As another example there may be more than two electrodes the electrodes may comprise multiple concentric rings and the electrodes may be disc shaped or have a non planar geometry.

No. 7 171 266 entitled Electroacupuncture device with stimulation electrode assembly to Gruzdowich. One of the novelties of the designs shown in is that the stimulator along with a correspondingly suitable stimulation waveform shapes the electric field producing a selective physiological response by stimulating that nerve but avoiding substantial stimulation of nerves and tissue other than the target nerve particularly avoiding the stimulation of nerves that produce pain. The shaping of the electric field is described in terms of the corresponding field equations in commonly assigned application US20110230938 application Ser. No. 13 075 746 entitled Devices and methods for non invasive electrical stimulation and their use for vagal nerve stimulation on the neck of a patient to SIMON et al. which is hereby incorporated by reference.

In one embodiment the magnetic stimulator coil in has a body that is similar to the electrode based stimulator shown in . To compare the electrode based stimulator with the magnetic stimulator refer to which shows the magnetic stimulator sectioned along its long axis to reveal its inner structure. As described below it reduces the volume of conducting material that must surround a toroidal coil by using two toroids side by side and passing electrical current through the two toroidal coils in opposite directions. In this configuration the induced electrical current will flow from the lumen of one toroid through the tissue and back through the lumen of the other completing the circuit within the toroids conducting medium. Thus minimal space for the conducting medium is required around the outside of the toroids at positions near from the gap between the pair of coils. An additional advantage of using two toroids in this configuration is that this design will greatly increase the magnitude of the electric field gradient between them which is crucial for exciting long straight axons such as the vagus nerve and certain peripheral nerves.

As seen in a mesh has openings that permit a conducting gel within in to pass from the inside of the stimulator to the surface of the patient s skin at the location of nerve or tissue stimulation. Thus the mesh with openings is the part of the magnetic stimulator that is applied to the skin of the patient.

As also seen in the coils and cores around which they are wound are mounted as close as practical to the corresponding mesh with openings through which conducting gel passes to the surface of the patient s skin. As shown each coil and the core around which it is wound is mounted in its own housing the function of which is to provide mechanical support to the coil and core as well as to electrically insulate a coil from its neighboring coil. With this design induced current will flow from the lumen of one toroid through the tissue and back through the lumen of the other completing the circuit within the toroids conducting medium. A difference between the structure of the electrode based stimulator shown in and the magnetic stimulator shown in is that the conducting gel is maintained within the chambers of the electrode based stimulator which is generally closed on the back side of the chamber because of the presence of the electrode but in the magnetic stimulator the hole of each toroidal core and winding is open permitting the conducting gel to enter the interconnected chambers .

Selected nerve fibers are stimulated in different embodiments of methods that make use of the disclosed electrical stimulation devices including stimulation of the vagus nerve at a location in the patient s neck. At that location the vagus nerve is situated within the carotid sheath near the carotid artery and the interior jugular vein. The carotid sheath is located at the lateral boundary of the retopharyngeal space on each side of the neck and deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The left vagus nerve is sometimes selected for stimulation because stimulation of the right vagus nerve may produce undesired effects on the heart but depending on the application the right vagus nerve or both right and left vagus nerves may be stimulated instead.

The three major structures within the carotid sheath are the common carotid artery the internal jugular vein and the vagus nerve. The carotid artery lies medial to the internal jugular vein and the vagus nerve is situated posteriorly between the two vessels. Typically the location of the carotid sheath or interior jugular vein in a patient and therefore the location of the vagus nerve will be ascertained in any manner known in the art e.g. by feel or ultrasound imaging. Proceeding from the skin of the neck above the sternocleidomastoid muscle to the vagus nerve a line may pass successively through the sternocleidomastoid muscle the carotid sheath and the internal jugular vein unless the position on the skin is immediately to either side of the external jugular vein. In the latter case the line may pass successively through only the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the carotid sheath before encountering the vagus nerve missing the interior jugular vein. Accordingly a point on the neck adjacent to the external jugular vein might be preferred for non invasive stimulation of the vagus nerve. The magnetic stimulator coil may be centered on such a point at the level of about the fifth to sixth cervical vertebra.

The vagus nerve is identified in along with the carotid sheath that is identified there in bold peripheral outline. The carotid sheath encloses not only the vagus nerve but also the internal jugular vein and the common carotid artery . Features that may be identified near the surface of the neck include the external jugular vein and the sternocleidomastoid muscle . Additional organs in the vicinity of the vagus nerve include the trachea thyroid gland esophagus scalenus anterior muscle and scalenus medius muscle . The sixth cervical vertebra is also shown in with bony structure indicated by hatching marks.

Methods of treating a patient comprise stimulating the vagus nerve as indicated in using the electrical stimulation devices that are disclosed herein. Stimulation may be performed on the left or right vagus nerve or on both of them simulataneously or alternately. The position and angular orientation of the device are adjusted about that location until the patient perceives stimulation when current is passed through the stimulator electrodes. The applied current is increased gradually first to a level wherein the patient feels sensation from the stimulation. The power is then increased but is set to a level that is less than one at which the patient first indicates any discomfort. Straps harnesses or frames are used to maintain the stimulator in position. The stimulator signal may have a frequency and other parameters that are selected to produce a therapeutic result in the patient. Stimulation parameters for each patient are adjusted on an individualized basis. Ordinarily the amplitude of the stimulation signal is set to the maximum that is comfortable for the patient and then the other stimulation parameters are adjusted.

The stimulation is then performed with a sinusoidal burst waveform like that shown in . The pattern of a burst followed by silent inter burst period repeats itself with a period of T. For example the sinusoidal period tau may be 200 microseconds the number of pulses per burst may be N 5 and the whole pattern of burst followed by silent inter burst period may have a period of T 40000 microseconds which is comparable to 25 Hz stimulation. More generally there may be 1 to 20 pulses per burst preferably five pulses. Each pulse within a burst has a duration of about 10 to about 1000 microseconds i.e. about 1 to about 10 KHz preferably about 200 microseconds about 5 KHz . A burst followed by a silent inter burst interval repeats at 1 to 5000 bursts per second bps preferably at 5 50 bps and even more preferably 10 25 bps stimulation 10 25 Hz . The preferred shape of each pulse is a full sinusoidal wave although triangular or other shapes may be used as well.

A vagus nerve stimulation treatment according to the present invention is conducted for continuous period of thirty seconds to five minutes preferably about 90 seconds to about three minutes and more preferably about two minutes each defined as a single dose . After a dose has been completed the therapy is stopped for a period of time depending on the treatment as described below . For prophylactic treatments such as a treatment to reduce or eliminate the severity duration and or number of migraines suffered by a patient the therapy preferably comprises multiple doses day over a period of time that may last from one week to a number of years. In certain embodiments the treatment will comprise multiple doses at predetermined times during the day and or at predetermined intervals throughout the day. In exemplary embodiments the treatment comprises one of the following 1 3 doses day at predetermined intervals or times 2 two doses either consecutively or separated by 5 min at predetermined intervals or times preferably two or three times day 3 3 doses either consecutively or separated by 5 min again at predetermined intervals or times such as 2 or 3 times day or 4 1 3 doses either consecutively or separated by 5 min 4 6 times per day. Initiation of a treatment may begin when an imminent attack e.g. headache seizure etc is forecasted or in a risk factor reduction program it may be performed throughout the day beginning after the patient arises in the morning.

For certain disorders the time of day can be more important than the time interval between treatments. For example the locus correleus has periods of time during a 24 hour day wherein it has inactive periods and active periods. Typically the inactive periods can occur in the late afternoon or in the middle of the night when the patient is asleep. It is during the inactive periods that the levels of inhibitiory neurotransmitters in the brain that are generated by the locus correleus are reduced. This may have an impact on certain disorders. For example patients suffering from migraines or cluster headaches often receive these headaches after an inactive period of the locus correleus. For these types of disorders the prophylactic treatment is optimal during the inactive periods such that the amounts of inhibitory neurotransmitters in the brain can remain at a higher enough level to mitigate or abort an acute attack of the disorder.

In these embodiments the prophlatic treatment may comprise multiple doses day timed for periods of inactivity of the locus correleus. In one embodiment a treatment according to the present invention comprises one or more doses administered 2 3 times per day or 2 3 treatment sessions per day. The treatment sessions preferably occur during the late afternoon or late evening in the middle of the night and again in the morning when the patient wakes up. In an exemplary embodiment each treatment session comprises 1 4 doses preferably 2 3 doses with each dose lasting for about 90 seconds to about three minutes.

For other disorders the intervals between treatment sessions may be the most important as applicant has determined that stimulation of the vagus nerve can have a prolonged effect on the inhibitor neurotransmitters levels in the brain e.g. at least one hour up to 3 hours and sometimes up to 8 hours. In one embodiment a treatment according to the present invention comprises one or more doses i.e. treatment sessions administered at intervals during a 24 hour period. In a preferred embodiment there are 1 5 such treatment sessions preferably 2 4 treatment sessions. Each treatment session preferably comprises 1 3 doses each lasting between about 60 seconds to about three minutes preferably about 90 seconds to about 150 seconds more preferably about 2 minutes.

For an acute treatment such as treatment of acute stroke the therapy according to the present invention may comprise one or more embodiments 1 1 dose at the onset of symptoms 2 1 dose at the onset of symptoms followed by another dose at 5 15 min or 3 1 dose every 15 minutes to 1 hour at the onset of symptoms until the acute attack has been mitigated or aborted. In these embodiments each dose preferably last between about 60 seconds to about three minutes preferably about 90 seconds to about 150 seconds more preferably about 2 minutes.

For long term treatment of an acute insult such as one that occurs during the rehabilitation of a stroke patient the therapy may consist of 1 3 treatments day 2 2 treatments either consecutively or separated by 5 min 3 day 3 3 treatments either consecutively or separated by 5 min 2 day 4 2 or 3 treatments either consecutively or separated by 5 min up to 10 day or 5 1 2 or 3 treatments either consecutively or separated by 5 min every 15 30 60 or 120 min.

For all of the treatments listed above one may alternate treatment between left and right sides or in the case of stroke or migraine that occur in particular brain hemispheres one may treat ipsilateral or contralateral to the stroke hemisphere or headache side respectively. Or for a single treatment one may treat one minute on one side followed by one minute on the opposite side. Variations of these treatment paradigms may be chosen on a patient by patient basis. However it is understood that parameters of the stimulation protocol may be varied in response to heterogeneity in the symptoms of patients. Different stimulation parameters may also be selected as the course of the patient s condition changes. In preferred embodiments the disclosed methods and devices do not produce clinically significant side effects such as agitation or anxiety or changes in heart rate or blood pressure.

The prophylactic treatments may be most effective when the patient is in a prodromal high risk bistable state. In that state the patient is simultaneously able to remain normal or exhibit symptoms and the selection between normal and symptomatic states depends on the amplification of fluctuations by physiological feedback networks. For example a thrombus may exist in either a gel or fluid phase with the feedback amplification of fluctuations driving the change of phase and or the volume of the gel phase. Thus a thrombus may form or not depending on the nonlinear dynamics exhibited by the network of enzymes involved in clot formation as influenced by blood flow and inflammation that may be modulated by vagus nerve stimulation PANTELEEV M A Balandina A N Lipets E N Ovanesov M V Ataullakhanov F I. Task oriented modular decomposition of biological networks trigger mechanism in blood coagulation. Biophys J 98 9 2010 1751 1761 Alexey M SHIBEKO Ekaterina S Lobanova Mikhail A Panteleev and Fazoil I Ataullakhanov. Blood flow controls coagulation onset via the positive feedback of factor VII activation by factor Xa. BMC Syst Biol 2010 4 2010 5 pp. 1 12 . Consequently the mechanisms of vagus nerve stimulation treatment during prophylaxis for a stroke are generally different than what occurs during an acute treatment when the stimulation inhibits excitatory neurotransmission that follows the onset of ischemia that is already caused by the thrombus. Nevertheless the prophylactic treatment may also inhibit excitatory neurotransmission so as to limit the excitation that would eventually occur upon formation of a thrombus and the acute treatment may prevent the formation of another thrombus.

The circuits involved in such inhibition are illustrated in . Excitatory nerves within the dorsal vagal complex generally use glutamate as their neurotransmitter. To inhibit neurotransmission within the dorsal vagal complex the present invention makes use of the bidirectional connections that the nucleus of the solitary tract NTS has with structures that produce inhibitory neurotransmitters or it makes use of connections that the NTS has with the hypothalamus which in turn projects.

The general stimulation schedules described above or an individualized protocol fashioned for each patient are designed or justified using concepts that are analogous to the selection of drug treatment protocols. For drugs pharmacological dose response experiments measure the cumulative effect of a bolus of the drug on the physiological parameter that is to be controlled as a function of time e.g. blood pressure . After administration of the drug the effective concentration of the drug decreases typically with an exponentially decaying half life but sometimes with a complex decay pattern and the effect of the drug on the physiological parameter also eventually decreases. The situation is similar with vagus nerve stimulation. The effectiveness of vagus nerve stimulation on a physiological parameter may also be considered quantitatively e.g. EEG derived index of cerebral ischemia see FERREE T C Hwa R C. Electrophysiological measures of acute cerebral ischaemia. Phys Med Biol 50 17 2005 3927 3939 . The effectiveness is a function of the stimulation voltage the duration of the stimulation and if stimulation has ceased the time since cessation of the last stimulation. Accordingly the numerical value of an Accumulated Vagus Nerve Stimulation with a particular waveform may be denoted as S t and may for present purposes be represented as one that increases at a rate proportional to the stimulation voltage V and decays with a time constant TAU such that after prolonged stimulation the accumulated stimulation effectiveness will saturate at a value equal to the product of V and TAU. Thus if Tis the duration of a stimulus pulse then for time tT S t S T exp t T TAU where the time t is measured from the start of a pulse Sis the value of S when t 0 and the stimulation voltage V may be expressed in units of the volts needed to first elicit a response on the part of the patient. Because each patient may have a different value of TAU the stimulus protocol needed to maintain the physiological value above or below a certain pre determined value may likewise vary from patient to patient. If the decay of the nerve stimulation effect is complex a model more complicated than simple exponential decay should be used analogous to more complex models used in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodymanics.

In other embodiments of the invention pairing of vagus nerve stimulation may be with a additional sensory stimulation. The paired sensory stimulation may be bright light sound tactile stimulation or electrical stimulation of the tongue to simulate odor taste e.g. pulsating with the same frequency as the vagus nerve electrical stimulation. The rationale for paired sensory stimulation is the same as simultaneous paired stimulation of both left and right vagus nerves namely that the pair of signals interacting with one another in the brain may result in the formation of larger and more coherent neural ensembles than the neural ensembles associated with the individual signals thereby enhancing the therapeutic effect.

For example the hypothalamus is well known to be responsive to the presence of bright light so exposing the patient to bright light that is fluctuating with the same stimulation frequency as the vagus nerve or a multiple of that frequency may be performed in an attempt to enhance the role of the hypothalamus in producing the desired therapeutic effect. Such paired stimulation does not necessarily rely upon neuronal plasticity and is in that sense different from other reports of paired stimulation Navzer D. ENGINEER Jonathan R. Riley Jonathan D.

Selection of stimulation parameters to preferentially stimulate particular regions of the brain may be done empirically wherein a set of stimulation parameters are chosen and the responsive region of the brain is measured using fMRI or a related imaging method CHAE J H Nahas Z Lomarev M Denslow S Lorberbaum J P Bohning D E George M S. A review of functional neuroimaging studies of vagus nerve stimulation VNS . J Psychiatr Res. 37 6 2003 443 455 CONWAY C R Sheline Y I Chibnall J T George M S Fletcher J W Mintun M A. Cerebral blood flow changes during vagus nerve stimulation for depression. Psychiatry Res. 146 2 2006 179 84 . Thus by performing the imaging with different sets of stimulation parameters a database may be constructed such that the inverse problem of selecting parameters to match a particular brain region may be solved by consulting the database.

Stimulation waveforms may also be constructed by superimposing or mixing the burst waveform shown in in which each component of the mixture may have a different period T effectively mixing different burst per second waveforms. The relative amplitude of each component of the mixture may be chosen to have a weight according to correlations in different bands in an EEG for a particular resting state network. Thus MANTINI et al performed simultaneous fMRI and EEG measurements and found that each resting state network has a particular EEG signature see in MANTINI D Perrucci M G Del Gratta C Romani G L Corbetta M. Electrophysiological signatures of resting state networks in the human brain. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 104 32 2007 13170 13175 . They reported relative correlations in each of the following bands for each resting state network that was measured delta 1 4 Hz theta 4 8 Hz alpha 8 13 Hz beta 13 30 Hz and gamma 30 50 Hz rhythms. For recently identified resting state networks measurement of the corresponding signature EEG networks will have to be performed.

According to the present embodiment of the invention multiple signals shown in are constructed with periods T that correspond to a location near the midpoint of each of the EEG bands e.g. using the MINATI data T equals approximately 0.4 sec 0.1667 sec 0.095 sec 0.0465 sec and 0.025 sec respectively . A more comprehensive mixture could also be made by mixing more than one signal for each band. These signals are then mixed with relative amplitudes corresponding to the weights measured for any particular resting state network and the mixture is used to stimulate the vagus nerve of the patient. Phases between the mixed signals are adjusted to optimize the fMRI signal for the resting state network that is being stimulated thereby producing entrainment with the resting state network. Stimulation of a network may activate or deactivate a network depending on the detailed configuration of adrenergic receptors within the network and their roles in enhancing or depressing neural activity within the network as well as subsequent network to network interactions. It is understood that variations of this method may be used when different combined fMRI EEG procedures are employed and where the same resting state may have different EEG signatures depending on the circumstances WU C W Gu H Lu H Stein E A Chen J H Yang Y.

Ultrahigh frequency EEG during fMRI pushing the limits of imaging artifact correction. Neuroimage 48 1 2009 94 108 . Once the network is entrained one may also attempt to change the signature EEG pattern of a network by slowly changing the frequency content of the stimulation EEG pattern of the network to which the stimulator is initially entrained. An objective in this case would be to modify the frequency content of the resting state signature EEG.

The individualized selection of parameters for the nerve stimulation protocol may based on trial and error in order to obtain a beneficial response without the sensation of skin pain or muscle twitches. Ordinarily the amplitude of the stimulation signal is set to the maximum that is comfortable for the patient and then the other stimulation parameters are adjusted. Alternatively the selection of parameter values may involve tuning as understood in control theory and as described below. It is understood that parameters may also be varied randomly in order to simulate normal physiological variability thereby possibly inducing a beneficial response in the patient Buchman T G. Nonlinear dynamics complex systems and the pathobiology of critical illness. Curr Opin Crit Care 10 5 2004 378 82 .

The vagus nerve stimulation may employ methods of control theory e.g. feedback in an attempt to compensate for motion of the stimulator relative to the vagus nerve to avoid potentially dangerous situations such as excessive heart rate and to maintain measured EEG bands e.g. delta theta alpha beta within predetermined ranges in attempt to preferentially activate particular resting state networks. Thus with these methods the parameters of the vagus nerve stimulation may be changed automatically depending on physiological measurements that are made in attempt to maintain the values of the physiological signals within predetermined ranges.

Measurement of the patient s EEG is preferably performed as part of one disclosed method for selecting the parameters of vagus nerve stimulation as described in the previous section.

When stimulating the vagus nerve motion variability may often be attributable to the patient s breathing which involves contraction and associated change in geometry of the sternocleidomastoid muscle that is situated close to the vagus nerve identified as in . Modulation of the stimulator amplitude to compensate for this variability may be accomplished by measuring the patient s respiratory phase or more directly by measuring movement of the stimulator then using controllers e.g. PID controllers that are known in the art of control theory as now described.

The System also receives input from the Controller which in this case may comprise the vagus nerve stimulation device as well as electronic components that may be used to select or set parameters for the stimulation protocol amplitude frequency pulse width burst number etc. or alert the patient as to the need to use or adjust the stimulator i.e. an alarm . For example the controller may include the control unit in . Feedback in the schema shown in is possible because physiological measurements of the System are made using sensors. Thus the values of variables of the system that could be measured define the system s state the System Output . As a practical matter only some of those measurements are actually made and they represent the Sensed Physiological Input to the Controller.

The preferred sensors will include ones ordinarily used for ambulatory monitoring. For example the sensors may comprise those used in conventional Holter and bedside monitoring applications for monitoring heart rate and variability ECG respiration depth and rate core temperature hydration blood pressure brain function oxygenation skin impedance and skin temperature. The sensors may be embedded in garments or placed in sports wristwatches as currently used in programs that monitor the physiological status of soldiers G. A. SHAW A. M. Siegel G. Zogbi and T. P. Opar. Warfighter physiological and environmental monitoring a study for the U.S. Army Research Institute in Environmental Medicine and the Soldier Systems Center. MIT Lincoln Laboratory Lexington Mass. 1 Nov. 2004 pp. 1 141 . The ECG sensors should be adapted to the automatic extraction and analysis of particular features of the ECG for example indices of P wave morphology as well as heart rate variability indices of parasympathetic and sympathetic tone. Measurement of respiration using noninvasive inductive plethysmography mercury in silastic strain gauges or impedance pneumography is particularly advised in order to account for the effects of respiration on the heart. A noninvasive accelerometer may also be included among the ambulatory sensors in order to identify motion artifacts. An event marker may also be included in order for the patient to mark relevant circumstances and sensations.

For brain monitoring the sensors may comprise ambulatory EEG sensors CASSON A Yates D Smith S Duncan J Rodriguez Villegas E. Wearable electroencephalography.

Signal processing methods comprising not only the application of conventional linear filters to the raw EEG data but also the nearly real time extraction of non linear signal features from the data may be considered to be a part of the EEG monitoring D. Puthankattil SUBHA Paul K. Joseph Rajendra Acharya U and Choo Min Lim. EEG signal analysis A survey. J Med Syst 34 2010 195 212 . In the present application the features would include EEG bands e.g. delta theta alpha beta .

Detection of the phase of respiration may be performed non invasively by adhering a thermistor or thermocouple probe to the patient s cheek so as to position the probe at the nasal orifice. Strain gauge signals from belts strapped around the chest as well as inductive plethysmography and impedance pneumography are also used traditionally to non invasively generate a signal that rises and falls as a function of the phase of respiration. Respiratory phase may also be inferred from movement of the sternocleidomastoid muscle that also causes movement of the vagus nerve stimulator during breathing measured using accelerometers attached to the vagus nerve stimulator as described below. After digitizing such signals the phase of respiration may be determined using software such as puka which is part of PhysioToolkit a large published library of open source software and user manuals that are used to process and display a wide range of physiological signals GOLDBERGER A L Amaral L A N Glass L Hausdorff J M Ivanov P Ch Mark R G Mietus J E Moody G B Peng C K Stanley H E. PhysioBank PhysioToolkit and PhysioNet Components of a New Research Resource for Complex Physiologic Signals. Circulation 101 23 2000 e215 e220 available from PhysioNet M.I.T. Room E25 505A 77 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge Mass. 02139 . In one embodiment of the present invention the control unit contains an analog to digital converter to receive such analog respiratory signals and software for the analysis of the digitized respiratory waveform resides within the control unit . That software extracts turning points within the respiratory waveform such as end expiration and end inspiration and forecasts future turning points based upon the frequency with which waveforms from previous breaths match a partial waveform for the current breath. The control unit then controls the impulse generator for example to stimulate the selected nerve only during a selected phase of respiration such as all of inspiration or only the first second of inspiration or only the expected middle half of inspiration.

It may be therapeutically advantageous to program the control unit to control the impulse generator in such a way as to temporally modulate stimulation by the magnetic stimulator coils or electrodes depending on the phase of the patient s respiration. In patent application JP2008 081479A entitled Vagus nerve stimulation system to YOSHIHOTO a system is also described for keeping the heart rate within safe limits. When the heart rate is too high that system stimulates a patient s vagus nerve and when the heart rate is too low that system tries to achieve stabilization of the heart rate by stimulating the heart itself rather than use different parameters to stimulate the vagus nerve. In that disclosure vagal stimulation uses an electrode which is described as either a surface electrode applied to the body surface or an electrode introduced to the vicinity of the vagus nerve via a hypodermic needle. That disclosure is unrelated to stroke or transient ischemic attack problems that are addressed here but it does consider stimulation during particular phases of the respiratory cycle for the following reason. Because the vagus nerve is near the phrenic nerve Yoshihoto indicates that the phrenic nerve will sometimes be electrically stimulated along with the vagus nerve. The present applicants have not experienced this problem so the problem may be one of a misplaced electrode. In any case the phrenic nerve controls muscular movement of the diaphragm so consequently stimulation of the phrenic nerve causes the patient to hiccup or experience irregular movement of the diaphragm or otherwise experience discomfort. To minimize the effects of irregular diaphragm movement Yoshihoto s system is designed to stimulate the phrenic nerve and possibly co stimulate the vagus nerve only during the inspiration phase of the respiratory cycle and not during expiration. Furthermore the system is designed to gradually increase and then decrease the magnitude of the electrical stimulation during inspiration notably amplitude and stimulus rate so as to make stimulation of the phrenic nerve and diaphragm gradual.

The present invention also discloses stimulation of the vagus nerve as a function of respiratory phase but the rationale for such stimulation is different from Yoshihoto s method.

In some embodiments of the invention overheating of the magnetic stimulator coil may also be minimized by optionally restricting the magnetic stimulation to particular phases of the respiratory cycle allowing the coil to cool during the other phases of the respiratory cycle. Alternatively greater peak power may be achieved per respiratory cycle by concentrating all the energy of the magnetic pulses into selected phases of the respiratory cycle.

Furthermore as an option in the present invention parameters of the stimulation may be modulated by the control unit to control the impulse generator in such a way as to temporally modulate stimulation by the magnetic stimulator coil or electrodes so as to achieve and maintain the heart rate within safe or desired limits. In that case the parameters of the stimulation are individually raised or lowered in increments power frequency etc. and the effect as an increased unchanged or decreased heart rate is stored in the memory of the control unit . When the heart rate changes to a value outside the specified range the control unit automatically resets the parameters to values that had been recorded to produce a heart rate within that range or if no heart rate within that range has yet been achieved it increases or decreases parameter values in the direction that previously acquired data indicate would change the heart rate in the direction towards a heart rate in the desired range. Similarly the arterial blood pressure is also recorded non invasively in an embodiment of the invention and as described above the control unit extracts the systolic diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure from the blood pressure waveform. The control unit will then control the impulse generator in such a way as to temporally modulate nerve stimulation by the magnetic stimulator coil or electrodes in such a way as to achieve and maintain the blood pressure within predetermined safe or desired limits by the same method that was indicated above for the heart rate. Thus even if one does not intend to treat problems associated with stroke embodiments of the invention described above may be used to achieve and maintain the heart rate and blood pressure within desired ranges.

Let the measured output variables of the system in be denoted by y i 1 to Q let the desired reference or setpoint values of ybe denoted by rand let the controller s input to the system consist of variables u j 1 to P . The objective is for a controller to select the input uin such a way that the output variables or a subset of them closely follows the reference signals r i.e. the control error e r yis small even if there is environmental input or noise to the system. Consider the error function e r yto be the sensed physiological input to the controller in i.e. the reference signals are integral to the controller which subtracts the measured system values from them to construct the control error signal . The controller will also receive a set of measured environmental signals v k 1 to R which also act upon the system as shown in .

The functional form of the system s input u t is constrained to be as shown in . Ordinarily a parameter that needs adjusting is the one associated with the amplitude of the signal shown in . As a first example of the use of feedback to control the system consider the problem of adjusting the input u t from the vagus nerve stimulator i.e. output from the controller in order to compensate for motion artifacts.

Nerve activation is generally a function of the second spatial derivative of the extracellular potential along the nerve s axon which would be changing as the position of the stimulator varies relative to the axon F. RATTAY. The basic mechanism for the electrical stimulation of the nervous system. Neuroscience 89 2 1999 335 346 . Such motion artifact can be due to movement by the patient e.g. neck movement or movement within the patient e.g. sternocleidomastoid muscle contraction associated with respiration or it can be due to movement of the stimulator relative to the body slippage or drift . Thus one expects that because of such undesired or unavoidable motion there will usually be some error e r y in the intended r versus actual y nerve stimulation amplitude that needs continuous adjustment.

Accelerometers can be used to detect all these types of movement using for example Model LSM330DL from STMicroelectronics 750 Canyon Dr 300 Coppell Tex. 75019. One or more accelerometer is attached to the patient s neck and one or more accelerometer is attached to the head of the stimulator in the vicinity of where the stimulator contacts the patient. Because the temporally integrated outputs of the accelerometers provide a measurement of the current position of each accelerometer the combined accelerometer outputs make it possible to measure any movement of the stimulator relative to the underlying tissue.

The location of the vagus nerve underlying the stimulator may be determined preliminarily by placing an ultrasound probe at the location where the center of the stimulator will be placed KNAPPERTZ V A Tegeler C H Hardin S J McKinney W M. Vagus nerve imaging with ultrasound anatomic and in vivo validation. Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg 118 1 1998 82 5 . The ultrasound probe is configured to have the same shape as the stimulator including the attachment of one or more accelerometer. As part of the preliminary protocol the patient with accelerometers attached is then instructed or helped to perform neck movements breathe deeply so as to contract the sternocleidomastoid muscle and generally simulate possible motion that may accompany prolonged stimulation with the stimulator. This would include possible slippage or movement of the stimulator relative to an initial position on the patient s neck. While these movements are being performed the accelerometers are acquiring position information and the corresponding location of the vagus nerve is determined from the ultrasound image. With these preliminary data it is then possible to infer the location of the vagus nerve relative to the stimulator given only the accelerometer data during a stimulation session by interpolating between the previously acquired vagus nerve position data as a function of accelerometer position data.

For any given position of the stimulator relative to the vagus nerve it is also possible to infer the amplitude of the electric field that it produces in the vicinity of the vagus nerve. This is done by calculation or by measuring the electric field that is produced by the stimulator as a function of depth and position within a phantom that simulates the relevant bodily tissue Francis Marion MOORE. Electrical Stimulation for pain suppression mathematical and physical models. Thesis School of Engineering ornell University 2007 Bartosz SAWICKI Robert Szmuro Przemysaw Ponecki Jacek Starzy ski Stanisaw Wincenciak Andrzej Rysz. Mathematical Modelling of Vagus Nerve Stimulation. pp. 92 97 in Krawczyk A. Electromagnetic Field Health and Environment Proceedings of EHE 07. Amsterdam IOS Press 2008 . Thus in order to compensate for movement the controller may increase or decrease the amplitude of the output from the stimulator u in proportion to the inferred deviation of the amplitude of the electric field in the vicinity of the vagus nerve relative to its desired value.

For present purposes no distinction is made between a system output variable and a variable representing the state of the system. Then a state space representation or model of the system consists of a set of first order differential equations of the form dy dt F t y u v r where t is time and where in general the rate of change of each variable yis a function F of many other output variables as well as the input and environmental signals.

Classical control theory is concerned with situations in which the functional form of Fis as a linear combination of the state and input variables but in which coefficients of the linear terms are not necessarily known in advance. In this linear case the differential equations may be solved with linear transform e.g. Laplace transform methods which convert the differential equations into algebraic equations for straightforward solution. Thus for example a single input single output system dropping the subscripts on variables may have input from a controller of the form 

Optimal selection of the parameters of the controller could be through calculation if the coefficients of the corresponding state differential equation were known in advance. However they are ordinarily not known so selection of the controller parameters tuning is accomplished by experiments in which the error e either is or is not used to form the system input respectively closed loop or open loop experiments . In an open loop experiment the input is increased in a step or random binary sequence of steps and the system response is measured. In a closed loop experiment the integral and derivative gains are set to zero the proportional gain is increased until the system starts to oscillate and the period of oscillation is measured. Depending on whether the experiment is open or closed loop the selection of PID parameter values may then be selected according to rules that were described initially by Ziegler and Nichols. There are also many improved versions of tuning rules including some that can be implemented automatically by the controller LI Y. Ang K. H. and Chong G. C. Y.

Commercial versions of PID controllers are available and they are used in 90 of all control applications. To use such a controller for example in an attempt to maintain the EEG gamma band at a particular level relative to the alpha band one could set the integral and derivative gains to zero increase the proportional gain amplitude of the stimulation until the relative gamma band level starts to oscillate and then measure the period of oscillation. The PID would then be set to its tuned parameter values.

Although classical control theory works well for linear systems having one or only a few system variables special methods have been developed for systems in which the system is nonlinear i.e. the state space representation contains nonlinear differential equations or multiple input output variables. Such methods are important for the present invention because the physiological system to be controlled will be generally nonlinear and there will generally be multiple output physiological signals. It is understood that those methods may also be implemented in the controller shown in Torkel GLAD and Lennart Ljung. Control Theory. Multivariable and Nonlinear Methods. New York Taylor and Francis 2000 Zdzislaw BUBNICKI. Modern Control Theory. Berlin Springer 2005 .

The controller shown in may also make use of feed forward methods Coleman BROSILOW Babu Joseph. Feedforward Control Chapter 9 In Techniques of Model Based Control. Upper Saddle River N.J. Prentice Hall PTR 2002. pp 221 240 . Thus the controller in may be a type of predictive controller methods for which have been developed in other contexts as well such as when a model of the system is used to calculate future outputs of the system with the objective of choosing among possible inputs so as to optimize a criterion that is based on future values of the system s output variables.

Performance of system control can be improved by combining the feedback closed loop control of a PID controller with feed forward control wherein knowledge about the system s future behavior can be fed forward and combined with the PID output to improve the overall system performance. For example if the sensed environmental input in is such the environmental input to the system will have a deleterious effect on the system after a delay the controller may use this information to provide anticipatory control input to the system so as to avert or mitigate the deleterious effects that would have been sensed only after the fact with a feedback only controller.

A mathematical model of the system is needed in order to perform the predictions of system behavior e.g. make predictions concerning the patient s future status regarding a stroke or transient ischemic attack. Models that are completely based upon physical first principles white box are rare especially in the case of physiological systems. Instead most models that make use of prior structural and mechanistic understanding of the system are so called grey box models. If the mechanisms of the systems are not sufficiently understood in order to construct a white or grey box model a black box model may be used instead. Such black box models comprise autoregressive models Tim BOLLERSLEV. Generalized autoregressive condiditional heteroskedasticity.

For the present invention if a black box model must be used the preferred model will be one that makes use of support vector machines. A support vector machine SVM is an algorithmic approach to the problem of classification within the larger context of supervised learning. A number of classification problems whose solutions in the past have been solved by multi layer back propagation neural networks or more complicated methods have been found to be more easily solvable by SVMs Christopher J.

Consider now the problem of predicting and possibly averting a stroke or transient ischemic attack. The example assumes that vagus nerve stimulation can be applied as described above but the stimulation is applied only when the invention s feedforward system predicts that a stroke or transient ischemic attack is imminent. Candidates for the disclosed forecasting methods include individuals who have had a recent transient ischemic attack and are likely to suffer a stroke in the next few days JOHNSTON S C Rothwell P M Nguyen Huynh M N Giles M F Elkins J S Bernstein A L Sidney S. Validation and refinement of scores to predict very early stroke risk after transient ischaemic attack. Lancet 369 9558 2007 283 292 .

A training set of physiological data will have been acquired that includes whether or not a stroke or transient ischemic attack is in progress. Thus the binary classification of the patient s state is whether or not a stroke or transient ischemic attack is in progress and the data used to make the classification consist of acquired physiological data. The training data would preferably be acquired from a single individual but as a practical matter the training set of data will ordinarily be obtained from a group of individuals who volunteer for ambulatory or hospital physiological monitoring. In general the more physiological data that are acquired the better the forecast will be.

Prediction that a stroke or TIA is imminent may be based upon the likely formation of a thrombosis or arterial embolism. In that regard there exists an ambulatory monitoring device that will monitor for cerebral emboli MacKINNON A D Aaslid R Markus H S. Long term ambulatory monitoring for cerebral emboli using transcranial Doppler ultrasound. Stroke 35 1 2004 73 8 . It measures the passage of emboli typically at the middle cerebral artery using a transcranial Doppler signal. Whereas some cerebral emboli produce symptoms of a stroke other emboli do not produce symptoms and may not be recognized by the patient. Therefore in one embodiment of the invention the detection of an embolus with the device mentioned above is used as input for the forecasting of a TIA or stroke but the appearance of the embolus in and of itself does not necessarily trigger the forecast of an imminent TIA or stroke. Additional physiological variables are used to make the forecast.

Preferably the additional physiological variables should include EEG and its derived features heart rate electrocardiogram leads blood pressure noninvasive tonometer respiration e.g. abdominal and thoracic plethysmography and motion accelerometer . For the monitoring of drug and medications systemic metabolism and changes in coagulation body chemistry may also be measure noninvasively using transdermal reverse iontophoresis Leboulanger B Guy R H Delgado Charro M B. Reverse iontophoresis for non invasive transdermal monitoring. Physiol Meas 25 3 2004 R35 50 . Preferably the ambulatory noninvasive measurements would also include skin impedance electrodermal leads carbon dioxide capnometry with nasual cannula vocalization microphones light light sensor external and finger temperature thermometers etc. as well as parameters of the stimulator device all evaluated at A time units prior to the time at which binary stroke or transient ischemic attack in progress yes no data are acquired. Many values of delta may be considered from seconds to minutes to hours. In general as the value of delta increases the calculated uncertainty of the forecast will also increase. The onset of the stroke or transient ischemic attack may be inferred from the data e.g. EEG data and or from a patient activated event marker upon the appearance of symptoms such as sudden weakness or numbness and dimming or loss of vision.

The selection of ambulatory noninvasive measurements may be motivated by physiological considerations. For example the ECG may automatically monitor the presence or forecast of atrial fibrillation ambulatory blood pressure monitors for the presence of acute increases in blood pressure and body temperature thermometers monitors the presence of infection and inflammation. The status of the autonomic nervous system is likewise monitored through heart rate variability via the ECG and skin impedance. The EEG may also provide evidence of the onset and progression of ischemia FERREE T C Hwa R C. Electrophysiological measures of acute cerebral ischaemia. Phys Med Biol 50 17 2005 3927 3939 . However because the detailed physiological mechanisms of ischemic events are not fully understood and a black box model is being used to make the forecast physiological variables with an uncertain relevance to ischemia may also be monitored.

For a patient who is not experiencing a stroke or transient ischemic attack the SVM is trained to forecast the imminence of a stroke or transient ischemic attack time units into the future and the training set includes the above mentioned physiological signals. The SVM is also trained to forecast the termination of a transient ischemic attack time units into the future and the training set includes the time course of features extracted from the above mentioned physiological signals. After training the SVM it is implemented as part of the controller. The controller may apply the vagus nerve stimulation as a prophylactic whenever there is a forecast of imminent stroke or transient ischemic attack. The controller may also be programmed to turn off the vagaus nerve stimulation when it forecasts or detects the termination of a transient ischemic attack. It is understood that in any event the patient should treat any in progress stroke or transient ischemic attack as a medical emergency and seek immediate emergency medical attention notwithstanding the use of vagus nerve stimulation as a prophylactic. If the stroke or transient ischemic attack is only forecasted the patient should immediately seek transportation to the waiting room of the nearest acute stroke treatment center or emergency room and wait at that location to see whether the predicted stroke or transient ischemic attack happens notwithstanding the use of vagus nerve stimulation as a prophylactic that may have prevented the event.
