This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 849 253 filed Jan. 23 2013 the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by this reference.

This invention was made with government support under grant number DE FG36 06GO86025 awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy. The government has certain rights in the invention.

The presently disclosed subject matter relates to catalysts for converting syngas to liquid hydrocarbons. In particular embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter relate to multi functional catalysts that can convert syngas into liquid hydrocarbons and methods for using the catalysts.

Known catalysts and methods exist to convert synthesis gas syngas to fuels and chemicals. One exemplary method includes Fischer Tropsch synthesis FTS but because FTS products are controlled by Anderson Schulz Flory ASF polymerization kinetics FTS does not provide for selective formation of hydrocarbons. Also since the hydrocarbon products contain only carbon C and hydrogen H oxygen O will be released as the byproducts of COand HO in the FTS process thereby decreasing the overall efficiency of the process. To improve the overall efficiency C H and O can be kept in the final products thereby increasing the utilization of syngas. Another approach is to first convert syngas to methanol over a methanol synthesis catalyst and subsequently polymerize methanol to hydrocarbons. These known methods generally utilize nitrogen free syngas or low level nitrogen syngas derived from natural gas or coal pure syngas or other low nitrogen syngas.

In this regard some have attempted to utilize biomass to produce energy related products such as electricity fuels heat chemicals and other materials. Biomass can be desirable because it can be renewable. However because the syngas from biomass gasification can contain about 50 vol to about 60 vol N the nitrogen content in biomass syngas is generally too high for hydrocarbon synthesis using existing technologies. For example catalysts designed for the syngas to gasoline processes have low performance with such high nitrogen content and the operation costs of syngas compression is a significant investment.

Additionally while the syngas from biomass and other sources is fairly clean some impurities such as HS NH and O do exist. Such impurities in the syngas can poison the catalyst and thus reduce conversion efficiency. Generally a qualified clean syngas should have minimal amounts of sulfurs such as HS COS NH and oxygen.

Accordingly there remains a need for a high activity and high stability catalyst useful for converting syngas including nitrogen rich and or biomass derived syngas bio syngas into hydrocarbons. There also remains a need for multi functional catalysts for a single stage syngas to hydrocarbon process that can be utilized with nitrogen rich bio syngas.

The details of one or more embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter are set forth in this document. Modifications to embodiments described in this document and other embodiments will be evident to those of ordinary skill in the art after a study of the information provided in this document. The information provided in this document and particularly the specific details of the described exemplary embodiments is provided primarily for clearness of understanding and no unnecessary limitations are to be understood therefrom. In case of conflict the specification of this document including definitions will control.

The presently disclosed subject matter includes methods for producing liquid hydrocarbons from syngas. In some embodiments the method comprises obtaining syngas optionally from biomass and then contacting the syngas with a catalyst. The catalyst can then catalyze the production of liquid hydrocarbons. In some embodiments the catalyst can include a base material support a transition metal and a promoter.

The term liquid hydrocarbons is used herein to refer to hydrocarbons that are in a liquid state at a particular temperature and pressure. In some embodiments liquid hydrocarbons are a liquid at 0 C. and ambient pressure and in other embodiments liquid hydrocarbons are liquid at ambient temperature and pressure. In some embodiments liquid hydrocarbons refer to any C hydrocarbon. In specific embodiments liquid hydrocarbons comprise about 4 to about 20 carbon atoms per molecule and in other embodiments liquid hydrocarbons can comprise more than 20 carbons. Further still in some embodiments liquid hydrocarbons do not include methane ethane propane butane or combinations thereof. Some embodiments of liquid hydrocarbons may or may not include C gasoline. Those of ordinary skill will appreciate that the hydrocarbons including liquid hydrocarbons can include straight or branched molecules as well as cyclic or acyclic molecules.

The terms hydrocarbon and liquid hydrocarbon are also inclusive of paraffins olefins aromatics and oxygenates. More specifically exemplary liquid hydrocarbons can be selected from higher alcohols higher esters higher ethers higher aldehydes higher ketones higher alkanes higher alkenes higher cycloalkanes higher cycloalkenes aryls fused aryls and combinations thereof wherein higher can refer to any molecule having 4 or more carbons. In some embodiments the liquid hydrocarbons including the liquid hydrocarbons described above are an oxygenate. The term oxygenate is used herein to refer to a molecule having one or more oxygen atoms. In specific embodiments the liquid hydrocarbons produced by the present methods and catalysts comprise a range of about 5 wt to about 80 wt of oxygenates.

The synthesis gas syngas described herein is comprised primarily of hydrogen and carbon dioxide. In some embodiments the syngas is obtained from a biomass although the term syngas is used herein to refer to both syngas that is and syngas that is not obtained from biomass. Biomass can include but is not limited to plant derived materials as well as metabolic waste obtained from microbes and other animals. Exemplary sources of biomass also include but are not limited to agricultural wastes corn stalks straw seed hulls sugarcane leavings bagasse nutshells manure wood materials municipal waste including waste paper and yard clippings and specific plants grown as biomass such as poplars willows switch grass alfalfa prairie bluestream corn soybean and the like.

In this regard the syngas in certain instances includes syngas or biosyngas having a relatively high concentration of nitrogen compared to syngas that is obtained from natural gas or the like. In some embodiments the biosyngas can comprise about 1 vol 10 vol 20 vol 30 vol 40 vol 50 vol 60 vol or any value therebetween of nitrogen. Specific embodiments can also comprise syngas that includes about 1 vol 10 vol 20 vol 30 vol 40 vol or any value therebetween of carbon dioxide. For example syngas that is obtained from a gasifier that is utilizing wood chips as the feedstock can produce a syngas comprising about 20 H about 19 CO about 12 CO and about 49 N. Certain embodiments described herein have the superior and unexpected result of being capable of converting syngas with relatively high concentrations of nitrogen and or carbon dioxide into liquid hydrocarbons. Furthermore certain embodiments described herein utilize a multi functional catalyst e.g. bifunctional catalyst that can process syngas including high nitrogen content syngas i.e. 20 vol in a single stage. On the other hand known systems are relatively more complex time consuming and expensive because high nitrogen content syngas either cannot be processed into liquid hydrocarbons or can only be processed into liquid hydrocarbons with two or more stages.

In some embodiments the syngas is reasonably suitable for producing liquid hydrocarbons without posing a risk of poising and reducing the conversion efficiency of the catalyst being used. On the other hand in some embodiments the syngas comprises impurities that can poison a catalyst such as HS NH and O. For example syngas with about 0.5 wt to about 1.0 wt of oxygen trace ammonia sulfur and or tar can poison certain catalysts and possibly cause them to prematurely become ineffective at catalyzing the production of liquid hydrocarbons.

In this regard in some embodiments the present method for producing liquid hydrocarbons further comprises a step of cleaning syngas that is known or suspected of having impurities that could potentially poison the catalysts. In some embodiments the cleaning step comprises passing the poisoning or potentially poisoning syngas through several reactors in series that are packed with different catalysts and or absorbents. Exemplary catalysts and absorbents include to active metals such as copper Cu cobalt Co manganese Mn molybdenum Mo nickel Ni palladium Pd platinum Pt silver Ag and ruthenium Rh . Exemplary catalysts and absorbents also include but are not limited to alumina supported metal catalysts 13X molsieve active carbon silica gel and other high surface area materials. In specific embodiment the syngas after the cleaning step and or from the obtaining step qualifies for total sulfurs HS COS of less than 10 ppb NHof less than 1 ppm and oxygen of less than 1 ppm.

As stated above the present catalysts can comprise a base material a transition metal and a promoter. In some embodiments the base material is selected from a zeolite iron a zeolite iron material a cobalt molybdenum material a cobalt molybdenum carbide or a combination thereof. The zeolite can include known zeolites and in some embodiments the zeolite can be selected from ZSM 5 ZSM 11 ZSM 12 ZSM 22 ZSM 23 ZSM 35 ZSM 48 ZSM 57 and combinations thereof. In some embodiments the zeolite is selected from a type Y zeolite.

The transition metals described herein also include salts water soluble halides nitrates amines sulfates acetates carbonates phosphates or the like of the transition metal. Similarly the present promoters can include alkali metals including oxides hydroxides nitrates chlorides carbonates sulfates or the like of an alkali metal.

In certain embodiments the catalyst comprises a zeolite iron base material. Specific embodiments can comprise about 40 wt to about 80 wt of the zeolite molecular sieve. Specific embodiments can also comprise about 2.0 wt to about 40 wt 2.0 wt to about 15.0 wt or about 5.0 wt to about 15.0 wt of iron. Both zeolite and iron comprise the zeolite iron base material of a catalyst. The zeolite iron base material can be prepared with different processes. For instance the zeolite iron base material can be prepared by precipitating iron directly onto the above described zeolite. In other embodiments iron introduced into the zeolite by an impregnation or incipient of a transition metal. Thus in some embodiments the catalyst comprises a base material that includes iron deposited e.g. by precipitation on a zeolite.

In other embodiments the zeolite iron base material can be prepared by mixing iron oxide nanostructures with the zeolite. With regard to the iron oxide nanostructures the term nanostructure is used herein to refer to any iron oxide structure that can be measured on a nanoscale i.e. about 1 nm to about 999 nm . In other embodiments the catalyst comprises a base material that includes iron oxide nanostructures that are mixed with a zeolite. The iron oxides for use in exemplary catalysts include known and commercially available iron oxide nanostructures. In other embodiments the present methods include preparing iron oxide nanostructures by a method selected from a sol gel method a hydrothermal method an impregnation method and a micro emulsion method.

The present catalysts can also include a transition metal. For the zeolite iron base material the transition metal can be transferred directly to the base material. Exemplary methods for transferring e.g. depositing and or ion exchanging transition metals to the zeolite iron material include one or more of a impregnation method an ion exchange method a hydrothermal ion exchange method a solid state ion exchange method a chemical vapor deposition CVD method or another suitable method. In some embodiments the transition metal is added to a zeolite material before the addition of iron. Thus in certain instances iron can be added to a zeolite to form a zeolite iron base material by precipitating iron directly onto a transition metal containing zeolite. In yet other embodiments iron is added to a zeolite to form a zeolite iron base material by physically mixing iron oxide nanostructures with a zeolite that includes the transition metal.

The transition metal of a catalyst can be selected based on factors including the liquid hydrocarbon that is desired reaction conditions or the like. In some embodiments the transition metal for use with a zeolite iron base material is selected from platinum Pt palladium Pd ruthenium Ru iridium Ir rhodium Rh molybdenum Mo cobalt Co and combinations thereof. Furthermore the transition metals can be in the form of but are not limited to salts water soluble halides nitrates amine complexes sulfates acetates carbonates phosphates or combinations thereof.

In some embodiments the incorporation of a transition metal in the catalyst can provide increased gasoline range hydrocarbon production. Likewise the concentration of transition metal can be selected based on a various factors. Embodiments of the present catalysts can include about 0.1 wt to about 10 wt of a transition metal.

To prepare a catalyst that comprises transition metals in some embodiments the transition metal is deposited on a zeolite as described above and then the mixture is calcined. In a specific embodiment the mixture of the transition metal and the zeolite is calcined at about 400 C. In another specific embodiment the mixture of the transition metal and the zeolite is calcined for about 3 hours to about 5 hours. The resulting material can be crushed and pelletized to tablets for use as a catalyst in a method of producing liquid hydrocarbons.

Further still in some embodiments the present catalysts comprise a cobalt molybdenum material as the base material. More specifically in some embodiments the base material includes a cobalt molybdenum carbide material. The cobalt of the base material can be obtained from cobalt containing chemicals such as those selected from cobalt chloride cobalt II acetate cobalt II acetate tetrahydrate cobalt II acetylacetonate cobalt II carbonate hydrate cobalt II nitrate hexahydrate cobalt II sulfate heptahydrate cobalt II III oxide and the like. Furthermore in some embodiments the molybdenum is obtained from molybdenum containing chemicals such as those selected from molybdenum V chloride molybdenum hexacarbonyl ammonium heptamolybdate molybdenum VI tetrachloride oxide molybdenum VI oxide molybdenum II acetate dimer and the like.

Embodied bimetallic cobalt molybdenum Co Mo carbide base materials have varying compositions. Exemplary Co Mo carbide base materials can comprise about 5 wt to about 15 wt cobalt. Exemplary Co Mo carbide base materials can comprise about 5 wt to about 25 wt molybdenum. Exemplary Co Mo carbide base materials can also comprise about 20 wt to about 45 wt carbon. While those of ordinary skill will appreciate that the composition of specific base materials can vary specific exemplary embodiments of the bimetallic Co Mo carbide base materials include 5 wt Co 25 wt Mo and 70 wt carbon. Another specific embodiment includes 10 wt Co 25 wt Mo and 65 wt carbon. Another specific embodiment includes 15 wt Co 25 wt Mo and 40 wt carbon. Another specific embodiment includes 20 wt Co 25 wt Mo and 55 wt carbon. Another specific embodiment includes 15 wt Co 15 wt Mo and 70 wt carbon. Another specific embodiment includes 15 wt Co 10 wt Mo and 75 wt carbon. Another specific embodiment includes 15 wt Co 5 wt Mo and 80 wt carbon.

In some embodiments the novel cobalt molybdenum carbide base material is prepared by carburization of metal precursors e.g. Co Mo precursor with carbon at high temperature. This can be done by a variety of processes including but not limited to a two stage reaction method developed by Newsam a temperature programmed nitridation and topotactic carburization process a thermal carburization process or a direct carburization process. In one embodiment the bimetallic Co Mo precursors were supported on carbon and prepared using a one step incipient wetness and or a co precipitation method.

In some embodiments the bimetallic cobalt molybdenum carbide base material can be prepared using a carbothermal reduction CR method or a carbothermal hydrogen reduction CHR method. The carbothermal reduction method includes the process of using helium or nitrogen as a carrier gas passed through the sample and the reduction reaction utilizes carbon as the reductant at elevated temperature. Following the reduction process the carbidization reaction between the reduced metal and carbon usually occurs to form transitional metal carbides. In this manner carbothermal reduction CR methods can prepare embodiments of the present metal carbides. For the case of molybdenum trioxide the following shows the reduction 1 and carbidization 2 reactions that can form MoC. MoO 3C Mo 3CO 1 2Mo C MoC 2 

In some embodiments the bimetallic cobalt molybdenum carbide material can be prepared using a carbothermal hydrogen reduction CHR method. Hydrogen flows through the sample during the CHR process. In CHR the reduction reaction uses hydrogen as the reductant at elevated temperature. Following the reduction process the carbidization reaction between the reduced transitional metal and carbon occurs to form transitional metal carbides. For the case of molybdenum trioxide the following shows the reduction 3 and carbidization 4 reactions that can for form MoC. MoO 3H Mo 3HO 3 2Mo C MoC 4 

The carbon of the Co Mo carbide base material can be derived from commercially available carbons and or home synthesized carbons. Exemplary carbon resources include active carbons carbon blacks carbon nanotubes carbon fibers fullerenes graphene graphite bio char other carbon containing materials and combinations thereof.

As described above the present catalysts can include a transition metal. For some embodiments of catalysts that include a cobalt molybdenum base material the transition metal can be selected from iron Fe nickel Ni tungsten W vanadium V copper Cu silver Ag platinum Pt palladium Pd Ruthenium Ru iridium Ir and Rhodium Rh and combinations thereof. The transition metals can be in the form of but are not limited to salts water soluble halides nitrates amine complexes sulfates acetates carbonates phosphates or combinations thereof. In some embodiments of the present catalysts include a cobalt molybdenum base material and about 0.1 wt to about 10 wt of a transition metal. The transition metal can be added to a cobalt molybdenum base material or the other base materials using the above described methods.

In some embodiments the catalyst can further comprises a promoter in addition to the base material and optionally the transition metal. A promoter can be an alkali metal. Exemplary promoters include substances selected from lithium Li sodium Na potassium K rubidium Rb cesium Cs and combinations thereof. A promoter can also include an oxide a hydroxide a nitrate a chloride a carbonate and or a sulfate of the one or more alkali metals. In an exemplary embodiment the promoter is potassium hydroxide.

In some embodiments the catalyst incorporates a promoter by an impregnation process. The concentration of a promoter will vary depending on the particular catalyst. Exemplary catalysts can include about 0.5 wt to about 10.0 wt of a promoter. In one particular embodiment the promoter is the last material added to form the catalyst. In some embodiments the catalyst if formed by providing a zeolite adding a transition metal to the zeolite adding iron and or iron oxide nanostructures to the zeolite and then adding the promoter. In other embodiments the catalyst is formed by providing a cobalt molybdenum precursor processing the precursor to form cobalt molybdenum carbide adding a transition metal to the cobalt molybdenum carbine and then adding the promoter.

The temperature pressure and gas hourly space velocity GHSV of the syngas can be tuned in the contacting step to yield desirable liquid hydrocarbons. In some embodiments the contact step is performed at about 250 C. to about 400 C. In some embodiments the pressure in the contacting step can be about 400 psi to about 1500 psi. Furthermore in some embodiments the contacting step is performed with the syngas having a GHSV of about 1 000to about 10 000. In a specific embodiment the catalyst is such that increasing the temperature and or pressure of the reaction generally increases carbon monoxide conversion whereas increasing GHSV generally decreases carbon monoxide conversion. The temperature pressure and space velocity used when producing liquid hydrocarbons can also affect the distribution of the particular hydrocarbons that are produced.

In some methods one or more of the temperature pressure space velocity and composition of the catalyst are adjusted so that the resulting liquid hydrocarbon mixture products have a particular composition and distribution. In some embodiments the parameters are adjusted so as to yield different liquid hydrocarbon products ranging from a light gasoline boiling point range to a diesel fuel to a jet fuel. In some embodiments the catalyst catalyzes the conversion of nitrogen rich e.g. 20 syngas to a liquid hydrocarbon mixture enriched with a C hydrocarbon fraction at low pressure. Embodiments of the present methods can be more efficient and more economical than traditional Fischer Tropsch FT catalysts.

The presently disclosed subject matter is further illustrated by the following specific but non limiting examples. Some of the following examples are prophetic notwithstanding the numerical values results and or data referred to and contained in the examples. Additionally the following examples may include compilations of data that are representative of data gathered at various times during the course of development and experimentation related to the present invention.

This Example describes processes for making and characterizing embodiments of the present catalysts. In particular this Example describes how to make certain iron and or zeolite containing catalysts and also characterizes their ability to process synthesis gas.

An amount of 9.4 g of PdClwas dissolved in 200 mL of deionized DI water and stirred for 2 hours. Then 50 g of ZSM 5 zeolite powder was added to the PdClsolution and HSOwas added in a dropwise fashion until the solution had 4.0 pH. The mixture was transferred into a 500 ml autoclave and maintained at 105 120 C. for 8 20 hours. The product was evaporated and oven dried at 110 C. for 12 hours then the mixture was calcined at 400 C. for 3 hours.

The obtained Pd ZSM 5 was added to an aqueous solution containing 95 g of ferric nitrate in 500 ml of water and the mixture was stirred at 80 C. for 12 hours. The brown products were dried at 110 C. for 5 hours then the dried mixture was calcined at 400 C. for 5 hours. An amount of 125 mL of 2.5 wt KOH solution was added to the resulting Fe Pd ZSM 5 mixture the promoted catalyst was calcined at 300 C. for 2 hours and then crushed and pelletized to tablets under 15 tons of force.

The synthesis gas conversion reaction was carried out in a micro reactor of a fixed bed flow system. Three 3 grams of the catalyst were loaded to the reactor. The system was first purged by a helium flow for 30 minutes followed by prereducing with a syngas mixture at 400 C. for 8 hours then syngas was fed in until reaching the desired pressure with a slow adjustment of the system to the desired temperature. The reaction was operated under the following conditions 250 400 C. a gas volume hourly space velocity GHSV of 500 to 5 000 h and a pressure of 500 1500 psi.

To observe the effect of temperature on the catalyst performance temperatures studied were conducted at 290 300 310 320 330 and 350 C. Table 1 shows the variation of CO conversion and C C selectivity at various temperatures and with the other variables remaining constant. Table 1 shows that temperature influenced CO conversion was very important. CO conversion increased from 55 at 290 C. to 83 at 350 C. Table 1 also shows that the hydrocarbon distribution changed with temperature with the light hydrocarbons being favored at higher temperatures. Higher hydrocarbons were relatively more sensitive to temperature.

Next the influence of pressure on catalyst performance was observed. An increase in total pressure generally increased the equilibrium towards the product side and increased the conversion. The change in Gibbs free energy was negative for the system where the change in number of moles upon reaction was negative and when pressure increased. Furthermore a change in total pressure did not affect the water gas shift reaction but did change the equilibrium product distribution. Trials under 500 750 1000 and 1250 psig were carried out. The other operating conditions included the following water temperature of 310 C. gas space velocity of 2000 h and syngas comprising 19.0 H 20.0 CO 12.0 CO 1.921 CH balance N. The effect of pressure on both CO conversion and process selectivity showed that when pressure increased CO conversion increased . Within the C fraction an effect of pressure on selectivity was observed. The increase in pressure favored the formation of C while C Cgaseous hydrocarbons decreased with increasing pressure.

Next the influence of space velocity on the catalyst performances was observed with different GHSVs of 500 1000 2000 2500 and 3000 h while the remaining operating conditions were maintained at 310 C. 1000 psig CO H 1. The effect of the space velocity on CO conversion and hydrocarbon distribution showed that when the space velocity increased CO conversion decreased . At the same time C selectivity also decreased. It can be concluded that CO conversion decreased with the increasing of space velocity. Space time had an effect on product distribution as it was observed that the yields of hydrocarbons decreased with increasing space velocity. The gasoline fraction C decreased with increasing space velocity.

The role of syngas composition on the catalyst performances was also observed. Synthesis gas composition can in some instances affect both reaction rates and activity. It was found that the catalyst had a relatively high activity and selectivity in producing liquid hydrocarbons when running with nitrogen rich syngas.

The effect of time on stream on the performance of the catalyst was observed at 310 C. over a period of 120 hours. The evolution of CO conversion and hydrocarbon distribution with time on stream are shown in for the exemplary catalyst. The activity of the catalyst reached a steady state after a period of approximately 20 hours under operating conditions. Time on stream results showed the catalyst was stable. CO conversion reached 74 after 20 hours run at 310 C. and kept constant after 120 hours run.

Wood syngas activity was also observed. A downdraft gasifier produced biomass syngas bio syngas from wood chips and other biomass. The syngas from the gasifier contained about 20 H 19 CO 12 CO and 49 Nif wood chips were used as the feedstock. In addition to the gases listed above the bio syngas also contained some tars ammonia HS trace oxygen and particulate impurities. Bio syngas was cleaned by bubbling the gas through water containing tanks before compressed the gas up to 1800 psi. The compressed wood syngas was fed to a fixed bed reactor for liquid hydrocarbon production. The wood syngas activity and selectivity was similar to that of the simulator syngas i.e. 19.0 H 19.0 CO 12.0 CO 1.921 CH balance N . Liquid product samples were collected and analyzed. The composition of the gasoline phase was also similar to the simulator syngas except there were more aromatics and less olefins in the wood syngas product.

As a comparison an embodiment of a catalyst that comprises nano iron oxide particles was also prepared and its performance as the FTS catalyst was observed. Nano structured iron particles were prepared by sol gel hydrothermal impregnation or micro emulsion techniques. The prepared nano structured iron oxide particle had a size of less than 50 nm. Iron chemicals were selected from Fe NO FeCl FeCl Fe CO and other iron containing chemicals. Nano iron catalysts were examined for FTS to produce hydrocarbon fuels from bio syngas produced by the downdraft gasifier Table 5 . Nano iron materials showed 75 80 CO conversion and 50 60 of liquid fuel selectivity. The liquid fuel product distribution was 30 50 olefins 5 10 aromatics 1 oxygenates and 30 50 paraffins.

Next an exemplary catalyst was prepared that included both the nano iron oxide particles and 3 wt of the Pd ZSM 5. The nano structured iron oxide was commercially available with a size of less than 50 nm. In the same manner as described above Pd was introduced onto the zeolite by an impregnation process. An amount of 8 g of the commercial nano iron oxide was milled with 50 g of 5 wt Pd ZSM 5 for 10 hours. Then the mixture was impregnated in 125 mL 2.5 KOH solution and the promoted catalyst was dried at 110 C. for 10 hours and calcined at 400 C. for 5 hours in air. The catalyst was grounded and pelletized for testing at 310 C. 1000 psig and 2000 hwith syngas of 19.0 H 20.0 CO 12.0 CO and 1.921 CH4 balance N. As shown in Table 6 the catalyst showed 76.5 CO conversion 74.8 hydrocarbon selectivity and 56 by weight of a C gasoline fraction.

Furthermore an exemplary iron ZSM 5 catalyst was manufactured and its properties were observed. First 95 g of ferric nitrate was dissolved in 500 ml of DI water and then was stirred for 30 minutes. An aqueous solution was obtained. Then 50 g of calcined ZSM 5 was added to the solution the mixture was stirred at 80 C. overnight the brown products were dried at 110 C. for 5 hours and then the dried mixture was calcined at 400 C. for 5 hours. The catalyst was grounded and pelletized for testing at 310 C. 1000 psig 2000 hwith syngas of 19.0 H 20.0 CO 12.0 CO and 1.921 CH4 balance N. This catalyst gave 65.3 CO conversion 69.8 hydrocarbon selectivity and 46.9 wt C gasoline fraction.

Lastly several exemplary catalysts were manufactured in a similar procedure described above to prepare the catalyst that includes palladium and iron e.g. Tables 1 4 . However instead of palladium rhodium platinum ruthenium cobalt or molybdenum were impregnated into the zeolite. This Example also describes conversion reactions of synthesis gas carried out with these exemplary catalysts that comprise rhodium platinum ruthenium cobalt or molybdenum. The results of the conversion reactions are shown in Table 8.

The catalyst containing 1.0 wt of rhodium was prepared by depositing rhodium nitrate over ZSM 5. The catalyst containing 1.0 wt of ruthenium was prepared by depositing ruthenium trichloride over ZSM 5. The catalyst containing 1 wt of platinum was prepared by depositing chloroplatinic acid over ZSM 5. The catalyst containing 3 wt of Mo was prepared by depositing ammonium molybdate hydrate over ZSM 5. The catalyst containing 3 wt of cobalt was prepared by depositing cobalt nitrate over ZSM 5. The results for these catalysts suggested that adding metals on an iron component may provide an improvement in the production of hydrocarbons from syngas.

This Example describes processes for making and characterizing embodiments of the present catalysts. In particular this Example describes how to make certain cobalt molybdenum Co Mo based catalysts and also characterizes their ability to process synthesis gas.

To first prepare the bimetallic Co Mo precursors an aqueous solution of ammonium heptamolybdate and cobalt nitrate was prepared with a Co Mo molar ratio 1 1. This aqueous solution was prepared by adding 7.36 g of ammonium heptamolybdate to 20 mL DI water. The solution was heated to 80 C. and stirred until a clear transparent solution was obtained. The solution was then cooled to 40 C. where 12.12 g of cobalt nitrate were added to the ammonium heptamolybdate solution. The mixture was stirred until a transparent solution was obtained. The obtained bimetallic salt solution then was added in a dropwise fashion to a beaker containing 10 g of active carbon support and stirred continuously. The impregnation step lasted until removal of the solvent at 80 C. by evaporation. The mass obtained was further dried at 110 C. for 12 hours.

Next the bimetallic CoMo carbide was formed from this mass by carbothermal reduction CR and carbothermal hydrogen reduction CHR processes. The dried Co Mo 1 1 molar ratio over active carbon precursors were transferred to a quartz reactor 1 inch O.D. . A tubular electrical furnace controlled by a temperature program was used to heat the reactor. The amount of the sample was about 20 200 g batch. The sample was first heated at 300 C. in helium flowing at 500 mL min for 2 hours to obtain CoMoO. The temperature was then ramped to 700 to 1100 C. with a heating rate of 1 100 C. min under either flowing helium 100 1000 mL min or pure H 100 1000 mL min . The final temperature 700 1100 C. was held for 2 hours. The sample was quenched trace of the oxygen in nitrogen reacted with surface Co Mo carbide 100 1000 mL min for 2 hours at room temperature.

Furthermore for certain exemplary embodiments at least one additional transitional metal was selected as active component of the catalyst. The additional metals were selected from the salts of iron Fe nickel Ni tungsten W vanadium V copper Cu silver Ag platinum Pt palladium Pd ruthenium Ru iridium Ir and rhodium Rh . The additional transitional contents were introduced into the catalyst system by employing an impregnation or incipient of the Co Mo carbide by a salt solution. The salts of the transitional metals could be nitrates chlorides oxides or hydroxides. The additional metal contents could also be added using prepared nanostructured metal particles by a physical mixing process. After introducing the additional transitional metals the mixture was first dried in an oven and then was calcined under a nitrogen flow in a one inch quartz tube reactor. The loading of the additional transitional metals was between 0.1 and 10 percent by weight.

For this Example an exemplary catalyst was formed by dissolving 0.5 g of palladium chloride in 10 mL DI water. The solution of PdClwas drop wisely added to 10 g of Co Mo bimetallic carbide obtained from the carbothermal reduction CR and a carbothermal hydrogen reduction CHR processes and was stirred continually. The impregnation step lasted until removal of the water solvent at 80 C. by evaporation. The sample obtained was further dried at 110 C. overnight.

Next alkali metals in the form of oxides hydroxides nitrates chlorides carbonates or sulfates were doped to certain samples of the Co Mo bimetallic carbide. The alkali metals included lithium Li sodium Na potassium K rubidium Rb and caesium Cs . Thus the catalyst prepared with or without impregnating with transition metals e.g. palladium could be further promoted with 1 15 wt alkali metals by am impregnation method. The final obtained multifunctional catalyst was first calcined under nitrogen atmosphere at 350 C. for 3 hours and was then crushed and pelletized to tablets.

For this Example an exemplary catalyst was formed by dissolving 0.5 g of potassium hydroxide in 10 mL DI water. The solution of KOH was added dropwise to the Pd impregnated catalyst and was stirred continually. The impregnation step lasted until removal of the water solvent at 80 C. by evaporation. The sample obtained was further dried at 110 C. overnight.

To observe the effect of temperature on the catalyst performance the ability of the catalyst to convert syngas to liquid hydrocarbons and oxygenates was observed at temperatures between 200 C. and 450 C. The synthesis gas conversion reaction was carried out in a micro reactor of a fixed bed flow system. Three 3 grams of the bimetallic CoMo catalyst that was Pd impregnated and promoted with KOH was loaded to the reactor. The system was first purged by a helium flow for 30 minutes followed by pre reducing with a mixture gas of N H 1 1 at 400 C. for 8 hours then syngas was fed in until reaching the desired pressure with slow adjustment of the system to the desired temperature. The reaction was operated under the following conditions 200 C. to 450 C. a gas volume hourly space velocity GHSV of 500 to 5 000 h and a pressure of 200 psi to 1200 psi.

Thus to examine temperature effects three 3 grams of the catalyst sample were loaded to a half inch stainless steel reactor. The activity of the catalyst was investigated at 350 C. 380 C. and 410 C. 1000 psi and 3000 hGHSV. Table 9 shows the variation of CO conversion C Clight hydrocarbons and liquid product selectivity with temperature the other variables remaining constant.

Next the influence of pressure on catalyst performance was observed. Pressured were varied from about 200 psig to about 1000 psig. The catalyst was analyzed at a temperature of 310 C. gas space velocity of 3000 h and with syngas of 50.0 H 50.0 CO. For this embodiments CO conversion and process selectivity increased when pressure increased.

Further still the impact of space velocity on the catalyst performance was observed. Experiments were completed with GHSV of 1000 3000 and 5000 h and the remaining operating conditions were maintained at 380 C. 3000 psig and CO H 1. The effect of the space velocity on CO conversion and hydrocarbon distribution showed that when the space velocity increased CO conversion decreases for this catalyst.

The impact of syngas composition on the catalyst performance was also observed. Synthesis gas composition can affect higher hydrocarbon synthesis. It can affect both reaction rates and activity. It was found that the catalyst has relatively high activity and selectivity in producing liquid hydrocarbons when running even with nitrogen rich syngas.

The effect of time on stream on the performance of the catalyst was studied at 380 C. over a period of 1960 hours. The evolution of CO conversion as well as light hydrocarbon and liquid product selectivity with time on stream are shown in for the Co Mo bimetallic carbide based catalyst. The activity of the Pd impregnated and KOH promoted catalyst reached a steady state after a period of about 40 hours under operating conditions. Time on stream results showed that the exemplary catalyst was stable. CO conversion reached 81 after 40 hours run at 380 C. and kept constant after 1960 hours run.

As a comparative example the Co Mo bimetallic carbide catalyst that was not impregnated or promoted was tested at 380 C. 1000 psig 3000 hwith syngas of 50.0 H 50.0 CO. This catalyst gave 51.2 CO conversion 61.7 light hydrocarbon selectivity and 26.9 wt liquid product selectivity.

Next studies were performed with catalysts prepared in a similar procedure to the Pd impregnated KOH promoted catalyst described above. However instead of the palladium Pd rhodium platinum or ruthenium were deposited on to Co Mo bimetallic carbide. Conversion reactions of the synthesis gas were carried out to obtain results as shown in Table 14.

The catalyst containing 1.0 wt of rhodium was prepared by depositing rhodium nitrate over Co Mo bimetallic carbide. The catalyst containing 1.0 wt of ruthenium was prepared by depositing ruthenium trichloride over Co Mo bimetallic carbide. The catalyst containing 1 wt of platinum was prepared by depositing chloroplatinic acid over Co Mo bimetallic carbide. The results for these catalysts suggested that adding the additional transitional metals on the Co Mo bimetallic carbide may provide an improvement in the production of hydrocarbons from the syngas.
