The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds. The present invention also relates to a method for preparing these compounds. The present invention also relates to a method of treating a mammalian disorder in which LSD1 levels are elevated by administering these compounds and compositions to a patient in need thereof. The present invention also relates to a method for decreasing histone demethylase activity in a mammal comprising administering to the mammal an effective amount of these compounds and compositions.

Over the past decade it has become clear that epigenetic changes which alter gene activity without altering DNA sequence collaborate with genetic mistakes to promote cancer development and progression Tsai H. C. and Baylin S. B. 2011 21 3 502 17 and Fullgrabe J. Kavanagh E. and Joseph B. 2011 . The regulation of the modifications on DNA and the proteins associated with DNA has become an area of intense interest and the enzymes involved in these processes have been suggested as a new class of protein targets for drug development. The major proteins associated with DNA are histone proteins. Histone tails are subject to a variety of posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation acetylation methylation and ubiquitination and these modifications especially acetylation and methylation on lysine residues play a major role in the regulation of gene expression and are often dysregulated in cancer Fullgrabe J. Kavanagh E. and Joseph B. 2011 .

Recently an enzyme called Lysine Specific Demethylase 1 LSD1 was identified as the first histone demethylase that specifically catalyzes the oxidative demethylation of monomethylated and dimethylated histone H3 at lysine 4 H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 and lysine 9 H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 through a flavin adenine dinucleotide FAD dependent reaction Shi Y. et al. 2004 119 7 941 53 and Metzger E. et al. 2005 437 7057 436 9 . LSD1 is a component of the corepressor of RE1 silencing transcription factor CoREST complex that is responsible for silencing neuronal specific genes in nonneuronal cells Gocke and Yu 2008 3 9 e3255 1 12 . The active site of LSD1 shows a highly negatively charged substrate binding cavity spacious enough to accommodate the N terminal tail of histone H3. Chen Y. et al. 2006 103 38 13956 13961. Further an N terminal SWIRM domain and an insertion in the core catalytic domain termed the Tower Domain were established as necessary structural motifs for enzymatic activity and interactions with cofactors such as CoREST.

Several lines of evidence point to LSD1 as being a possible therapeutic target in cancer. LSD1 is reportedly over expressed in a variety of tumors including neuroblastoma estrogen receptor ER negative breast bladder lung and colorectal tumors Schulte J. H. et al. 2009 69 5 2065 71 Lim S. et al. 2010 31 3 512 20 and Hayami S. et al. 2011 128 3 574 86 . Increased methylation of the permissive H3K4 mark by LSD1 inhibition has been shown to reactivate expression of tumor suppressor genes in cancer models Huang Y. et al. 2009 15 23 7217 28 . In addition LSD1 has been found to associate with estrogen and androgen receptors leading to the specific demethylation of the repressive H3K9 mark thereby increasing target gene expression Metzger E. et al. 2005 437 7057 436 9 and Garcia Bassets I. et al. 2007 128 3 505 18 . Thus depending upon cofactors bound to LSD1 demethylation by LSD1 can contribute to cancer through both the permissive H3K4 and the repressive H3K9 mark. Therefore the inhibition of LSD1 might be an effective strategy for re expression of epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes as well as down regulation of important cancer pathways in a number of cancer types. Several LSD1 inhibitors have been reported but they have shown poor selectivity and or pharmacological properties making further exploration of LSD1 biology difficult.

Monoamine oxidase MAO inhibitors such as tranylcypromine and pargyline have been reported as LSD1 inhibitors and there have been several reports regarding attempts to discover derivatives with increased selectivity for LSD1 over MAO Mimasu S. et al. 2010 49 30 6494 503 Binda C. et al. 2010 132 19 6827 33 Culhane J. C. et al. 2006 128 14 4536 7 Culhane J. C. et al. 2010 132 9 3164 76 and Ueda R. et al. 2009 131 48 17536 7 . These compounds irreversibly inactivate LSD1 by covalent binding to the FAD cofactor. Polyamine derivatives have also been evaluated as LSD1 inhibitors where compounds with activity in the M range have been described Huang Y. et al. 2009 15 23 7217 28 Sharma S. K. et al. 2010 53 14 5197 212 and Huang Y. et al. 2007 104 19 8023 8 . In general these and other reported LSD1 inhibitors are neither adequately selective nor potent enough to optimally interact with the crucial amino acid residues of the substrate binding site present in LSD1.

In summary the LSD1 protein plays a key role in epigenetic and transcriptional regulation and is frequently altered in mammalian cancers thus making them an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Despite advances in drug discovery directed to identifying inhibitors of LSD1 protein activity there is still a scarcity of compounds that are both potent efficacious and selective inhibitors of LSD1. Furthermore there is a scarcity of compounds effective in the treatment of cancer and other diseases associated with dysfunction in LSD1. These needs and other needs are satisfied by the present invention.

The term contacting as used herein refers to bringing a disclosed compound and a cell target receptor or other biological entity together in such a manner that the compound can affect the activity of the target e.g. receptor cell etc. either directly i.e. by interacting with the target itself or indirectly i.e. by interacting with another molecule co factor factor or protein on which the activity of the target is dependent.

As used herein the terms effective amount and amount effective refer to an amount that is sufficient to achieve the desired result or to have an effect on an undesired condition. For example a therapeutically effective amount refers to an amount that is sufficient to achieve the desired therapeutic result or to have an effect on undesired symptoms but is generally insufficient to cause adverse side affects. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder the specific composition employed the age body weight general health sex and diet of the patient the time of administration the route of administration the rate of excretion of the specific compound employed the duration of the treatment drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed and like factors well known in the medical arts. For example it is well within the skill of the art to start doses of a compound at levels lower than those required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved. If desired the effective daily dose can be divided into multiple doses for purposes of administration. Consequently single dose compositions can contain such amounts or submultiples thereof to make up the daily dose. The dosage can be adjusted by the individual physician in the event of any contraindications. Dosage can vary and can be administered in one or more dose administrations daily for one or several days. Guidance can be found in the literature for appropriate dosages for given classes of pharmaceutical products.

As used herein the term pharmaceutically acceptable carrier refers to sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions dispersions suspensions or emulsions as well as sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers diluents solvents or vehicles include water ethanol polyols such as glycerol propylene glycol polyethylene glycol and the like carboxymethylcellulose and suitable mixtures thereof vegetable oils such as olive oil and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained for example by the use of coating materials such as lecithin by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions and by the use of surfactants. These compositions can also contain adjuvants such as preservatives wetting agents emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents such as paraben chlorobutanol phenol sorbic acid and the like. It can also be desirable to include isotonic agents such as sugars sodium chloride and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the inclusion of agents such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin which delay absorption. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide polyglycolide poly orthoesters and poly anhydrides . Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed the rate of drug release can be controlled. Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues. The injectable formulations can be sterilized for example by filtration through a bacterial retaining filter or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable media just prior to use. Suitable inert carriers can include sugars such as lactose. Desirably at least 95 by weight of the particles of the active ingredient have an effective particle size in the range of 0.01 to 10 micrometers.

As used herein the term substituted is contemplated to include all permissible substituents of organic compounds.

Illustrative substituents include for example those described below. The permissible substituents can be one or more and the same or different for appropriate organic compounds. For purposes of this disclosure the heteroatoms such as nitrogen can have hydrogen substituents and or any permissible substituents of organic compounds described herein which satisfy the valences of the heteroatoms. This disclosure is not intended to be limited in any manner by the permissible substituents of organic compounds. Also the terms substitution or substituted with include the implicit proviso that such substitution is in accordance with permitted valence of the substituted atom and the substituent and that the substitution results in a stable compound e.g. a compound that does not spontaneously undergo transformation such as by rearrangement cyclization elimination etc. It is also contemplated that in certain embodiments unless expressly indicated to the contrary individual substituents can be further optionally substituted i.e. further substituted or unsubstituted .

The term alkyl as used herein is a branched or unbranched saturated hydrocarbon group of 1 to 24 carbon atoms such as methyl ethyl n propyl isopropyl n butyl isobutyl s butyl t butyl n pentyl isopentyl s pentyl neopentyl hexyl heptyl octyl nonyl decyl dodecyl tetradecyl hexadecyl eicosyl tetracosyl and the like. The alkyl group can be cyclic or acyclic. The alkyl group can be branched or unbranched. The alkyl group can also be substituted or unsubstituted. For example the alkyl group can be substituted with one or more groups including but not limited to alkyl cycloalkyl alkoxy amino ether halide hydroxy nitro silyl sulfo oxo or thiol as described herein. A lower alkyl group is an alkyl group containing from one to six e.g. from one to four carbon atoms.

In certain embodiments the C1 C12 alkyl group can be optionally further substituted.

Throughout the specification alkyl is generally used to refer to both unsubstituted alkyl groups and substituted alkyl groups however substituted alkyl groups are also specifically referred to herein by identifying the specific substituent s on the alkyl group. For example the term halogenated alkyl or haloalkyl specifically refers to an alkyl group that is substituted with one or more halide e.g. fluorine chlorine bromine or iodine. The term alkoxyalkyl specifically refers to an alkyl group that is substituted with one or more alkoxy groups as described below. The term alkylamino specifically refers to an alkyl group that is substituted with one or more amino groups as described below and the like. When alkyl is used in one instance and a specific term such as alkylalcohol is used in another it is not meant to imply that the term alkyl does not also refer to specific terms such as alkylalcohol and the like.

This practice is also used for other groups described herein. That is while a term such as cycloalkyl refers to both unsubstituted and substituted cycloalkyl moieties the substituted moieties can in addition be specifically identified herein for example a particular substituted cycloalkyl can be referred to as e.g. an alkylcycloalkyl. Similarly a substituted alkoxy can be specifically referred to as e.g. a halogenated alkoxy a particular substituted alkenyl can be e.g. an alkenylalcohol and the like. Again the practice of using a general term such as cycloalkyl and a specific term such as alkylcycloalkyl is not meant to imply that the general term does not also include the specific term.

The term aryl as used herein is a group that contains any carbon based aromatic group including but not limited to benzene naphthalene phenyl biphenyl phenoxybenzene and the like. The term aryl also includes heteroaryl which is defined as a group that contains an aromatic group that has at least one heteroatom incorporated within the ring of the aromatic group. Examples of heteroatoms include but are not limited to nitrogen oxygen sulfur and phosphorus. Likewise the term non heteroaryl which is also included in the term aryl defines a group that contains an aromatic group that does not contain a heteroatom. The aryl group can be substituted or unsubstituted. The aryl group can be substituted with one or more groups including but not limited to alkyl cycloalkyl alkoxy alkenyl cycloalkenyl alkynyl cycloalkynyl aryl heteroaryl aldehyde amino carboxylic acid ester ether halide hydroxy ketone azide nitro silyl sulfo oxo nitrile sulfonamide or thiol as described herein.

Biaryl refers to two aryl groups that are bound together via a fused ring structure as in naphthalene or are attached via one or more carbon carbon bonds as in biphenyl.

The terms halogen halide and halo as used herein refer to the halogens fluorine chlorine bromine and iodine. It is also contemplated that in various embodiments halogen can be selected from fluoro chloro bromo and iodo. For example halogen can be selected from fluoro chloro and bromo.

It is also contemplated that in certain embodiments pseudohalogens e.g. triflate mesylate tosylate brosylate etc. can be used in place of halogens. For example in certain embodiments halogen can be replaced by pseudohalogen. As a further example pseudohalogen can be selected from triflate mesylate tosylate and brosylate. In one embodiment pseudohalogen is triflate. In another embodiment pseudohalogen is mesylate. In another embodiment pseudohalogen is tosylate. In another embodiment pseudohalogen is brosylate.

The term heterocycle as used herein refers to single and multi cyclic aromatic or non aromatic ring systems in which at least one of the ring members is other than carbon. Heterocycle includes azetidine dioxane furan imidazole isothiazole isoxazole morpholine oxazole oxazole including 1 2 3 oxadiazole 1 2 5 oxadiazole and 1 3 4 oxadiazole piperazine piperidine pyrazine pyrazole pyridazine pyridine pyrimidine pyrrole pyrrolidine tetrahydrofuran tetrahydropyran tetrazine including 1 2 4 5 tetrazine tetrazole including 1 2 3 4 tetrazole and 1 2 4 5 tetrazole thiadiazole including 1 2 3 thiadiazole 1 2 5 thiadiazole and 1 3 4 thiadiazole thiazole thiophene triazine including 1 3 5 triazine and 1 2 4 triazine triazole including 1 2 3 triazole 1 3 4 triazole and the like.

All computational studies employed PDB ID 2Z5U for the structural coordinates of LSD1. Virtual docking methods ICM Glide and GOLD programs were implemented. The protein structure was prepared by 3D protonation deletion of water molecules and energy minimization using the ICM force field and distance dependent dielectric potential with an RMS gradient of 0.1 heavy atoms in the protein were kept fixed and histidine residues were considered as neutral. Virtual screening calculations utilized default parameters unless explicitly specified otherwise with ICM and Glide scores as scoring functions respectively. In both cases FAD was defined as the ligand and an active site region was defined by a sphere of radius 12 around the bound FAD in complex with LSD1.

Confirmation of the accuracy and efficiency of the applied docking protocol used the FAD cofactor adenine dinucleotide fragment and the flavin fragment and known LSD1 inhibitors decoy set as positive controls. Two separate docking runs were carried out with ICM and the Glide docking program GOLD docking was employed for re scoring.

The compound database was prepared using Ligprep 2.1.23 Schr dinger LLC. New York N.Y. . Two rounds of VS including HTVS and standard precision SP docking were adopted. The top 10000 compounds ranked by Glide were stored and submitted for additional docking experiments using ICM docking. The final set of 2000 hits was selected based on ICM scores and individual compounds were visually inspected to check the docking poses and interactions between ligands and LSD1. GOLD consensus scoring functions were employed further to re score these 2000 hits selected from Glide and ICM. Finally 121 compounds were purchased if available or synthesized for LSD1 inhibition studies.

All simulations were performed using the AMBER ff99SB force field Hornak V. et al. 2006 65 3 712 25 for LSD1 the general Amber force field gaff see Wang J. et al. 2004 25 9 1157 74 for compound 12 and the TIP3P Jorgensen W. L. 1982 77 4156 4163 model for water was employed. The simulations approximated long range electrostatic interactions using the particle mesh Ewald method PME procedure Essmann U. et al. 1995 103 8577 8593 Darden T. et al. 1993 98 10089 10092 . Using LEaP the binding modes generated from ICM docking in complex with LSD1 were solvated to neutral charge and the complexes were first minimized with PMEMD Case D. A. et al. 11 San Francisco 2010 . Following minimization 200 ps of unrestrained molecular dynamics simulation using a non bonded interaction cutoff of 9 was run for both binding modes with a constant pressure periodic boundary maintaining 1 atm of pressure and isotropic position scaling with a relaxation time of 2 ps. SHAKE was used to constrain bonds involving hydrogen and Langevin dynamics were used to regulate temperature Case D. A. et al. 11 San Francisco 2010 maintaining 300 K. Relative free energies of binding for comparisons between the two binding modes were predicted using MMPBSA.pywith 100 snapshots at 1 ps intervals starting either at 1 ps or 101 ps into the trajectory.

The first crystal structures of LSD1 elucidating critical architectural features were later by Stavropoulos et al. 2006 13 7 626 32 Protein Data Bank or PDB ID 2H94 see http www.wwpdb.org Yang et al. 2006 23 3 377 87 PDB ID 2IW5 and Chen et al. 2006 103 38 13956 61 PDB ID 2HKO . These 2.9 2.57 and 2.8 structures respectively show a highly negatively charged substrate binding cavity spacious enough to accommodate the N terminal tail of histone H3. Further an N terminal SWIRM domain and an insertion in the core catalytic domain termed the Tower Domain were established as necessary structural motifs for enzymatic activity and interactions with cofactors such as CoREST. For the studies described herein the structure PDB ID 2Z5U was used with bound LSD1 inhibitor tranylcypromine for computational studies including virtual screening docking and molecular dynamics Mimasu S. et al. 2008 366 1 15 22 . In order to evaluate the chemical space outside of tranylcypromine and polyamine derivatives HTVS was used with an in house library. The library was curated from publicly available vendor libraries totaling approximately 13 million compounds using custom filters developed in house. Compounds were filtered based on Lipinski s rule of five with exceptions occurring in only 62 000 compounds. Further structurally redundant compounds were removed such that the resulting library contained a diverse yet manageable set of about 2 million compounds. Prior to screening compounds were prepared using the LigPrep module of the Schrodinger Suite as well as ICM s inbuilt preparation of three dimensional 3D ligands such that physiologically relevant protonation states were used.

Prepared ligands were then docked against three different sites on LSD1 the FAD site located in the amine oxidase domain and the adenine dinucleotide and flavin fragments of this pocket. The docking protocols used by both ICM and Glide were run with the FAD adenine dinucleotide flavin fragments and known LSD1 inhibitors to check for accuracy. In addition to the docking algorithm rankings visual inspection of the docking results were used to evaluate binding position suitable pose and orientation. Taken together the scoring functions from ICM and Glide were able to correctly identify known inhibitors within the top 2 of the decoy set used. GOLD was used to re score and the GOLD fitness function produced similar enrichments.

A virtual screen was set up against the FAD binding pocket of LSD1 using the established docking protocol and the 2 million compound database. The top 10 000 compounds were selected from both ICM and Glide scoring functions for further analysis. A few identical compounds were scored similarly between the two algorithms this redundancy was filtered out. Furthermore visual inspection was performed to filter out similar compounds and to increase the diversity of the final selection. Visual analysis also allowed identification of key interactions within the FAD binding pocked of LSD1. These include hydrogen bonding with Ser289 Arg310 and Arg316 van der Waals interactions with Val590 and Leu625 and it interactions with Trp756. Moreover compounds with hydroxyl and hydrophobic electron withdrawing groups seemed to show increased enrichment in the initial docking results. The FAD binding pocket of LSD1 is a deep and narrow crevice in the interior of the protein and is surrounded by hydrophobic amino acid residues. Thus the hydrophobic character of the compounds may play an important role in the random walk of the compound into the active site.

Based on the selection criteria discussed above 121 structurally distinct compounds were procured and submitted for biochemical screening against LSD1. The biochemical assay as described in the experimental section measures HOproduced from the oxidative demethylation of a peptide substrate. From the 121 compounds a series of related compounds which showed potent activity in the biochemical assay were identified. Structures for the series are presented in Table 1.

The following example of the in vivo effect of the disclosed compounds are prophetic. Generally agents which modulate the regulation of chromatin including histone demethylase inhibitors display efficacy in preclinical models of cancer. In vivo effects of the compounds described in the preceding examples are expected to be shown in various animal models of cancer known to the skilled person such as tumor xenograft models. These models are typically conducted in rodent most often in mouse but may be conducted in other animal species as is convenient to the study goals. Compounds products and compositions disclosed herein are expected to show in vivo effects in various animal models of cancer known to the skilled person such as mouse tumor xenograft models.

In vivo effects of compounds can be assessed with in a mouse tumor xenograft study one possible study protocol is described herein. Briefly cells 2 to 5 10in 100 mL culture media were implanted subcutaneously e.g. by subcutaneous injection in the right hind flank of athymic nu nu nude mice 5 to 6 weeks old 18 22 g . For test compounds of the present invention a typical cell line used for the tumor xenograft study would be AN3 CA or BT 20. Other suitable cell lines for these studies are BT 549 HCT 116 HER218 MCF7 MDA MB 231 MDA MB 235 MDA MB 4355 MDA MB 468 PANC 1 PC 3 SK N MC T 47D and U 87 MG cells. The cells are cultured prior to harvesting for this protocol as described herein.

Following implantation the tumors are allowed to grow to about 100 mm typically about 6 18 days post implantation before the animals are randomized into treatment groups e.g. vehicle positive control and various dose levels of the test compound the number of animals per group is typically 8 12. Day 1 of study corresponds to the day that the animals receive their first dose. The efficacy of a test compound can be determined in studies of various length dependent upon the goals of the study. Typical study periods are for 14 21 and 28 days. The dosing frequency e.g. whether animals are dosed with test compound daily every other day every third day or other frequencies is determined for each study depending upon the toxicity and potency of the test compound. A typical study design would involve dosing daily M F with the test compound with recovery on the weekend. Throughout the study tumor volumes and body weights are measured twice a week. At the end of the study the animals are euthanized and the tumors harvested and frozen for further analysis. Alternatively tumors may be processed immediately for analysis e.g. fixed in buffered formalin paraffin embedded and sectioned for hematoxylin eosin staining and further immunohistochemical analysis for desired oncology markers.

For example compounds having a structure represented by a formula having a structure represented by Formula I and II or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt solvate polymorph hydrate and the stereochemically isomeric form thereof are expected to show such in vivo effects.

Alternatively it can be desirable to assess the in vivo efficacy of the disclosed compounds in a tumor explant or tumor graft animal models e.g. see Rubio Viqueira B. et al. . 2006 12 4652 4661 Fiebig H. H. Maier A. and Burger A. M. . 2004 40 802 820 and DeRose Y. S. et al. Patient derived tumor grafts authentically reflect tumor pathology growth metastasis and disease outcomes. 2011 . in press . These models can provide higher quality information on in vivo effects of therapeutic compounds. It is believed tumor graft models are more authentic in vivo models of many types of cancer e.g. human breast cancer with which to examine the biology of tumors and how they metastasize. Engraftment of actual patient tumor tissues into immunodeficient mice termed tumor grafts provides improvement over implantation of cell lines in terms of phenocopying human tumors and predicting drug responses in patients Clarke R. 2009 11 Suppl 3 S22 Press J. Z. et al. 2008 110 56 264 Kim M. P. et al. 2009 4 670 1680 Daniel V. C. et al. 2009 69 3364 3373 and Ding L. et al. 2010 464 999 1005 .

Briefly tissue samples will be collected from informed consented patients at Huntsman Cancer Hospital University of Utah under an approved IRB protocol. Samples will be collected and de identified by the Huntsman Cancer Institute Tissue Resource and Application Core facility before being obtained for implantation. It is anticipated that all primary tumors will be from individuals that had not received chemotherapy prior to tissue collection and all metastatic effusions will be from individuals that had been treated with chemotherapy hormone therapy and or radiation therapy. The University of Utah Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee will review and approve all mouse experiments. It is anticipated that a minimum of three mice per experimental group will be used and only female mice will be used for studies involving breast cancer tumors. A single fragment of fresh or frozen tumor 8 mm3 or about 10cells in matrigel is implanted into cleared inguinal mammary fat pads of 3 4 week old female NOD SCID mice. At the same interscapular estrogen pellets are subcutaneously implanted in mice with ER tumors. Tumor growth is measured weekly using calipers. When tumors reach about 150 2 000 mm the mice are euthanized and tissue fragments are re transplanted into another cohort of mice frozen for later use and or analyzed for histology gene expression and DNA copy number. Tumor volumes are calculated using the formula 0.5 length width . For experiments to determine estrogen dependence ER tumors are implanted into mice as described above in the presence or absence of intracapsular estrogen pellets and with or without a concurrent surgical procedure to remove the ovaries which is performed according to standard methods.
