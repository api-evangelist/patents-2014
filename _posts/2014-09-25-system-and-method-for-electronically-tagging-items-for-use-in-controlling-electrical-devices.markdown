This patent application relates to electronic or electrical systems or devices appliances and computer implemented software according to various example embodiments and more specifically to a system and method for electronically tagging items for use in controlling electrical devices.

Radio frequency identification RFID is a conventional technology that uses communication via radio waves to exchange data between a reader and an electronic tag attached to an object typically for the purpose of identification and tracking. Some tags can be read from several meters away and beyond the line of sight of the reader. The application of bulk reading enables an almost parallel reading of a plurality of tags.

Radio frequency identification involves interrogators also known as readers and tags. Most RFID tags contain at least two parts. One part is typically an integrated circuit for storing and processing information modulating and demodulating a radio frequency RF signal and other specialized functions. The other part is an antenna for receiving and transmitting the RF signal. RFID tags can be passive RFID tags which have no power source and require an external electromagnetic field to initiate a signal transmission or active RFID tags which contain a battery and can transmit signals once an external source e.g. an interrogator has been successfully identified.

RFID technology is used in the apparel and textile manufacturing industry. This technology was introduced in the textile industry many years ago. In the apparel retail sector RFID is widely used by big retailers for security and for tracking sales stock and real time information. However RFID and other electronic tagging technologies have not been extensively used for controlling electrical devices.

It can be frustrating and expensive if one fails to keep track of and manage care instructions for clothing. Apparel can be easily ruined if care instructions are not properly followed. Typically items of clothing have a tag or label sewn inside one of the seams. The tags or labels themselves are sometimes a nuisance and are often cut off or become unreadable due to wear and tear. The information on the tags is also often hard to read and understand. It can also be difficult to match the care instructions on the tag of clothing to the options provided on a clothes washer and dryer. Washers and dryers have become quite sophisticated in the options they provide for specialized care needs but it can be overwhelming to remember each and every garment s individual care instructions.

Currently the way to obtain care instructions for garments is to read the label and try to interpret the symbols and instructions. Sometimes it is even harder to understand symbols and instructions if the clothes are imported from abroad. This can be time consuming and prone to misinterpretation which can result in ruined clothing.

In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various embodiments. It will be evident however to one of ordinary skill in the art that the various embodiments may be practiced without these specific details.

In the various embodiments described herein a system and method for electronically tagging items for use in controlling electrical devices are disclosed. The disclosed embodiments can be used with a wide variety of electrical or electronic devices appliances or other electrical equipment such as clothes washers clothes dryers steam cleaners industrial clothes presses and the like. Example embodiments are described in more detail below.

Clothes washers dryers and other appliances have become quite sophisticated in the options they provide for specialized care needs but it can be overwhelming to remember each and every garment s individual care instructions. The various embodiments described herein provide an automated solution to reduce the workload of the appliance user operator. The various embodiments described herein employ an electronically readable item tag or label which can be attached or embedded in an item such as an item of clothing. The electronically readable item tag or label can be automatically read and interpreted by the electrical appliance e.g. a clothes washer dryer etc. to allow for automatic configuration of the appliance to accommodate the specific needs of a load of items e.g. a load of laundry being processed by the appliance. As a result the various embodiments provide customized care of items and decrease the workload of the user operator.

In the various embodiments described herein the electronically readable item tag or label can be a microchip a radio frequency identification RFID tag a barcode a Quick Response QR code or the like embedded in the hem of an item of clothing attached to a portion of the garment attached to a garment label or attached or embedded into an item. The general use of RFID tags barcodes and QR codes are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The various embodiments described herein apply these known technologies to the electronic tagging of items for use in controlling electrical devices as described in more detail below.

In conventional systems the way to obtain care instructions for garments is for the appliance user operator to manually read the label and try to interpret the symbols and instructions on the label. Sometimes it is even harder to understand symbols and instructions if the items are imported from abroad or the labels are written in a non native language. This can be time consuming for the appliance user operator and prone to misinterpretation which can result in ruined clothing or other items.

The various embodiments described herein provide a better solution. As electronically tagged items of a load e.g. a load of clothing are placed inside or near an appliance e.g. a clothes washer dryer etc. a reader attached to the appliance is configured to read the electronically readable item tag or label on each item placed into or near the appliance. A data processor and memory microcontroller or other control system in the appliance can record the particular care instructions and other item information encoded into the electronic tag of each item. A variety of item information can be encoded into the electronic tag of each item. For example the encoded item information can include the care instructions e.g. washing drying ironing instructions etc. of the garment the garment manufacturer provenance information the sourcing of materials and the manufacturing processes used the date of manufacture and or purchase the name or identity of the owner or purchaser the item stock keeping unit SKU number the size of the garment the dry weight and wet weight of the garment the identity of the materials from which the garment is made safety advisories storage and disposal advisories special care instructions or warnings the number of times the item has been washed or dried a flammability coding a water resistance coding allergen warnings government or industry rating data manufacturer identification data pricing information liability limitations copyright or trademark advisories website or uniform resource locator URL links and the like. The data processor or microcontroller can aggregate and record the retrieved item data for all items in the load being processed by the appliance. An information display on the appliance can show care instructions and item information. This displayed information can include the number of times the item has been washed the material from which the garment is made whether it is safe to bleach or iron the item etc. The appliance e.g. washer dryer etc. can also automatically suggest washing and drying settings according to the care instructions read from the electronically readable item tag. The suggested settings can be displayed to a user operator via a light emitting diode LED display or other conventional display device on the appliance. If multiple items are present in or near the appliance the data processor or microcontroller in the appliance can suggest ideal settings based on the care needs of the items in the appliance and or present a warning that one or more of the items have conflicting care needs. Additionally for appliances that support an application programming interface API provided with an example embodiment the data processor or microcontroller can automatically configure the settings of the appliance based on the item information read from the electronically readable item tags of the items placed into or near the appliance. For example the data processor or microcontroller may determine that several delicate garment items have been placed into the appliance e.g. a clothes washer by reading the electronic tags of the items in the load. Based on this determination the data processor or microcontroller can automatically program the washer to use a wash cycle configured for delicate loads. In this manner an example embodiment can automatically configure the settings of an appliance based on the particular needs or characteristics of the items in a load being processed by the appliance.

Referring now to an example embodiment is illustrated for applying an electronically readable tag or label on an item. In the particular embodiment shown in a garment is tagged in any of a variety of ways with an electronically readable item tag or label . As shown the electronically readable item tag can be a microchip a radio frequency identification RFID tag a barcode a Quick Response QR code or the like embedded in the hem of an item of clothing attached to a portion of the garment attached to a garment label or otherwise attached or embedded into an item. In other embodiments dishware silverware or other kitchen or dining utensils can also be tagged with an electronically readable tag or label . In still other embodiments food items cleaning items bathroom items tools or other household items can also be tagged with an electronically readable tag or label . In each case the electronically readable item tag or label can be configured to be waterproof wear resistant heat and cold resistant and configured for permanent or semi permanent attachment to an item or object by adhesive bonding stitching or embedding into the material of the item.

Each electronically readable item tag or label can be encoded with item information pertaining to the item to which the tag is attached. In the case of a microchip or an RFID tag the information can be read by a reader using a radio frequency RF signal receiver as well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In the case of a barcode or a Quick Response QR code the information can be read by a scanner configured to decode the arrangement of printed shapes in the barcode or QR code image as well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In each case the item information encoded into the tag can be read or scanned and transferred to a data processor or microcontroller generally a controller for processing. As described above a variety of item information can be encoded into the electronic tag of each item. As a result a variety of item specific information can be electronically passed from the tag on each item to a data processor or microcontroller as described in more detail below.

Referring to an example embodiment is illustrated for use with any of a variety of appliances such as the top loading clothes washer shown in or the clothes dryer shown in . It will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the disclosure herein that other types of appliances e.g. dishwashers refrigerators and the like can be configured to include the technologies disclosed herein.

Referring now to the top loading clothes washer of an example embodiment is shown to include an RFID reader which can be affixed to the top of the washer near an opening into which clothing items are placed. Such RFID readers are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In a similar fashion the clothes dryer shown in can include an RFID reader which can be affixed to the front of the dryer near an opening into which clothing items are placed. As shown in items placed into appliances or can each include electronically readable item tags or labels . As these items are placed into appliances or the items come into proximity of the RFID reader . As a result the RFID reader can electronically read the item information encoded into the electronically readable item tag of each item. This item information can be transferred to an appliance control module described in more detail below.

Referring again to the top loading clothes washer of an example embodiment is shown to include a barcode or QR code scanner which can be installed in an upper portion of the washer near an opening into which clothing items are placed. Such barcode or QR code scanners are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In a similar fashion the clothes dryer shown in includes a barcode or QR code scanner which can be installed in the front of the dryer near an opening into which clothing items are placed. As shown in items placed into appliances or can each include electronically readable item tags or labels . However some items may not have a microchip RFID tag or other radio enabled tag. Some items in load may only include a barcode or QR code on the item label or somewhere on the item. Because these items without a radio enabled tag cannot be automatically read by the RFID reader the user operator can pass these items in front of barcode or QR code scanner . As a result the barcode or QR code scanner can electronically read the item information encoded into the electronically readable item tag of each item. This item information can be transferred to the appliance control module described in more detail below.

Referring again to the top loading clothes washer of an example embodiment is shown to include a display device which can be installed in an upper portion of the washer and easily visible to the user operator. The display device can be a standard a light emitting diode LED display plasma display or other conventional display device. Such display devices are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In a similar fashion the clothes dryer shown in can include a display device which can be installed in the front of the dryer and easily visible to the user operator. The display device can be used to display messages or prompts to the user operator of the appliance. These messages or prompts can be generated by the appliance control module described in more detail below. In some embodiments the display device can be a standard touchscreen display device which accepts user operator inputs and command selections. These user operator inputs and command selections can also be transferred to the appliance control module described in more detail below.

Referring now to the diagram illustrates the system architecture of an example embodiment of the appliance control module . As described above the appliance control module receives item information read from the electronically readable item tags on the items of a load in or near the appliance. The radio enabled tags can be read by the RFID reader . The item information can be received at the appliance control module from the RFID reader by an electronic tag reader interface . Using well known protocols the electronic tag reader interface can receive electronic signals from the RFID reader and convert the received signals to computer readable tag data or item data representing the item information read from the tags . The item information can be passed to a microcontroller . The non radio enabled tags in load can be scanned by the barcode QR code scanner . The item information can be received at the appliance control module from the barcode QR code scanner by an electronic scanner interface . Using well known protocols the electronic scanner interface can receive electronic signals from the barcode QR code scanner and convert the received signals to computer readable tag data or item data representing the item information scanned from the tags . The item information can be passed to the microcontroller .

The microcontroller or controller of an example embodiment generally handles the user operator interface and the automatic control of an appliance based on the item information associated with a load being processed by the appliance. The microcontroller can be a specialized processing module of a particular appliance. Alternatively the microcontroller can be a general data processor of the appliance. The microcontroller can also be implemented using standard discrete logic components semiconductor logic application specific integrated circuits ASIC field programmable gate array FPGA components or any of a variety of conventional electronic components and techniques. In the example embodiment shown in the microcontroller receives item information read from the tags of items in or near an appliance as described above. The microcontroller can aggregate and record the received item data in a configuration data store and logic element for all items in the load being processed by the appliance. The microcontroller can use logic preconfigured into the configuration data store and logic element to generate information displays for presentation to a user operator via the display driver and the display device . For example the microcontroller can automatically generate information displays to suggest washing and or drying settings according to the care instructions read from the electronically readable item tags of the load . If multiple items are present in the appliance the microcontroller can suggest ideal settings based on the aggregated care needs of the items in the appliance and or present a warning that one or more of the items in the load have conflicting care needs. The microcontroller can suggest appliance settings for the user operator to approve or reject. The microcontroller can also provide suggestions such as white clothing should not be washed with dark colored clothing that may bleed or discolor the white clothing. As particular examples for illustration sample information displays generated by microcontroller and presented on display device are shown in . If the user operator doesn t agree with the suggestions presented on the display device by the microcontroller the user operator has the option of selecting their own custom wash or dry. Additionally the user operator can be prompted to automatically add the appropriate amounts of soap fabric softener and bleach based on the load size and clothing types as read from the item tags . If an item is placed in the appliance that shouldn t be included in the load e.g. a dry clean only item or an item that requires a special garment bag a warning can be displayed on the display device to alert the user operator e.g. see . A particular embodiment can also have predefined weight profiles for clothes and can check clothing for forgotten items left in pockets by comparing the weight profiles of items in the load with the current weight of items inside the appliance.

Referring still to the appliance control module of an example embodiment can automatically configure and control the operation of an appliance based on the item information obtained from the electronically readable tags of the items in the load. For appliances that support an application programming interface API provided with an example embodiment the microcontroller can automatically configure the settings of the appliance based on the information read from the electronically readable tags of the items placed into or near the appliance. An appliance interface is provided in a particular embodiment to convert appliance settings or control signals into a form compatible with an API for a particular class of appliances or electrical devices. As a result the microcontroller can generate and issue appliance settings or control commands to configure the operation of an appliance. For example the microcontroller may determine that several delicate garment items have been placed into an appliance e.g. a clothes washer by reading the electronic tags of the items in the load. Based on this determination the microcontroller can use the appliance interface to automatically program the washer to use a wash cycle configured for delicate loads. In this manner an example embodiment can automatically configure the settings and operation of an appliance based on the particular needs or characteristics of the items in a load being processed by the appliance.

Referring still to the appliance control module of an example embodiment can include a network interface and a wireless transceiver . The combination of the network interface and the wireless transceiver enables the appliance control module to be in network communication with a local area network or a wide area network such as the Internet. Using well known network protocols and electrical interfaces the appliance control module and the microcontroller therein can establish a data connection with various network accessible external resources such as servers websites and distributed databases. These external resources can be accessed by the appliance control module to enable the appliance control module to gather additional information related to items detected in a particular load. For example the appliance control module can use item information read from an electronically readable item tag to retrieve additional information pertaining to the item from an external resource. As a result the appliance control module can retrieve a highly detailed set of item information from external resources based on item information read from an electronically readable item tag. The appliance control module can also use the network interface to retrieve a highly detailed set of additional appliance information pertaining to a particular appliance or electrical device being controlled by the appliance control module . The appliance control module can use this additional appliance information to more accurately and robustly control the operation of the appliance. Moreover the appliance control module can use the network interface to retrieve additional configuration data and logic for storage in configuration data and logic store and use by the appliance control module . Additionally the network interface can be used by authorized external network resources to monitor and control the operation of the appliance control module from a remote site. In this manner the appliance control module at one or more sites can be networked together and controlled or monitored by a network host.

In various alternative embodiments the appliance control module as described herein can be adapted for a variety of electrical or electronic devices appliances or other electrical equipment such as clothes washers clothes dryers steam cleaners industrial clothes presses dishwashers refrigerators or other types of appliances. The items placed into or with these appliances can be electronically tagged as described above. As also described above the operation of the appliances can be automatically configured based on the specific item information read by the appliance control module from the items placed into or with the appliances. In this manner the appliances can be configured to alert a user operator regarding a variety of conditions. For example in the case of a refrigerator an embodiment can alert a user operator regarding food items that are about to expire or food items that may be hazardous if consumed in a raw form. Additionally the user operator can be alerted regarding issues related to safety storage and disposal. As described above the various embodiments can also configure the operation of the appliances based on the specific item information read from the electronic tags on each item. As a result the various embodiments described herein provide systems and methods for electronically tagging items for use in controlling electrical devices.

In other alternative embodiments the embedding of electronically readable item tags or labels into apparel can provide corporations and retailers with more opportunities and information to increase sales. When a consumer walks into a store the retailer can collect sizing information that allows sales associates to guide customers to certain sections of the store. The embedding of electronically readable item tags or labels into apparel can also allow retailers to offer special sales for repeat customers or even a discount if the individual is already wearing a product that was recently purchased. This allows for a more personalized and tailored shopping experience. In addition to an improved customer experience the inventory process can be improved and simplified using a wand that can read the electronically readable item tags or labels. A retailer can pass the wand over clothing racks and shelves to get sizing color and quantity information for all the products based on the tag information read from the electronically readable item tags or labels.

In addition to the advantages of the disclosed embodiments for corporations or retailers consumers can also obtain value from the embedding of electronically readable item tags or labels into apparel as disclosed herein. For example consumers can scan items while shopping to obtain tag information from the electronically readable item tags or labels attached to products of interest. The tag information can inform the consumer as to the materials used in the manufacture of products their origins dyes used sizing information comparison to previous purchases wash instructions reviews etc. This would provide consumers more control over the purchases they make and would even help them to find items similar to previous purchases if the previously purchased items are old and worn out. Consumers worried about environmental conditions associated with the manufacturing of their clothing can find instantaneous information on the factory conditions where the garment was made as well as the sourcing of materials to avoid areas of conflict. This can help to improve work conditions the use of sustainable materials and reduction of pollution due to chemical processes used during manufacturing.

Thus the example embodiments described herein provide a technical solution to a technical problem. The various embodiments improve the functioning of a variety of classes of appliances by providing electronic tagging of items used in controlling the operation of electrical devices such as appliances. The various embodiments also serve to transform the operational state of appliances to a different and improved state by virtue of the variety of manipulations modifications and or controls applied to the appliances based on the item information read from the item tags. Additionally the various embodiments effect an improvement in a variety of technical fields including the fields of appliance control home computing information sharing and device communications.
