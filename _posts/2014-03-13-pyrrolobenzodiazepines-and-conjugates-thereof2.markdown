The present invention relates to pyrrolobenzodiazepines PBDs in particular pyrrolobenzodiazepines having a linker group connected to a cell binding agent.

Some pyrrolobenzodiazepines PBDs have the ability to recognise and bond to specific sequences of DNA the preferred sequence is PuGPu. The first PBD antitumour antibiotic anthramycin was discovered in 1965 Leimgruber et al. 87 5793 5795 1965 Leimgruber et al 87 5791 5793 1965 . Since then a number of naturally occurring PBDs have been reported and over 10 synthetic routes have been developed to a variety of analogues Thurston et al. 1994 433 465 1994 Antonow D. and Thurston D. E. Chem. Rev. 2011 111 4 2815 2864 . Family members include abbeymycin Hochlowski et al. 40 145 148 1987 chicamycin Konishi et al. 37 200 206 1984 DC 81 Japanese Patent 58 180 487 Thurston et al. 26 767 772 1990 Bose et al. 48 751 758 1992 mazethramycin Kuminoto et al. 33 665 667 1980 neothramycins A and B Takeuchi et al. 29 93 96 1976 porothramycin Tsunakawa et al. 41 1366 1373 1988 prothracarcin Shimizu et al 29 2492 2503 1982 Langley and Thurston 52 91 97 1987 sibanomicin DC 102 Hara et al. 41 702 704 1988 Itoh et al. 41 1281 1284 1988 sibiromycin Leber et al. 110 2992 2993 1988 and tomamycin Arima et al. 25 437 444 1972 . PBDs are of the general structure 

They differ in the number type and position of substituents in both their aromatic A rings and pyrrolo C rings and in the degree of saturation of the C ring. In the B ring there is either an imine N C a carbinolamine NH CH OH or a carbinolamine methyl ether NH CH OMe at the N10 C11 position which is the electrophilic centre responsible for alkylating DNA. All of the known natural products have an S configuration at the chiral C11a position which provides them with a right handed twist when viewed from the C ring towards the A ring. This gives them the appropriate three dimensional shape for isohelicity with the minor groove of B form DNA leading to a snug fit at the binding site Kohn In . Springer Verlag New York pp. 3 11 1975 Hurley and Needham VanDevanter 19 230 237 1986 . Their ability to form an adduct in the minor groove enables them to interfere with DNA processing hence their use as antitumour agents.

A particularly advantageous pyrrolobenzodiazepine compound is described by Gregson et al. 1999 797 798 as compound 1 and by Gregson et al. 2001 44 1161 1174 as compound 4a. This compound also known as SJG 136 is shown below 

Other dimeric PBD compounds such as those bearing C2 aryl substituents in WO 2005 085251 have been disclosed an example being 

Antibody therapy has been established for the targeted treatment of patients with cancer immunological and angiogenic disorders Carter P. 2006 Nature Reviews Immunology 6 343 357 . The use of antibody drug conjugates ADC i.e. immunoconjugates for the local delivery of cytotoxic or cytostatic agents i.e. drugs to kill or inhibit tumor cells in the treatment of cancer targets delivery of the drug moiety to tumors and intracellular accumulation therein whereas systemic administration of these unconjugated drug agents may result in unacceptable levels of toxicity to normal cells as well as the tumor cells sought to be eliminated Xie et al 2006 6 3 281 291 Kovtun et al 2006 66 6 3214 3121 Law et al 2006 66 4 2328 2337 Wu et al 2005 23 9 1137 1145 Lambert J. 2005 5 543 549 Hamann P. 2005 15 9 1087 1103 Payne G. 2003 3 207 212 Trail et al 2003 52 328 337 Syrigos and Epenetos 1999 19 605 614 .

Maximal efficacy with minimal toxicity is sought thereby. Efforts to design and refine ADC have focused on the selectivity of monoclonal antibodies mAbs as well as drug mechanism of action drug linking drug antibody ratio loading and drug releasing properties Junutula et al. 2008b Nature Biotech. 26 8 925 932 Dornan et al 2009 114 13 2721 2729 U.S. Pat. No. 7 521 541 U.S. Pat. No. 7 723 485 WO2009 052249 McDonagh 2006 Protein Eng. Design Sel. 19 7 299 307 Doronina et al 2006 Bioconj. Chem. 17 114 124 Erickson et al 2006 66 8 1 8 Sanderson et al 2005 11 843 852 Jeffrey et al 2005 48 1344 1358 Hamblett et al 2004 10 7063 7070 . Drug moieties may impart their cytotoxic and cytostatic effects by mechanisms including tubulin binding DNA binding or topoisomerase inhibition. Some cytotoxic drugs tend to be inactive or less active when conjugated to large antibodies or protein receptor ligands.

Dimeric PBDs have been disclosed as the drugs in drug conjugates. For example in WO 2011 130598 dimer PBD compounds having linker groups for connection to a cell binding agent such as an antibody are disclosed where the linker group is attached to one of the available N10 positions and are generally cleaved by action of an enzyme on the linker group.

By contrast in WO 2011 130613 and WO 2011 130616 dimer PBD compounds having linker groups for connection to a cell binding agent such as an antibody are disclosed where the linker group is attached via an aromatic group at one of the C2 positions and are generally cleaved by action of an enzyme on the linker group. Such antibody drug conjugates are also described in Flygare J. et al 81 113 121 2013 which also describes other types of antibody drug conjugates.

A further approach is described in WO 2007 085930 wherein tomamycin like dimers have a linker group for connection to a cell binding agent such as an antibody where the linker group is attached to the tether between the tomamycin units and are generally cleaved by action of an enzyme on the linker group.

The present inventors have developed a novel approach to forming PBD conjugates with cell binding agents and in particular PBD antibody conjugates.

in a general aspect the present invention provides a conjugate comprising a PBD dimer compound with a linker for connecting to a cell binding agent wherein the linker has a triazole piperazine propargylene or oxime group attached to a phenylene or pyriydylene in the bridge linking the two PBD monomers.

L is a linker connected to the cell binding agent in the conjugate compound. G is a reactive group for connecting the PBD dimer to the cell binding agent to form the conjugate compound.

Preferably the linker reactive group contains an electrophilic functional group for reaction with a nucleophilic functional group on the cell binding agent. Nucleophilic groups on antibodies include but are not limited to i N terminal amine groups ii side chain amine groups e.g. lysine iii side chain thiol groups e.g. cysteine and iv sugar hydroxyl or amino groups where the antibody is glycosylated. Amine thiol and hydroxyl groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including i maleimide groups ii activated disulfides iii active esters such as NHS N hydroxysuccinirmide esters HOBt N hydroxybenzotriazole esters haloformates and acid halides iv alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides and v aldehydes ketones carboxyl and some of which are exemplified as follows 

Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT dithiothreitol . Each cysteine bridge will thus form theoretically two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through the reaction of lysines with 2 iminothiolane Traut s reagent resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol. Reactive thiol groups may be introduced into the antibody or fragment thereof by introducing one two three four or more cysteine residues e.g. preparing mutant antibodies comprising one or more non native cysteine amino acid residues . U.S. Pat. No. 7 521 541 teaches engineering antibodies by introduction of reactive cysteine amino acids. In some embodiments a Linker has a reactive nucleophilic group which is reactive with an electrophilic group present on an antibody. Useful electrophilic groups on an antibody include but are not limited to aldehyde and ketone carbonyl groups. The heteroatom of a nucleophilic group of a Linker can react with an electrophilic group on an antibody and form a covalent bond to an antibody unit. Useful nucleophilic groups on a Linker include but are not limited to hydrazide oxime amino hydroxyl hydrazine thiosemicarbazone hydrazine carboxylate and arylhydrazide. The electrophilic group on an antibody provides a convenient site for attachment to a Linker.

In one embodiment the connection between the cell binding agent and L is through a thiol residue of the cell binding agent and a maleimide group of L.

Other dipeptide combinations may be used including those described by Dubowchik et al. 2002 13 855 869 which is incorporated herein by reference.

In one embodiment the amino acid side chain is derivatised where appropriate. For example an amino group or carboxy group of an amino acid side chain may be derivatised. In one embodiment an amino group NHof a side chain amino acid such as lysine is a derivatised form selected from the group consisting of NHR and NRR .

In one embodiment a carboxy group COOH of a side chain amino acid such as aspartic acid is a derivatised form selected from the group consisting of COOR CONH CONHR and CONRR .

In one embodiment the amino acid side chain is chemically protected where appropriate. The side chain protecting group may be a group as discussed below in relation to the group R. The present inventors have established that protected amino acid sequences are cleavable by enzymes. For example it has been established that a dipeptide sequence comprising a Boc side chain protected Lys residue is cleavable by cathepsin.

Protecting groups for the side chains of amino acids are well known in the art and are described in the Novabiochem Catalog. Additional protecting group strategies are set out in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis Greene and Wuts.

Possible side chain protecting groups are shown below for those amino acids having reactive side chain functionality 

In one embodiment R is independently selected from optionally substituted Calkyl Cheterocyclyl and Caryl groups. These groups are each defined in the substituents section below.

In some embodiments of the invention there is provided a compound having a substituent group NRR . In one embodiment R and R together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached form an optionally substituted 4 5 6 or 7 membered heterocyclic ring. The ring may contain a further heteroatom for example N O or S.

In one embodiment the heterocyclic ring is itself substituted with a group R. Where a further N heteroatom is present the substituent may be on the N heteroatom.

A cell binding agent may be of any kind and include peptides and non peptides. These can include antibodies or a fragment of an antibody that contains at least one binding site lymphokines hormones growth factors nutrient transport molecules or any other cell binding molecule or substance.

The term antibody herein is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal antibodies polyclonal antibodies dimers multimers multispecific antibodies e.g. bispecific antibodies and antibody fragments so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity Miller et al 2003 170 4854 4861 . Antibodies may be murine human humanized chimeric or derived from other species. An antibody is a protein generated by the immune system that is capable of recognizing and binding to a specific antigen. Janeway C. Travers P. Walport M. Shlomchik 2001 5. Garland Publishing New York . A target antigen generally has numerous binding sites also called epitopes recognized by CDRs on multiple antibodies. Each antibody that specifically binds to a different epitope has a different structure. Thus one antigen may have more than one corresponding antibody. An antibody includes a full length immunoglobulin molecule or an immunologically active portion of a full length immunoglobulin molecule i.e. a molecule that contains an antigen binding site that immunospecifically binds an antigen of a target of interest or part thereof such targets including but not limited to cancer cell or cells that produce autoimmune antibodies associated with an autoimmune disease. The immunoglobulin can be of any type e.g. IgG IgE IgM IgD and IgA class e.g. IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 IgG4 IgA1 and IgA2 or subclass of immunoglobulin molecule. The immunoglobulins can be derived from any species including human murine or rabbit origin.

 Antibody fragments comprise a portion of a full length antibody generally the antigen binding or variable region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab Fab F ab and Fv fragments diabodies linear antibodies fragments produced by a Fab expression library anti idiotypic anti Id antibodies CDR complementary determining region and epitope binding fragments of any of the above which immunospecifically bind to cancer cell antigens viral antigens or microbial antigens single chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.

The term monoclonal antibody as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies i.e. the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which include different antibodies directed against different determinants epitopes each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they may be synthesized uncontaminated by other antibodies. The modifier monoclonal indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al 1975 256 495 or may be made by recombinant DNA methods see U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 . The monoclonal antibodies may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al 1991 Nature 352 624 628 Marks et al 1991 J. Mol. Biol. 222 581 597.

The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include chimeric antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass while the remainder of the chain s is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass as well as fragments of such antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 and Morrison et al 1984 . USA 81 6851 6855 . Chimeric antibodies include primatized antibodies comprising variable domain antigen binding sequences derived from a non human primate e.g. Old World Monkey or Ape and human constant region sequences.

An intact antibody herein is one comprising a VL and VH domains as well as a light chain constant domain CL and heavy chain constant domains CH CHand CH. The constant domains may be native sequence constant domains e.g. human native sequence constant domains or amino acid sequence variant thereof. The intact antibody may have one or more effector functions which refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region of an antibody. Examples of antibody effector functions include C1q binding complement dependent cytotoxicity Fc receptor binding antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC phagocytosis and down regulation of cell surface receptors such as B cell receptor and BCR.

Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains intact antibodies can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of intact antibodies IgA IgD IgE IgG and IgM and several of these may be further divided into subclasses isotypes e.g. IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 IgG4 IgA and IgA2. The heavy chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of antibodies are called and respectively. The subunit structures and three dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known.

Examples of cell binding agents include those agents described for use in WO 2007 085930 which is incorporated herein.

The cell binding agent may be or comprise a polypeptide. The polypeptide may be a cyclic polypeptide. The cell binding agent may be antibody. Thus in one embodiment the present invention provides an antibody drug conjugate ADC .

The drug loading is the average number of PBD drugs per antibody. Drug loading may range from 1 to 8 drugs D per antibody Ab i.e. where 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 drug moieties are covalently attached to the antibody. Compositions of ADC include collections of antibodies conjugated with a range of drugs from 1 to 8. The average number of drugs per antibody in preparations of ADC from conjugation reactions may be characterized by conventional means such as mass spectroscopy ELISA assay electrophoresis and HPLC. The quantitative distribution of ADC in terms of p may also be determined. By ELISA the averaged value of p in a particular preparation of ADC may be determined Hamblett et al 2004 Clin. Cancer Res. 10 7063 7070 Sanderson et al 2005 Clin. Cancer Res. 11 843 852 . However the distribution of p drug values is not discernible by the antibody antigen binding and detection limitation of ELISA. Also ELISA assay for detection of antibody drug conjugates does not determine where the drug moieties are attached to the antibody such as the heavy chain or light chain fragments or the particular amino acid residues. In some instances separation purification and characterization of homogeneous ADC where p is a certain value from ADC with other drug loadings may be achieved by means such as reverse phase HPLC or electrophoresis.

For some antibody drug conjugates p may be limited by the number of attachment sites on the antibody. For example an antibody may have only one or several cysteine thiol groups or may have only one or several sufficiently reactive thiol groups through which a linker may be attached. Higher drug loading e.g. p 5 may cause aggregation insolubility toxicity or loss of cellular permeability of certain antibody drug conjugates.

Typically fewer than the theoretical maximum of drug moieties are conjugated to an antibody during a conjugation reaction. An antibody may contain for example many lysine residues that do not react with the drug linker intermediate D L or linker reagent. Only the most reactive lysine groups may react with an amine reactive linker reagent. Also only the most reactive cysteine thiol groups may react with a thiol reactive linker reagent. Generally antibodies do not contain many if any free and reactive cysteine thiol groups which may be linked to a drug moiety. Most cysteine thiol residues in the antibodies of the compounds exist as disulfide bridges and must be reduced with a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol DTT or TCEP under partial or total reducing conditions. The loading drug antibody ratio of an ADC may be controlled in several different manners including i limiting the molar excess of drug linker intermediate D L or linker reagent relative to antibody ii limiting the conjugation reaction time or temperature and iii partial or limiting reductive conditions for cysteine thiol modification.

Cysteine amino acids may be engineered at reactive sites in an antibody and which do not form intrachain or intermolecular disulfide linkages Junutula et al. 2008b Nature Biotech. 26 8 925 932 Dornan et al 2009 Blood 114 13 2721 2729 U.S. Pat. No. 7 521 541 U.S. Pat. No. 7 723 485 WO2009 052249 Shen et al 2012 Nature Biotech. 30 2 184 191 Junutula et al 2008 Jour of Immun. Methods 332 41 52 . The engineered cysteine thiols may react with linker reagents or the drug linker reagents of the present invention which have thiol reactive electrophilic groups such as maleimide or alpha halo amides to form ADO with cysteine engineered antibodies ThioMabs and the PBD drug moieties. The location of the drug moiety can thus be designed controlled and known. The drug loading can be controlled since the engineered cysteine thiol groups typically react with thiol reactive linker reagents or drug linker reagents in high yield. Engineering an IgG antibody to introduce a cysteine amino acid by substitution at a single site on the heavy or light chain gives two new cysteines on the symmetrical antibody. A drug loading near 2 can be achieved and near homogeneity of the conjugation product ADC.

Where more than one nucleophilic or electrophilic group of the antibody reacts with a drug linker intermediate or linker reagent followed by drug moiety reagent then the resulting product is a mixture of ADC compounds with a distribution of drug moieties attached to an antibody e.g. 1 2 3 etc. Liquid chromatography methods such as polymeric reverse phase PLRP and hydrophobic interaction HIC may separate compounds in the mixture by drug loading value. Preparations of ADC with a single drug loading value p may be isolated however these single loading value ADCs may still be heterogeneous mixtures because the drug moieties may be attached via the linker at different sites on the antibody.

Thus the antibody drug conjugate compositions of the invention include mixtures of antibody drug conjugate compounds where the antibody has one or more PBD drug moieties and where the drug moieties may be attached to the antibody at various amino acid residues.

In one embodiment the average number of dimer pyrrolobenzodiazepine groups per cell binding agent is in the range 1 to 20. In some embodiments the range is selected from 1 to 8 2 to 8 2 to 6 2 to 4 and 4 to 8.

In one embodiment the cell binding agent is a linear or cyclic peptide comprising 4 20 preferably 6 20 contiguous amino acid residues. In this embodiment it is preferred that one cell binding agent is linked to one monomer or dimer pyrrolobenzodiazepine compound.

In one embodiment the cell binding agent comprises a peptide that binds integrin . The peptide may be selective for over XYS.

In one embodiment the cell binding agent comprises the A20FMDV Cys polypeptide. The A20FMDV Cys has the sequence NAVPNLRGDLQVLAQKVARTC SEQ ID NO 7. Alternatively a variant of the A20FMDV Cys sequence may be used wherein one two three four five six seven eight nine or ten amino acid residues is substituted with another amino acid residue.

In one embodiment the antibody is a monoclonal antibody chimeric antibody humanized antibody fully human antibody or a single chain antibody. One embodiment the antibody is a fragment of one of these antibodies having biological activity. Examples of such fragments include Fab Fab F ab and Fv fragments.

In these embodiments each antibody may be linked to one or several dimer pyrrolobenzodiazepine groups. The preferred ratios of pyrrolobenzodiazepine to cell binding agent are given above.

Antibodies for use in the present invention include those antibodies described in WO 2005 082023 which is incorporated herein. Particularly preferred are those antibodies for tumour associated antigens. Examples of those antigens known in the art include but are not limited to those tumour associated antigens set out in WO 2005 082023. See for instance pages 41 55.

The conjugates of the invention are designed to target tumour cells via their cell surface antigens. The antigens are usually normal cell surface antigens which are either over expressed or expressed at abnormal times. Ideally the target antigen is expressed only on proliferative cells preferably tumour cells however this is rarely observed in practice. As a result target antigens are usually selected on the basis of differential expression between proliferative and healthy tissue.

Tumor associated antigens TAA are known in the art and can prepared for use in generating antibodies using methods and information which are well known in the art. In attempts to discover effective cellular targets for cancer diagnosis and therapy researchers have sought to identify transmembrane or otherwise tumor associated polypeptides that are specifically expressed on the surface of one or more particular type s of cancer cell as compared to on one or more normal non cancerous cell s . Often such tumor associated polypeptides are more abundantly expressed on the surface of the cancer cells as compared to on the surface of the non cancerous cells. The identification of such tumor associated cell surface antigen polypeptides has given rise to the ability to specifically target cancer cells for destruction via antibody based therapies.

Examples of TAA include but are not limited to TAA 1 36 listed below. For convenience information relating to these antigens all of which are known in the art is listed below and includes names alternative names Genbank accession numbers and primary reference s following nucleic acid and protein sequence identification conventions of the National Center for Biotechnology Information NCBI . Nucleic acid and protein sequences corresponding to TAA 1 36 are available in public databases such as GenBank. Tumor associated antigens targeted by antibodies include all amino acid sequence variants and isoforms possessing at least about 70 80 85 90 or 95 sequence identity relative to the sequences identified in the cited references or which exhibit substantially the same biological properties or characteristics as a TAA having a sequence found in the cited references. For example a TAA having a variant sequence generally is able to bind specifically to an antibody that binds specifically to the TAA with the corresponding sequence listed. The sequences and disclosure in the reference specifically recited herein are expressly incorporated by reference.

It may be convenient or desirable to prepare purify and or handle a corresponding salt of the active compound for example a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are discussed in Berge et al. 66 1 19 1977 .

For example if the compound is anionic or has a functional group which may be anionic e.g. COOH may be COO then a salt may be formed with a suitable cation. Examples of suitable inorganic cations include but are not limited to alkali metal ions such as Na and K alkaline earth cations such as Caand Mg and other cations such as Al.

If the solvent is water the solvate may be conveniently referred to as a hydrate for example a mono hydrate a di hydrate a tri hydrate etc.

The invention includes compounds where a solvent adds across the imine bond of the PBD moiety which is illustrated below where the solvent is water or an alcohol ROH where Ris Calkyl 

These forms can be called the carbinolamine and carbinolamine ether forms of the PBD as described in the section relating to Rabove . The balance of these equilibria depend on the conditions in which the compounds are found as well as the nature of the moiety itself.

Certain compounds of the invention may exist in one or more particular geometric optical enantiomeric diasteriomeric epimeric atropic stereoisomeric tautomeric conformational or anomeric forms including but not limited to cis and trans forms E and Z forms c t and r forms endo and exo forms R S and meso forms D and L forms d and I forms and forms keto enol and enolate forms syn and anti forms synclinal and anticlinal forms and forms axial and equatorial forms boat chair twist envelope and halfchair forms and combinations thereof hereinafter collectively referred to as isomers or isomeric forms .

The term stereoisomers refers to compounds which have identical chemical constitution but differ with regard to the arrangement of the atoms or groups in space.

 Diastereomer refers to a stereoisomer with two or more centers of chirality and whose molecules are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have different physical properties e.g. melting points boiling points spectral properties and reactivities. Mixtures of diastereomers may separate under high resolution analytical procedures such as electrophoresis and chromatography.

 Enantiomers refer to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non superimposable mirror images of one another.

Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker Ed. 1984 McGraw Hill Book Company New York and Eliel E. and Wilen S. Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds John Wiley Sons Inc. New York 1994. The compounds of the invention may contain asymmetric or chiral centers and therefore exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of the invention including but not limited to diastereomers enantiomers and atropisomers as well as mixtures thereof such as racemic mixtures form part of the present invention. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms i.e. they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane polarized light. In describing an optically active compound the prefixes D and L or R and S are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center s . The prefixes d and l or and are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane polarized light by the compound with or l meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50 50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms racemic mixture and racemate refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species devoid of optical activity.

Note that except as discussed below for tautomeric forms specifically excluded from the term isomers as used herein are structural or constitutional isomers i.e. isomers which differ in the connections between atoms rather than merely by the position of atoms in space . For example a reference to a methoxy group OCH is not to be construed as a reference to its structural isomer a hydroxymethyl group CHOH. Similarly a reference to ortho chlorophenyl is not to be construed as a reference to its structural isomer meta chlorophenyl. However a reference to a class of structures may well include structurally isomeric forms falling within that class e.g. Calkyl includes n propyl and iso propyl butyl includes n iso sec and tert butyl methoxyphenyl includes ortho meta and para methoxyphenyl .

The above exclusion does not pertain to tautomeric forms for example keto enol and enolate forms as in for example the following tautomeric pairs keto enol illustrated below imine enamine amide imino alcohol amidine amidine nitroso oxime thioketone enethiol N nitroso hyroxyazo and nitro aci nitro.

The term tautomer or tautomeric form refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example proton tautomers also known as prototropic tautomers include interconversions via migration of a proton such as keto enol and imine enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons.

Note that specifically included in the term isomer are compounds with one or more isotopic substitutions. For example H may be in any isotopic form including H H D and H T C may be in any isotopic form including C C and C O may be in any isotopic form including O and O and the like.

Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen carbon nitrogen oxygen phosphorous fluorine and chlorine such as but not limited to H deuterium D H tritium C C C N F P P S Cl and I. Various isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as 3H 13C and 14C are incorporated. Such isotopically labelled compounds may be useful in metabolic studies reaction kinetic studies detection or imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography PET or single photon emission computed tomography SPECT including drug or substrate tissue distribution assays or in radioactive treatment of patients. Deuterium labelled or substituted therapeutic compounds of the invention may have improved DMPK drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics properties relating to distribution metabolism and excretion ADME . Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability for example increased in vivo half life or reduced dosage requirements. An 18F labeled compound may be useful for PET or SPECT studies. Isotopically labeled compounds of this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the schemes or in the examples and preparations described below by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non isotopically labeled reagent. Further substitution with heavier isotopes particularly deuterium i.e. 2H or D may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability for example increased in vivo half life or reduced dosage requirements or an improvement in therapeutic index. It is understood that deuterium in this context is regarded as a substituent. The concentration of such a heavier isotope specifically deuterium may be defined by an isotopic enrichment factor. In the compounds of this invention any atom not specifically designated as a particular isotope is meant to represent any stable isotope of that atom.

Unless otherwise specified a reference to a particular compound includes all such isomeric forms including wholly or partially racemic and other mixtures thereof. Methods for the preparation e.g. asymmetric synthesis and separation e.g. fractional crystallisation and chromatographic means of such isomeric forms are either known in the art or are readily obtained by adapting the methods taught herein or known methods in a known manner.

Generally the cytotoxic or cytostatic activity of an antibody drug conjugate ADC is measured by exposing mammalian cells having receptor proteins e.g. HER2 to the antibody of the ADC in a cell culture medium culturing the cells for a period from about 6 hours to about 5 days and measuring cell viability. Cell based in vitro assays are used to measure viability proliferation cytotoxicity and induction of apoptosis caspase activation of an ADC of the invention.

The in vitro potency of antibody drug conjugates can be measured by a cell proliferation assay. The CellTiter Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay is a commercially available Promega Corp. Madison Wis. homogeneous assay method based on the recombinant expression of luciferase U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 583 024 5 674 713 and 5 700 670 . This cell proliferation assay determines the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of the ATP present an indicator of metabolically active cells Crouch et al 1993 160 81 88 U.S. Pat. No. 6 602 677 . The CellTiter Glo Assay is conducted in 96 well format making it amenable to automated high throughput screening HTS Cree et al 1995 6 398 404 . The homogeneous assay procedure involves adding the single reagent CellTiter Glo Reagent directly to cells cultured in serum supplemented medium. Cell washing removal of medium and multiple pipetting steps are not required. The system detects as few as 15 cells well in a 384 well format in 10 minutes after adding reagent and mixing. The cells may be treated continuously with ADC or they may be treated and separated from ADC. Generally cells treated briefly i.e. 3 hours showed the same potency effects as continuously treated cells.

The homogeneous add mix measure format results in cell lysis and generation of a luminescent signal proportional to the amount of ATP present. The amount of ATP is directly proportional to the number of cells present in culture. The CellTiter Glo Assay generates a glow type luminescent signal produced by the luciferase reaction which has a half life generally greater than five hours depending on cell type and medium used. Viable cells are reflected in relative luminescence units RLU . The substrate Beetle Luciferin is oxidatively decarboxylated by recombinant firefly luciferase with concomitant conversion of ATP to AMP and generation of photons.

The in vitro potency of antibody drug conjugates can also be measured by a cytotoxicity assay. Cultured adherent cells are washed with PBS detached with trypsin diluted in complete medium containing 10 FCS centrifuged re suspended in fresh medium and counted with a haemocytometer. Suspension cultures are counted directly. Monodisperse cell suspensions suitable for counting may require agitation of the suspension by repeated aspiration to break up cell clumps.

The cell suspension is diluted to the desired seeding density and dispensed 100 l per well into black 96 well plates. Plates of adherent cell lines are incubated overnight to allow adherence. Suspension cell cultures can be used on the day of seeding.

A stock solution 1 ml of ADC 20 g ml is made in the appropriate cell culture medium. Serial 10 fold dilutions of stock ADC are made in 15 ml centrifuge tubes by serially transferring 100 l to 900 l of cell culture medium.

Four replicate wells of each ADC dilution 100 l are dispensed in 96 well black plates previously plated with cell suspension 100 l resulting in a final volume of 200 l. Control wells receive cell culture medium 100 l .

If the doubling time of the cell line is greater than 30 hours ADC incubation is for 5 days otherwise a four day incubation is done.

At the end of the incubation period cell viability is assessed with the Alamar blue assay. AlamarBlue Invitrogen is dispensed over the whole plate 20 l per well and incubated for 4 hours. Alamar blue fluorescence is measured at excitation 570 nm emission 585 nm on the Varioskan flash plate reader. Percentage cell survival is calculated from the mean fluorescence in the ADC treated wells compared to the mean fluorescence in the control wells.

The in vivo efficacy of antibody drug conjugates ADC of the invention can be measured by tumor xenograft studies in mice. For example the in vivo efficacy of an anti HER2 ADC of the invention can be measured by a high expressing HER2 transgenic explant mouse model. An allograft is propagated from the Fo5 mmtv transgenic mouse which does not respond to or responds poorly to HERCEPTIN therapy. Subjects were treated once with ADC at certain dose levels mg kg and PBD drug exposure g m and placebo buffer control Vehicle and monitored over two weeks or more to measure the time to tumor doubling log cell kill and tumor shrinkage.

The target location is preferably a proliferative cell population. The antibody is an antibody for an antigen present in a proliferative cell population.

In one embodiment the antigen is absent or present at a reduced level in a non proliferative cell population compared to the amount of antigen present in the proliferative cell population for example a tumour cell population.

The antibody drug conjugate ADC compounds of the invention include those with utility for anticancer activity. In particular the compounds include an antibody conjugated i.e. covalently attached by a linker to a PBD moiety.

At the target location the linker may not be cleaved. The antibody drug conjugate ADC compounds of the invention may have a cytotoxic effect without the cleavage of the linker to release a PBD drug moiety. The antibody drug conjugates ADC of the invention selectively deliver cytotoxic agent to tumor tissue whereby greater selectivity i.e. a lower efficacious dose may be achieved.

Thus in one aspect the present invention provides a conjugate compound as described herein for use in therapy.

In a further aspect there is also provides a conjugate compound as described herein for use in the treatment of a proliferative disease. A second aspect of the present invention provides the use of a conjugate compound in the manufacture of a medicament for treating a proliferative disease.

One of ordinary skill in the art is readily able to determine whether or not a candidate conjugate treats a proliferative condition for any particular cell type. For example assays which may conveniently be used to assess the activity offered by a particular compound are described in the examples below.

The term proliferative disease pertains to an unwanted or uncontrolled cellular proliferation of excessive or abnormal cells which is undesired such as neoplastic or hyperplastic growth whether in vitro or in vivo.

Examples of proliferative conditions include but are not limited to benign pre malignant and malignant cellular proliferation including but not limited to neoplasms and tumours e.g. histocytoma glioma astrocyoma osteoma cancers e.g. lung cancer small cell lung cancer gastrointestinal cancer bowel cancer colon cancer breast carinoma ovarian carcinoma prostate cancer testicular cancer liver cancer kidney cancer bladder cancer pancreas cancer brain cancer sarcoma osteosarcoma Kaposi s sarcoma melanoma leukemias psoriasis bone diseases fibroproliferative disorders e.g. of connective tissues and atherosclerosis. Cancers of particular interest include but are not limited to leukemias and ovarian cancers.

Any type of cell may be treated including but not limited to lung gastrointestinal including e.g. bowel colon breast mammary ovarian prostate liver hepatic kidney renal bladder pancreas brain and skin.

It is contemplated that the antibody drug conjugates ADC of the present invention may be used to treat various diseases or disorders e.g. characterized by the overexpression of a tumor antigen. Exemplary conditions or hyperproliferative disorders include benign or malignant tumors leukemia haematological and lymphoid malignancies. Others include neuronal glial astrocytal hypothalamic glandular macrophagal epithelial stromal blastocoelic inflammatory angiogenic and immunologic including autoimmune disorders.

Generally the disease or disorder to be treated is a hyperproliferative disease such as cancer.

Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders granules and tablets.

It will be appreciated by one of skill in the art that appropriate dosages of the conjugate compound and compositions comprising the conjugate compound can vary from patient to patient. Determining the optimal dosage will generally involve the balancing of the level of therapeutic benefit against any risk or deleterious side effects. The selected dosage level will depend on a variety of factors including but not limited to the activity of the particular compound the route of administration the time of administration the rate of excretion of the compound the duration of the treatment other drugs compounds and or materials used in combination the severity of the condition and the species sex age weight condition general health and prior medical history of the patient. The amount of compound and route of administration will ultimately be at the discretion of the physician veterinarian or clinician although generally the dosage will be selected to achieve local concentrations at the site of action which achieve the desired effect without causing substantial harmful or deleterious side effects.

Administration can be effected in one dose continuously or intermittently e.g. in divided doses at appropriate intervals throughout the course of treatment. Methods of determining the most effective means and dosage of administration are well known to those of skill in the art and will vary with the formulation used for therapy the purpose of the therapy the target cell s being treated and the subject being treated. Single or multiple administrations can be carried out with the dose level and pattern being selected by the treating physician veterinarian or clinician.

In general a suitable dose of the active compound is in the range of about 100 ng to about 25 mg more typically about 1 g to about 10 mg per kilogram body weight of the subject per day. Where the active compound is a salt an ester an amide a prodrug or the like the amount administered is calculated on the basis of the parent compound and so the actual weight to be used is increased proportionately.

In one embodiment the active compound is administered to a human patient according to the following dosage regime about 100 mg 3 times daily.

In one embodiment the active compound is administered to a human patient according to the following dosage regime about 150 mg 2 times daily.

However in one embodiment the conjugate compound is administered to a human patient according to the following dosage regime about 50 or about 75 mg 3 or 4 times daily.

In one embodiment the conjugate compound is administered to a human patient according to the following dosage regime about 100 or about 125 mg 2 times daily.

The dosage amounts described above may apply to the conjugate including the PBD moiety and the linker to the antibody or to the effective amount of PBD compound provided for example the amount of compound that is releasable after cleavage of the linker.

For the prevention or treatment of disease the appropriate dosage of an ADC of the invention will depend on the type of disease to be treated as defined above the severity and course of the disease whether the molecule is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes previous therapy the patient s clinical history and response to the antibody and the discretion of the attending physician. The molecule is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease about 1 g kg to 15 mg kg e.g. 0.1 20 mg kg of molecule is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient whether for example by one or more separate administrations or by continuous infusion. A typical daily dosage might range from about 1 g kg to 100 mg kg or more depending on the factors mentioned above. An exemplary dosage of ADC to be administered to a patient is in the range of about 0.1 to about 10 mg kg of patient weight. For repeated administrations over several days or longer depending on the condition the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises a course of administering an initial loading dose of about 4 mg kg followed by additional doses every week two weeks or three weeks of an ADC. Other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.

The term treatment as used herein in the context of treating a condition pertains generally to treatment and therapy whether of a human or an animal e.g. in veterinary applications in which some desired therapeutic effect is achieved for example the inhibition of the progress of the condition and includes a reduction in the rate of progress a halt in the rate of progress regression of the condition amelioration of the condition and cure of the condition. Treatment as a prophylactic measure i.e. prophylaxis prevention is also included.

The term therapeutically effective amount as used herein pertains to that amount of an active compound or a material composition or dosage from comprising an active compound which is effective for producing some desired therapeutic effect commensurate with a reasonable benefit risk ratio when administered in accordance with a desired treatment regimen.

Similarly the term prophylactically effective amount as used herein pertains to that amount of an active compound or a material composition or dosage from comprising an active compound which is effective for producing some desired prophylactic effect commensurate with a reasonable benefit risk ratio when administered in accordance with a desired treatment regimen.

Antibody drug conjugates may be prepared by several routes employing organic chemistry reactions conditions and reagents known to those skilled in the art including 1 reaction of a nucleophilic group of an antibody with a bivalent linker reagent to form antibody linker intermediate Ab L via a covalent bond followed by reaction with an activated drug moiety reagent and 2 reaction of a drug moiety reagent with a linker reagent to form drug linker reagent D L via a covalent bond followed by reaction with the nucleophilic of an antibody. Conjugation methods 1 and 2 may be employed with a variety of antibodies and linkers to prepare the antibody drug conjugates of the invention.

Nucleophilic groups on antibodies include but are not limited to side chain thiol groups e.g. cysteine. Thiol groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties such as those of the present invention. Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT Cleland s reagent dithiothreitol or TCEP tris 2 carboxyethyl phosphine hydrochloride Getz et al 1999 Anal. Biochem. Vol 273 73 80 Soltec Ventures Beverly Mass. . Each cysteine disulfide bridge will thus form theoretically two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through the reaction of lysines with 2 iminothiolane Traut s reagent resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol.

The subject patient may be an animal mammal a placental mammal a marsupial e.g. kangaroo wombat a monotreme e.g. duckbilled platypus a rodent e.g. a guinea pig a hamster a rat a mouse murine e.g. a mouse a lagomorph e.g. a rabbit avian e.g. a bird canine e.g. a dog feline e.g. a cat equine e.g. a horse porcine e.g. a pig ovine e.g. a sheep bovine e.g. a cow a primate simian e.g. a monkey or ape a monkey e.g. marmoset baboon an ape e.g. gorilla chimpanzee orangutan gibbon or a human.

Furthermore the subject patient may be any of its forms of development for example a fetus. In one preferred embodiment the subject patient is a human.

In one embodiment the patient is a population where each patient has a tumour having integrin on the surface of the cell.

In the above schemes R R and R each independently represent a nitrogen protecting group. Rand R each independently represent OH or OProt where Protis a hydroxy protecting group. Protecting groups are well known in the art. R Rand Rmay be for example BOG. Protmay be THP. It may be the protection of the N10 C11 imine bonds is removed at a different stage in the synthesis methods to that shown above dependent on the chemistries employed.

In general the compounds and conjugates can be prepared by first linking two PBD monomers with a phenylene or pyridylene dimer bridge to produce intermediate IV or XXI. The halogen group on the aryl ring in the dimer bridge of intermediate IV may then be used to form the tether including linker group G or L to connect the PBD dimer to the cell binding agent.

In more detail two PBD monomers with XH and X H groups at the C8 position of each PBD monomer intermediates I and II respectively may be rected with T Hal and T Hal groups on intermediate II or intermediate XX. Such a method of synthesis allows for the PBD monomers to be different and so the resulting PBD dimer is asymmetrical. Equally the PBD monomers may be the same.

PBD dimer intermediate IV may be used to provide the compounds and conjugates of the present invention by reacting the aryl halogen group in the bridge in a number of ways.

First intermediate IV can be used in a Sonogishira cross coupling reaction to provide an acetylene group on the aryl group of the dimer bridge. Sonogishira cross coupling reactions are well known in the art for coupling a terminal alkyne with an aryl halide in the presence of a palladium catalyst such as Pd Ph a copper catalyst such as CuI and a base such as diethylamine.

When acetylene is to be used as the terminal acetylene one side of the acetylene molecule is typically protected with for example TMS in order to prevent cross linking of the PBD dimers. Once the Sonogishira reaction is complete the TMS group can be cleaved to provide alkyne intermediate V.

Intermediate V can be reacted with an azido compound to form a triazole derivative in an azide alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition. Such a reaction may be catalysed by a copper catalyst. To form the compounds and conjugates of the present invention the azide is bonded to an ethylene group and a variable number of PEG groups. The azide may be terminated with an amine group to react further. Reaction of intermediate V with an amino azide compound will provide intermediate VI.

The free amine group of intermediate VI can then be reacted with a carboxylic acid group of a linker group for connecting to a cell binding unit to form the amido group linking the PBD dimer to the linker group G or L to provide compound VII.

The linker group reactive group G of intermediate VII can be conjugated to a cell binding agent to provide conjugates of the present invention.

As an alternative Sonogishira reaction intermediate IV can be coupled to an acetylamine such as propargylamine in the presence of palladium and copper catalysts and base. Such a reaction provides part of a tether attached to the PBD dimer bridge where the aclyne group is preserved and a free terminal amine is available for further reaction. For example the reaction of intermediate IV with propargylamine provides intermediate VIII.

The terminal amine of intermediate VIII can be reacted with for example a carboxylic acid group attached to a linker reactive group G for connecting to a cell binding agent to provide intermediate IX.

As an alternative synthesis of intermediate IX the carboxylic acid group of intermediate XI can be reacted with propargylamine to form intermediate XII. Reaction of intermediate IV with intermediate XII in a Sonogoshira reaction yields intermediate XIII.

The protected amine group terminated the variable PEG chain can be deprotected and reacted with the carboxylic acid group of intermediate XIV in order to couple the linker reactive group G onto the PBD dimer and produce intermediate XIV.

Intermediate IV may also used in a cross coupling amination reaction such as a Buchwald Hartwig amination. A carbon nitrogen bond is formed via a palladium catalysed cross coupling of an amine with an aryl halide. A number of palladium catalysts for use in such cross coupling reactions are known such as Pd Ph or RuPhos RuPhosPd.

Reaction of intermediate IV with a piperizine functionalised with a protected propan 1 amine provides intermediate XV. The protected amine of intermediate XV can be further reacted with for example a carboxylic acid group attached to a linker reactive group G for connecting to a cell binding agent to provide intermediate XVI.

Cross coupling amination reaction such as a Buchwald Hartwig amination of intermediate IV with a partially protected piperazine followed by deprotection for example with trifluoroacetic acid provides intermediate XVII.

The deprotected piperazine amine group of intermediate XVII can be reacted with a carboxylic acid group in intermediate XVIII to provide intermediate XIX.

Intermediate XXI can be used to form the oxime intermediate XXIV. For example a partially protected PEG diamine intermediate XXII may be reacted with the carboxylic acid group of intermediate XIV. Deprotection yields intermediate XIII.

Reaction of intermediates XXI and XXIII yields oxime intermediate XXIV. The syn and anti oximes can be resolved using preparative HPLC.

Intermediate XXI can also be used to form the acrylamide intermediate XXVII. For example the aldehyde intermediate XXI can be reacted with malonic acid in a Knoevenagel condensation to yield the acrylic acid intermediate XXV. This can be reacted with a partially protected PEG diamine to yield intermediate XXVI. Deprotectopm and coupling with intermediate XIV yield the acrylamide intermediate XXVII
