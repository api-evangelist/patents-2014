The present invention relates to a thermoelectric conversion material including a carbon nanotube a thermoelectric conversion element including the material and an article for thermoelectric power generation including the same element. In addition the present invention relates to a method for manufacturing the thermoelectric conversion element.

In recent years in consideration of the global environment there has been a demand for the transition of fossil energies of the related art into renewable energies. Examples of the renewable energies include solar power generation wind power generation wave power generation vibration power generation thermoelectric power generation and the like. However among the above described power generations the thermoelectric power generation is attracting attention since the thermoelectric power generation is capable of directly converting thermal energy into electric power and is capable of effectively using a huge quantity of unused thermal energy such as exhaust heat from solar power generation geothermal power generation hot water heat power generation an industrial furnace or a vehicle. In addition the thermoelectric power generation is capable of directly converting thermal energy into electric power and does not require a movable unit and thus has been put into practical use of a wrist watch which is operated by using body heat a power supply in a remote area a power supply in the space and the like.

For the thermoelectric power generation a thermoelectric conversion material capable of converting thermal energy into electric energy and vice versa and a thermoelectric conversion element thermoelectric power generation element produced by processing the thermoelectric conversion material are used. From the viewpoint of the thermoelectric conversion efficiency the thermoelectric conversion material that has been put into practical use at the moment is an inorganic material but the inorganic material has problems of a high price the inclusion of a harmful substance the complicated step of being processed into a thermoelectric conversion element and the like. Therefore studies are underway regarding an organic thermoelectric conversion material that can be manufactured at a relatively low cost and can be easily formed into a film. For example US2010 0319750A and JP2008 305831A report thermoelectric conversion materials for which a carbon nanotube is used.

An object of the present invention is to provide a thermoelectric conversion material having excellent thermoelectric performance a thermoelectric conversion element including the same material an article for thermoelectric power generation including the same element and a method for manufacturing the thermoelectric conversion element.

The present inventors additionally have conducted intensive studies regarding an organic thermoelectric conversion material. As a result it has been found that a composition including a carbon nanotube and a polythiophene polymer in which both the third and fourth positions of a thiophene ring are substituted by alkyl groups exhibits excellent thermoelectric performance and is useful as a thermoelectric conversion material. The material had a strong electric conduction property and a high thermoelectric force required for thermoelectric conversion and exhibited excellent thermoelectric performance. The present invention has been completed on the basis of the above described finding.

The thermoelectric conversion material of the present invention has a strong electric conduction property and a thermoelectric force required for thermoelectric conversion and has excellent thermoelectric performance. The thermoelectric conversion material can be preferably used for thermoelectric conversion usages such as a thermoelectric conversion element or an article for thermoelectric power generation.

In addition according to the manufacturing method of the present invention it is possible to manufacture a thermoelectric conversion element having high thermoelectric performance.

The thermoelectric performance of the thermoelectric conversion material or the thermoelectric conversion element can be measured using a performance index ZT represented using the following equation A . As is clear from the following equation A the improvement of the thermoelectric performance requires an increase in the thermoelectric force and the electric conductivity and a decrease in the thermal conductivity. As described above since the thermoelectric performance is significantly affected by factors other than the electric conductivity it is not certain whether or not a material generally having a high electric conductivity effectively functions as a thermoelectric conversion material in actual cases. The thermoelectric conversion material of the present invention is capable of realizing a high electric conductivity without decreasing the thermoelectric force as verified in examples described below and has thermoelectric performance favorable enough to be used as a thermoelectric conversion material.

The thermoelectric conversion material of the present invention includes a carbon nanotube and a polythiophene polymer constituted of a repeating unit represented by Formula 1 described below. Hereinafter the respective components of the thermoelectric conversion material of the present invention will be described.

Examples of the carbon nanotube hereinafter also referred to as CNT include a single layer CNT around which a carbon film graphene sheet is cylindrically coiled a dual layer CNT around which two graphene sheets are concentrically coiled and a multi layer CNT around which multiple graphene sheets are concentrically coiled. In the present invention the single layer CNT the dual layer CNT and the multi layer CNT may be singly used or two or more CNTs may be jointly used. In particular it is preferable to use the single layer CNT and the dual layer CNT which have excellent electric conductivity and semiconductor characteristics and the single layer CNT is more preferably used.

The single layer CNT may be a semi conductive CNT or a metallic CNT or may be a combination of a semi conductive CNT and a metallic CNT. In addition the CNT may include metal or the like or may include a molecule such as fullerene. Meanwhile the thermoelectric conversion material of the present invention may include in addition to the CNT nanocarbons such as carbon nanohorns carbon nanocoils or carbon nanobeads.

The CNT can be manufactured using an arc discharge method a chemical vapor deposition method hereinafter referred to as the CVD method a laser abrasion method or the like. The CNT used in the present invention may be a CNT obtained using any method but is preferably a CNT obtained using the arc discharge method and the CVD method.

When the CNT is manufactured fullerene graphite or amorphous carbon is generated as a by product at the same time and catalyst metals such as nickel iron cobalt and yttrium also remain. To remove these impurities it is preferable to purify the CNT. There is no particular limitation regarding the method for purifying the CNT but an acid treatment using nitric acid sulfuric acid or the like or an ultrasonic treatment is effective for removing the impurities. It is more preferable to remove the impurities by separation using a filter in conjunction with the above described treatment from the viewpoint of improving the purity.

After the purification the obtained CNT can be used with no additional step. In addition generally the CNT is generated in a string shape the CNT may be used after being cut into a desired length depending on usage. The CNT can be cut into a short fiber shape using an acid treatment in which nitric acid sulfuric acid or the like is used an ultrasonic treatment a frost shattering method or the like. In addition it is preferable to carry out separation using a filter in conjunction with the above described treatment from the viewpoint of improving the purity.

In the present invention not only the cut CNT but also the CNT that has been produced in a short fiber shape in advance can be used. The above described short fiber shaped CNT is obtained in a shape of being oriented in the vertical direction to the substrate surface by for example forming catalyst metals such as iron and cobalt on a substrate and thermally decomposing a carbon compound on the substrate surface at 700 C. to 900 C. using the CVD method thereby causing the vapor deposition of the CNT. The short fiber shaped CNT produced in the above described manner can be taken out from the substrate using a method such as peeling. In addition the short fiber shaped CNT can also be grown on the surface of a catalyst metal using the CVD method after the catalyst metal is supported on a porous supporting body such as porous silicon or on an anodically oxidized film of alumina. The oriented short fiber shaped CNT can be produced using a method in which molecules such as iron phthalocyanine containing a catalyst metal in the molecules is used as a raw material and CVD is carried out in a gas flow of argon hydrogen thereby producing the CNT on the substrate. Furthermore it is also possible to obtain the oriented short fiber shaped CNT on the surface of a SiC monocrystal using an epitaxial growth method.

The average length of the CNT used in the present invention is not particularly limited however from the viewpoint of manufacturing readiness film forming properties electric conduction properties and the like the average length of the CNT is preferably in a range of 0.01 m to 1000 m and more preferably in a range of 0.1 m to 100 m.

The content of the CNT in the thermoelectric conversion material is in the total solid content preferably in a range of 2 mass to 60 mass more preferably in a range of 5 mass to 40 mass and particularly preferably in a range of 8 mass to 30 mass .

The polythiophene polymer used in the thermoelectric conversion material of the present invention has an alkyl substituted thiophene structure represented by the following formula 1 as a repeating unit. The polythiophene polymer has a molecular structure including a conjugated polymer main chain by forming a polymer main chain coupled at the second and fifth positions of a thiophene ring and thus functions as an electrically conductive macromolecule.

The alkyl group of Ror Rmay be either a straight alkyl group or a branched alkyl group. Specific examples of the straight alkyl group include a methyl group an ethyl group a propyl group a butyl group a pentyl group a hexyl group a heptyl group an octyl group a nonyl group a decyl group a undecyl group a dodecyl group a tridecyl group a tetradecyl group a pentadecyl group a hexadecyl group a heptadecyl group an octadecyl group a nonadecyl group and an eicosyl group and specific examples of the branched alkyl group include an isopropyl group an isobutyl group an isoamyl group a s butyl group a t butyl group a 2 methyl butyl group a 2 methyl hexyl group a 2 ethyl hexyl group a 2 methyl octyl group a 2 ethyl octyl group and the like. The alkyl group may further include a substituent but is preferably an unsubstituted alkyl group.

Ris preferably an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms more preferably a straight alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms and particularly preferably a methyl group.

Ris preferably an alkyl group having 4 to 12 carbon atoms more preferably a branched alkyl group having 4 to 12 carbon atoms still more preferably a 2 methyl hexyl group a 2 ethyl hexyl group a 2 methyl octyl group or a 2 ethyl octyl group and particularly preferably a 2 ethyl hexyl group. As described in the examples described below when a branched alkyl group is introduced as R the dispersibility of the CNT in the thermoelectric conversion material is improved and favorable film forming properties can be obtained.

In the present invention as described above Rand Rare preferably different alkyl groups and it is more preferably that Rbe a straight alkyl group and Rbe a branched alkyl group.

The combination of Rand Ris preferably a combination of Rof an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms and Rof an alkyl group having 4 to 12 carbon atoms more preferably a combination of Rof a straight alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms and Rof a branched alkyl group having 4 to 12 carbon atoms still more preferably a combination of Rof a methyl group and Rof a 2 methyl hexyl group a 2 ethyl hexyl group a 2 methyloctyl group or a 2 ethyloctyl group and particularly preferably a combination of Rof a methyl group and Rof a 2 ethyl hexyl group.

Specific examples of the polythiophene polymer represented by Formula 1 will be illustrated below but the present invention is not limited thereto.

As represented in Formula 1 the polythiophene polymer used in the present invention has a two position substitution structure in which both the third and fourth positions of a thiophene ring which is the repeating unit are substituted by alkyl groups.

Since the second and fifth positions of the thiophene ring are active positions under ordinary conditions a polymerization reaction selectively proceeds in the second or fifth position and polythiophene 2 5 diyl is obtained. In the case of polythiphene 2 5 diyl having a thiophene ring with a two position substitution structure as a structural unit as used in the present invention the generated polythiophene main chain is significantly twisted due to the steric repulsion between the thiophene rings. The polythiophene main chain having the thiophene ring with a two position substitution structure as the structural unit is more twisted compared with polythiophene having a thiophene ring with a one position substitution structure in which only either the third or fourth position of the thiophene ring is substituted as the structural unit.

An example of a method for measuring the twist degree of the polythiophene main chain is a method for measuring the ionization potential of the polythiophene. The ionization potential indicates the energy necessary for a molecule to be ionized and corresponds to the energy level of the highest occupied molecular orbital HOMO . Generally when the conjugate system of an organic molecule expands and thus the interaction between orbits in the molecule increases the energy level of HOMO becomes positively decreased. It is known that the ionization potential of polyalkyl thiophene having a one position substitution structure is approximately 5.2 eV and it is possible to determine that as the ionization potential becomes positively greater than 5.2 eV the level of HOMO is deep the degree of conjugation of the polythiophene main chain becomes smaller that is the twist degree of the polythiophene main chain becomes greater. Examples of the method for measuring the ionization potential include electrochemical methods such as photoelectric spectroscopy or cyclic voltammetry.

It is considered that when the thermoelectric conversion material of the present invention includes a polymer made of a repeating unit having a polythiophene structure of the two position substitution structure together with the CNT a high electric conduction property can be realized. This is considered to be because the use of polythiophene having a polymer main chain that is significantly twisted causes highly efficient carrier migration as described below. Since carriers holes generated in polythiophene carrier mobility of 0.1 cm V s which is an electrically conductive polymer are injected into the CNT and migrate in the CNT which allows the carriers to easily migrate carrier mobility of 30000 cm V s at a high speed a high electric conduction property is developed. Particularly in a case in which polythiophene having a significantly twisted main chain is used it is assumed that the HOMO level is deep as described above and thus holes can more easily inject into the CNT and consequently the electric conduction property further improves.

In the polythiophene polymer used in the present invention the repeating number of the repeating units represented by Formula 1 is preferably in a range of approximately 4 to 2 000. In addition the molecular weight is in terms of the weight average molecular weight preferably in a range of 5 000 to 250 000 more preferably in a range of 10 000 to 200 000 and still more preferably in a range of 15 000 to 170 000. The weight average molecular weight can be measured using gel permeation chromatography GPC .

Then the CNT can be dispersed in a high concentration with no defect. Specifically a combination of the mechanical homogenizer method and then the ultrasonic dispersion method is preferable.

The thermoelectric conversion material can also be prepared in the atmosphere but is preferably prepared in an inert gas atmosphere. The inert gas atmosphere refers to a state in which the concentration of oxygen is smaller than that in the atmosphere and is preferably 10 or less. An example of the method for setting the inert gas atmosphere that is preferably used is a method in which the atmosphere is substituted by gas such as nitrogen or argon.

There are cases in which the CNT included in the obtained thermoelectric conversion material includes defective CNT. The defects of the above described CNT degrade the electric conduction properties of the thermoelectric conversion material and thus it is preferable to reduce the defective CNT. The amount of the defects of the CNT in the thermoelectric conversion material can be estimated from the ratio G D of the G band to the D band in the Raman spectrum.

As the method for applying the thermoelectric conversion material for example a well known coating method such as spin coating extrusion die coating blade coating bar coating screen printing stencil printing roll coating curtain coating spray coating dip coating or ink jet printing can be used.

After the coating step if necessary a heating step or a drying step may be provided to distill away the solvent and the like.

In the present invention the thermoelectric conversion material is preferably molded using the ink jet printing method among the above described application methods. The ink jet printing method is a printing method in which ink is sprayed from a nozzle and ink particles are accumulated on a substrate. The thermoelectric conversion material of the present invention can be formed into a thermoelectric conversion layer by applying ink using the ink jet printing method.

There is no particular limitation regarding an ink jet apparatus used in the present invention and a commercially available ink jet apparatus can be used.

From the standpoint of controlling the ink viscosity in the ink jet apparatus it is preferable to set the ink temperature to be constant during the discharge.

As a method for controlling the temperature for example it is preferable to provide a plurality of temperature sensors in individual pipe sections and control the heating depending on the ink flow rate environment temperature and the like. The temperature sensors can be provided in the ink supply tank and near the nozzle in the ink jet head.

The surface tension of the thermoelectric conversion material can be adjusted by using a surfactant or the like.

To obtain a desired thickness of the thermoelectric conversion layer it is preferable to repeat the ink jet printing of the thermoelectric conversion material. In a case in which the ink jet printing is repeated it is preferable to distill away the solvent and the like by providing a heating step or a drying step after the ink jet printing and then carry out additional ink jet printing.

As is clear from Table 5 the thermoelectric conversion element in which the thermoelectric conversion layer was formed using the ink jet printing method exhibited more favorable thermoelectric conversion characteristics than the thermoelectric conversion element in which the thermoelectric conversion layer was formed by making the o dichlorobenzene solution to flow into the mold frame even when the same o dichlorobenzene solution of the thermoelectric conversion material was used.
