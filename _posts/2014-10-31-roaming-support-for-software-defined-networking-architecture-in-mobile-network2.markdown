The subject disclosure relates to roaming support on a software defined networking architecture mobile network.

Widespread proliferation of wireless broadband networks offers increased quality of experience for mobile users but also renders management and maintenance of these networks a tedious and costly task. The network core which facilitates mobile management and data transfer is traditionally comprised of individual server elements with each piece of hardware performing a dedicated task. Several of the server elements perform control plane functions of managing subscription information traffic management and data routing. This routing can be especially complicated with roaming operations as information needs to be exchanged seamlessly between multiple operator domains. Additionally once a roaming connection has been established service sensitive routing may need to be established for end to end traffic.

As mobile device users travel provision of mobile services across different operator domains will be provided. In order to support roaming services mobile networks will need to exchange information with each other about subscription information related to the mobile device users.

One or more embodiments are now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various embodiments. It is evident however that the various embodiments can be practiced without these specific details and without applying to any particular networked environment or standard .

A network core with a software defined networking SDN controller is provided to control routing of traffic within the network and between the network and the traffic destination. The SDN controller is merged with existing 3Generation Partnership Project 3GPP network architecture to enable service deliveries via open application programming interfaces APIs and move the network core towards an all internet protocol IP cloud based and software driven telecom network. The SDN controller can work with or take the place of policy and charging rules function PCRF network elements so that policies such as quality of service and traffic management and routing can be synchronized and managed end to end.

An SDN controller can be provided to manage sharing of information relating to roaming requests for mobile devices that are roaming on visited networks. The SDN controller can be a sub instance of a main SDN controller that manages traffic within the home network and the SDN controller can sit at the edge of the home network and control edge routing elements. The edge SDN controller may communicate with roaming partner s edge SDN controller and or with the roaming interconnect operator s SDN controller to exchange roaming related information. This exchange mechanism will provides a consistent user experience while roaming and will provide operators flexibility in providing service chaining based on services applications network conditions subscriber preferences etc.

In an embodiment the SDN controller on a home network can receive service profile requests from legacy PCRF network elements on a roaming network. The service profile request protocols from the PCRF may differ from a SDN protocol and the SDN controller can translate the non compatible protocol to match the SDN protocol. In other embodiments the SDN controller can enable local breakout which enables the roaming mobile device to use a packet data network gateway PGW on the roaming network while roaming. This allows the mobile device to experience home style services while roaming.

For these considerations as well as other considerations in one or more embodiments a software defined networking controller includes a processor and a memory that stores executable instructions that when executed by the processor facilitate performance of operations including receiving a service profile request from another software defined networking controller of a visited mobile network wherein the service profile request is associated with a mobile device that is roaming on the visited mobile network. The operations can also include retrieving service profile information from a policy data store of a home mobile network of the mobile device. The operations can further include initiating transmission of the service profile information about the mobile device to the other software defined networking controller.

In an embodiment a method can comprise receiving by a first software defined networking controller comprising a processor a service profile request from a second software defined networking controller of a visited mobile network wherein the service profile request is associated with a mobile device that is determined to be roaming on the visited mobile network. The method can also comprise collecting by the first software defined networking controller service profile information associated with the mobile device from a policy data store of a home mobile network for the mobile device. The method can also include sending by the first software defined networking controller the service profile information to the second software defined networking controller of the visited mobile network.

In another embodiment a computer readable storage device having instructions stored thereon that in response to execution cause a software defined networking controller comprising a processor to perform operations including receiving a service profile request of a mobile device from another second software defined networking controller of a roaming network on which the mobile device is roaming. The operations can also include collecting service profile information from a policy data store of a home network of the mobile device. The operations can further include sending the service profile information about the mobile device to the second software defined networking controller of the roaming network.

An SDN controller that is specifically configured to be logically located on the edge of the home network can intercept these service profile requests and retrieve the relevant service profile information from policy database on home network . SDN controller can identify the relevant service profile information using mobile device identifiers in the service profile request such as the international mobile subscriber identity IMSI or the mobile subscriber ISDN number MSISDN .

Once the service profile information is retrieved from the policy database the service profile information can be transmitted by the SDN controller to the visited network . The service profile information can then be used by visited network in facilitating the connection of the mobile device the visited network. In an embodiment PGW can receive data sent from the mobile device to the visited network and then provide the routing and data connection to an external packet network e.g. Internet .

Such LAN and WAN networking environments are commonplace in offices and companies and facilitate enterprise wide computer networks such as intranets all of which can connect to a global communications network e.g. the Internet.

When used in a LAN networking environment the computer can be connected to the local network through a wired and or wireless communication network interface or adapter . The adapter can facilitate wired or wireless communication to the LAN which can also include a wireless AP disposed thereon for communicating with the wireless adapter .

When used in a WAN networking environment the computer can include a modem or can be connected to a communications server on the WAN or has other means for establishing communications over the WAN such as by way of the Internet.

This can include Wireless Fidelity Wi Fi and BLUETOOTH wireless technologies. Thus the communication can be a predefined structure as with a conventional network or simply an ad hoc communication between at least two devices.

Wi Fi can allow connection to the Internet from a couch at home a bed in a hotel room or a conference room at work without wires. Wi Fi is a wireless technology similar to that used in a cell phone that enables such devices e.g. computers to send and receive data indoors and out anywhere within the range of a base station. Wi Fi networks use radio technologies called IEEE 802.11 a b g n ac etc. to provide secure reliable fast wireless connectivity. A Wi Fi network can be used to connect computers to each other to the Internet and to wired networks which can use IEEE 802.3 or Ethernet . Wi Fi networks operate in the unlicensed 2.4 and 5 GHz radio bands at an 11 Mbps 802.11a or 54 Mbps 802.11b data rate for example or with products that contain both bands dual band so the networks can provide real world performance similar to the basic 10BaseT wired Ethernet networks used in many offices.

In an embodiment of the subject application the computer can provide the environment and or setting in which one or more of the core mobility networks disclosed in can be operated from. For instance the edge SDN controllers disclosed herein can be applications stored in hard drive and executed by processing unit .

The connection of the MS to the evolved packet core EPC network is subsequent to an authentication for example a SIM based authentication between the MS and the evolved packet core EPC network. In one aspect the MME provides authentication of the MS by interacting with the HSS . The HSS contains a subscriber profile and keeps track of which core network node is currently handling the subscriber. It also supports subscriber authentication and authorization functions AAA . In networks with more than one HSS a subscriber location function provides information on the HSS that contains the profile of a given subscriber.

As an example the eNB can host a PHYsical PHY Medium Access Control MAC Radio Link Control RLC and Packet Data Control Protocol PDCP layers that include the functionality of user plane header compression and encryption. In addition the eNB can implement at least in part Radio Resource Control RRC functionality e.g. radio resource management admission control scheduling cell information broadcast etc. . The eNB can be coupled to a serving gateway SGW that facilitates routing of user data packets and serves as a local mobility anchor for data bearers when the MS moves between eNBs. In addition the SGW can act as an anchor for mobility between LTE and other 3GPP technologies GPRS UMTS etc. . When MS is in an idle state the SGW terminates a downlink DL data path and triggers paging when DL data arrives for the MS . Further the SGW can perform various administrative functions in the visited network such as collecting information for charging and lawful interception.

In one aspect the SGW can be coupled to a Packet Data Network Gateway PDN GW that provides connectivity between the MS and external packet data networks such as IP service s network s . Moreover the PDN GW is a point of exit and entry of traffic for the MS . It is noted that the MS can have simultaneous connectivity with more than one PDN GW not shown for accessing multiple PDNs.

The PDN GW performs IP address allocation for the MS as well as QoS enforcement and implements flow based charging according to rules from a Policy Control and Charging Rules Function PCRF . The PCRF can facilitate policy control decision making and control flow based charging functionalities in a Policy Control Enforcement Function PCEF which resides in the PDN GW . The PCRF can store data e.g. QoS class identifier and or bit rates that facilitates QoS authorization of data flows within the PCEF. In one aspect the PDN GW can facilitate filtering of downlink user IP packets into the different QoS based bearers and perform policy enforcement packet filtering for each user charging support lawful interception and packet screening. Further the PDN GW acts as the anchor for mobility between 3GPP and non 3GPP technologies such as WiMAX and 3GPP2 CDMA X and EvDO . Although a LTE network architecture is described and illustrated herein it is noted that most any communication network architecture can be utilized to implement the disclosed embodiments.

The embodiments described herein can employ artificial intelligence AI to facilitate automating one or more features described herein. The embodiments e.g. in connection with automatically identifying acquired cell sites that provide a maximum value benefit after addition to an existing communication network can employ various AI based schemes for carrying out various embodiments thereof. Moreover the classifier can be employed to determine a ranking or priority of the each cell site of the acquired network. A classifier is a function that maps an input attribute vector x x1 x2 x3 x4 . . . xn to a confidence that the input belongs to a class that is f x confidence class . Such classification can employ a probabilistic and or statistical based analysis e.g. factoring into the analysis utilities and costs to prognose or infer an action that a user desires to be automatically performed. A support vector machine SVM is an example of a classifier that can be employed. The SVM operates by finding a hypersurface in the space of possible inputs which the hypersurface attempts to split the triggering criteria from the non triggering events. Intuitively this makes the classification correct for testing data that is near but not identical to training data. Other directed and undirected model classification approaches include e.g. na ve Bayes Bayesian networks decision trees neural networks fuzzy logic models and probabilistic classification models providing different patterns of independence can be employed. Classification as used herein also is inclusive of statistical regression that is utilized to develop models of priority.

As will be readily appreciated one or more of the embodiments can employ classifiers that are explicitly trained e.g. via a generic training data as well as implicitly trained e.g. via observing UE behavior operator preferences historical information receiving extrinsic information . For example SVMs can be configured via a learning or training phase within a classifier constructor and feature selection module. Thus the classifier s can be used to automatically learn and perform a number of functions including but not limited to determining according to a predetermined criteria which of the acquired cell sites will benefit a maximum number of subscribers and or which of the acquired cell sites will add minimum value to the existing communication network coverage etc.

As used in this application in some embodiments the terms component system and the like are intended to refer to or include a computer related entity or an entity related to an operational apparatus with one or more specific functionalities wherein the entity can be either hardware a combination of hardware and software software or software in execution.

By way of illustration and not limitation both an application running on a server and the server can be a component. One or more components may reside within a process and or thread of execution and a component may be localized on one computer and or distributed between two or more computers. In addition these components can execute from various computer readable media having various data structures stored thereon. The components may communicate via local and or remote processes such as in accordance with a signal having one or more data packets e.g. data from one component interacting with another component in a local system distributed system and or across a network such as the Internet with other systems via the signal . As another example a component can be an apparatus with specific functionality provided by mechanical parts operated by electric or electronic circuitry which is operated by a software or firmware application executed by a processor wherein the processor can be internal or external to the apparatus and executes at least a part of the software or firmware application. As yet another example a component can be an apparatus that provides specific functionality through electronic components without mechanical parts the electronic components can include a processor therein to execute software or firmware that confers at least in part the functionality of the electronic components.
