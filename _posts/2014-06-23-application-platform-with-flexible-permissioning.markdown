This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 848 533 filed Aug. 2 2010 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

Embodiments of the present disclosure generally relate to application platforms and more particularly to methods and systems for providing flexible permissioning for application platforms.

Existing application platforms allow an application developer to develop applications that may be used for various purposes in various contexts. In this regard an application programming interface API is made available to application developers to develop applications for a specific application platform. The applications may be developed or sold by the manufacturer of a mobile device or by third party application developers. A consumer may load applications on the mobile device which may run the applications after the mobile device has been manufactured and purchased.

An API is an interface that a software program implements to allow other software to interact with it. APIs may be implemented by applications libraries and operating systems to define how other software can make calls to or request services from them. An API determines the vocabulary and calling conventions the application developer should employ to use the services. It may include specifications for routines data structures object classes and protocols used to communicate between the application developer and the provider of the API.

Some companies make their APIs and related features freely available. For example Microsoft makes the Microsoft Windows API public and Apple releases APIs such as Carbon and Cocoa so that software can be written for their platform. Other companies may protect information on their APIs from the general public. For example Sony used to make its official PlayStation 2 API available only to licensed PlayStation developers. This enabled Sony to control who wrote PlayStation 2 games. Such control can have quality control benefits and potential license revenue.

However making API features available to application developers may have a number of shortcomings related to security or confidentiality. For example application developers may have different resources preferences or policies for different types of security mechanisms some preferring security mechanisms that are low in cost or easier to implement but not as reliable.

As such providing application developers licensed or not with full access and use of all features of APIs may pose a risk that may be due at least in part for example to substandard security policies or practices of application developers using the APIs.

As will be further described herein in relation to various embodiments systems and methods are provided for an application platform with flexible permissioning so that full access and use of all features of APIs may be controlled to allow only those API features that a particular application developer may need based on the application developer s profile.

According to an embodiment an application platform with flexible permissioning comprises a service provider server adapted to interact with an application development server and a client device over a network wherein the service provider server is adapted to implement at least one application programming interface API . The application platform with flexible permissioning also comprises one or more processors and one or more memories adapted to store a plurality of machine readable instructions which when executed by the one or more processors are adapted to cause the application platform with flexible permissioning to maintain at the service provider server a profile associated with at least one application developer using the application development server receive an API call from the application developer authenticate the application developer and authorize the API call assign an access level to the application developer based on the profile associated with the application developer and control permissions given to the application developer to perform operations available based on the assigned access level.

According to another embodiment a computer implemented method for providing an application platform with flexible permissioning comprises maintaining at a service provider server a profile associated with at least one application developer using an application programming interface API provided by the service provider server. The method also comprises receiving an API call from the application developer. The method also comprises authenticating the application developer and authorizing the API call. The method also comprises assigning an access level to the application developer based on the profile associated with the application developer and controlling permissions given to the application developer to perform operations available based on the assigned access level.

According to another embodiment an infrastructure for an application platform with flexible permissioning comprises a service provider server comprising an application platform that includes a plurality of application programming interfaces APIs wherein the APIs are adapted to be provided to at least one application developer using an application development server for developing applications operable on a client device. The infrastructure also comprises one or more processors and one or more memories adapted to store a plurality of machine readable instructions which when executed by the one or more processors are adapted to cause the infrastructure to maintain at the service provider server a profile associated with the at least one application developer receive an API call from the application developer authenticate the application developer and authorize the API call assign an access level to the application developer based on the profile associated with the application developer and control permissions given to the application developer for operating functional capabilities of the APIs based on the assigned access level.

These and other features and advantages of the embodiments of the present disclosure will be more readily apparent from the detailed description of the embodiments set forth below taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

As will be further described herein in relation to various embodiments systems and methods are provided for an application platform with flexible permissioning so that full access and use of all features of application programming interfaces APIs may be controlled so that an application developer is allowed to access and or use only those API features that the particular application developer may need based on the application developer s profile.

In this regard features or functional capabilities of APIs may be catalogued into tiers or levels associated with a degree of risk for a particular application developer. An application developer is given permission to use or access only the features or functional capabilities in the tier or level to which the application developer has been granted permission. Furthermore limits related to the functional capabilities may be configurable based on the degree of risk associated with the application developer s profile.

Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure only and not for purposes of limiting the same illustrates a system for providing an application platform with flexible permissioning according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.

A service provider is adapted to interact communicate or exchange data with an application development server and a client device via a network . Data connections between service provider and application development server and client device may take place for example via SMS or a Wireless Application Protocol WAP over network . In addition according to one or more embodiments service provider may have other data connections not shown for example with subscriber Internet companies Internet financial companies Internet brokers or other Internet companies. In one embodiment service provider may be implemented by a payment service provider such as PayPal Inc. or eBay Inc. of San Jose Calif.

Application development server includes an application development application that may be configured to process the creation and or deployment of applications by application developers to be downloaded by one or more users of client device . The application developer may be an entity for example an individual or a corporation which develops one or more portions of an application for example a software application operable on different types of client devices. Examples of application developers include iTunes Sprint mFoundry Tivo Wii Playstation RIM application store or the like. The application developer may be known or unknown to the manufacturer of client device .

Service provider includes an application platform that may be configured to interact with application developer server so that an application developer is enabled to call APIs in order to develop one or more applications. In this regard service provider may provide information to application development server to assist the application developer in creating and or deploying an application in a manner which is compatible with client device . Service provider may assign application identifiers for both internal and external identification.

Service provider may maintain a plurality of application developer accounts each of which may include account information associated with specific application developers. For example in one embodiment account information may include private or confidential information of an application developer such as account numbers passwords credit debit card information bank information or other information that may be used to facilitate online or other types of transactions between service provider and application developers using application development server .

The application developer may first register prepare or otherwise sign up to use application platform implemented by service provider . An application is externally developed software that may use APIs of application platform . An application developer may also be referred to as an App caller which is an entity making an API call. Applications may be composed of one or more API calls and are run by App callers. An API call is an operation being called by the application developer for example to use a specific operation of service provider . In an embodiment where service provider is a payment service provider such as PayPal an operation may be called for the purpose of for example splitting payments between recipients. Application platform may provide one or more specific capabilities referred to as a functional capability. For example in an embodiment where service provider is implemented by a payment service provider a functional capability may include a split payment. It should be noted that a functional capability may not be necessarily tied to a single API call.

Service provider may further include a risk processing application configurable to evaluate received information from application development server over network and store the information in a plurality of records that are associated with application developer accounts so that a profile may be created for each application developer. It will be appreciated that by performing a plurality of transactions by an application developer with application development server a plurality of records may be stored by service provider and associated with an appropriate application developer account . Authorization information based on the plurality of records may be stored in an application developer authorization processing application .

The centralized storage of information or data of service provider may be combined and enhanced with data obtained from business partners of service provider including subscriber acquirers brands Internet companies or other entities. In one embodiment where service provider is PayPal Inc. the centralized stored information or data may be combined with data obtained from PayPal s business partners such as eBay thus resulting in even richer and more extensive data.

Client device may be configured to download install and run applications created and or deployed by application development server . Client device may be implemented using any appropriate combination of hardware and or software configured for wired and or wireless communication over a network. For example in one embodiment client device may be implemented as a mobile device in communication with network such as the Internet or another network. In other embodiments client device may be implemented as a personal computer wireless telephone personal digital assistant PDA key fob smart phone smart card notebook computer game console digital video recorder DVR and or other types of computing devices. Furthermore client device may be enabled for NFC Bluetooth online infrared communications and or other types of communications.

Application development server may include various other applications as may be desired in particular embodiments to provide desired features to application developers using application development server . For example in various embodiments other applications may include security applications for implementing security features or any other types of applications.

Application development server may provide information to service provider to open an application developer account . In this regard it will be appreciated that the application developer may provide account information to service provider over network through for example a secure connection between application development server and service provider . For example service provider may provide a webpage that may be viewed by an application developer through a browser application.

The information provided to service provider may be used to assign a specific application developer identifier which application development server may store and may be used to identify the particular application developer as having an application developer account maintained by service provider . Application developer identifiers may be implemented for example as one or more cookies operating system registry entries hardware identifiers or other types of identifiers. Other data specific to the application developer may be created and stored by service provider including for example signature information and an application developer profile . Signature information is a way to identify the application developer. Furthermore application developer profile may be created for example based on an application developer s typical behavior in transactions.

Client device application developer server and service provider may each include one or more processors memories and other appropriate components for executing instructions such as program code and or data stored on one or more computer readable mediums to implement the various applications data and methods described herein. For example such instructions may be stored in one or more computer readable mediums such as memories or data storage devices internal and or external to various components of the system and or accessible over a network which may be implemented as a single network or a combination of multiple networks. For example in various embodiments network may include the Internet or one or more intranets landline networks wireless networks and or other appropriate types of networks.

In block service provider may receive an API call from an application developer or App caller using application development server . The App caller may wish to create an application and access features of an API of application platform . App callers may also be known as Actors with existing authorization and authorization credentials such as username password or passcode and a 3 token signature or certificate.

In block service provider authenticates the App caller and authorizes the API call. For example service provider may first verify the App caller s credentials such as username password or passcode so that the credentials match information maintained by service provider . For example information in connection with application developer identifier of application development server is verified. Other data maintained at service provider such as signature information and application developer profile information maintained for example in application developer profile may also be used to correlate and authenticate the application developer. If particular information provided by the App caller appears to be out of line with the App caller s typical profile as maintained in application developer profile the App caller may not be authenticated. For instance if the application developer generally only deals with transactions over the telephone for a particular technology a transaction related to a different odd technology may raise a fraud alert. Other data that may raise fraud alerts include the number of transactions the time of day or the time of year when the transaction takes place. Finally transactions made over application development server may also provide geo location information using for example a Global Positioning Satellite GPS to identify the location of the application development server and correspondingly the application developer . The location of application developers as well as other credentials may be helpful in establishing risk models for transactions.

In addition an API may be checked to ensure that the API is valid and active. If the App caller is allowed to use the particular API then the API call may be authorized. If the App caller is not allowed to use the particular API then the API call is rejected.

In block once an App caller is authenticated and the API call is authorized an Access Level is assigned to the App caller based on the App caller s profile. When an entity applies to be an application developer or App caller caller of APIs of application platform the entity may be vetted using a risk analysis or technique used by Risk Processing Application of service provider . The App caller may be vetted for example on its financial and identity trustworthiness. Based on such vetting application developer account for the particular App caller may be assigned an Access Level with respect to APIs in application platform .

In block controlled permissions are given to the App caller to perform operations available based on its assigned Access Level. That is all functional capabilities in the assigned Access Level may be allowed when the App caller makes a call. APIs may be called only within the context of an application. Each application may be identified by application identifier .

Application platform of service provider exposes services to external application developers or App callers using application development server to create applications. As such risk analysis may be used to classify an App caller into a tier. A tier also known as a level is a level of risk associated with a given App caller and may also be used to provide an initial set of functional capabilities to a particular App caller. Tiers may be created for the services built into application platform . Functional capabilities may also be placed into several tiers based on a risk factor of a functional capability.

In an embodiment where service provider is a payment service provider such as PayPal API calls may be placed in connection with for example different adaptive payments such as splitting payments to different receivers in series or parallel creating accounts or the like. Examples of functional capabilities are shown in Table 1 below and include 

As discussed above functional capabilities may be placed into several tiers based on a risk factor of a functional capability. Table 2 below illustrates an example of a tier in an embodiment where service provider is a payment service provider such as PayPal. Examples of a tier or a level may include a Standard tier and an Advanced tier. As shown in Table 2 for example an API call for Adaptive Payments.Pay in connection with a functional capability Simple Send Money is placed in a Standard tier. An API call for Adaptive Payments.Pay in connection with a functional capability to Make Preapproved Payment is placed in an Advanced tier. Examples of a tier or a level include 

That is functional capabilities may be based on tiers standard or advanced. It should be understood that functional capabilities are not necessarily tied to one specific API call.

Permissions in either the standard tier or the advanced tier may be given to an application developer or App Caller based on the profile or vetting of the application developer. The application developer with a qualifying profile or vetting may be classified in the advanced tier and have access to corresponding functional capabilities therein. Such granular process allows for general access as a whole within a tier or may be broken into smaller usable segments. For example a billing agreement may be given only to certain levels of access depending on the tier thus allowing for a level of flexibility based on risk factors that limit access to certain provisions. Only vetted application developers may use or access certain or all features of an API as needed whereas application developers that are not qualified may only have limited or no use or access to such features.

By way of example and not of limitation an analogy may be made with respect to fine tuning or turning of a knob wherein access to certain API features or functions is granted upon tweaking of the knob to increase or decrease limits feedback and or access as will be described herein.

In block with respect to App callers exercising functional capabilities as discussed above all App callers may be vetted and assigned a corresponding Access Level in connection with an application developer or App caller account . All functional capabilities in the assigned Access Level are allowed when an App caller makes a call. However if an App caller tries to exercise a functional capability that is in a level higher than what the App caller is vetted for then the call is rejected in block for example with an error code or message.

The relationship between an App caller s account and its Access Level may be stored in a domain for Risk Processing Application of service provider . The relationship between functional capabilities and Access Levels may also be stored in a domain in Risk Processing Application . Application Developer Authorization Processing Application also referred to as Userauthserv may use the list of functional capabilities available to an application developer or App caller account based on the Access Level for granting or rejecting permissions.

In block after an App caller is vetted and correspondingly assigned to an Access Level additional controls limits or restrictions may be imposed on the App caller s account for example by turning off certain functional capabilities for the particular App caller. If the App caller tries to exercise a functional capability that has been turned off the call is rejected in block for example with an error code or message.

The relationship between an App caller account and the list of functional capabilities that are turned off may be stored for example in an application developer domain in Userauthserv which reconciles the list of functional capabilities provided at Risk Processing Application with the functional capabilities that are turned off.

In block in addition to risk controlled functional capabilities there may be an additional category of functional capabilities that may be managed or controlled. For example additional Business Unit BU level functional capabilities may be managed. This allows a Business Unit to enable additional functionality for an App Caller s account without having to go through risk vetting.

Default settings for each control may be applied to each application developer account that is no special policy or rule is necessary that determines whether or not a particular functional capability is allowed. That is a BU for example may turn on additional functional capabilities for a particular application developer account. If an App Caller tries to exercise a functional capability that is not turned on for the particular App Caller s account the call may be rejected in block for example with an error code or error message.

The relationship between an App Caller account and selected functional capabilities for example BU level functional capabilities may be stored for example in an application developer domain in Userauthserv which adds BU level controls with respective answers e.g. granted or rejected to the list of functional capabilities.

In block one or more functional capabilities may have specified limits associated with them. If an App caller tries to exercise a functional capability that is not within the specified limits for the particular App caller s account the call may be rejected in block for example with an error code or error message. Specified limits and examples will be described in more detail below.

In block permissions are granted to App Callers exercising functional capabilities of APIs when the functional capability is within an assigned Access Level the functional capability is not turned OFF the functional capability is included as an additional functional capability and a specified limit for the functional capability is met.

With respect to specified limits limits normally may represent some numeric values that refine the functional capability or control. For example an application developer account may be allowed to exercise chained payments but only up to 4 legs or transactions . Limits may be configurable for each application developer account such that two different accounts with the same functional capability turned on may exercise that functional capability up to the different limits respectively.

In some embodiments there may be two types of limits numeric rates and geographic. Generally numeric and geographic limits may be enabled for any functional capability or control. Table 3 below illustrates an example of numeric preapproval limits 

In the example of Table 3 above pre approval limits may be settable for the maximum amount of money the maximum amount of agreements the maximum amount of transactions per agreement and or the maximum duration of an agreement allowed based in general or in connection with an identifier such as a PIN or passcode or a subscription. In one embodiment an App Caller may be limited or restricted to a smaller set of operations or features of an API or may be required to pay a higher amount of money for increased use of operations or features.

Limits may also be imposed based on rates. Table 4 below illustrates an example of numeric rate limits 

In the example of Table 4 above rate limiting may be conducted for the number of calls per day the number of calls per months and or the number of calls per week allowed based on different types of accounts such as consumer or business accounts over a network such as the Internet or web or over a mobile device.

Functional capabilities may further be limited based on geographic limits. Table 5 below illustrates an example of geographic limits 

In the example of Table 5 above geographic limits or controls may be imposed where allowed based on different types of accounts such as consumer or business accounts over a network such as the Internet or web or over a mobile device. By default functional capabilities may be allowed everywhere. However an ON OFF switch may be used to restrict the functional capability to a certain geographical location s . In an embodiment where service provider is a payment service provider such as PayPal for example a functional capability may be configurable to certain geographical locations such as API Caller Home EU Europe PP Inc corporate headquarters AU Australia and or CA Canada .

Embodiments of the present disclosure provide a solution for evaluating policies or rules associated with an App Caller for determining whether or not a particular functional capability in an application platform is allowed in connection with the particular App Caller. In general API calls made to application platform of service provider may operate functional capabilities for which they are authorized. Authorization information may be provided for a particular App Caller making an API call. The authorization information may include 1 a complete list of functional capabilities with a decision to grant or reject and 2 a list of limits associated with the functional capabilities.

The authorization information may be used for enforcement purposes. If all functional capabilities are shown as not granted or rejected the API call is rejected with for example an error code or message. If an App Caller tries to exercise a functional capability that is not authorized the API call is rejected with for example an error code or message. If an App caller tries to execute a functional capability violating the limits the API call is rejected with for example an error code or message. It should be noted that error codes or messages may or may not be the same for each instance of rejecting an API call.

Each API call may be annotated with one or more functional capabilities. A call may then be made into the Userauthserv with the list of functional capabilities. The results of the evaluation are then reported back. The result of the evaluation includes the list of functional capabilities the policy decision on each functional capability yes no and the reason for refusal if any . Furthermore if applicable a list of limits associated with the functional capabilities in question will be returned.

To facilitate the evaluation process each operation may be annotated with all the functional capabilities. Logic for annotation processing may be created. On each incoming call the annotations may be processed and Userauthserv may be called to provide the list of functional capabilities to evaluate. The evaluation results may be stored in a security context of the call. Ways for reading the security context may be provided so that the results of the evaluation may be read and enforced.

Every functional capability may have a policy associated therewith. A policy is a rule or logical expression that evaluates account properties and arrives to for example a Boolean result. Table 6 below is an example of account properties that may be evaluated for each functional capability. Table 6 may be an example associated with an embodiment where service provider is a payment service provider such as PayPal 

In the example of Table 6 above six Access Levels may be provided for specific functional capabilities depending on the applicable policies. For a Standard Access Level an API caller would have access to the functional capabilities listed therein if the App Caller has a business verified account.

For an Entry Access Level an API caller would have access to the functional capabilities listed therein if the App Caller has a business verified account belongs to Entry Access Level and is not restricted to use a functional capability.

For an Advanced Access Level an API caller would have access to the functional capabilities listed therein if the App Caller has a business verified account belongs to Advanced Access Level and is not restricted to use a functional capability.

For an Advanced Plus Access Level an API caller would have access to the functional capabilities listed therein if the App Caller has a business verified account belongs to Advanced Plus Access Level and is not restricted to use a functional capability.

For a Strategic Partner Access Level an API caller would have access to the functional capabilities listed therein if the App Caller has a business verified account belongs to Strategic Partner Access Level and is not restricted to use a functional capability.

Finally for a BU Controlled Access Level an API caller would have access to the functional capabilities listed therein if the App Caller has a business verified account and is allowed to use a BU controlled functional capability.

According to one or more embodiments service provider may have certain administrative capabilities with respect to Access Levels for APIs. Administrative capabilities may include for example i switching Access Levels for App callers ii restricting App caller s access to a functional capability within an assigned tier iii allowing App callers to access non risk functional capabilities and iv setting limits for an App caller.

With respect to i switching Access Levels for App callers when an Access Level is changed for an App caller the list of functional capabilities is dynamically updated to reflect the functional capabilities allowed for that Access Level. For example the setting may be turned to ON for each functional capability that is provisioned at the particular Access Level. Only functional capabilities available for the particular Access Level may be shown in addition to default limits.

With respect to ii restricting App caller s access to a functional capability within an assigned tier when a functional capability needs to be turned OFF an interface such as a button or a toggle may be provided. When a functional capability is OFF the defaults may be shown in faded mode or not shown at all. Table 7 below is an example showing toggle interfaces that may be used to change payment permissions with respect to functional capabilities and related limits. For example permission may be given for a Chained Payment functional capability or if desired the permission may be rejected by using the toggle interface to switch to No. Correspondingly for example a limit on the number of transactions per split may also be set. In this example the limit is set to 3 transactions per split 

With respect to allowing App callers to access non risk functional capabilities in general functional capabilities that are not associated with any Access Level may be turned OFF by default. In some cases an interface such as a button or a toggle may be provided to turn ON a non risk functional capability.

With respect to iv setting limits for an App Caller editable fields for limits such as numeric limits may be provided for example as illustrated in Tables 3 and 4 above. In an embodiment where geographical limitations are to be set the ability to restrict a functional capability to a location may be provided.
