title: Double patterning technology (DPT) layout routing
abstract: One or more techniques or systems for determining double patterning technology (DPT) layout routing compliance are provided herein. For example, a layout routing component of a system is configured to assign a pin loop value to a pin loop. In some embodiments, the pin loop value is assigned based on a mask assignment of a pin of the pin loop. In some embodiments, the pin loop value is assigned based on a number of nodes associated with the pin loop. DPT compliance or a DPT violation is determined for the pin loop based on the pin loop value. In this manner, odd loop detection associated with DPT layout routing is provided because a DPT violation results in generation of an additional instance of a net, for example. Detecting an odd loop allows a design to be redesigned before fabrication, where the odd loop would present undesired issues.

This application is a divisional application of and claims priority to U.S. Non Provisional patent application Ser. No. 13 753 815 filed on Jan. 30 2013 which is incorporated herein by reference.

Generally a layout router facilitates layout of pins within a semiconductor device. For example a layout router places a circuit element at a location within an integrated circuit IC where the circuit element is connected to one or more pins. The layout router creates a layout based on a set of design rules. For example terminals of a same net are connected. Additionally terminals associated with different nets are not connected etc. However routing becomes challenging with more advanced technology.

This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to be an extensive overview of the claimed subject matter identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

One or more techniques or systems for determining double patterning technology DPT compliance or DPT layout routing are provided herein. For example a layout router or a router is configured to support odd loop detection for pre colored pins and associated nets. In some scenarios when a first net and a second net are spaced closer than a lithography limit the first net is assigned to a first mask and the second net is assigned to a second mask thus mitigating the lithography limit issue. However when a third net is located closer than the lithography limit to the first net and the second net an undesirable odd loop is formed. In some embodiments pre colored pins are pins associated with a mask assignment. In a first scenario a layout router is configured to create a pin loop based on a first pin associated with a first net a second pin associated with a second net and a conflict space associated with both the first net and the second net. The pin loop is a mechanism that facilitates finding of undesirable odd loops. A net is an electrical connection to a pin. Additionally the layout router is configured to assign a pin loop value to the pin loop based on a mask assignment for the first pin or a mask assignment for the second pin. For example if the first pin and the second pin share a same mask assignment an even pin loop value is assigned to the corresponding pin loop. Conversely if the first pin and the second pin are associated with different mask assignments an odd pin loop value is assigned to the pin loop. The layout router is configured to determine a DPT compliance or a DPT violation for the pin loop based on the pin loop value. It will be appreciated that the layout router supports odd loop checking for pre colored pins because the pin loop value is assigned based on mask assignments of pins associated with the pin loop.

In a second scenario the layout router is configured to create a first pin group based on a mask assignment for one or more pins of the first pin group. Additionally the first pin group is created based on one or more first internal conflict spaces between pins of the first pin group. Additionally the layout router is configured to create a second pin group in a similar fashion. The layout router is configured to associate the first pin group or the second pin group with a first phantom assisted feature AF mask or a second phantom AF mask. In some embodiments the layout router is configured to generate a first net for a pin of the first pin group or a second net for a pin of the second pin group. The layout router is configured create a pin loop based on the first net the second net the first phantom AF mask the second phantom AF mask first internal conflict spaces or second internal conflict spaces. The layout router is configured to assign a pin loop value to the pin loop based on a number of nodes associated with the pin loop. Additionally the layout router is configured to determine a DPT compliance or a DPT violation based on the pin loop value. The layout router supports odd loop checking for pre colored pins because the first phantom AF mask or the second phantom AF mask compensate for the pre colored pins during pin loop analysis.

The following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects are employed. Other aspects advantages or novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

Embodiments or examples illustrated in the drawings are disclosed below using specific language. It will nevertheless be understood that the embodiments or examples are not intended to be limiting. Any alterations and modifications in the disclosed embodiments and any further applications of the principles disclosed in this document are contemplated as would normally occur to one of ordinary skill in the pertinent art.

It will be appreciated that for at least some of the figures herein one or more boundaries such as boundary or of for example are drawn with different heights widths perimeters aspect ratios etc. relative to one another merely for illustrative purposes and are not necessarily drawn to scale. For example because dashed or dotted lines are used to represent different boundaries if the dashed and dotted lines were drawn on top of one another they would not be distinguishable in the figures and thus are drawn slightly apart from one another in at least some of the figures so that they are distinguishable from one another for example. As another example where a boundary is associated with an irregular shape the boundary such as a box drawn with a dashed line dotted lined etc. does not necessarily encompass an entire component in some instances. Conversely a drawn box does not necessarily encompass merely an associated component in some instances but encompasses at least a portion of one or more other components as well.

In some embodiments the layout router is configured to generate the respective nets for the pins. For example the layout router is configured to generate the first net for the first pin the second net for the second pin the third net for the third pin or the fourth net for the fourth pin . During layout routing a conflict space occurs when a distance between a first object and a second object is less than a lithography limit. For example an object is a net a pattern a polygon etc. Accordingly it will be appreciated that a layout router is configured to assign the first object a first mask assignment and the second object a second mask assignment to resolve the conflict space in some embodiments. In the example illustrated in a first conflict space is associated with the first net and the third net . Additionally a second conflict space is associated with the first net and the fourth net . In the illustrate example the first pin and the third pin are associated with a mask assignment to a first mask as indicated by the cross hatching. Additionally the second pin and the fourth pin are associated with a mask assignment to a second mask.

In some embodiments the layout router is configured to create a pin loop based on at least one of a first pin associated with a first net a second pin associated with a second net or a conflict space associated with the first net and the second net. For example in the layout router is configured to create a first pin loop based on the first pin the first net the third pin the third net and the first conflict space . In greater detail since the first conflict space is between the first net and the third net and nets and are associated with pins and respectively the layout router is configured to create the first pin loop such that the first pin loop surrounds a perimeter associated with respective elements. In other words the first pin loop closes a loop from the first pin to the first net to the first conflict space to the third net to the third pin and back to the first pin . It will be appreciated that a second pin loop is created in a similar fashion. For example the second pin loop comprises a path from the first pin to the first net to the second conflict space to the fourth net to the fourth pin back to the first pin .

In some embodiments the layout router is configured to assign a pin loop value to the pin loop based on at least one of a mask assignment for the first pin or a mask assignment for the second pin. In the layout router is configured to assign a pin loop value to the first pin loop based on the first pin and the third pin being associated with a mask assignment to a first mask or rather a mask used in fabricating the first pin or the second pin such as during lithography for example. Since the first pin and the third pin are associated with a same mask assignment to the first mask the layout router is configured to assign a pin loop value of zero or an even pin loop value. In other words the layout router is configured to assign the pin loop value to zero or an even pin loop value based on a same mask assignment between a first pin and a second pin. At a virtual short is seen between the first pin and the third pin because the first pin and the third pin are associated with a same mask assignment to mask one. In some embodiments the layout router is configured to assign a pin loop value based on a virtual short between a first pin and a second pin. For example the layout router is configured to assign a pin loop a pin loop value of zero or an even pin loop value when a virtual short such as is associated with the pin loop. Accordingly the layout router is configured to assign the first pin loop a pin loop value of zero or an even pin loop value because the first pin loop comprises the virtual short .

Additionally the layout router is configured to assign a pin loop value to the second pin loop based on the first pin associated with a mask assignment to the first mask and the fourth pin associated with a mask assignment to a second mask. Since the first pin and the fourth pin are associated with different mask assignments the layout router is configured to assign a pin loop value of one or an odd pin loop value. In other words the layout router is configured to assign the pin loop value to one or an odd pin loop value based on a different mask assignment between a first pin and a second pin. At a virtual open is seen between the first pin and the fourth pin because the first pin and the fourth pin are associated with different mask assignments. In some embodiments the layout router is configured to assign a pin loop value based on a virtual open between a first pin and a second pin. For example the layout router is configured to assign a pin loop a pin loop value of one or an odd pin loop value when a virtual open such as is associated with the pin loop. Accordingly the layout router is configured to assign the second pin loop a pin loop value of one or an odd pin loop value because the second pin loop comprises the virtual open .

In some embodiments the layout router is configured to determine at least one of a double patterning technology DPT compliance for the pin loop or a DPT violation for the pin loop based on the pin loop value. In the layout router is configured to determine a DPT compliance for the second pin loop and a DPT violation for the first pin loop because the first pin loop is assigned a pin loop value of zero and the second pin loop is assigned a pin loop value of one.

In some embodiments the pin loop value is indicative of a number of internal conflict spaces associated with a pin loop. Accordingly the layout router is configured to assign the pin loop value based on the number of virtual conflict spaces associated with the pin loop. It will be appreciated that a number of conflict spaces associated with a pin loop within the net region is determined by analyzing the pin loop. For example the number of conflict spaces for a pin loop associated with a first pin a first net a second pin and a second net is determined. In a number of conflict spaces associated with the first pin loop is one because there is the first conflict space is between the first net and the third net . In other words the number of conflict spaces for the first pin loop is one because the first conflict space of the first pin loop is within the net region . Similarly a number of conflict spaces for the second pin loop is also one because the second conflict space is associated with the second pin loop in the net region .

In some embodiments a total loop count is determined by adding a number of conflict spaces associated with a pin loop to a number of virtual conflict spaces associated with the pin loop. Turning to the first pin loop it is seen that the number of conflict spaces associated with the first pin loop is one because the first conflict space is between the first net and the third net . Additionally a number of virtual conflict spaces associated with the first pin loop is zero because the pin loop value assigned to the first pin loop is indicative of the number of internal conflict spaces associated with the first pin loop and the first pin loop was assigned a pin loop value of zero. Accordingly the total loop count for the first pin loop is one because the number of conflict spaces associated with the first pin loop is one and the number of virtual conflict spaces associated with the first pin loop is zero. It will be appreciated that a total loop count for the second pin loop is determined in a similar fashion. For example the total loop count for the second pin loop is two because the number of conflict spaces associated with the second pin loop is one and the number of virtual conflict spaces associated with the second pin loop is one. Expressed as an equation the total loop count of a pin loop a number of conflict spaces associated with the pin loop a number of virtual conflict spaces associated with the pin loop. It will be appreciated that the total loop count for a pin loop is based on a pin loop value of the pin loop because the pin loop value is indicative of a number of virtual conflict spaces associated with the pin loop according to some embodiments.

In some embodiments the layout router is configured to determine a DPT compliance for a pin loop or a DPT violation for the pin loop based on the total loop count for the pin loop. For example since the total loop count for the first pin loop is one and the total loop count is an odd number the layout router assigns a DPT violation to the first pin loop . Similarly for the second pin loop since the total loop count is two and the total loop count is an even number the layout router assigns a DPT compliance to the second pin loop . In this way the layout router determines a DPT compliance or a DPT violation based on a total loop count. It will be appreciated that the layout router also determines a DPT compliance or a DPT violation based on a pin loop value because the total loop count is based on the pin loop value for example. In some embodiments the layout router is configured to generate a second instance of a first net for a first pin or a second instance of a second net for a second pin based on a determined DPT violation. In other words the layout router re generates one or more nets for pins of a pin loop based on a DPT violation for the pin loop.

In some embodiments a layout router is configured to create a pin group based on at least one of a mask assignment for one or more pins of the pin group or one or more internal conflict spaces between at least some of the one or more pins of the pin group. For example the layout router is configured to create a second pin group in because the third pin A the fourth pin B and the fifth pin C are associated with a mask assignment to at least one of a first mask or a second mask. Additionally the second pin group is created because the third pin A the fourth pin B and the fifth pin C are separated by one or more internal conflict spaces such as A and B. In other words a pin group is defined as a group of pins associated with a mask assignment to a mask and linked or separated by one or more internal conflict spaces. Accordingly the second pin and the sixth pin A are not associated with the second pin group because there is no internal conflict space between the second pin and the third pin A or between the fifth pin C and the sixth pin A. It will be appreciated that the layout router is configured to create one or more other pin groups in a similar fashion. For example a first pin group comprises the first pin A. A third pin group comprises the sixth pin A. Additionally a fourth pin group comprises the seventh pin A and the eighth pin B.

In some embodiments the layout router is configured to associate a pin group with at least one of a first phantom assisted feature AF mask or a second phantom AF mask. Explained in greater detail the layout router is configured to associate a pin group with at least one of one or more first phantom AF mask polygons of a first phantom AF mask or one or more second phantom AF mask polygons of a second AF mask. The layout router is configured to randomly select a pin from a pin group and associate the pin with a phantom AF mask opposite of a mask assignment for the pin. For example the layout router is configured to associate the first pin A of the first pin group with a second phantom AF mask polygon A because the first pin is associated with a mask assignment to a first mask. Accordingly the first pin group is associated with the second phantom AF mask because the first pin A of the first pin group is linked to the second phantom AF mask polygon A of the second phantom AF mask.

In some embodiments an internal conflict space B is between the second phantom AF mask polygon A and the first pin A. It will be appreciated that the layout router is configured to associate one or more pin groups with at least one of a first phantom AF mask polygon of a first phantom AF mask or a second phantom AF mask polygon of a second phantom AF mask. In this way the layout router is configured to associate a pin group with at least one of a first phantom AF mask or a second phantom AF mask. In a pin is selected from the second pin group randomly such as the fourth pin B for example. The layout router is configured to associate the fourth pin B with a second phantom AF mask polygon B because the fourth pin B is associated with a mask assignment to the first mask as indicated by the cross hatching. Additionally an internal conflict space B is between the second phantom AF mask polygon B and the fourth pin B. It will be appreciated that one or more phantom AF mask polygons are associated with the third pin group and the fourth pin group in a similar fashion. For example the sixth pin A is associated with a first phantom AF mask polygon B via internal conflict space and the seventh pin A is associated with a second phantom AF mask polygon C via internal conflict space B.

In some embodiments at least one of the second phantom AF mask polygons A B or C is associated or linked to a first phantom AF mask polygon A via internal conflict spaces A A or A respectively. For example the second phantom AF mask polygons A B or C are associated with the first phantom AF mask polygon A via internal conflict spaces because they are opposite masks as indicated by the different cross hatching. Conversely the first phantom AF mask polygon B is associated or linked to the first phantom AF mask polygon A without an internal conflict space because the first phantom AF mask polygon B and the first phantom AF mask polygon A are associated with the same first phantom AF mask as indicated by the same cross hatching.

In some embodiments the layout router is configured to create one or more first phantom AF mask polygons for the first phantom AF mask. Additionally the layout router is configured to create one or more second phantom AF mask polygons for the second phantom AF mask. In some embodiments the first phantom AF mask comprises one or more of the first phantom AF mask polygons. Similarly the second phantom AF mask comprises one or more of the second phantom AF mask polygons. The layout router is configured to create or insert one or more internal conflict spaces between a pin and a phantom AF mask polygon or between a first phantom AF mask polygon and a second phantom AF mask polygon. However in some embodiments an internal conflict space is not inserted between phantom AF mask polygons associated with a same mask such as between B and A.

In some embodiments the layout router is configured to generate one or more nets for one or more pins of a pin group. Explained in another way for a pin group the layout router selects a pin of the pin group at random and generates one or more nets for the selected pin. It will be appreciated that a net comprises one or more polygons. However in respective nets are represented by a single polygon although nets comprise additional polygons in some embodiments. For example the layout router is configured to generate a first net for the first pin A. Additionally the first net comprises a first net polygon . It will be appreciated that the layout router is configured to generate one or more corresponding nets for other pins in a similar fashion. For example the layout router is configured to generate a second net comprising a second net polygon for the fourth pin B. For example the layout router is configured to generate a third net comprising a third net polygon for the sixth pin A. For example the layout router is configured to generate a fourth net comprising a fourth net polygon for the seventh pin A. It will be appreciated that some of the one or more generated nets are associated with one or more conflict spaces. When the layout router generates one or more of the nets a distance such as a conflict space between a first net and a second net is sometimes smaller than a lithography limit. For example in a first conflict space is associated with the first net polygon and the second net polygon . Additionally a second conflict space is associated with the third net polygon and the fourth net polygon . In this way the first conflict space is between the first net polygon and the second net polygon . Similarly the second conflict space is between the third net polygon and the fourth net polygon .

The layout router is configured to create the pin loop such that one or more adjacent polygons are associated with a node. A group of one or more polygons are adjacent when no conflict space or internal conflict space is between two polygons of the group of polygons. For example in a first pin loop is created by the layout router. Here the first phantom AF mask polygon A of . Is a first node for the first pin loop because internal conflict spaces A and A are between the first phantom AF mask polygon A and the second phantom AF mask polygons A and B respectively. It will be appreciated that one or more nodes for the pin loop are created in a similar fashion. For example a second node for the first pin loop is created based on the second phantom AF mask polygon A between internal conflict spaces A and B. In this way the second node is associated with the second phantom AF mask polygon A. A third node for the first pin loop is created based on the first pin A and the first net polygon because A and are between internal conflict space B and conflict space . In this way the third node is associated with respective polygons A and . Additionally a fourth node for the first pin loop is created or associated with polygons B and . It will be appreciated that polygons A and C are not associated with the first pin loop because respective polygons are associated with merely one internal conflict space A and B respectively. In some embodiments a polygon associated with merely a single conflict space or merely a single internal conflict space is not included in the pin loop because the polygon is dangling from the pin loop. At a fifth node is associated with the second phantom AF mask polygon B. It will be appreciated that the second pin loop and corresponding nodes are created in a similar fashion. Accordingly the second pin loop comprises a first node a second node a third node and a fourth node . In some embodiments a conflict space or an internal conflict space is an edge for a pin loop. A layout router is configured to assign a pin loop value to a pin loop based on a number of edges associated with the pin loop. In some embodiments the layout router is configured to assign a pin loop value to a pin loop based on a number of internal conflict spaces associated with the pin loop and a number of conflict spaces associated with the pin loop. In other words the pin loop value is determined by a number of edges associated with the pin loop because an edge of a pin loop is at least one of a conflict space or an internal conflict space.

In some embodiments the layout router is configured to assign a pin loop value to the pin loop based on a number of nodes associated with the pin loop. For example for the first pin loop a pin loop value of five is assigned because the first pin loop comprises five nodes and . Similarly for the second pin loop a pin loop value of four is assigned because the second pin loop comprises four nodes and .

In some embodiments the layout router is configured to determine at least one of a double patterning technology DPT compliance for the pin loop or a DPT violation for the pin loop based on the pin loop value. For example the layout router is configured to determine a DPT compliance for a pin loop based on an even pin loop value for the pin loop. Conversely the layout router is configured to determine a DPT violation for a pin loop based on an odd pin loop value for the pin loop.
