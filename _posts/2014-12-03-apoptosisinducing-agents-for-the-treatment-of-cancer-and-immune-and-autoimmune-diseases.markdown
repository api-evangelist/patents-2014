This invention pertains to compounds which inhibit the activity of Bcl xL anti apoptotic proteins compositions containing the compounds and methods of treating diseases during which anti apoptotic Bcl xL proteins are expressed.

Apoptosis is recognized as an essential biological process for tissue homeostasis of all living species. In mammals in particular it has been shown to regulate early embryonic development. Later in life cell death is a default mechanism by which potentially dangerous cells e.g. cells carrying cancerous defects are removed. Several apoptotic pathways have been uncovered and one of the most important involves the Bcl 2 family of proteins which are key regulators of the mitochondrial also called intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. See Danial N. N. and Korsmeyer S. J. 2004 116 205 219. The structural homology domains BH1 BH2 BH3 and BH4 are characteristic of this family of proteins. The Bcl 2 family of proteins can be further classified into three subfamilies depending on how many of the homology domains each protein contains and on its biological activity i.e. whether it has pro or anti apoptotic function .

The first subgroup contains proteins having all 4 homology domains i.e. BH1 BH2 BH3 and BH4. Their general effect is anti apoptotic that is to preserve a cell from starting a cell death process. Proteins such as for example Bcl 2 Bcl w Bcl xL Mcl 1 and Bfl 1 A1 are members of this first subgroup. Proteins belonging to the second subgroup contain the three homology domains BH1 BH2 and BH3 and have a pro apoptotic effect. The two main representative proteins of this second subgroup are Bax and Bak. Finally the third subgroup is composed of proteins containing only the BH3 domain and members of this subgroup are usually referred to as BH3 only proteins. Their biological effect on the cell is pro apoptotic. Bim Bid Bad Bik Noxa Hrk Bmf and Puma are examples of this third subfamily of proteins. The exact mechanism by which the Bcl 2 family proteins regulate cell death is still not entirely known and understanding this mechanism is an active area of research in the science community. In one hypothesis of regulation of cell death by Bcl 2 family proteins the BH3 only proteins are further categorized as either activator e.g. Bim and Bid or sensitizer e.g. Bad Bik Noxa Hrk Bmf and Puma proteins depending on their regulatory function.

The key to tissue homeostasis is achieving the delicate balance in the interactions among the three subgroups of protein in cells. Recent studies have tried to elucidate the mechanisms by which pro apoptotic and anti apoptotic subgroups of Bcl 2 family proteins interact to allow a cell to undergo programmed cell death. After receiving intra or extra cellular signals in cells post translational or transcriptional activation of BH3 only proteins occurs. The BH3 only proteins are the primary inducers of an apoptotic cascade that includes as one step the activation of the pro apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak on the mitochondrial membrane in cells. Upon activation of Bax and or Bak that are either already anchored to the mitochondrial membrane or migrate to this membrane Bax and or Bak oligomerize to result in mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization MOMP the release of cytochrome C and downstream activation of effector caspases to ultimately result in cell apoptosis. Some researchers hypothesize that certain BH3 only proteins e.g. Puma Bim Bid are activators in that these proteins directly engage pro apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak to initiate MOMP while other BH3 only proteins e.g. Bad Bik and Noxa are sensitizers and induce Bax and Bak oligomerization indirectly by binding anti apoptotic proteins e.g. Bcl 2 Bcl xL Bcl w Mcl 1 and displacing and freeing up the activator BH3 only proteins which subsequently bind to and activate pro apoptotic proteins e.g. Bax Bak to induce cell death. Other researchers suggest that anti apoptotic proteins engage and seqeuester Bax and Bak directly and all BH3 only proteins regulates this interaction by binding to anti apoptotic proteins e.g. Bcl 2 Bcl xL Bcl w Mcl 1 which results in the release Bax and Bak. See Adams J. M. and Cory S. 2007 26 1324 1337 Willis S. N. et al. 2007 315 856 859. Although the exact interactions through which the anti and pro apoptotic Bcl 2 family proteins regulate apoptosis remain under debate there is a large body of scientific evidence to show that compounds which inhibit the binding of BH3 only proteins to anti apoptotic Bcl 2 family proteins promote apoptosis in cells.

Dysregulated apoptotic pathways have been implicated in the pathology of many significant diseases such as neurodegenerative conditions up regulated apoptosis such as for example Alzheimer s disease and proliferative diseases down regulated apoptosis such as for example cancer autoimmune diseases and pro thrombotic conditions.

In one aspect the implication that down regulated apoptosis and more particularly the Bcl 2 family of proteins is involved in the onset of cancerous malignancy has revealed a novel way of targeting this still elusive disease. Research has shown for example the anti apoptotic proteins Bcl 2 and Bcl xL are over expressed in many cancer cell types. See Zhang J. Y. 2002 1 101 Kirkin V. et al. 2004 1644 229 249 and Amundson S. A. et al. 2000 60 6101 6110. The effect of this deregulation is the survival of altered cells which would otherwise have undergone apoptosis in normal conditions. The repetition of these defects associated with unregulated proliferation is thought to be the starting point of cancerous evolution. Additionally research has shown that BH3 only proteins can act as tumor suppressors when expressed in diseased animals.

These findings as well as numerous others have made possible the emergence of new strategies in drug discovery for targeting cancer. If a small molecule that could mimic the effect of BH3 only proteins were able to enter the cell and overcome the anti apoptotic protein over expression then it could be possible to reset the apoptotic process. This strategy can have the advantage that it can alleviate the problem of drug resistance which is usually a consequence of apoptotic deregulation abnormal survival .

Researchers also have demonstrated that platelets also contain the necessary apoptotic machinery e.g. Bax Bak Bcl xL Bcl 2 cytochrome c caspase 9 caspase 3 and APAF 1 to execute programmed cell death through the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Although circulating platelet production is a normal physiological process a number of diseases are caused or exacerbated by excess of or undesired activation of platelets. The above suggests that therapeutic agents capable of inhibiting anti apoptotic proteins in platelets and reducing the number of platelets in mammals maybe useful in treating pro thrombotic conditions and diseases that are characterized by an excess of or undesired activation of platelets.

We have developed a class of small molecule BH3 only protein mimetics i.e. ABT 737 and ABT 263 that bind strongly to a subset of anti apoptotic Bcl 2 proteins including Bcl 2 Bcl w and Bcl xL but only weakly to Mcl 1 and A1 and exhibits mechanism based cytotoxicity. These compounds were tested in animal studies and demonstrated cytotoxic activity in certain xenograft models as single agents as well as enhanced the effects of a number of chemotherapeutic agents on other xenograft models when used in combination. See Tse C. et al. 2008 68 3421 3428 and van Delft M. F. et al. 2006 10 389 399. These in vivo studies suggest the potential utility of inhibitors of anti apoptotic Bcl 2 family proteins for the treatment of diseases that involve a dysregulated apoptotic pathway.

The natural expression levels of anti apoptotic Bcl 2 family proteins members vary in different cell types. For example in young platelets Bcl xL protein is highly expressed and plays an important role in regulating cell death life span of platelets. Also in certain cancer cell types the cancer cell s survival is attributed to the dysregulation of the apoptotic pathway caused by the over expression of one or more anti apoptotic Bcl 2 protein family members. In view of the important role for Bcl 2 family of proteins in regulating apoptosis in both cancerous and normal i.e. non cancerous cells and the recognized inter cell type variability of Bcl 2 family protein expression it is advantageous to have a small molecule inhibitor that selectively targets and preferably binds to one type or a subset of anti apoptotic Bcl 2 protein s for example to an anti apoptotic Bcl 2 family member that overexpressed in a certain cancer type. Such a selective compound also may confer certain advantages in the clinical setting by providing for example the flexibility to select a dosing regimen a reduced on target toxic effect in normal cells among others e.g. lymphopenia has been observed in Bcl 2 deficient mice . See Nakayama K. et al. 1994 91 3700 3704.

In view of the above there is a need in the art for small molecules therapeutics that can selectively inhibit the activity of one type or a subset of anti apoptotic Bcl 2 proteins for example of a Bcl xL anti apoptotic protein. The present invention fulfills at least this need.

The term C Ccycloalkenyl means a cycloalkenyl ring system containing from x to y carbon atoms. For example C Ccycloalkenyl means a cycloalkenyl ring system containing from 4 to 7 carbon atoms.

The term aryl alone or in combination with another term s means an aromatic carbocyclyl containing from 6 to 14 carbon ring atoms. An aryl may be monocyclic or polycyclic i.e. may contain more than one ring . In the case of polycyclic aromatic rings only one ring the polycyclic system is required to be unsaturated while the remaining ring s may be saturated partially saturated or unsaturated. Examples of aryls include phenyl naphthalenyl indenyl indanyl and tetrahydronaphthyl.

In some instances the number of carbon atoms in a substituent e.g. alkyl alkenyl alkynyl cycloalkyl heterocyclyl heteroaryl and aryl is indicated by the prefix C C wherein x is the minimum and y is the maximum number of carbon atoms. Thus for example C C alkyl refers to an alkyl containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Illustrating further C C cycloalkyl means a saturated hydrocarbyl ring containing from 3 to 8 carbon ring atoms.

The term Cbranched chain alkyl means a saturated hydrocarbyl substituent containing from x to y carbons wherein attachment occurs through a dialkyl trivalent or trialkyl tetravalent carbon radical. Examples of such substituents include isopentanyl pentan 3 yl neopentanyl 2 2 dimethylpropan 2 yl heptan 4 yl and 2 6 dimethylheptan 4 yl.

If a substituent is described as being substituted a non hydrogen radical is in the place of hydrogen radical on a carbon or nitrogen of the substituent. Thus for example a substituted alkyl substituent is an alkyl substituent in which at least one non hydrogen radical is in the place of a hydrogen radical on the alkyl substituent. To illustrate monofluoroalkyl is alkyl substituted with a fluoro radical and difluoroalkyl is alkyl substituted with two fluoro radicals. It should be recognized that if there are more than one substitution on a substituent each non hydrogen radical may be identical or different unless otherwise stated .

If a substituent is described as being optionally substituted the substituent may be either 1 not substituted or 2 substituted. If a substituent is described as being optionally substituted with up to a particular number of non hydrogen radicals that substituent may be either 1 not substituted or 2 substituted by up to that particular number of non hydrogen radicals or by up to the maximum number of substitutable positions on the substituent whichever is less. Thus for example if a substituent is described as a heteroaryl optionally substituted with up to 3 non hydrogen radicals then any heteroaryl with less than 3 substitutable positions would be optionally substituted by up to only as many non hydrogen radicals as the heteroaryl has substitutable positions. To illustrate tetrazolyl which has only one substitutable position would be optionally substituted with up to one non hydrogen radical. To illustrate further if an amino nitrogen is described as being optionally substituted with up to 2 non hydrogen radicals then a primary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to 2 non hydrogen radicals whereas a secondary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to only 1 non hydrogen radical.

The prefix halo indicates that the substituent to which the prefix is attached is substituted with one or more independently selected halogen radicals. For example haloalkyl means an alkyl substituent in which at least one hydrogen radical is replaced with a halogen radical. Examples of haloalkyls include chloromethyl 1 bromoethyl fluoromethyl difluoromethyl trifluoromethyl and 1 1 1 trifluoroethyl. It should be recognized that if a substituent is substituted by more than one halogen radical those halogen radicals may be identical or different unless otherwise stated .

The prefix perhalo indicates that every hydrogen radical on the substituent to which the prefix is attached is replaced with independently selected halogen radicals i.e. each hydrogen radical on the substituent is replaced with a halogen radical. If all the halogen radicals are identical the prefix typically will identify the halogen radical. Thus for example the term perfluoro means that every hydrogen radical on the substituent to which the prefix is attached is substituted with a fluorine radical. To illustrate the term perfluoroalkyl means an alkyl substituent wherein a fluorine radical is in the place of each hydrogen radical.

The term oxy alone or in combination with another term s means an ether substituent and may be depicted as O .

The term alkyloxy alone or in combination with another term s means an alkylether substituent i.e. O alkyl. Examples of such a substituent include methoxy O CH ethoxy n propoxy isopropoxy n butoxy iso butoxy sec butoxy and tert butoxy.

Similarly the term heterocyclylcarbonyl alone or in combination with another term s means C O heterocyclyl.

The term carbocyclylalkylcarbonyl alone or in combination with another term s means C O alkyl carbocyclyl.

Similarly the term heterocyclylalkylcarbonyl alone or in combination with another term s means C O alkyl heterocyclyl.

The term carbocyclylalkyloxycarbonyl alone or in combination with another term s means C O O alkyl carbocyclyl.

The term thio or thia alone or in combination with another term s means replacement by a sulfur radical i.e. a thiaether substituent means an ether substituent wherein a divalent sulfur atom is in the place of the ether oxygen atom. Such a substituent may be depicted as S . For example alkyl thio alkyl means alkyl S alkyl alkyl sulfanyl alkyl .

A prefix attached to a multi component substituent only applies to the first component. To illustrate the term alkylcycloalkyl contains two components alkyl and cycloalkyl. Thus the C C prefix on C C alkylcycloalkyl means that the alkyl component of the alkylcycloalkyl contains from 1 to 6 carbon atoms the C C prefix does not describe the cycloalkyl component. To illustrate further the prefix halo on haloalkyloxyalkyl indicates that only the alkyloxy component of the alkyloxyalkyl substituent is substituted with one or more halogen radicals. If halogen substitution may alternatively or additionally occur on the alkyl component the substituent would instead be described as halogen substituted alkyloxyalkyl rather than haloalkyloxyalkyl. And finally if the halogen substitution may only occur on the alkyl component the substituent would instead be described as alkyloxyhaloalkyl.

In another embodiment the isotope labeled compounds contain deuterium H tritium H or C isotopes. Isotope labeled compounds of this invention can be prepared by the general methods well known to persons having ordinary skill in the art. Such isotope labeled compounds can be conveniently prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Examples disclosed herein and Schemes by substituting a readily available isotope labeled reagent for a non labeled reagent. In some instances compounds may be treated with isotope labeled reagents to exchange a normal atom with its isotope for example hydrogen for deuterium can be exchanged by the action of a deuteric acid such as DSODO. In addition to the above relevant procedures and intermediates are disclosed for instance in Lizondo J et al. 21 11 1116 1996 Brickner S J et al. 39 3 673 1996 Mallesham B et al. 5 7 963 200 3 PCT publications WO1997010223 WO2005099353 WO1995007271 WO2006008754 U.S. Pat.

The isotope labeled compounds of the invention may be used as standards to determine the effectiveness of Bcl xL inhibitors in binding assays. Isotope containing compounds have been used in pharmaceutical research to investigate the in vivo metabolic fate of the compounds by evaluation of the mechanism of action and metabolic pathway of the nonisotope labeled parent compound Blake et al. 64 3 367 391 1975 . Such metabolic studies are important in the design of safe effective therapeutic drugs either because the in vivo active compound administered to the patient or because the metabolites produced from the parent compound prove to be toxic or carcinogenic Foster et al. Advances in Drug Research Vol. 14 pp. 2 36 Academic press London 1985 Kato et al. J. 36 10 927 932 1995 Kushner et al. 77 79 88 1999 .

In addition non radio active isotope containing drugs such as deuterated drugs called heavy drugs can be used for the treatment of diseases and conditions related to Bcl xL activity. Increasing the amount of an isotope present in a compound above its natural abundance is called enrichment. Examples of the amount of enrichment include from about 0.5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 16 21 25 29 33 37 42 46 50 54 58 63 67 71 75 79 84 88 92 96 to about 100 mol . Replacement of up to about 15 of normal atom with a heavy isotope has been effected and maintained for a period of days to weeks in mammals including rodents and dogs with minimal observed adverse effects Czajka D M and Finkel A J. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1960 84 770 Thomson J F Ann. New York Acad. Sci. 1960 84 736 Czakja D M et al. Am. J. Physiol. 1961 201 357 . Acute replacement of as high as 15 23 in human fluids with deuterium was found not to cause toxicity Blagojevic N et al. in Dosimetry Treatment Planning for Neutron Capture Therapy Zamenhof R Solares G and Harling O Eds. 1994. Advanced Medical Publishing Madison Wis. pp. 125 134 Diabetes Metab. 23 251 1997 .

Stable isotope labeling of a drug can alter its physico chemical properties such as pKa and lipid solubility. These effects and alterations can affect the pharmacodynamic response of the drug molecule if the isotopic substitution affects a region involved in a ligand receptor interaction. While some of the physical properties of a stable isotope labeled molecule are different from those of the unlabeled one the chemical and biological properties are the same with one important exception because of the increased mass of the heavy isotope any bond involving the heavy isotope and another atom will be stronger than the same bond between the light isotope and that atom. Accordingly the incorporation of an isotope at a site of metabolism or enzymatic transformation will slow said reactions potentially altering the pharmacokinetic profile or efficacy relative to the non isotopic compound.

The measurement of competition of compounds of Formula I with F Bak for a Bcl 2 family protein Bcl xL binding site using a Time Resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer TR FRET binding assay 

Test compounds were serially diluted in DMSO starting at 50 M 2 starting concentration 10 DMSO and 10 L transferred into a 384 well plate. Then 10 L of a protein probe antibody mix is added to each well at final concentrations listed in Table 1.

The samples are then mixed on a shaker for 1 minute then incubated for an additional 2 hours at room temperature. For each assay plate a probe antibody and protein antibody probe mixture were included as a negative and a positive control respectively. Fluorescence was measured on the ENVISION plate reader Perkin Elmer using a 340 35 nm excitation filter and 520 525 F Bak and 495 510 nm Tb labeled anti his antibody emission filters. Dissociation constants K were determined using Wang s equation Wang Z.X. An 20 exact mathematical expression for describing competitive binding of two different ligands to protein molecule. FEBS Lett. 1995 360 111 114 . The TR FRET assay can be performed in the presence of varying concentrations of human serum HS or fetal bovine serum FBS . TR FRET assay results K in nanomolar for representative compounds of Formula I are provided below in Table 2.

For comparison the measurement of the competition of compounds of Formula I for other Bcl 2 family protein binding sites e.g. Bcl 2 using the TR FRET binding assay was accomplished by substituting GST Bcl xL in the TR FRET assay with other GST labeled protein e.g. GST Bcl 2 prepared in house.

In one embodiment compounds of Formula I selectively inhibit the Bcl 2 family protein Bcl x over other Bcl 2 family proteins such as Bcl 2. For comparison data Kin micromolar from the measurement of the competition by certain compounds of Formula I i.e. Examples 20 43 49 82 99 107 117 130 134 148 159 176 and 185 in Table 3 with F Bak for the Bcl 2 binding site using the TR FRET binding assay are 0.070 0.023 0.039 0.033 0.033 0.056 0.021 0.076 0.024 0.075 0.272 0.177 and 0.014 respectively.

The efficacy of the compounds of Formula I can also be determined in cell based killing assays using a variety of cell lines and mouse tumor models. For example their activity on cell viability can be assessed on a panel of cultured tumorigenic and non tumorigenic cell lines as well as primary mouse or human cell populations. In one exemplary set of conditions mouse FL5.12 cells transfected with Bcl XL were cultured under standard conditions in RPMI with 2 mM glutamine 1 100 mM sodium pyruvate 2 1 M HEPES 4 L L of mercaptoethanol 1 penicillin streptomycin 10 FBS and 10 WEHI 3B conditioned media for IL 3 . For assaying the compound activity the cells were exchanged into an IL 3 depleted deprivation media which was identical to the growth media except for the absence of FBS and WEHI 3B conditional media for 2 days. Then the cells were exchanged to 3 FBS assay media RPMI with 2 mM glutamine 1 100 mM sodium pyruvate 2 1 M HEPES 4 L L of mercaptoethanol 1 penicillin streptomycin 3 FBS . Compounds in series dilutions were added and the cells were cultured for 24 hours. Compounds in series dilutions were added and the cells were cultured for 24 hours.

The single dose pharmacokinetics of select compounds were evaluated in Sprague Dawley rats Charles River after a 5 mg kg oral dose n 3 10 DMSO in PEG 400 administered by gavage or by 5 mg kg IV bolus dose n 3 10 DMSO in PEG 400 . Compound and the internal standard were separated from each other and coextracted contaminants on a 50 mm 3 mm Keystone Betasil CN 5 m column with an acetonitrile 0.1 trifluoroacetic acid mobile phase 50 50 by volume at a flow rate of 0.7 mL min. Analysis was performed on a Sciex API3000 biomolecular mass analyzer with a heated nebulizer interface. Compound and internal standard peak areas were determined using Sciex MacQuan software. The plasma drug concentration of each sample was calculated by least squares linear regression analysis nonweighted of the peak area ratio parent internal standard of the spiked plasma standards versus concentration. The plasma concentration data were submitted to multiexponential curve fitting using WinNonlin.3. The area under the plasma concentration time curve was calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule for the plasma concentration time profiles.

In pharmacology bioavailability BA is a subcategory of absorption and is used to describe the fraction of an administered dose of unchanged drug that reaches the systemic circulation one of the principal pharmacokinetic properties of drugs. By definition when a medication is administered intravenously its bioavailability is 100 see Griffin. J. P. The Textbook of Pharmaceutical Medicine 6th Ed. . New Jersey BMJ Books . However when a medication is administered via other routes such as orally its bioavailability generally decreases due to incomplete absorption and first pass metabolism and may vary from patient to patient. Bioavailability is one of the essential tools in pharmacokinetics as bioavailability must be considered when calculating dosages for non intravenous routes of administration. One way to calculate bioavailability of a drug or agent is by dividing the plasma concentration following an oral dose by the concentration following an intravenous dose. The oral bioavailability as represented by F in Sprague Dawley rats for representative compounds of the invention are provided below in Table 3.

In the drug discovery setting it is generally accepted that Lipinski s rule of 5 predicts that poor oral absorption or poor permeation is likely when two or more of the following metrics are satisfied i there are more than 5 hydrogen bond donors ii the molecular weight is greater than 500 iii there are greater than 10 hydrogen bond acceptors expressed as the sum of nitrogen and oxygen atoms or iv the calculated Log P c Log P is greater than 5 Lipinski et al. Adv. Drug Del. Rev. 2001 3 26 . Indeed the combination of high molecular weight 500 and high c Log P 5 is the best predictor of poor absorption or permeation. Compounds described herein generally exceed the recommended ranges pertaining to molecular weight 500 and c Log P 5 as shown in Table 3. It is notable therefore that Examples described herein have acceptable oral bioavailability in rats as defined by F 10 see Martin 2005 48 3164 as illustrated in Table 3.

Data in Table 2 and cited Molt 4 data show the utility of compounds of the invention to functionally inhibit anti apoptotic Bcl xL protein in a cellular context. The ability of compounds to kill FL5.12 cells over expressing Bcl xL or human tumor cell lines that are dependant upon Bcl xL such as Molt 4 cells is a direct measure of the compound s ability to inhibit anti apoptotic Bcl xL protein function. Compounds of the invention are very effective in killing FL5.12 cells over expressing Bcl xL or human tumor cell lines that are dependant upon Bcl xL such as Molt 4 cells as demonstrated by low ECvalues.
