title: Fragmentation warhead with flexible liner
abstract: A fragmentation warhead with a flexible liner enables increased control of the warhead's fragmentation pattern. The flexible liner is fixed to a rigid portion of the warhead housing. Explosive material is contained in the housing. A fluid is disposed between the explosive material and the flexible liner to function as a shock transition material. The fluid is contiguous with and bears on an inner surface of the flexible liner. A plurality of rigid fragments or a plurality of explosively formed projectile (EFP) liners are fixed to an outer surface of the flexible liner opposite the fluid. Initiation of the explosive material propels the fragments or EFP liners in directions that may be varied by varying the shape of the flexible liner.

The fragmentation effects of a warhead can be delivered by a variety of known techniques. In some cases unintended collateral damage may be caused by warhead fragments. A need exists for an apparatus and method to direct or channel the fragmentation effects of a warhead to a targeted area while simultaneously eliminating excess fragmentation and collateral damage.

One aspect of the invention is a fragmentation warhead with a central longitudinal axis and a housing. The housing includes a portion formed of a flexible liner and a portion formed of a rigid material. A high explosive material is disposed in the housing. A fluid is disposed between the high explosive material and the flexible liner. The fluid is contiguous with and bears on an inner surface of the flexible liner. A plurality of rigid fragments or a plurality of explosively formed projectile liners are fixed to an outer surface of the flexible liner opposite the fluid.

The fluid may be an energetic material. The fluid and the high explosive material may be the same viscous material.

In one embodiment the rigid material portion of the housing may be generally in the shape of a hollow right circular cylinder having one open end and a central longitudinal axis. The flexible liner may be fixed to the perimeter of the one open end. The rigid material portion may include a telescoping portion that moves the flexible liner between concave neutral and convex positions. The flexible liner may be symmetric about the central longitudinal axis of the warhead.

In another embodiment the rigid material portion of the housing may include a pair of opposed end plates and the flexible liner may be fixed to and extend between the pair of opposed end plates to form a side wall of the housing. The side wall of the housing may be movable between concave neutral and convex positions by altering a volume of the fluid in the housing.

A framework in the form of a grid may be disposed between the side wall and the high explosive material. The grid may include a plurality of longitudinal members extending between the pair of opposed end plates and a plurality of circumferential members extending around the side wall. The side wall may be fixed to the plurality of longitudinal members and the plurality of circumferential members to form an individually movable sub curvature for each opening in the grid. The sub curvatures may be movable between concave neutral and convex positions by altering the volume of the fluid in the housing.

Another aspect of the invention is a method that includes providing a warhead having a flexible liner and adjusting a shape of the flexible liner to thereby alter a fragmentation pattern of the warhead.

The step of adjusting may include adjusting the shape of the flexible liner between concave neutral and convex positions.

In one embodiment the step of adjusting includes adjusting the shape of the flexible liner by altering a volume fluid in the warhead.

In another embodiment the step of adjusting includes translating a telescoping portion of the housing of the warhead.

A novel fragmentation warhead has a housing formed in part by a rigid material and in part by a flexible liner. The warhead has a central longitudinal axis. An explosive composition such as a high explosive material is disposed in the housing. A fluid is disposed in the housing between the explosive material and the flexible liner. The fluid is contiguous with and bears on an inner surface of the flexible liner. A plurality of rigid fragments are fixed to an outer surface of the flexible liner opposite the fluid. The rigid fragments are propelled at a high velocity by energy produced when the explosive material is initiated.

In some embodiments a plurality of explosively formed projectile EFP liners may be used in lieu of the plurality of rigid fragments. That is a plurality of EFP liners may be fixed to the outer surface of the flexible liner rather than a plurality of rigid fragments.

In some other embodiments the fluid and the high explosive material may be different materials. By way of example only the fluid may be oil and the explosive material may be a solid material.

The configuration or shape of the flexible liner with the fragments or EFP liners fixed thereto may be adjusted or changed prior to reaction of the explosive material. Adjustment of the flexible liner changes the cone angle of the fragment pattern. The fragment pattern may be adjusted in a continuous manner from a diverging pattern to a linear or neutral pattern to a converging pattern.

In some embodiments the fragments may be propelled in directions that are parallel or acutely angled with respect to the central longitudinal axis of the warhead. These embodiments are end fired warheads. In the end fired warheads adjustment of the shape of the flexible liner may be enabled by altering the volume of fluid in the warhead or by translating a telescoping portion of the rigid part of the housing.

In some other embodiments the fragments may be propelled in directions that are generally radial with respect to the central longitudinal axis of the warhead. These embodiments are side fired warheads. In the side fired warheads adjustment of the shape of the flexible liner may be enabled by altering the volume of fluid in the warhead.

The novel warhead may be used in a variety of ways. By way of example only the warhead may be placed by hand and remotely detonated or the warhead may be launched from a gun tube. In some embodiments the flexible liner may be adjusted manually. In other embodiments the flexible liner may be adjusted by a remotely operated mechanism.

Telescoping portion is translatable with respect to cylinder in the direction of axis A. A sealing ring for sealing fluid may be disposed between telescoping portion and cylinder . The rigid portion of housing is generally in the shape of a hollow right circular cylinder having a central longitudinal axis B and an open end which is closed by flexible liner . The flexible liner is fixed to the perimeter of the telescoping portion and may be symmetric about axes A and B. Axes A and B are coincident.

A plurality of rigid fragments are fixed to an outer surface of the flexible liner opposite the fluid . Fragments may be made of for example steel or other materials. Fragments may be fixed to liner by for example gluing. As mentioned previously a plurality of mini EFP liners not shown may be used in lieu of fragments .

In the embodiment shown the fluid is separated from explosive by a membrane or plate . However fluid and explosive may be the same material for example a viscous explosive material in which case membrane is not needed.

An explosive booster may be disposed in explosive and a detonator disposed adjacent booster . By way of example only detonator may be activated by a wireless electromagnetic signal or a known warhead fuze.
