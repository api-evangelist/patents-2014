Two dimensional 2D codes e.g. bar codes allow for a few kilobytes of information to be stored and decoded using image processing algorithms. Today these 2D codes are often scanned and decoded by smartphones or other mobile devices.

The present solution is directed to an architecture procedure and implementation for securely creating storing delivering presenting and checking IDs passes tickets other certificates and documents in the form of a series of two dimensional codes referred to as motion codes with the use of devices such as smartphones and mobile device. The architecture procedure and implementation of the present solution enables the smartphone or mobile device environment to conclude authentication and validation of legitimacy via the motion code. The present solution generates and provides the motion code as a sequence of static 2D codes which can store more information than static codes. The content of these motion codes is un modifiable and the issuer of the code is verifiable. As a result of the application of subsequent 2D codes in a form of motion picture devices such as smartphones can display detect and process more pieces of 2D code based information than in the case of using static 2D codes. Production delivery presentation and checking of such motion 2D codes is simpler less costly and more secure than any traditional ID ticket certificate pass or other document management systems.

In some aspects the present solution addresses various issues. In order to avoid data not being verified with a valid signature and or created on unsafe devices including mobile instruments data of the pass ID ticket etc. encodes via the motion code of the present solution is digitally signed by the issuer s equipment. The issuer may provide and maintains all the information and the tool that is needed for digitally sign the issued motion codes that represent pass ID ticket etc. In some cases it may be a further issue that during the public communication between the mobile device and the signature device it cannot be determined whether the signature device is addressed by a valid mobile device or another entity masking itself as a valid one. Implementations of the present solution provide a secure communication between the signature and the mobile devices ensured by a secondary so called push channel. Using this channel the signature device can directly send a security token to the mobile device within the short time or sufficient frequency applicable for the given device. In some implementations when presenting the information the mobile presentational device can complement the original data for every single frame with one time jump codes location information and or time stamps synchronized with the mobile network further reducing the possibility of faults.

In one aspect of the present solution the implementation and process is based on an image repetition frequency of the two dimension code presentation ranging from 1 frame sec to 40 frame sec. The color of the two dimension code presentation can also vary depending on the place and or date of submission. To extend storage capacity without increasing number of presented codes or the presentation and or detection time the presented codes can also be colorful where coloring can encodes additional information. Further meanwhile the appearance of the two dimension code shall provide a safe empiric sensation for the end user. Certain varying parts of the two dimension codes can also be masked depending on the time and or place of the application. The shield may also disappear dependent on the time and place e.g. an event ticket shall be meaningfully processed in its entirety merely on the date and in the spot of the event s place .

Using components of the architecture and the procedure knowledge and possession based two factor authentication or biometric authentication certificate and dynamic management of permissions for example ticket can be completed in such a manner that sufficiently short time or frequency can be dynamically set or fine tuned in accordance with the current state of technology and the size of presentable information is restricted only by transfer speeds and reasonable patience during awaiting time shown in verification delays.

Referring now to the systems and methods of the architecture process and implementation of a motion QR code will be described. In general a motion QR code is a 2D code that is played as a motion picture of 2D codes or as a sequence of 2D codes over time. The motion QR code is encoded with a flow of data that is displayed or played to sequentially reveal display or otherwise visualize a plurality of 2D codes encoding such data. The 2D codes can include 2D barcodes QR codes Aztec codes data matrix codes or similar codes and are generically referred to as 2D codes. In comparison to a traditional 2D code the motion QR code dramatically increases the amount of information encoded carried and displayed. The QR motion codes can be displayed on and scanned by applications executing on client devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. The QR motion codes can be incorporated into IDs certificates tickets passes or other documents and management systems.

Each and or any of the components of the mQR server may include or be implemented as one or more applications programs libraries scripts services processes tasks and or any type and form of executable instructions executing on one or more devices such as any of the servers .

The mQR server includes a transmit and receive TX RX module for sending and or receiving communications such as network packets to from other devices over one or more networks . In some implementations the TX RX module is a network interface or similar I O port as described above in relation to . Through the TX RX module the mQR server sends data to and receives data from the various components of the system . For example and as described below the mQR server uses the TX RX module to transmits mQR codes to the client device . The TX RX module communicates with the components of the system through a network such as the above described network . For example the mQR server may communicate with the components of the system over a local area network LAN a wide area network WAN wireless area network intranets and other communication networks such as mobile telephone networks the Internet or a combination thereof.

The mQR server also includes a mQR generation module . The mQR generation module is configured to create generate or otherwise provide mQR codes that encodes one or more data items such as a flow of data requested by a requestor. Generally a mQR code can be referred to in two forms. The data form such as the form transmitted between devices may be referred to as a mQR byte array. The display form such as the visual presentation of the data form may be referred to as the mQR code. The term mQR code may be used herein to describe the mQR byte array in its data form and or the mQR code in its displayed form.

The mQR generation module is configured to receive a request to generate a mQR code and generates the mQR code responsive to the request. In some implementations the request is received from the permission issuer or another component of the system . The request includes data or a flow of data e.g. content that is to be encoded by the mQR generation module to become the generated mQR code. The mQR generation module generates the mQR code as a byte array which is later displayed by a client . The mQR byte array is described further in relation to . In general the mQR generation module arranges the data of the mQR code into a series or sequence of a plurality of 2D codes. In some implementations the mQR generation module also includes a mask display frequency permissions data or any other information for the subsequent display or visualization of the mQR code as further described herein.

The mQR server also includes an authentication module . In some implementation the authentication module is configured to authenticate a user and or device of the user. The authentication module may be configured to use one factor or two factor authentication. In some embodiments the authentication module uses biometric information of a user to authenticate the user. The authentication module may communicate with one or more other servers to authenticate a user and or device of the user.

In some implementations the authentication module is configured to authenticate the mQR code. In some implementations the authentication module digitally signs with a digital signature the mQR byte array after the byte array is generated by the mQR generation module . For example the byte array generated by the mQR generation module may be signed with a private signature. Signing the mQR byte array by the authentication module enables the other components of the system to determine the authenticity of the mQR byte array when they receive the mQR byte array. For example an mQR application executing on a client may be configured to convert the mQR byte array into an mQR code for display only if the mQR byte array is signed with an acceptable digital signature and its authenticity is verified. Likewise the authentication module may verify the authenticity of an mQR byte array or data flow that is received by or presented to the mQR server based on the digital signature.

The mQR server may also include an encryption module for encrypting the mQR code such as the byte array and any portion of communications herein and for decrypting the same. The encryption module may be configured to perform asymmetric or symmetric encryption and or decryption. Although generally the encryption module is referred to as encrypting the encryption module may be designed and constructed to perform both encryption and decryption. The encryption module may encrypt the item to be encrypted such as the byte array of the mQR code using a private key that the encryption module stores and or maintains for decryption. The encryption module may decrypt using the private key any item that the encryption module has encrypted. The mQR server can be configured to encrypt the mQR byte array before the byte array is transmitted to a client . In some implementations the encryption module encrypts the bye array for storage in the mQR storage . In another implementation the encryption module is involved in encrypting the communications between the mQR server and the various components of the system . For example the encryption module may manage a secure communication protocols for example Secure Socket Layer Transport Layer Security or Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol HTTPS connection to the client for the delivery of a mQR code byte code array to the client

The mQR server also includes a mQR storage . In some implementations the mQR storage is similar to the above described storage device . In some implementations the mQR server maintains a record of the mQR codes that the mQR server generates and distributes to any type and form of database. For example after generating and delivering a mQR code to a client the mQR server may save the mQR code and or any information related to the mQR code into the mQR storage comprising a database. The mQR server may track the usage and or activity of the mQR code to the database in storage. When the client device attempts to use the mQR code the mQR code is authenticated with the mQR server . The mQR server may ensure that a copy of the mQR code is saved in the mQR storage before further processing the mQR code. In some implementations the mQR server may verify the mQR code has not been used before by referencing the mQR storage . For example assume that the mQR is used as a concert ticket. When the guest presents his ticket at the gate the mQR is processed with the system by the concert attendant. The mQR server may then indicate to the attendant that the mQR code is valid and has not been used before. The mQR server may then save an indication that the mQR code has been used in association with the mQR code saved in the mQR storage . If a second user later attempts to use the same mQR code the mQR server may indicate to the attendant that the mQR code was previously used. In some implementations the mQR codes stored in the mQR storage are deleted from the mQR storage . The deletion of mQR codes from the mQR storage may be done at predetermined intervals e.g. mQR codes older may be phased out after 30 days or the mQR codes may be deleted after they are indicated as being used.

The system also includes a communication server . The communication server is a server or similar device that is configured to perform or handle communications between the mQR server and any client devices. As described below an issuer of a mQR code can select to have the mQR server send the mQR code directly to a client or the issuer may request that the mQR code be pushed to the client such via a push communication channel. In some implementations the communication server is a push server. For example the communication server may be a push server using the HTTP server push protocol long polling Flash XML socket relays or similar push protocols. In some implementations the communication server may be a push server maintained by third party for example the Apple Push Notification Service or the Android Cloud to Device Messaging Service. In some implementations transmitting a mQR byte array to the client through the communication server enables the mQR server to determine that the mQR server is addressing a valid client and not another entity masking itself as a valid client .

The system also includes a plurality of client devices . The clients illustrated in relation to system are similar to the clients described above in relationship to . Each client includes one or more processors to execute the mQR application . A mQR code transaction typically includes a first client on the issuer side of the transaction and a second client on the user side of the transaction. In some implementations the mQR application executed by each of the clients is capable of performing the functions described herein on either side of the transaction. In other implementations the user client executes a user mQR application and the issuer client executes an issuer mQR application .

As an overview the mQR application is configured to receive process and or handle the motion codes of the present solution. The mQR application may receive a mQR code from the mQR server . The mQR code may be received as a mQR byte array. The mQR application is designed constructed and or configured to understand interpret and process the structure format and or information carried by and or stored via the mQR byte array. The mQR application process and or translates the mQR byte array into a visualization of the mQR code that is displayed via the display . The application may be configured to display the series sequence or motion picture of the plurality of 2D codes of the mQR code at a predetermined frequency between about 1 frame second to about 40 frames second. The application may be configured to display the series sequence or motion picture of the plurality of 2D codes of the mQR code through a predetermined number of loops such as 1 2 3 or N times. The application may be configured to display the series sequence or motion picture of the plurality of 2D codes of the mQR code continuously until a predetermined event such as a user requesting the application to stop displaying the mQR code or receiving an indication that the mQR code was scanned or read.

The clients may include a camera such as to scan or read any codes 2D codes or motion codes. On the issuer side of the transaction the client uses the display and camera to scan a displayed mQR code. The application on the client that scans the mQR code may translate decode or otherwise generate the byte array that corresponds to the mQR code. The byte array may be forwarded to the mQR server for authentication and or further processing.

The system also includes a permission issuer . In some implementations the permission issuer is a server or other computing device owned or operated by the entity that requests the mQR code be issued. For example the permission issuer may be a ticket agent or similar entity that issues tickets to users. The permission issuer is in communication with the mQR server . The permission issuer sends mQR requests to the mQR server . As described below the mQR server then generates the mQR responsive to the request. In some implementations the requests can include content a desired method of delivery and a recipient e.g. an email address or phone number of the recipient . In some implementations the permission issuer provides the authentication module of the mQR server with the private signature key with which the mQR code data array is signed.

In some implementations the request to generate a mQR code comes from a third party. For example the request may come from a distributor of tickets. In these implementations the third party may transmit the request to the mQR server . Realizing the request is from a third party the mQR server may then forward the request to the permission issuer for authorization. Responsive to receiving authorization from the permission issuer the mQR server may then generate and transmit the mQR code responsive the request form the third party.

In some implementations the system may include a client device and application on the client for the issuer or a controller or entity controlling access or use of the mQR code of the issuer. The issuer or controller client scans a mQR code and then sends an indication of the scanned mQR code directly to the mQR server . In other implementations the clients sends the indication to the permission issuer which then forwards the indication or other data to the mQR server . The indication sent to the mQR server or the permission issuer can be a scan log. The scan log can include information relating the scan of the mQR code. For example the scan log can indicate when and where the mQR was scanned who scanned the mQR code the user of the mQR code event or other ticket information time stamp information or any combination thereof. In some implementations if the indication is sent directly to the mQR server the mQR server may forward a log or other report back to the permission issuer to indicate that a mQR code was used.

The mQR byte array includes a plurality of data items representing or implementing a flow of data encoded by and to be delivered or provided via a sequence of 2D codes of the mQR code and or information for generating and displaying or visualizing the mQR code. When displayed an mQR code is displayed as a series of QR codes. Each of the 2D code data items represent the data encoded in each of the series of QR codes. Each of the 2D code data items includes a flow of data that is used to generate one of the QR codes e.g. frames of the mQR code. As described below in relation to in some implementations the data flows from the request into each of the 2D code data items in a non sequential manner. For example a first portion of the data may flow into the 2D code data item and a second portion of the data may flow into the 2D code data item . As illustrated in the mQR byte array includes n 2D code data items . The number of code data items can be varied responsive to the amount of data that is to be transferred with the mQR code.

The color data item is the data item for encoding or identifying one or more colors for the mQR. In some implementations the mQR code is displayed in one or more colors. In some implementations the mQR may change color responsive data within the permissions data item . For example the mQR code may display as a first color and then display as a second color a predetermined amount of time before the mQR code is to be used. Furthering the example the mQR code may turn from red to green when the doors open for a concert or when the client is within a given distance of the concert hall.

Similarly the mQR code may be displayed with a mask. A mask is an image that blocks or obfuscates a portion or the entirety of the mQR code. The data for the mask is stored encoded or otherwise identified by the mask data item . A mask may be applied to an mQR code for security purposes or to ensure that the mQR code is only used at a predetermined time. The mask may cover a portion of the mQR code and prevent the entirety of the mQR code from being displayed until a predetermined amount of time. In some implementations the mask blocks a portion or region of the mQR code responsive to the current time or location of the client displaying the mQR code.

The mQR byte array may also include a permissions data item for the storage of the permissions associated with the mQR byte array . As described above different colors and masks may be used to control the permissions of who when e.g. date or time and where e.g. place or location an mQR code may be used. In some implementations the data stored within the permissions data item indicates to the mQR application displaying the mQR code when an mQR code may be displayed. The data within the permissions data item may be encrypted or digitally signed such that the mQR application knows that the permissions and the array have not been altered. In some implementations the user is authenticated through one or two factor authentication before the mQR code is displayed. The mQR application may perform a hash on a password the user enters and then compare the hash to a hash saved in the permissions data item to determine if the mQR code should be displayed. The mQR application may authenticate a user using passwords finger prints facial characteristics DNA or any combination thereof.

The mQR byte array may include a steganography data item . In some implementations the mQR code is hidden within an image or video. The data for the images that hide the mQR code or otherwise provide the steganogram is stored in the steganography data item . In some implementations the steganography data item also stores audio data. The application may play the audio data when displaying the mQR code in a manner where the audio signal is not perceivable to the human ear. For example the audio signal may be an additional way in which the mQR code is authenticated.

In some implementations the mQR byte array includes a frequency data item. In other implementations the frequency data item may be coded or configured into the executable instructions of the application . The data at the frequency data item indicates at what speed the 2D QR codes should be displayed in visualization the mQR code. In some implementations the display frequency of the mQR code is between about 1 frame second to about 40 frames second. In some implementations the frequency data item includes a plurality of frequencies. In these implementations the display frequency of the mQR code may dynamically update as the application displays the mQR code.

The mQR byte array may also include instruction data items related to the generation and visualization of the mQR code on the client device . For example the mQR byte array may include information such as mQR code display size length or number of times the mQR code is to be displayed header information that indicates the location of the above described data items within the mQR byte array or any combination thereof.

In some implementations the non sequential encoding of the array provides an extra layer of security. For example if the data was sequentially displayed then a third party viewing the display of the mQR could possibly collect and decode the data transmitted by the mQR code . However if the mQR code is generated with non sequential byte array then if a third party intercepts the mQR code they will be unable to create the data because they do not in what order to place the bytes decoded from the mQR code .

In further details of step the mQR server receives a request to generate a mQR code. The request may comprise a request to generate data flow to be displayed via the mQR code. The request may identify any combination i data to be encoded in the data flow ii the method of delivery the assembled byte array to the client device and or iii the information necessary to identify the client and the client device In some implementations the request comes from an issuer that is located remotely from the server that receives the request. For example the issuer may be a venue that is selling tickets for a concert that is going to be held at the venue. The request can include data the issuer wishes to be included in the mQR code such as but not limited to ticket information seating information user information or any combination thereof. The request can also include an indication of how the issuer wishes the mQR code to be delivered to the recipient of the mQR code. For example the issuer may request the mQR code be delivered to the recipient through a secure channel using the above described communication server by email by text message or by a similar messaging service. The request can also include permissions information. For example the request may include a hashed password or other security feature to ensure that only a valid recipient of the mQR code is able to display the mQR code. The permission information may also include masking data times locations and other conditions under which the mQR code may be displayed.

At step the server generates the mQR code. The mQR server may generate the byte array of the mQR code using the data and information from the request such as by encoding a flow of data from the request into the sequence of 2D codes of the mQR code. In some implementations the server collects the information from the issuer and encodes the data into the mQR byte array. In some implementations the server encodes and packages the data in a format similar to that described above in relation to . The server may also encode other information necessary for the visualization the mQR code into the mQR byte array. For example the server may include specific colors for the display of the mQR code or a specific frequency at which the mQR code is to be displayed. In some implementations the server also encrypts the mQR byte array or includes other security features into the byte array such as stenography data.

At step the server digitally signs the mQR byte array. The server may sign the encoded mQR byte code array with a private signature key. In some implementations the private signature key is provided by the issuer. By signing the mQR byte array a client receiving the mQR byte array can determine that the mQR byte array is authentic and was delivered from a valid server.

At step the mQR byte array is transmitted. The server transmits the mQR byte array to the client device. As described above in relation to the server may transmit the mQR byte array to the client directly or through a secure push server such as the communication server . As described above the method of transmission can be determined by the issuer in the request of step . In some implementations the mQR byte array is pushed by the communication server directly to the mQR application executing on the client . In other implementations the server delivers the mQR byte array to the client device through a third party application. For example the server may deliver the mQR byte array through email or a text message. The user may then click on an attachment or link in the email to open the mQR code in the mQR application .

At step the mQR code is displayed by the client. The client receives the mQR code as a mQR byte array. When a user wishes to display the mQR code the user launches the mQR code application on the client. The application then decodes the mQR code array and generates a visualization of the mQR code for display. Decoding can include generating the plurality of 2D QR codes that form the mQR code and applying the appropriate masks colors or other security features as are encoded in the mQR byte code array. Responsive to decoding the mQR byte array into a mQR code the client device such as via the application displays the mQR code. In some implementations the mQR code is played through a predetermined number of times. In other implementations the application continues to display the mQR code in a continuous manor until the mQR code is successful scanned or the user quits the application. The server may provide the client with an indication when the displayed mQR code has successfully been scanned.

At step the displayed mQR code is scanned. As the client device displays the mQR code the mQR code may be scanned by an issuer or controller client device. The issuer or controller client device may be a smart phone or tablet with a camera. Using the camera the issuer client may scan or record the mQR code displayed on the client. Responsive to scanning or recording the mQR code the issuer or controller client re encodes the mQR code into a mQR byte array. The mQR byte array may be transmitted to the permission issuer or to the mQR server for authentication. For example the issuer or controller client may transmit the re encoded byte array to the server to determine if the mQR code has been used before. In some implementations the issuer or controller client may transmit an indication of the re encoded byte array. For example the issuer or controller client may transmit a hash of the re encoded byte array to the permission issuer or the server for authentication. In some implementations the issuer or controller client is loaded with indications of mQR codes from the mQR storage such that the issuer client can authenticate mQR codes without reconnecting to the permission issuer or the server. For example if an event is to be held in a remote location with poor network connectivity the issuer or controller client may download an indication of the mQR codes tickets that were sold for the event. The mQR codes may then be verified at the event without the issuer or controller client having to reconnect to the server. At a later point in time such as when the issuer or controller client reestablishes a network connection the issuer or controller client may transmit an indication of the scanned mQR codes to the permission issuer and or server.

At step when the mQR code is successfully scanned by the issuer client the application scanning the mQR code on the issuer client generates an indication that the mQR code was scanned. The indication may be a log of the scan result or a similar data structure that is transmitted to the permission issuer and or server when a successful scan has been made. In some implementations the application on the issuer or controller client also generates a local indication for the user of the issuer or controller client. For example the application may generate an audible tone or flash. The indication alerts the users of the issuer client and the user client that the mQR code was successfully scanned. Additionally the application on the issuer or controller client may provide a negative indication if a mQR code is not successfully read after a predetermined number of attempts or amount of time.

While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to specific embodiments it should be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention described in this disclosure.
