This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 e to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 62 022 473 which was filed in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Jul. 9 2014 the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates generally to location tracking and more particularly to apparatuses and methods for specifying and activating a location perimeter referred to as a geo fence using a power efficient geo fence solver.

There is a location service generally provided by application programming interfaces API on smart phones and other location enabled devices called geo fencing. A geo fence is a virtual perimeter imposed on a geographic area where the user e.g. application on a user equipment UE describes areas of interests either to get notification on entering leaving or precise navigation in certain areas. For example a dynamic geo fence may be continuously defined around the UE so that the UE may retrieve points of interest POI geographically located within a dynamic geo fence and provide those POI to the UE. However continuous movement of the UE such as might occur in a vehicle may result in repeated geo fence redefinition i.e. the UE crosses over the geo fence perimeter and POI retrieval both which may drain the UE s power source.

Therefore there exists a need for apparatuses and methods for specifying and activating a geo fence using a power efficient geo fence solver.

The present invention has been made to address the above problems and disadvantages and to provide at least the advantages described below. Accordingly an aspect of the present invention which may prove useful in the related arts is to provide apparatuses and methods for specifying and activating a geo fence using a power efficient geo fence solver.

Various embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description specific details such as detailed configuration and components are merely provided to assist in the overall understanding of these embodiments of the present invention. Therefore it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications of the embodiments described herein can be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention. In addition descriptions of well known functions and constructions are omitted for clarity and conciseness.

As noted above apparatuses and methods for specifying and activating a geo fence using a power efficient geo fence solver may prove useful in the related arts and such a geo fence solver is herein described.

In accordance with the embodiments of the present invention two chipsets are provided in a UE and are programmed for determining when the UE moves into and out of geo fence areas. The UE can be embodied in various forms including but not limited to personal computers laptop computers personal digital assistants PDAs mobile cellular phones smart phones etc. For illustrative purposes it is assumed that the UE is a smart phone.

The pertinent components of the UE include a first chipset and a second chip set . For illustrative purposes the second chipset is shown as a separate component from the first chip set . However the second chipset may be embedded on the first chipset e.g. to provide a tracker global navigation satellite system GNSS solution which would provide a power efficient geo fencing device on a tracker solution conventional tracker solutions are typically deemed not to be suitable for power efficient geo fence operations due to their lack of location knowledge.

The UE may also include one or more transmitters receivers antennas speakers displays memory and other peripherals e.g. drivers . The first chipset and or the second chipset communicates with these devices to perform one or more functions of the UE .

The first chip set is a high power chipset that provides logic calculations and data storage e.g. to the memory and includes at least one first processor for controlling one or more of the devices and at least one geo fence module for generating a first set of geo fence rules and a second set of geo fence rules .

The geo fence module of the first chipset is programmed to process all the data relating to the first set of geo fence rules e.g. the full set of geo fence rules . As the first set of geo fence rules require a great deal of memory and power to solve the geo fence module of the first chipset is also programmed to generate the second set of geo fence rules which are a simplified subset of the first set of geo fence rules .

In accordance with the embodiments of the present invention if it is determined that the at least one of the second set of geo fence rules is broken then this may be indicative that one of the first set of geo fence rules is broken. More importantly however if none of the second set of geo fence rules is broken then this is indicative that none of the first set of geo fence rules is broken the significance of which is described in greater detail below.

Once the geo fence module of the first chipset generates the second set of geo fence rules the first processor transmits these rules to the second chipset which operates in a power memory resource efficient manner while monitoring the second set of geo fence rules . After the geo fence module transmits the second set of geo fence rules to the second chipset the geo fence module transmits a power down command or sleep mode command to the first processor of the first chipset which is then powered down.

The second chipset has strict memory and processing constraints thereby allowing the second chipset to operate at a much lower power level as compared to the first chipset . The second chipset includes at least one clock e.g. a low power low accuracy 18 kHz clock and at least one second processor e.g. a location processor including at least one navigation ranging module .

In embodiments of the present invention it may prove advantageous for the second chipset to be programmed to access location information e.g. GNSS information microelectromechanical systems MEMS Sensor information WiFi connection information cellular information etc.

The second processor receives the second set of geo fence rules from the geo fence module and determines if at least one of the second set of geo fence rules has been broken. When the second processor of the second chipset determines that at least one of the second set of geo fence rules is broken the second processor notifies the geo fence module of the first chipset so that the geo fence module can determine if any of the first set of geo fence rules has been broken .

If the geo fence module determines that none of the first geo fence rules have been broken the geo fence module generates another second set of geo fence rules which may be the same as or different from the original second set of geo fence rules . On the other hand if it is determined that at least one of the first geo fence rules is broken the geo fence module transmits a power up command or wake command to the first processor of the first chipset which is then powered up. After the first chipset is powered up the second chipset is set to a continuous update mode and the first processor of the first chipset monitors a geo fence area to the determine if the UE moves outside of the geo fence area and upon the UE moving outside of the geo fence area the geo fence module generates another second set of geo fence rules.

While the first set of geo fence rules are shown as circles this is merely for illustrative purposes. Generally however the first sets of geo fence rules are not this small and do not operate on circles.

For example is a diagram illustrating the UE shown in within a geo fence region that is based on a simplified set of geo fence rules according to another embodiment of the present invention. As shown in at least one of the first sets of geo fence rules and the second set of geo fence rules are embodied in a polygon configuration e.g. rectangular configuration star configuration random configuration.

In the small circles represent a plurality of geo fence areas each including a corresponding set of active geo fence rules e.g. the first set of geo fence rules . When the first chipset of the UE is required to execute geo fence operations for example as requested by a set of smart phone apps of the UE the first processor of the first chipset sends the first sets of geo fence rules to the geo fence module which monitors all of the active first sets of geo fence rules e.g. not uncommon to be greater than 1000 .

Instead of transmitting all of the active first sets of geo fence rules to the second chipset the geo fence module generates the second set of geo fence rules which as described above if broken may be indicative that at least one of the active geo fence rules has been broken.

Referring to the second set of geo fence rules are represented by the large circle and are transmitted to the second processor of the second chipset . The second set of geo fence rules do not represent a particular geo fence area but rather an area of interest that when crossed by the UE alerts the second processor to notify the geo fence module of the first chipset to determine whether at least one of the first geo fence rules has been broken.

After the geo fence module of the first chipset transmits the second set of geo fence rules to the second processor the geo fence module powers down e.g. is placed in sleep mode . In accordance with embodiments of the present invention it may prove advantageous to power down the entire first chipset e.g. when the first chipset is not performing other functions for the UE .

Moreover if signal conditions are adequate after receiving the second set of geo fence rules the second processor of the second chipset can also power down one or more clocks of the second chipset while the clock which as noted above is a low power low accuracy clock remains operable to track the furthest possible movement of the UE . One such clock may for example be a high power clock not explicitly shown which may be shared with other components of the UE . Thus when signal conditions are adequate the second processor of the second chipset may power off or allow to power off the high power clock such as when the radio of the UE is not needed. As can be appreciated performing such operations may further decrease overall power consumption of the UE . In certain instances however e.g. when the radio of the UE needs to be power cycled quickly to receive RF data phase coherent with the last time the radio was on it may prove advantageous to keep the high power clock on.

Referring to if the UE moves outside of the second set of geo fence rules i.e. outside the area of interest that was transmitted to the second processor of the second chipset the second processor notifies the geo fence module e.g. gives the geo fence module the current position of the UE that at least one of the second geo fence rules has been broken. Thereafter the geo fence module determines if the at least one second rule that was broken is indicative of any of the first geo fence rules being broken.

Referring to if the second geo fence rule that was broken is not indicative of breaking at least one of the first sets of geo fence rules i.e. the geo fence module determines that the UE is not within a real geo fence area or is far enough away from any real geo fence areas the geo fence module generates another second set of geo fence rules based on where the UE is located and the geo fence module again powers down e.g. goes back to sleep. Again the second set of geo fence rules do not represent a particular geo fence area but rather an area of interest that when crossed by the UE alerts the second processor to notify the geo fence module of the first chipset to determine whether at least one of the first set of geo fence rules has been broken.

Referring to if the UE moves outside of the another second set of geo fence rules i.e. outside the area of interest that was transmitted to the second processor of the second chipset the second processor notifies the geo fence module e.g. gives the geo fence module the current position that at least one of the another second geo fence rules has been broken. Thereafter the geo fence module determines if the at least one of the another second rules that was broken is indicative of any of the first geo fence rules being broken.

Referring to if the geo fence module determines that the at least of the another second set of geo fence rules is broken and is indicative of breaking at least one of the first set of geo fence rules i.e. the UE moved within a real geo fence area the geofence module in embodiments notifies the second processor to switch the second chipset to a continuous update mode. In continuous update mode the second processor of the second chipset in normal power saving mode performs continuous 1 Hz updates assuming that this is requested by the first geo fence rule . It is noted that while the second processor performs the continuous 1 Hz updates the second processor does not process information relating to the real geo fence area hence the reason why the second chipset is capable of functioning in normal power savings mode as the second processor is not loaded down with heavy calculations associated with monitoring the real geo fence area.

In embodiments according to the present invention the geofence module may send a different notification to the second chipset as the contents of notification may change according to which one of the first set of geo fence rules was broken.

With continued reference to the geo fence module and or the first processor of the first chipset monitors the real geo fence area as the UE moves shown by the dashed lines within the real geo fence area corresponding to the first set of geo fence rules in within the real geo fence area to determine amongst other things if the UE moves outside of the real geo fence area. Since the first chipset is required to be active within the real geo fence area there is no need while the UE is within the real geo fence area to generate and transmit another second set geo fence rules to the second chipset as such an operation would require the second chipset to use more power i.e. the second chipset would be required to monitor the another second set of geo fence rules i.e. an area of interest.

Upon the UE moving outside of the real geo fence area the geo fence module generates another second set of geo fence rules not shown and transmits the another second set of rules to the second processor of the second chipset so that the aforementioned process may be repeated.

In accordance with the present invention the apparatuses and method described herein overcome the drawbacks described above associated with conventional UEs. More specifically as the second chipset is only programmed to determine when at least one of second set of geo fence rules is broken the second chipset does not require the computational resources or memory to resolve the full set of geo fence rules e.g. the first set of geo fence rules which results in less power consumption of the UE . Additionally as the first chipset can be completely powered off until the at least one rule of the second set of geo fence rules is broken which in practice can be many hours potentially even days results in even less power consumption of the UE when compared to conventional UEs.

While the apparatuses and methods have been described herein using first and second chipsets more than two chipsets can be used. For example third fourth fifth etc. chipsets can be used such that the second set of geo fence rules can be simplified even further thus making the geo fence solving operation even more efficient. In such embodiments these chipsets for example may detect relative ranging source differences from radio sources and may be provided with a simplified rule set to monitor the ranging differences. The additional chipsets may also notify upwards e.g. from a fifth chipset to a first chipset if the simplified rule set is broken. Other than the number of chipsets being implemented the basic concept described hereinabove remains the same.

In embodiments according to the present invention the second processor of the second chipset can also be programmed to determine if after receiving the second set of geo fence rules from the geo fence module the second set of geo fence rules should be redefined to include a long term power down duration of the first chipset such as when the UE is a predetermined distance away from breaking the first set of geo fence rules . If it is determined that the second set of geo fence rules should be redefined the second processor and or the navigation ranging module of the second chipset notifies the geo fence module to power down the first chipset for the long term power down duration. In such an embodiment the clock of the second chipset is powered up for the long term power down duration and is configured to alert the second processor upon expiry of the long term power down duration.

In embodiments the second processor of the second chip set may be programmed to generate power efficient rule sets for MEMS and WiFi engines when such rule sets are deemed more power efficient.

While the present invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to certain embodiments thereof it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the following claims and their equivalents.
