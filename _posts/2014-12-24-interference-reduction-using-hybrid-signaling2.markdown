The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 943 969 filed Feb. 24 2014 the entire specification of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

Wireless mobile communication technology uses various standards and protocols to transmit data between a node e.g. a transmission station and a wireless device e.g. a mobile device . Some wireless devices communicate using orthogonal frequency division multiple access OFDMA in a downlink DL transmission and single carrier frequency division multiple access SC FDMA in an uplink UL transmission. Standards and protocols that use orthogonal frequency division multiplexing OFDM for signal transmission include the third generation partnership project 3GPP long term evolution LTE the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE 802.16 standard e.g. 802.16e 802.16m which is commonly known to industry groups as WiMAX Worldwide interoperability for Microwave Access and the IEEE 802.11 standard which is commonly known to industry groups as WiFi.

In 3GPP radio access network RAN LTE systems the node can be a combination of Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network E UTRAN Node Bs also commonly denoted as evolved Node Bs enhanced Node Bs eNodeBs or eNBs and Radio Network Controllers RNCs which communicates with the wireless device known as a user equipment UE . The downlink DL transmission can be a communication from the node e.g. eNodeB to the wireless device e.g. UE and the uplink UL transmission can be a communication from the wireless device to the node.

In homogeneous networks the node also called a macro node can provide basic wireless coverage to wireless devices in a cell. The cell can be the area in which the wireless devices are operable to communicate with the macro node. Heterogeneous networks HetNets can be used to handle the increased traffic loads on the macro nodes due to increased usage and functionality of wireless devices. HetNets can include a layer of planned high power macro nodes or macro eNBs overlaid with layers of lower power nodes small eNBs micro eNBs pico eNBs femto eNBs or home eNBs HeNBs that can be deployed in a less well planned or even entirely uncoordinated manner within the coverage area cell of a macro node. The lower power nodes LPNs can generally be referred to as low power nodes small nodes or small cells.

In LTE data can be transmitted from the eNodeB to the UE via a physical downlink shared channel PDSCH . A physical uplink control channel PUCCH can be used to acknowledge that data was received. Downlink and uplink channels or transmissions can use time division duplexing TDD or frequency division duplexing FDD .

Reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments illustrated and specific language will be used herein to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended.

Before the present invention is disclosed and described it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular structures process steps or materials disclosed herein but is extended to equivalents thereof as would be recognized by those ordinarily skilled in the relevant arts. It should also be understood that terminology employed herein is used for the purpose of describing particular examples only and is not intended to be limiting. The same reference numerals in different drawings represent the same element. Numbers provided in flow charts and processes are provided for clarity in illustrating steps and operations and do not necessarily indicate a particular order or sequence.

An initial overview of technology embodiments is provided below and then specific technology embodiments are described in further detail later. This initial summary is intended to aid readers in understanding the technology more quickly but is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the technology nor is it intended to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

A technology is described for reducing signal interference at a user equipment UE using network assisted interference cancellation and suppression NAICS . The UE can be served by a serving evolved node B eNB . The UE can be adjacent to a cell edge within a cell that is served by the serving eNB. In a neighboring cell a neighboring eNB may cause signal interference for the UE. In order to enable the UE to mitigate the signal interference the neighboring eNB can periodically send semi static signaling to the UE. In one configuration the neighboring eNB can send the semi static signaling to the UE via the serving eNB. For example the neighboring eNB can send the semi static signaling to the serving eNB via a backhaul link and then the serving eNB can forward the semi static signaling via a unicast transmission.

The semi static signaling can include potential configurations of signal parameters used at the neighboring eNB. For example the semi static signaling can include a physical resource block PRB allocation granularity a subset of supported transmission modes an indication that PRB hopping is used at the neighboring eNB a maximum number of layers for downlink transmission a maximum modulation order an uplink downlink configuration of a frame a subset of power offsets values and or a subset of scrambling identities for a defined transmission mode. The UE can use the potential configurations of signal parameters in the semi static signaling to reduce the signal interference from the neighboring eNB. For example the UE can perform blind detection based on the potential configurations of signal parameters in order to reduce the signal interference.

In addition the neighboring eNB can send dynamic signaling directly to the UE that includes a subset of the potential configurations of signal parameters. The subset of the potential signal parameter configurations can be used in a given downlink subframe at the neighboring eNB. In one example the subset of the potential configurations of signal parameters is an actual configuration of signal parameters used at the neighboring eNB as opposed to a range of possible configurations as provided in the semi static signaling . The neighboring eNB can be triggered to send the dynamic signaling upon selecting at least one of the potential configurations of signal parameters or modifying signal parameters in an existing configuration. The dynamic signaling can also include the physical resource block PRB allocation granularity the subset of supported transmission modes the indication that PRB hopping is used at the neighboring eNB a maximum number of layers for downlink transmission the maximum modulation order an uplink downlink configuration of a frame a subset of power offsets values and or the subset of scrambling identities for a defined transmission mode. However the dynamic signaling can be more accurate and up to date as compared to the semi static signaling. The UE can use the subset of the potential configurations of signal parameters in the dynamic signaling to reduce the signal interference from the neighboring eNB.

The capacity of Third Generation Partnership Project 3GPP Long Term Evolution LTE Advanced LTE A networks can be improved by the deployment of heterogeneous networks to achieve cell splitting gains and multi user MU multiple input multiple output MIMO . In both scenarios co channel interference either from inter cell users or co scheduled intra cell users is expected to become the dominant limiting factor for achieving higher network capacity. Although MU MIMO transmissions can significantly increase the cell throughput or cell capacity compared to single user SU transmissions due to MU diversity users scheduled for MU MIMO can experience strong signal interference if the channel state information at the base station or evolved node B eNB is outdated or in small cells with a limited number of users available. In MU MIMO the throughput of the user equipments UEs can depend on the amount of interference from co scheduled users. The signal interference can be managed either at the eNB through efficient precoding or at the UE via interference cancellation. In order to mitigate the signal interference at the UE the UE can exploit information about the interfering data stream in the decoding process which can result in a performance gain through reduction of the signal interference.

In conventional 3GPP LTE Release 11 systems such interference can be mitigated using coordinated multi point CoMP techniques which helps to avoid interference at the transmitting base station i.e. network side . These coordinated transmissions between neighboring cells can reduce interference in the downlink. In addition performing interference mitigation at the UE side by accounting for spatial properties of the interference has also shown promising gains in spectral efficiency. Further enhancements for interference mitigation at the receiver side can be achieved by considering more advanced receiver algorithms which may utilize additional information about interference structure. For example UEs can be provided with side knowledge of the interference such as but not limited to the transmission modes resource allocation granularity interference presence and reference symbols. The UEs can also be referred to as interference cancellation receivers or suppression receivers. Thus further enhancements to intra cell and inter cell interference at the receiver side can be achieved by increasing the degree of knowledge about interfering transmissions to the UE with possible coordination from the network. Such interference cancellation receivers can be considered for performance improvement of different physical channels such as the physical downlink shared channel PDSCH the physical downlink control channel PDCCH the enhanced downlink control channel EPDCCH etc.

The UE can reduce interference and improve throughput performance by using linear processing techniques. More advanced receiver structures can use non linear techniques. Non linear structures can utilize additional information e.g. parameters on the interfering signals. In other words the UE can perform interference suppression if certain parameters about the interfering signal are known to the UE. These parameters describing the interfering signal can include a modulation order a precoding matrix indicator PMI number of layers transmission modes etc. As an example the UE can use the modulation order to know that the interfering signal is not an arbitrary signal but rather occurs at specific points. The UE can utilize such information to better suppress the interference from neighboring cells. In one configuration such parameters can be estimated at the UE receiver from the received signal. In other words the UE can detect the interfering signal e.g. from an eNB in an adjacent cell and then estimate these signal parameters from the interfering signal. However in some cases estimation of the signal parameters from the interfering signal can be unreliable and complex for practical implementations. In addition estimation of the signal parameters can result in additional power usage at the UE.

To reduce the complexity of the UE and improve the performance semi static signaling of the interfering signal parameters is being considered in 3GPP Technical Report TR 36.866. In other words the UE can utilize network assistance e.g. receipt of semi static signaling in order to acquire the signal parameters of the interfering signal rather than the UE estimating the signal parameters itself. One drawback of such approach is that semi static signaling implies the semi static restriction of the indicated parameters over a large number of frames. In other words the UE can perform interference suppression using the signal parameters in the semi static signaling but if the signal parameters change over time the UE may not become aware of the changes because the signaling is semi static or not as frequent. Therefore the UE can continue to perform interference suppression using outdated signal parameters. Such long term restriction can degrade the performance on the interference cell and therefore is not desirable.

The eNB that is causing interference for the UE via the interfering signal can be referred to as a neighboring eNB. The eNB that is causing the interference can also be referred to as an aggressor eNB or an interfering eNB. When the neighboring eNB reconfigures some of the signal parameters the UE may not receive the updated reconfiguration in a timely manner through semi static signaling. In traditional techniques the neighboring eNB can communicate the reconfiguration of the signal parameters to other eNBs. Each of the other eNBs upon receiving the reconfigured signal parameters from the neighboring eNB can process or incorporate the interfering eNB s reconfigured signal parameters. Thus each reconfiguration of signal parameters at the neighboring eNB results in a relatively large amount of signaling between the other eNBs. As a result the UE may not receive the updated configuration of the signal parameters in a timely manner and can continue to use outdated signal parameter configurations to perform interference reduction or suppression.

Therefore the current technology describes providing semi static signaling to the UE as well as dynamic signaling from the neighboring cell or neighboring eNB . The semi static signaling can indicate one or more possible interference configurations on the neighboring cell or the neighboring eNB . The dynamic signaling can indicate an actual interference configuration that has been realized in a given subframe of the neighboring eNB. The dynamic signaling can be directly communicated to the UE from the neighboring eNB. The UE can use both the semi static signaling and the dynamic signaling to reduce or suppress interference from the neighboring eNB in a neighboring cell. In other words the UE can use hybrid signaling i.e. both the semi static signaling and the dynamic signaling for reducing the interference. Alternatively the UE can use both the semi static signaling and the dynamic signaling to reduce or suppress interference from other UEs within the same cell. By providing the dynamic signaling to the UE in addition to the semi static signaling the previous long term restriction of the signal parameters for performing interference reduction can be eliminated. In addition the hybrid signaling can reduce complexity at the UE by relieving the UE of independently determining the signal parameters.

The UE can periodically receive the semi static signaling from the neighboring evolved node B eNB via the serving eNB . For example the neighboring eNB can communicate the semi static signaling to the serving eNB via a backhaul link and then the serving eNB can forward the semi static signaling to the UE . In one example the serving eNB can forward the semi static signaling to the UE via a unicast transmission. The semi static signaling can include possible configurations of signal parameters used at the neighboring eNB . In other words the possible configurations of signal parameters can describe or characterize interfering signals transmitted from the neighboring eNB . The UE can use the possible configurations of signal parameters in the semi static signaling to reduce or suppress interference from the neighboring eNB . For example the UE can perform blind decoding using the possible configurations of signal parameters in order to reduce interference from the neighboring eNB . If the UE learns of the possible configurations of signal parameters that are being implemented at the neighboring eNB then the UE can use this information to reduce the effect of the interfering signals on the UE .

In one example the semi static signaling can include possible configurations of a physical resource block PRB allocation granularity used at the neighboring eNB . The neighboring eNB can schedule UEs that are being served by the neighboring eNB using chunks of PRBs. The neighboring eNB can use different resource allocation granularities based on traffic conditions whether Voice over Internet Protocol VoIP is being used etc. As non limiting examples possible configurations of PRB allocation granularities can include one PRB or four PRBs and these possible configurations can be provided to the UE . The UE can use the PRB allocation granularities to reduce interference from the neighboring eNB .

The semi static signaling can include a subset of supported transmission modes at the neighboring eNB . For example the semi static signaling can indicate that both transmission mode TM and TM are supported at the neighboring eNB . In other words the semi static signaling can indicate that both TM and TM are supported at the neighboring eNB but may not indicate which specific TM is currently being used at the neighboring eNB . However the UE can use the subset of supported transmission modes to reduce interference from the neighboring eNB .

The semi static signaling can include an indication that PRB hopping is used at the neighboring eNB . In some examples the neighboring eNB does not use distributed PRBs but rather uses localized PRB allocations. The neighboring eNB can use PRB hopping in certain situations. If the neighboring eNB does use PRB hopping the neighboring eNB can indicate that PRB hopping is used in a given subframe. The UE can adjust certain processing algorithms for such resource allocations when PRB hopping is performed by the neighboring eNB which can allow the UE to reduce interference from the neighboring eNB .

The semi static signaling can include a maximum number of layers for downlink transmission. In other words the semi static signaling can provide the UE with an upper bound on the number of layers that have been used at the neighboring eNB . The maximum number of layers can refer to a number of spatial layers used for downlink transmissions when multiple antennas are utilized. In previous solutions the UE would blindly detect how many layers were used in the neighboring eNB . In the current technology the semi static signaling can provide the UE with the maximum number of layers or a possible range of the maximum number of layers such that the complexity of reducing the interference can be reduced due to less blind decoding estimation at the UE .

The semi static signaling can include a maximum modulation order used at the neighboring eNB . The modulation order can refer to a number of bits per resource element RE . For example the modulation order can range from 2 to 6. In one example the semi static signaling can include a possible range of the maximum modulation order e.g. 4 or 6 bits per RE such that the complexity of reducing the interference can be reduced due to less blind decoding estimation at the UE . In other words providing the UE with a range for the maximum modulation order can reduce blind detection complexity at the UE since the UE does not have to search through all possible modulations.

The semi static signaling can include a subset of the scrambling identities for transmission mode TM . If there are scrambling codes used for reference signals in TM these scrambling codes can be initialized. In other words the neighboring eNB can use a set of these scrambling codes. The indexes of the scrambling content used by the neighboring eNB can be included in the semi static signaling. The scrambling identities can be included in the semi static signaling to the UE in order to reduce the complexity of blind detection of the scrambling sequence used by the neighboring eNB

Therefore the semi static signaling can include potential configurations of signal parameters such as the PRB allocation granularity the subset of supported transmission modes the indication of whether PRB hopping is used at the neighboring eNB the maximum number of layers for downlink transmission the maximum modulation order an uplink downlink configuration of a frame a subset of power offsets values and or the subset of scrambling identities for the defined transmission mode. Although the UE can use the potential configurations of signal parameters in the semi static signaling to perform blind detection and reduce the signal interference from the neighboring eNB the amount of blind detection performed can be overly complex for the UE and consume a large amount of the UE s power. Since the semi static signaling can often only provide a range of possible values or signal parameter configurations the UE still has to consume a relatively large amount of computing power to go through the possible signal parameter configurations included in the semi static signaling. In addition the periodic nature of the semi static signaling can result in the potential configurations of signal parameters being outdated. In other words the neighboring eNB can modify one of its signal parameters but the UE may not learn of the modification for a relatively long period of time because updated semi static signaling is not frequently provided to the UE . As a result the UE may attempt to perform blind detection using outdated signal parameter configurations which can reduce a likelihood of the UE successfully reducing or suppressing the interference from the neighboring eNB .

In one configuration the neighboring eNB can send dynamic signaling to the UE that includes a subset of the potential configurations of signal parameters. The neighboring eNB can send the dynamic signaling in addition to the semi static signaling. The signal parameters included in the dynamic signaling can be currently used in a given downlink subframe or a set of downlink subframes at the neighboring eNB . In one example the subset of the potential configurations of signal parameters is an actual configuration of signal parameters used at the neighboring eNB as opposed to a range of possible configurations as provided in the semi static signaling . Alternatively the subset of the potential configurations of signal parameters can be a refined or reduced range of possible signal parameter configurations as compared to the potential configurations of signal parameters included in the semi static signaling. In other words the information included in the dynamic signaling can be a subset of the information previously included in the semi static signaling.

The neighboring eNB can be triggered to send the dynamic signaling upon selecting at least one of the potential configurations of signal parameters or modifying signal parameters in an existing configuration. In one example the neighboring eNB can broadcast the dynamic signaling. The UE can detect the broadcast and determine that one or more signal parameter configurations at the neighboring eNB have been modified. In an alternative configuration the neighboring eNB can send the dynamic signaling to the serving eNB via the backhaul link and the serving eNB can forward the dynamic signaling to the UE . However sending the dynamic signaling via the serving eNB can result in additional signaling when the neighboring eNB updates or modifies an existing configuration of signal parameters.

The UE can use the dynamic signaling broadcasted from the neighboring eNB as well as the semi static signaling to perform blind detection and reduce interference from the neighboring eNB . The dynamic signaling can be an actual configuration of signal parameters used at the neighboring eNB or a reduced range of possible configurations of signal parameters . Thus the UE can more efficiently perform blind detection as compared to using only the semi static signaling in order to reduce the interference from the neighboring eNB . In addition the dynamic signaling can be more accurate and up to date as compared to the semi static signaling. As a result the UE can more quickly become aware of modifications at the neighboring eNB and accordingly alter the UE s interference reduction or suppression techniques to account for the modified signal parameters used at the neighboring eNB .

The dynamic signaling can include the subset of the potential configurations of signal parameters such as an updated PRB allocation granularity an updated subset of supported transmission modes an updated indication of whether PRB hopping is used at the neighboring eNB an updated maximum number of layers for downlink transmission an updated maximum modulation order an updated uplink downlink configuration of a frame an updated subset of power offsets values and or an updated subset of scrambling identities for a defined transmission mode. The UE can use the subset of the potential configurations of signal parameters or the updated signal parameter configurations in the dynamic signaling to reduce the signal interference from the neighboring eNB . As previously described the subset can include a reduced set of possible signal parameter configuration or an actual signal parameter configuration used at the neighboring eNB .

In one example the UE can use both dynamic signaling and semi static signaling to reduce interference from the neighboring eNB . As a non limiting example the UE can use semi static signaling for the PRB allocation granularity PRB hopping and the maximum number of layers for downlink transmission and dynamic signaling for the transmission modes the maximum modulation order and scrambling identities in order to reduce the interference from the neighboring eNB .

In one example the neighboring eNB can initially send semi static signaling to the UE that indicates a PRB allocation granularity of four PRBs. However four PRBs may not be ideal for certain situations e.g. VoIP UEs that typically have narrow band allocations . Therefore the neighboring eNB can dynamically change the resource allocation to a smaller size such as one PRB in order to deliver VoIP traffic. The neighboring eNB can dynamically inform the UE of the updated PRB allocation granularity using dynamic signaling that is broadcasted to the UE . Thus the neighboring eNB can indicate that the resource allocation granularity has been changed from four PRBs to one PRB. The dynamic signaling can be a direct indication from the neighboring eNB on the actual resource allocation granularity that is currently being used on a given subframe or a set of subframes at the neighboring eNB .

In another example the neighboring eNB can initially send semi static signaling to the UE indicating that both TM and TM are supported at the neighboring eNB . In other words the neighboring eNB can indicate that either TM or TM can be used. At a later time the neighboring eNB can send dynamic signaling indicating that TM is currently being used in a given subframe. Thus the UE can use the updated transmission mode when performing interference suppression.

In yet another example the neighboring eNB can initially send semi static signaling to the UE indicating a defined range for a maximum number of layers for downlink transmissions used at the neighboring eNB . At a later time the neighboring eNB can send dynamic signaling indicating a reduced range as compared to the defined range previously included in the semi static signaling for the maximum number of layers for downlink transmissions. Since the neighboring eNB can dynamically change the maximum number of layers from one downlink subframe to another downlink subframe the dynamic signaling enables the UE to receive an updated indication of the maximum number of layers in a timely manner. Similarly the neighboring eNB can dynamically change the maximum modulation order and therefore the dynamic signaling enables the UE to receive an updated indication of the maximum modulation order in a timely manner.

In one example the UE can reduce interference based on a specific transmission mode used in a given PRB at the neighboring eNB . In previous solutions the UE would perform blind detection among all possible transmission modes e.g. TM . The UE would blindly detect for each PRB an actual transmission mode used by the neighboring eNB . In the present technology the complexity can be reduced at the UE when the neighboring eNB generates two possible subsets of the transmission modes. A first subset can be TM and the second subset can be TM . The neighboring eNB can send the first subset and the second subset to the UE in the semi static signaling. At a later time the neighboring eNB can indicate the subset of TM is being utilized via dynamic signaling that is provided to the UE which can reduce the search space and complexity for the UE . In an alternative example the dynamic signaling can indicate to the UE that TM or TM is being used at the neighboring eNB . The UE can use this information to determine how the signal is structured in the neighboring cell and the UE can accordingly suppress the interference using this information.

In one example the neighboring eNB can be configured with two PRB allocation granularities of one PRB pair and X adjacent PRB pairs wherein X is an integer greater than one. In one example X can be equal to a resource block group RBG . Depending on an actual scheduling decision performed at the neighboring eNB either a first allocation granularity or a second allocation granularity can be signaled to the UE . In another example two subsets of the transmission modes can be configured e.g. TM TM TM or TM . Depending on an actual scheduling decision performed at the neighboring eNB an actual set of the transmission modes from the two subsets can be provided to the UE . In another example PRB hopping can be enabled or disabled depending on a scheduling decision performed at the neighboring eNB . Actual information on the use of PRB hopping can be provided to the UE via dynamic signaling.

Based on the dynamic signaling received from the neighboring eNB the UE can understand which parameters among the semi static signaling are actually used in given downlink subframes at the neighboring eNB . As a result the UE can more effectively cancel the interference from the neighboring eNB . By knowing the actual signal parameters as well as possible signal parameters from the semi static signaling the UE can detect how the interfering signal is structured in the neighboring cell and accordingly suppress the interfering signal. In addition the UE can use less computational capacity to reduce the interference based on the dynamic signaling. Without the dynamic signaling the UE may have to perform blind detection among all possible values in the potential signal parameter configurations which can result in a large amount of computation. If the actual signal parameter values or a reduced subset of possible signal parameter values are provided to the UE in the dynamic signaling the UE can blindly detect a reduced number of values.

Another example provides functionality of a user equipment UE operable to reduce signal interference as shown in . The UE can include a communication module configured to receive semi static signaling from a neighboring evolved node eNB via a serving eNB . The semi static signaling can include potential configurations of signal parameters used at the neighboring eNB . The UE can be located within a cell that is served by the serving eNB . The communication module can be configured to receive at the UE dynamic signaling directly from the neighboring eNB that includes a subset of the potential configurations of signal parameters used in a given downlink subframe at the neighboring eNB . The UE can include an interference reduction module configured to reduce signal interference at the UE caused by the neighboring eNB using the semi static signaling that includes the potential configurations of signal parameters and the dynamic signaling that includes the subset of the potential configurations of signal parameters.

In one example the communication module can be further configured to receive the dynamic signaling from the neighboring eNB via a physical downlink control channel PDCCH or an enhanced PDCCH EPDCCH . The communication module can be further configured to receive the semi static signaling from the serving eNB via radio resource control RRC signaling. The communication module can be further configured to receive the semi static and dynamic signaling from the neighboring eNB according to a defined periodicity.

In one example the subset of the potential configurations of signal parameters is an actual configuration of signal parameters used at the neighboring eNB . In another example the UE is located adjacent to a cell edge within the cell that is served by the serving eNB and endures signal interference from the neighboring eNB . In yet another example the neighboring eNB is located within a neighboring cell in proximity to the serving eNB that is serving the UE.

In one example the communication module can be further configured to receive the semi static signaling via a unicast transmission from the serving eNB wherein the serving eNB receives the semi static signaling from the neighboring eNB via a backhaul link. In another example the potential configurations of signal parameters in the semi static signaling and the subset of the potential configurations of signal parameters in the dynamic signaling include at least one of a physical resource block PRB allocation granularity a subset of supported transmission modes an indication that PRB hopping is used at the neighboring eNB a maximum number of layers for downlink transmissions a maximum modulation order an uplink downlink configuration of a frame a subset of power offsets values or a subset of scrambling identities for UE specific reference signals for a defined transmission mode.

In one example the interference reduction module can be further configured to perform blind detection in order to reduce the signal interference caused by the neighboring eNB . The UE can perform the blind detection using at least one of the potential configurations of signal parameters in the semi static signaling or the subset of the potential configurations of signal parameters in the dynamic signaling. In another example the communication module can be further configured to receive the dynamic signaling from the neighboring eNB in response to the neighboring eNB selecting at least one of the potential configurations of signal parameters or modifying signal parameters in an existing configuration. In yet another example the communication module can be further configured to receive the dynamic signaling from the neighboring eNB via a broadcast transmission.

Another example provides functionality of a neighboring evolved node B eNB operable to operable to facilitate reduction of signal interference as shown in the flow chart in . The functionality can be implemented as a method or the functionality can be executed as instructions on a machine where the instructions are included on at least one computer readable medium or one non transitory machine readable storage medium. The neighboring eNB can include one or more processors configured to send semi static signaling to a user equipment UE via a serving eNB the semi static signaling including potential configurations of signal parameters used at the neighboring eNB the UE being located within a cell that is served by the serving eNB as in block . The neighboring eNB can include one or more processors configured to send dynamic signaling to the UE that includes a subset of the potential configurations of signal parameters used in a given downlink subframe at the neighboring eNB as in block . In one example the semi static signaling that includes the potential configurations of signal parameters and the dynamic signaling that includes the subset of the potential configurations of signal parameters enables the UE to reduce signal interference at the UE that is caused by the neighboring eNB.

In one example the neighboring eNB can include one or more processors further configured to send the semi static signaling to the UE according to a defined periodicity. In another example the neighboring eNB can include one or more processors further configured to send the dynamic signaling to the UE in response to selecting at least one of the potential configurations of signal parameters or modifying signal parameters in an existing configuration. In yet another example the UE that is enduring the signal interference from the neighboring eNB is located adjacent to a cell edge within the cell that is being served by the serving eNB. In addition the neighboring eNB is located within a neighboring cell in proximity to the serving eNB that is serving the UE.

In one example the neighboring eNB can include one or more processors further configured to send the semi static signaling to the serving eNB over a backhaul link wherein the serving eNB forwards the semi static signaling to the UE via a unicast transmission to the UE. In another example the potential configurations of signal parameters in the semi static signaling and the subset of the potential configurations of signal parameters in the dynamic signaling include at least one of a physical resource block PRB allocation granularity a subset of supported transmission modes an indication that PRB hopping is used at the neighboring eNB a maximum number of layers for downlink transmissions a maximum modulation order a uplink downlink configuration of the frame a subset of power offsets values or a subset of scrambling identities for UE specific reference signals for a defined transmission mode. In yet another example the neighboring eNB can include one or more processors further configured to send the dynamic signaling to the UE via a broadcast transmission.

The method can include the operation of reducing signal interference at the UE that is caused by the neighboring eNB using the semi static signaling and the dynamic signaling as in block .

In one example the method can further include the operation of performing blind detection using the semi static signaling and the dynamic signaling in order to reduce the signal interference caused by the neighboring eNB. In another example the subset of the potential configurations of signal parameters is an actual configuration of signal parameters used at the neighboring eNB. In yet another example the method can include the operation of receiving the semi static signaling from the neighboring eNB via a unicast transmission from the serving eNB wherein the serving eNB receives the semi static signaling from the neighboring eNB via a backhaul link. In addition the method can include the operations of receiving the semi static signaling from the neighboring eNB according to a defined periodicity and receiving the dynamic signaling from the neighboring eNB in response to the neighboring eNB selecting at least one of the potential configurations of signal parameters or modifying signal parameters in an existing configuration.

However the program s can be implemented in assembly or machine language if desired. In any case the language can be a compiled or interpreted language and combined with hardware implementations.

It should be understood that many of the functional units described in this specification have been labeled as modules in order to more particularly emphasize their implementation independence. For example a module can be implemented as a hardware circuit comprising custom VLSI circuits or gate arrays off the shelf semiconductors such as logic chips transistors or other discrete components. A module can also be implemented in programmable hardware devices such as field programmable gate arrays programmable array logic programmable logic devices or the like.

In one example multiple hardware circuits can be used to implement the functional units described in this specification. For example a first hardware circuit can be used to perform processing operations and a second hardware circuit e.g. a transceiver can be used to communicate with other entities. The first hardware circuit and the second hardware circuit can be integrated into a single hardware circuit or alternatively the first hardware circuit and the second hardware circuit can be separate hardware circuits.

Modules can also be implemented in software for execution by various types of processors. An identified module of executable code can for instance comprise one or more physical or logical blocks of computer instructions which can for instance be organized as an object procedure or function. Nevertheless the executables of an identified module need not be physically located together but can comprise disparate instructions stored in different locations which when joined logically together comprise the module and achieve the stated purpose for the module.

Indeed a module of executable code can be a single instruction or many instructions and can even be distributed over several different code segments among different programs and across several memory devices. Similarly operational data can be identified and illustrated herein within modules and can be embodied in any suitable form and organized within any suitable type of data structure. The operational data can be collected as a single data set or can be distributed over different locations including over different storage devices and can exist at least partially merely as electronic signals on a system or network. The modules can be passive or active including agents operable to perform desired functions.

Reference throughout this specification to an example means that a particular feature structure or characteristic described in connection with the example is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus appearances of the phrases in an example in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.

As used herein a plurality of items structural elements compositional elements and or materials can be presented in a common list for convenience. However these lists should be construed as though each member of the list is individually identified as a separate and unique member. Thus no individual member of such list should be construed as a de facto equivalent of any other member of the same list solely based on their presentation in a common group without indications to the contrary. In addition various embodiments and example of the present invention can be referred to herein along with alternatives for the various components thereof. It is understood that such embodiments examples and alternatives are not to be construed as defacto equivalents of one another but are to be considered as separate and autonomous representations of the present invention.

Furthermore the described features structures or characteristics can be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments. In the following description numerous specific details are provided such as examples of layouts distances network examples etc. to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize however that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details or with other methods components layouts etc. In other instances well known structures materials or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention.

While the forgoing examples are illustrative of the principles of the present invention in one or more particular applications it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that numerous modifications in form usage and details of implementation can be made without the exercise of inventive faculty and without departing from the principles and concepts of the invention. Accordingly it is not intended that the invention be limited except as by the claims set forth below.
