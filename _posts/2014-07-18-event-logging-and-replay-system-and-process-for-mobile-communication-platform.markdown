The infrastructure required to supply a high quality of continuous two way data communication to a mobile communication platform is expensive and complex. A variety of data bearers come into play at various points along a voyage. The various bearers have different capacities costs per bit QoS profiles and geographic zones of coverage. Many variables are subject to optimization to approach any given performance or cost metrics. In the normal course of operation of an MCP data may be collected at many points along the technical chain on actual performance as a function of time space user load environmental conditions and other inputs for later analysis and construction of statistical models.

Exemplarily queries would include all voyages passing through a region such a the vicinity of a port all voyages on a common path between two points all data from one voyage data from part of one voyage any of the previous queries limited to a single vessel or type of vessel or configuration of vessel any of the previous queries limited to inbound or outbound journeys.

 API in this context refers to Application Programming Interface a set of defined entry points e.g. functions and controls e.g. parameters to those entry points and output behavior e.g. return values to logic that can be invoked to access specific functionality of the logic. For example a phone might have a specific API that allows downloaded games to access a 3D graphics chip. Other APIs in the same phone might allow the game to control the vibrate motor or send and receive text messages.

 App in this context refers to Application a distinct set of logic that provides specific functionality for phones. Phones may come with some apps built in and may allow others to be downloaded and installed by the user. Examples of apps include to do list game drawing tool calculator email web browser game photo editor and a weather forecast tool.

 Application in this context refers to logic that can be independently installed accessed and removed from a device and which executes at lower permission levels and within confines as to functionality and device resource utilization as determined by operating system software. Often referred to as regular application logic as opposed to driver applet or system logic also logic that causes a computer to perform tasks beyond the basic operation of the computer itself. The term application may be abbreviated in some contexts to simply app . An application may be logic built upon or integrated with operating system logic. Examples of application logic include enterprise software accounting software office suites graphics software games web browsers and media players. Applications may be bundled with the computer and its system software or published separately. Application logic applies the capabilities of a particular computing platform or system software to a particular purpose. Some applications are available in versions for several different platforms others have narrower requirements and are thus called for example a Geography application for Windows or an Android application for education or Linux gaming.

 Backhaul in this context refers to In wireless networks the connection from an individual base station tower to the central network backbone . Typical backhaul connections are wired high speed data connections T1 line etc. but they can be wireless as well using point to point microwave or WiMax etc. The intermediate links between a network and devices on the edge of the network i.e. leaf nodes of the network . Backhaul may refer to the portions of a local or intermediate network e.g. Internet Service Provider that communicate with the global Internet.

 Bandwidth in this context refers to a measure of the signal throughput capacity of a channel or connection or the amount of said capacity required for communication of particular signals. Bandwidth refers to a number of signals often bits that can be communicated over a channel in a given amount of time with acceptable noise distortion. Bandwidth is typically measured in hertz Hz cycles per second or bits or bytes per second.

 Database in this context refers to an organized collection of data states of matter representing values symbols or control signals to device logic structured typically into tables that comprise rows and columns although this structure is not implemented in every case. One column of a table is often designated a key for purposes of creating indexes to rapidly search the database.

 GPS in this context refers to Global Positioning System logic to interact with multiple geosynchronous satellites to determine a terrestrial location. Global Positioning System a space based satellite navigation system that provides location and time information in most weather conditions anywhere on or near the Earth where there is an unobstructed line of sight to four or more GPS satellites. The system provides critical capabilities to military civil and commercial users around the world. It is maintained by the United States government and is freely accessible to anyone with a GPS receiver. The global positioning system is a location determination network that uses satellites to act as reference points for the calculation of position information.

 MCP in this context refers to Mobile Communications Platform a vessel or vehicle capable of motion and including communication capabilities to one or more of satellite and fixed not moving antennas in the environment.

 Modem in this context refers to modulator demodulator a device that modulates a carrier signal to encode digital information and also demodulates such a carrier signal to decode the transmitted information.

 NMS in this context refers to Network Management System a machine or system of machines to manage bandwidth quality of service flow and other features of a data network.

 RFID in this context refers to Radio Frequency Identification Tag a device that receives a radio signal and responds with a code that provides an identification of the tag. An RFID tag may be self powered e.g. battery or it may be a simple mixer circuit that does not require external power.

 Router in this context refers to logic that distributes digital information that is contained within a data packet. Each data packet contains address information that a router can use to determine if the source and destination are on the same network or if the data packet must be transferred from one network to another. This transfer to another type of network is achieved by encapsulating the data with network specific protocol header information. When multiple routers are used in a large collection of interconnected networks the routers exchange information about target system addresses so that each router can build up a table showing the preferred paths between any two systems on the interconnected networks.

 UI in this context refers to User Interface the physically sensitive areas of a device that the user interacts with directly. Broadly this can include hardware such as the display buttons other controls and mechanical features. More commonly the UI refers to the software controlled visual elements displayed on the screen that allow the user to interact with the device. This includes menus icons text entry boxes etc. Although the term can also be used for hardware input such as microphones contact switches or keys it is used most frequently to refer to the software controlled elements displayed on a machine optical output device e.g. display that are used to interact with the device. That includes icons buttons menus text boxes etc.

Sensors and APIs stream data continuously to a data aggregator. For numerical data the data aggregator maintains a temporal moving average of each input over a set window. Unstructured inputs are accumulated in circular buffers. At a set periodic interval a database sends a clock tick to the data aggregator and receives in return a record containing a snapshot of the state of the data accumulated. Data that is recorded aggregated may include geolocation heading course speed and bandwith connectivity backhaul conditions for the MCP data network and usage information about application logic utilized by passengers aboard the MCP at the various conditions.

An embodiment of the system includes a mobile communication platform MCP with logic to record network performance data along a first route taken by the MCP. The system includes logic to track one or more of MCP location heading or speed as MCP circumstances and to apply the network performance data to predict application usage by passengers aboard the MCP along a second route taken by the MCP. The MCP circumstances may include a time of day day of the week calendar date or weather conditions. The system may adjust a course speed or location of the MCP based on the predicted application usage.
