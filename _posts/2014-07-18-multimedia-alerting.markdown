This application is a continuation in part application that claims priority to pending U.S. Utility patent application Ser. No. 13 082 236 filed Apr. 7 2011 which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 322 640 filed Apr. 9 2010 which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.

NOAA Weather Radio is a service of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA of the U.S. Department of Commerce. As the Voice of the National Weather Service it provides continuous broadcasts of the latest weather information from local National Weather Service offices. Weather messages are repeated every 4 to 6 minutes and are routinely updated every 1 to 3 hours or more frequently in rapidly changing local weather or if a nearby hazardous environmental condition exists. The service operates 24 hours daily. The regular broadcasts are specifically tailored to weather information needs of the people within the service area of the transmitter. For example in addition to general weather information stations in coastal areas provide information of interest to mariners. Other specialized information such as current conditions and forecasts may be broadcast.

During severe weather National Weather Service forecasters can interrupt the routine weather broadcasts and insert special warning messages concerning imminent threats to life and property. The forecaster can also add special signals to warnings that trigger alerting features of specially equipped receivers. This is known as the tone alert feature and acts much like a smoke detector in that it will alarm when necessary to warn of an impending hazard. Currently all receivers equipped with the tone alert feature within the listening area will alarm when a warning is issued. However in the future only receivers located in the warned area normally a specific county or counties will alarm. This feature is referred to as Specific Area Message Encoding SAME and will be the primary activator for the new Emergency Alert System currently being implemented by the Federal Communication Commission.

Under a January 1975 White House policy statement NOAA Weather Radio was designated the sole government operated radio system to provide direct warnings into private homes for both natural disasters and nuclear attack. This concept is being expanded to include warnings for all hazardous conditions that pose a threat to life and safety both at a local and national level. NOAA Weather Radio currently broadcasts from over 400 FM transmitters on seven frequencies in the VHF band ranging from 162.400 to 162.550 megahertz MHz in fifty states Puerto Rico the Virgin Islands Guam and Saipan. These frequencies are outside the normal AM or FM broadcast bands.

Special radios that receive only NOAA Weather Radio both with and without the tone alert feature are available from several manufacturers. The radios can usually be found at most department and electronics stores. In addition other manufacturers are including NOAA Weather Radio as a special feature on an increasing number of receivers. NOAA Weather Radio capability is currently available on some automobile aircraft marine citizens band and standard AM FM radios as well as communications receivers transceivers scanners and cable TV.

By nature and by design NOAA Weather Radio coverage is typically limited to an area within 40 miles using 500 watt transmitters of the transmitter. The quality of what is heard is dictated by the distance from the transmitter local terrain and the quality and location of the receiver. In general those on flat terrain or at sea using a high quality receiver can expect reliable reception far beyond 40 miles. Those living in cities surrounded by large buildings and those in mountain valleys with standard receivers may experience little or no reception at considerably less than 40 miles. If possible a receiver should be tested in the location where it will be used prior to purchase.

NOAA Weather Radio is directly available to approximately 70 to 80 percent of the U.S. population. The National Weather Service is currently engaged in a program to increase coverage to 95 percent of the population.

Using an existing NOAA issued weather radio the user of this service is required to tune the weather radio to a given frequency based on their location before the radio will work. Once working the weather radio will notify the users covering an area of approximately 40 miles radius from the transmitter see the NOAA Weather Radio coverage maps at http www.weather.gov nwr Maps . Currently the NOAA Weather Radio Network includes 1000 transmitters covering all 50 states adjacent coastal waters Puerto Rico the U.S. Virgin Islands and the U.S. Pacific Territories.

While this invention is susceptible of embodiment in many different forms there is shown in the drawings and will herein be described in detail specific embodiments with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered as an example of the principles of the invention and not intended to limit the invention to the specific embodiments shown and described. In the description below like reference numerals are used to describe the same similar or corresponding parts in the several views of the drawings.

In other instances well known methods procedures and components have not been described in detail to avoid obscuring the embodiments described. The description is not to be considered as limited to the scope of the embodiments described herein.

Due to the large percentage of mobile device users especially with the significant increase in the use of Smart phones mobile devices provide an excellent vehicle for delivering severe warning messages of impending severe weather or other hazards to the public. In addition to this most new mobile phones possess the capability to determine their device location within less than 1 km accuracy. This is enough resolution to make use of the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA severe warning system and other weather and hazard warning systems to determine if the location of the device is in such a hazard. In addition to mapping severe weather alerts this System can map the DMA Direct Marketing Area of the device to local television and or radio broadcasters that might have even more information for the user about the severity of the conditions and how the conditions might affect them.

Given those facts the Multimedia Alerting method system apparatus and device as described in embodiments herein provide the ability to convert mobile devices into a video audio and or textual severe weather early warning devices and to allow local television and or radio broadcasts to be directed to a user of a mobile device in times of impending danger.

Multimedia alerting is designed to support high end mobile phones smart phones and other portable computing devices that can obtain its location has access to an Internet data source and has the capability to at least render digital audio and possibly also video alert information to the user of the device.

It is noted that while the use of portable mobile devices such as cellular telephones mobile phones smart phones and the like are discussed the embodiments described herein are not limited to usage with mobile devices. Any location enabled device for which location can be determined including stationary devices and or vehicles and assets or objects of interest are compatible with the embodiments described herein. These devices will have at least an audio capability of delivering and providing messages via a user interface having audio capabilities regarding weather conditions and non weather conditions relevant to one or more locations of interest which may or may not be the location of the device itself as will be described. These devices may also have a video visual capability of delivering and providing messages via a user interface having audio and or visual capabilities regarding weather conditions and non weather conditions relevant to one or more locations of interest.

Therefore in accordance with various embodiments disclosed herein a method of providing alert information to a user of a device comprises in response to an alert notification of an alert determining one or more alert geographical tiles of interest that are affected by the alert of a plurality of geographical tiles wherein each geographical tile of the plurality of geographical tiles represents a unique geographic projection of a rendered geographical area of defined size determining one or more location enabled devices each having a location that falls within an alert geographical tile of the one or more alert geographical tiles retrieving a portion of the alert from an alert database and processing the portion of the alert to generate a media version of the alert constructing an alert text notification of the alert having the text portion of the alert an alert identifier of the alert a reference identifier for the media version of the alert the one or more alert geographical tiles and the one or more one or more device identifiers for each of the one or more devices and retrieving the one or more device identifiers for each of the one or more devices the alert text notification and the alert identifier of the alert and transmitting the alert text notification to the one or more devices corresponding to the retrieved one or more device identifiers. A device of the one or more devices may receive and process the alert text notification and request to receive alert data of the alert. Received alert data of the alert may be presented to a user of the device through a user interface of the device.

Moreover in accordance with various embodiments disclosed herein a method of providing alert information to a user of a device comprises an alert service provider transmitting an alert notification of an alert to an alert processing server storing the alert notification in an alert database coupled to the alert processing server an alert notification server retrieving the alert notification from the alert database and determining one or more alert geographical tiles of interest that are affected by the alert of a plurality of geographical tiles wherein each geographical tile of the plurality of geographical tiles represents a unique geographic projection of a rendered geographical area of defined size the alert notification server determining one or more location enabled devices each having a location that falls within an alert geographical tile of the one or more alert geographical tiles retrieving a text portion of the alert from the alert database and processing the text portion of the alert to generate an audio version of the alert constructing an alert text notification of the alert having the text portion of the alert an alert identifier of the alert a reference identifier for the audio version of the alert the one or more alert geographical tiles and the one or more one or more device identifiers for each of the one or more devices and storing the alert text notification into an alert notification queue and a gateway server retrieving the one or more device identifiers for each of the one or more devices the alert text notification and the alert identifier of the alert from the alert notification queue and transmitting the alert text notification to the one or more devices corresponding to the retrieved one or more device identifiers. A device of the one or more devices may receive and process the alert text notification and request to receive alert data of the alert. Received alert data of the alert may be presented to a user of the device through a user interface of the device.

The types of alert notifications that are supported by the various embodiments described herein include but are not limited to Weather Alerts Lightning Alerts Lightning Prediction Alerts Traffic Alerts and Emergency Alert Service EAS Service Network just to name a few possibilities.

A Weather Alert Service Provider may receive weather alerts and notifications from The National Weather Service of the United States or other sources such as a Lightning detection system weather forecast system disaster emergency alert services or other sources. These alerts are delivered in encoded text from the Alert Service Provider or System. The encoded text includes information relating to the severity of the alert the type of phenomena or event that the alert represents text describing the alert the watch warning boxes of the alert a beginning time estimated time of arrival ETA an ending time estimated time of departure ETD and the current area effected by the phenomena.

Audio alerts are designed to mimic the voice audio supplied by a National Weather Service Weather Radio when a device user needs to be notified of severe weather traffic current weather conditions weather forecasts special public notices or emergency conditions.

There are at least two 2 types of audio available for alerts. One is statically generated audio that is baked into the mobile applications and the other is a Text to Speech converted MP3 audio file that reads the header of the alert and or reads the full alert text to the user. Audio Alerts do not necessarily need to be limited to weather alerts. They could include traffic alerts public alert notifications disaster warnings and many more public notifications.

The audio alerts are generated by a Text to Speech engine such as a third party Text to Speech engine and provided to a user of a device by an alert software program or software application also referred to as an Alert Application a Backend Application or simply an App running on the Device. A Text to Speech engine supplies the Text to Speech conversion service through an Application Programming Interface API with which an application running on the Device may interface. This interface will allow the Alert Message or Service Provider to modify voice speed and inflection of the voice to be rendered by the application with supplied text. Each voice is also language dependant.

Also please note when converting from Text to Speech the text must be first processed to replace any abbreviated text with full word versions of the abbreviation. For instance Feb should be converted to February CDT should be converted to Central Daylight Time as examples. These abbreviations that are commonly contained in alert text and include but are not limited to time zones countries hours minutes and days of the week months and states. Other phonetic modification may need to be made depending on the quality of the voice. Thus a word prone to mispronunciation can be modified to match phonetically to the intended speech. For example the spelling of the word wind may be modified to match phonetically to the intended speech so that wind is converted to wend .

The Audio Alerts cache lifespan should match the life expectancy of the alert as defined in the data supplied by the alert source. A background task should be set to purge the audio files cached at configurable time that balances between server load and space available. The initial recommendation is to set the background task to run every hour for example.

The EAS alerts are delivered to the Weather Alert Service Provider as aggregated information by the National Weather Service contained within their alert bulletins. This information is parsed in the same manner as the Weather Alerts received from the National Weather Service. A Weather Alert Service Provider may combine data from multiple sources such as the United States Geological Survey for Earthquake and Volcanic alerts the United States Department of Justice for child abduction alerts and the United States Department of Homeland Security for public security alerts.

In addition to this the alerting system of a Weather Alert Service Provider may include alerts on a global basis.

A user traveling along a highway could also be notified by both audible and or visual alerts to changes in traffic conditions along a route such as road work ahead traffic slowing ahead and other tests. This would also be defined by using tile and magnetic heading of the device.

This alert system is based on identifying alert affected areas in Tiles where each tile is defined as a geographic area identified by a Tile Code .

The Multimedia Alerting System is designed to provide an enhanced alerting feature set and expand the scope of alerts beyond traditional text based severe weather text alerting products. One of the primary features of this alerting system is to reduce the number of false alarms received by the end user. In order to accomplish this the geographic grouping that matches alerts with the recipients of an alert is not based on traditional city state or county boundaries in which actual latitude Longitude polygons are provided for the affected area for a given alert. Due to the high volume of traffic that this alert system will process this system cannot handle the computational complexity of attempting to determine if a recipients location falls within a polygon using traditional means.

Based on these requirements a tile coding system was developed to allow a backend alert software application to use a simple database query to determine what recipients should receive alerts based on a static non changing location such as a hospital or school or dynamic changeable location such as a tracked mobile device location of interest. A recipient who should receive an alert may be a user of a device having location represented by a tile code of interest or the recipient may be a person interested in a tile code of interest even if their physical device is not itself located in the tile code of interest. These tile codes are used between the server and client device to represent a unique geographic projection of a rendered geographical area of defined size. The unique geographic projection may be a Mercator or other geographical projection rendered box or Tile approximately 2 sq km in size for example.

To accomplish this a tile coding system was developed to allow communications between the server and client device while maintaining an approximate 2 km approximately 1.2 mile accuracy which we finally chose a representation of a Mercator box or Tile based on 1 arc minute of latitude and longitude within a text string. This allows the entire planet to be divided into an even number of sections or Tiles that can be quickly searched by a database while maintaining a reasonable resolution to be useful for weather alerting.

In order to understand the concept of the tile code and its resolution one must first understand the length of a degree and arc minute on the planet. An arc minute upon which the tile code is based represents a square box or Tile on a Mercator projection of the curved planet. In reality a one 1 arc minute by one 1 arc minute box is not a square but a four sided polygon in which all of the sides are slightly curved. But for the purposes of this document the arc minute or Tile will be represented in its Mercator square form.

The length of an arc degree of north south latitude difference is about 60 nautical miles 111 kilometers or 69 statute miles at any latitude more exactly a degree of latitude at the pole covers about 1 percent more distance than a degree at the equator. The length of an arc degree of east west longitude difference roughly cos is about the same at the Equator as the north south reducing to zero at the poles.

In the case of a spheroid a meridian and its anti meridian form an ellipse from which an expression for the length of an arc degree of latitude is 

Along the Equator east to west N equals the equatorial radius. The radius of curvature at a right angle to the Equator north to south M is 43 km shorter hence the length of an arc degree of latitude at the Equator is about 0.7 km less than the length of an arc degree of longitude at the Equator. N and M are equal at the poles where they are about 64 km greater than the north south equatorial radius of curvature because the polar radius is 21 km less than the equatorial radius. The shorter polar radii indicate that the northern and southern hemispheres are flatter making their radii of curvature longer. This flattening also pinches the north south equatorial radius of curvature making it 43 km less than the equatorial radius. Both radii of curvature are perpendicular to the plane tangent to the surface of the ellipsoid at all latitudes directed toward a point on the polar axis in the opposite hemisphere except at the Equator where both point toward Earth s center . The east west radius of curvature reaches the axis whereas the north south radius of curvature is shorter at all latitudes except the poles.

The WGS84 ellipsoid used by all GPS devices uses an equatorial radius of 6378137.0 m and an inverse flattening 1 f of 298.257223563 hence its polar radius is 6356752.3142 m and its first eccentricity squared is 0.00669437999014. The more recent but little used IERS 2003 ellipsoid provides equatorial and polar radii of 6378136.6 and 6356751.9 m respectively and an inverse flattening of 298.25642. Lengths of degrees on the WGS84 and IERS 2003 ellipsoids are the same when rounded to six significant digits. An appropriate calculator for any latitude is provided by the U.S. government s National Geospatial Intelligence Agency NGA .

This gives the same distance as the formula above which aside from rounding is the exact distance along a parallel of latitude getting the distance along the shortest route will be more work but those two distances are always within 0.6 meter of each other if the two points are one degree of longitude apart.

Since the resolution of 1 arc minute 1 arc minute is being used to represent a tile approximately 1.8 km 1.8 km at the equator the tile unit of the X Y Cartesian coordinate system will start from latitude 0 degrees and longitude 0 degrees. The range of the contiguous United States CONUS domain ranges from 130 to 60 W longitude and 25 to 50 N latitude. This yields 4200 1500 possible tiles to cover the United States and 21 600 21 600 tiles to cover the entire planet. Furthermore many of these tiles approximately 70 percent would almost never be used since terrain such as desert tundra and water covered areas are not inhabited.

Since the National Weather Service issues alerts based on VTEC bound boxes Zone codes or County codes the Alert Service will need to convert the geographic areas into a collection of Tiles used to approximately represent the alert locations.

In the cases of UGC Zone and county codes these are done by preprocessing a vector based shape file which can be found at http www.nws.noaa.gov geodata catalog wsom html pubzone.htm that represents the National Weather Service UGC Universal Geographic Code locations for all known locations and generating tiles and storing them into a database that cross references the UGC code to a collection of tiles. This way alert requests received to the server will take the alert UGC code and perform a database query that matches the UGC codes and retrieves Tile codes. These tile codes are then in turn used to perform queries on the Target device and location database which is indexed by Tile Codes to retrieve target alerting devices to receive notifications in turn alerting the user of those devices. This will maintain accuracy within 2 miles of the target location while maintaining high speed response time to a larger volume of devices.

The illustration of shows two 2 UGC areas VAZ501 and VAZ502 with an example of a tile grid overlay over the image. The map area designates the VAZ501 area and the map area designates the VAZ502 area. Each of the tiles overlaying at least a portion of a map area would be associated with the corresponding UGC areas. Thus it can be seen that the tiles of the collection of Tiles overlay or border at least a portion of the VAZ501 area while the tiles of the collection of Tiles overlay or border at least a portion of the VAZ502 area. As show below also there are several tiles on the border of these areas that belong to both UGC areas.

In the case of VTEC bounding boxes a VTEC polygon is approximately converted into a collection or set of tiles using the maximum and minimum latitude and longitude construct a collection of Tile Codes associated with the VTEC alert. Once this is done the Tiles are further reduced to closely match the polygon before the query to the database is made. The result of the database query yields a collection of tiles that can yield alerting device described in the previous paragraph.

Certain embodiments described herein use a device such as a mobile device with Location Based Services a Device Location Database a Notification Server Services that pushes notification to a device such as by way of example and not limitations SMS and or Push notification services like the Apple Push Notification Service Alert Servers and Text to Speech Server. Below is a flow of events that further describe the methodology system apparatus and device functionality.

An exemplary high level system flow diagram is shown in system of . System Flow diagram of illustrates the flow that an alert notification also referred to as a message text message notification or a notification message follows through the system of . Note that the encircled numerals 1 2 3 4 5a 5b 5c and 5d in correspond to the flow numerals below 

Device using the Apple Push Notification Service APNS the message could have in the Alert Database a defined alternate method available such as Simple Messaging Service SMS . In the example case the COMM Gateway Servers would attempt to read the database using the device ID and determine if an alternate method of delivery is defined in this case SMS and place the message into the appropriate queue to be sent to the Device .

As used herein the terms service and server may be used interchangeably. For example an Alert Processing Service may make use of an Alert Processing Server and the Alert Processing Server itself may provide the Alert Processing Service. A similar observation may be made about Alert Notification Server and Alert Notification Service.

A system block diagram is shown in . With reference to the system flow of and the System Block Diagram of the following functional descriptions are consistent with certain embodiments described herein. Note that the encircled numerals 1 12 in correspond to the flow numerals below 

Referring now to an exemplary device flow diagram is shown in accordance with various embodiments. Alert delivery take places in two 2 phases the registration phase and the alert notification phase. This section describes the registration and delivery of alert notifications to the device. There are two 2 different methods of each phase of delivering the alert to the device. These methods are separated by the device platforms that are being targeted which may include public and third party proprietary communication protocols and systems. For example Apple Inc. s iPhone Apple Push Notification Service APNS Short Messaging Service SMS Real Simple Syndication RSS having text plus metadata and Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol XMPP communication protocols are just a few possible services contemplated. This does not preclude the addition of other text based alert delivery mechanisms from being used in the future. Thus any text message based service or system that can be sent to a mobile device as well as any event driven message service that can be used to deliver a text string to the mobile device is contemplated.

Referring now to Block an Alert Message Event such receipt by the device of an alert text notification message occurs and at Block the device initiates a request to determine the device location. This may be provided from a GPS or LBS service for example as shown at Block . At Block the inquiry for the device is whether there is an alert or warning received for this location. Concurrently weather information is retrieved by the device at Block with input of the determined device location retrieve information may include current weather conditions forecast information and alert information of the location. The current device location is converted to a tile and corresponding device tile code as previously discussed. At Decision Block the inquiry is whether the event is an alert event in other words is the event one that rises to the level so that an alert or warning or other information is associated with it. If yes then at Block the alert information received by the phone is parsed and stored in an Alert database . This Alert database may or may not be stored on the Device itself. If the inquiry at Decision Block yielded a negative response then at Block the device queries the alerts in the Alert Database for the current device location that have not yet been displayed by the Device such as to a user of the device via a screen shot or other user interface of the device. As previously noted a server query of a system server may be undertaken to obtained detailed alert data including Media Feeds via URLS. The database query of the Alert Dababase will identify one or more alerts stored in the alert database that have one or more alert geographical tile codes that match the device tile code representative of the current location of the device that have not been presented to a user of the device through a user interface of the device. Thus a search of all of the alert tile codes stored in the Alert Database for the device tile code will identify the alerts of interest to the device at its current location. The inquiry at Decision Block is whether the query identifies any alert in the Alert Database that fits the query made at Block . If yes then at Block the user of the device is notified of the new Alert by prompting the user to view the newly identified Alert. If the user chooses to view the alert at Decision Block then the alert is displayed for viewing on the device and the user is prompted with an option to listen to audio describing the alert to view on a map a radar view of the alert and or to watch a local video audio broadcast concerning the alert.

Referring back to Decision Block if no alert in the Alert Database is found that fits the query at Block then there is the option at Decision Block of waking the device to listen to current location conditions while playing to the user an audio describing the current conditions associated with the current location of the phone at Block .

The goal of the registration phase discussed above is to notify the alert network that a device is available to be tracked and or to receive alert messages. In this process the device location and identification are collected and stored in the Device Location Database . Once the device location is collected the system will then assign the device to a geographical region representing the location of the device called a Tile described above to create a virtual world grid having a sequence of 13 characters in length where each square on the grid would represent approximately 2 miles square. As a result this would make it easier for computing systems to maintain reasonable accuracy for the data while maintaining an efficient easily searchable cache for alert data of interest such as weather data.

Referring now to flow diagram an exemplary registration process in which tile code information is used is illustrated in accordance with various embodiments. Note that the encircled numerals 1 3 in correspond to the flow numerals below 

The goal of the registration authentication is to protect the privacy of device user s from someone requesting information about alerts at their device locations thereby making it possible for unwanted information about the users location to be accidentally revealed.

An exemplary Alert Authorization Process is illustrated in the flow diagram of in which an exemplary device is a mobile phone. Note that the encircled numerals 1 5 in correspond to the flow numerals below 

The Alert Notification phase is the process that enables a device such as a mobile phone to actually receive an emergency alert from the Alert Service Provider . The Alert Service Provider may be a Weather Alert Service Provider as was previously discussed.

This process begins when the Alert Service Provider receives an emergency alert from an alerting source or system which can be by way of example and not limitation The National Weather Service US Geological Survey US Department of Justice Center for Disease Control Lightning Decision server Traffic Network et cetera. Referring now to flow diagram of the process by which an alert is delivered and processed by the Alert Service Provider will be further described. Note that the encircled numerals 1 3 in correspond to the flow numerals below 

The Alert Notification phase enables a device to actually receive notification of an alert available to be retrieved from the Alert Service Provider . Referring now to an exemplary alert notification process flow of how the alert is sent to a device from the alert server is illustrated. Note that the encircled numerals 1 5 and 6a 6b 6c 6d and 6e in correspond to the flow numerals below 

One requirement of the Multimedia Alert System may be to link broadcasts of both audio and video supplied by third party broadcasters to severe weather events. Too support this each third party broadcaster is required to record video and or audio clips in formats such as Apple Inc. s iPhone or Google s Android platforms or other platforms of interest can render and store an entry in a Media RSS file sorted according to time in descending order.

Thus each entry in the Media RSS file may contain at least the following information a thumbnail representing a first frame of video or the media clip a brief description of the media clip and a URL needed to retrieve the media clip.

Referring now to flow diagram of a retrieve media alert flow in accordance with various embodiments is disclosed. Note that the encircled numerals 1 5in correspond to the flow numerals below. Thus when the user selects to view the local video about the alert the following occurs in connection with certain embodiments 

Data for use in accordance with various embodiments of the Multimedia Alert Method System Apparatus and Device may be organized into two 2 databases the Alert Database and the Device Location Database . The data sets in each database may be as follows 

Based on battery status of a Device a device application may alert the user to one or more features of the application that will consume significant amount of power thus allowing the user to prolong battery life in critical situations. For example such low battery alerts may notify the user when they 

An exemplary Battery Management flow diagram is illustrated in . At Block a check for power availability in the device battery is undertaken. If at Decision Block it is determined that the Device battery power level is less than some threshold such as less than 40 for example then at Block the user is prompted to activate a power saver mode of the Device. At Decision Block if the user chooses to enter activate the Device s power saver mode then at Block various system flags may be set to activate the power saver mode. As shown some examples of power saver mode actions may be to play audio only reduce the number of GPS queries undertaken reduce the brightness of the Device screen to some level such as 50 for example if supported by the Device.

If the current battery power level of the Device is not below the threshold then the flow continues to Block to schedule a timer to wake up the Device such as in 30 minutes. The device is then put into its sleep mode at Block until the timer wakes it up. The Device wakes up at Block this may occur by operation of the timer or upon power up of the Device.

Power conservation of the Device may be triggered upon a request of the location of the Device. At Decision Block the inquiry after a location request might be whether the device battery power level is less than or equal to a threshold such as 60 . If yes than at Block LBS or cell tower triangulation may be used to lower the accuracy obtained in the location determination. The LBS request is made at Block . Again this level of decreased accuracy may be perfectly acceptable within lesser degree of accuracy needed for the Tile Code regime. If this is not acceptable than at Block GPS is used and the accuracy achievable with GPS location determination may be set.

In accordance with various embodiments the lightning alert is generated based on the probability that lightning will strike a given location based on data. These alerts are delivered to the alert system from system servers at an Alert Service Provider and other lightning networks.

Lightning information is gathered by lightning detectors from third party networks and that information is supplied to the Alert Service Provider for analysis. The information supplied from the lightning networks given the approximation of the location of lightning strikes in longitude and latitude coordinates along with the time that the strike was recorded. The lightning alert is triggered based upon the frequency or strikes within a given time period at a given location.

An exemplary lighting prediction flow diagram is illustrated in . At Block data is received from lightning networks source networks for lightning information. At Block a prediction of lightning activity or events such as lighting strikes consisting of geographical areas of lightning activity is undertaken. The geographical areas of the lightning activity is converted to Tile Sets and corresponding Tile Code information at Block . At Block the Device Location Database is queries for matching Tile information. At Block one or more lightning prediction alerts may be transmitted to target Devices having matching Tile information. The Device receives the lightning prediction alert at Block . The Alert may be stored in the local Alert Database at Block . At Decision Block the inquiry is whether the immediate or current Device location falls within a tile of the lightning prediction alert. If so then the user of the Device is alerted at Block . If not than the lightning prediction alert is ignored at Block .

Referring now a flowchart of a lightning prediction flow in accordance with other various representative embodiments is shown. At Block the Alert Processing Server receives lightning prediction data from an alert provider or algorithm and that lightning prediction data is used to define the lightning prediction. At Block the lightning prediction includes valuable information such as area of lightning threat severity of lightning threat and the ETA ETD of the lighting threat. At Block the Alert Notification Server converts the area of threat to tile code information as previously discussed. At Block the target device database is queried for matching tile information. The lightning prediction alert is transmitted to one or more target devices at Block .

As lighting is an event that occurs at a given location the lightning strike and within a given time or range of time it is a discrete condition for which it is possible to know the distance of the strike location to a specified geographical tile and whether one or more alert geographical tiles associated with the discrete condition are within a user defined distance from the location of the discrete condition. The distance from the strike location radiates out in all directions to define a circle having its center at the strike location in an alert geographical tile at the center of the one or more alert geographical tiles that represent the alert region and the body of the circle defined by one or more additional alert geographical tiles radiating out from the strike location. All of these alert geographical tiles represent the point based circular alert region. This distance may be set by a user of the Device i.e. user defined as shown in . As shown in the drawing through interaction with the user interface of a touch screen mobile device for example the user may set the desired proximity for lightning notifications to be provided to the user via the Device. In the particular example shown the user is given the choice of setting the lightning proximity to either 2 miles or 10 miles from either the current location of the device or from a location other than the current location of the device. The user defined distance then may be a distance from the lightning strike to the location of the user with his Device or it may be a distance from the lightning strike to another location a non changing location specified by the user that is monitored. For example the user may wish to know when lightning strikes occur within 2 miles of his child s school or within 10 miles of home both of which are examples of non changing locations other than the location of the Device.

In addition to a lightning strike an epicenter of an earthquake is an example of a discrete condition for which the user may be alerted. In that case the user may be alerted when the epicenter of the earthquake a discrete location is within a user defined distance from either the Device location or a non changing location other than the Device location. For either type of discrete condition the alert data of the condition may include the time of issue of the alert a duration of the alert a severity of the alert a title of the alert and a base text of the alert.

As described a method of providing alert information to a user of a location enabled device of an alert of a discrete condition is provided. In particular in response to receiving notification of the occurrence of an alert of a discrete condition occurring at a location a current location of the device is determined and the determined current location is converted to a device geographical tile of a plurality of geographical tiles that encompasses the determined current location wherein each of the plurality of geographical tiles represents a unique geographic projection of a rendered geographical area of defined size and wherein the device geographical tile is represented by a device tile code. The alert data received about the alert of the discrete condition is an alert message event is processed and the location of the discrete condition e.g. lightning strike is converted to an alert geographical tile and stored in an alert database that stores alerts if it is determined that the device tile code of the device geographical tile matches any of one or more alert geographical tiles that represent the one or more alert geographical tiles that define encompass the discrete condition and the user defined distance from the location of the discrete condition. The one or more alert geographical tiles are within a user defined distance from the location of the discrete condition and each of the one or more alert geographical tiles is represented by one or more alert tile codes the one or more alert geographical tiles are of the plurality of geographical tiles and the device geographical tile and each of the one or more alert geographical tiles are the defined size of the plurality of geographical tiles. Next a database query of the alert database is performed to identify one or more alerts stored in the alert database having one or more alert geographical tile codes that match the device tile code representative of the current location of the device and that have not been presented to a user of the device through a user interface of the device. The database query means searching the alert database for the device tile code. The Device user via the user interface of the device is notified of the identified one or more alerts of interest to the current location that have not been presented and the user is prompted to view the identified one or more alerts via the user interface of the device.

Further when a location other than the current device location is to be monitored with respect to the discrete condition alert alert data received about the alert in an alert message event in an alert database that stores a plurality of alerts is processed and stored if it is determined that a location tile code of a location geographical tile matches any of one or more alert geographical tiles that represent the one or more alert geographical tiles that define the discrete alert condition and geographical tiles that represent the user defined distance from the discrete condition. As before each of the one or more alert geographical tiles is represented by one or more alert tile codes the one or more alert geographical tiles are of the plurality of geographical tiles and the location geographical tile and each of the one or more alert geographical tiles are the defined size of the plurality of geographical tiles. A database query of the alert database may be performed to identify one or more alerts stored in the alert database having one or more alert geographical tile codes that match the location tile code representative of a location other than the current location of the device and that have not been presented to a user of the device through a user interface of the device. The database query is performed by searching the alert database for the location tile code. Next the user of the Device is notified via the user interface of the device of alerts of interest to the location other than the current location of the device that have not been presented and the user is prompted to view the identified one or more alerts via the user interface of the device.

Further with reference to the block diagram and flows discussed above in accordance with communicating the occurrence of a discrete condition such as lightning or an earthquake an alert service provider transmits to an alert processing server an alert notification of an alert of a discrete condition occurring at a location. The alert notification is stored in an alert database coupled to the alert processing server. An alert notification server can retrieve the alert notification from the alert database and determine one or more alert geographical tiles of interest that are affected by the alert. Again the one or more alert geographical tiles define encompass the discrete condition and the user defined distance from the location of the discrete condition. The alert notification server can further determine one or more location enabled devices having a location that falls within an alert geographical tile where each alert geographical tile is within a user defined distance from the location of the discrete condition. A text portion of the alert is retrieved from the alert database and the text portion of the alert processed to generate an audio version of the alert. An alert text notification of the alert is constructed having the text portion of the alert an alert identifier of the alert a reference identifier for the audio version of the alert the one or more alert geographical tiles and the one or more device identifiers for each of the one or more devices and the alert text notification is stored into an alert notification queue. A gateway server can retrieve the one or more device identifiers for each of the one or more devices the alert text notification and the alert identifier of the alert from the alert notification queue and transmit the alert text notification to the one or more devices corresponding to the retrieved one or more device identifiers. Operation of the various elements including the alert service provider alert notification server and gateway server are discussed above.

Moreover a Device can receive and process the alert text notification and request to receive alert data of the alert. Before the Device requests the receive alert data a current location of the device represented by a device geographical tile is obtained and the current location of the device is converted to a device tile code and the device tile code representative of the current device location stored to a device location database.

The Device receives and presents to a user of the Device the received alert data of the alert through a user interface of the device. If the Device is not authorized to receive alert notifications the alert notification server sends to the Device a request message requesting tracking of the device for alert notifications. If the request message is approved the alert notification server updates the device location database to include the device as a registered device.

In this manner a method of providing alert information concerning the occurrence of a lightning strike earthquake or other discrete condition is provided to a user of a Device.

Examples of user interfaces with description for a user of a device shown as a mobile phone are provided in the screen shots of . The screen shots are generated controlled and rendered to a user of the mobile phone by a weather alert application running on the mobile phone.

Referring now to an illustration of a mobile device that is under control of a weather application to operate as a weather radio to provide weather information and alerts to a user of the mobile phone via a user interface is shown. The alert application running on the mobile phone causes a splash screen to be displayed to a user of the device that may have information such as corporate branding and sponsorship branding displayed as shown. Corporate and sponsorship branding are useful in partnering with sponsors or third party local regional or national media providers to provide alerts. This screen may appear if the user launches the application without an alert such as a severe weather alert waking up the phone via a pop up screen.

Referring now to a screen shot of a mobile phone waking up from an existing state of the phone can be seen. The existing state of the phone may be operation of another application of the phone. When on the mobile phone wakes up when a severe weather alert is received by the phone such as via Push Notification in the case of an iPhone. The audio portion of the alert is provided first. Upon the phone waking up for the alert a number of auditory sounds such as three beeps may be sounded followed by playing of the alert summary until the user selects view to view the alert on the alert detail screen where the alert related to this pop up will be highlighted or until the user selects to close the alert. Only the summary of the alert is played in this pop up until the user selects to learn more about the alert. In this particular example the following alert summary is read or played audibly for the user of the device 

The main device volume may be lowered if not silent and the alert audio volume increased so that the alert summary will be more readily heard. The background for the alert box or panel may be semi transparent as shown. If desired a background color for the alert box may be chosen such as red.

Referring now to a weather alert list screen that lists alerts that are available for viewing is illustrated. A user has navigated to this screen by selecting the View button on a pop up alert and the related alert will be highlighted in the listing of alerts. In this drawing the alert box provides important alert information to the phone user. In the alert box five menu control buttons are displayed along the bottom of the alert box from left to right an Alert Button a Map Radar button a Media video button a My Places button and a Setup button. The Alert Button when selected allows a viewer to see a listing of available alerts for the current location as shown in this drawing. The Map Radar button can be selected to show radar and map information for an alert area. The Video button can be selected to see hear live streaming video and or audio about a selected alert if available. The My Places button at the bottom of the alert box allows a user to select and control locations of interest. The Setup button allows the user to select settings for the alert application such as weather settings as will be described.

It can be seen that the Alert Button is selected and the weather alert list screen lists three alerts for the current device location a wind advisory a thunderstorm warning and forecasts for the location. Any of these three alert notifications can be selected to access more detailed information. It can be seen that although the alerts are listed for the current location the forward and backward arrows indicate that the user can scroll through other locations if desired. The My Places button at the bottom of the alert box allows a user to select and control locations of interest. The user can additionally scroll down the list in the alert panel to see additional alerts.

Also as part of the alert box the user can access local emergency services by activating the 911 alert button. The user can select the 911 button to launch a standard emergency dialer with the needed 911 number pre filled. The user would then have to only select the green call button to activate a call to emergency services. In some instances the 911 button may only appear if there is an alert for the device s current location otherwise a call contacts button may be provided as illustrated in another drawing.

Corporate branding is shown and a user may select corporate branding if they wish to visit a corporate website by launching their browser. Sponsorship branding may also be shown.

The weather alert list screen of provides a listing of available weather alerts relevant to a current location in Norman Okla. In this particular example the available alerts of the listing are a wind advisory a thunderstorm warning and an option to listen to NOAA alerts and forecasts. As illustrated the alert box or panel may contain a button by which contact information may be accessed. It is noted that a contacts button may be placed in any screen shot of the alert application as desired.

Once a user has selected to learn more about an alert listed in the alert listing of a weather alert detail screen is displayed. Referring now to the text detail of a flood warning is displayed in the alert box. Detailed alert information about the flood such as time of alert duration of alert location of alert severity etc. are provided. The alert information is displayed as text in the alert panel and the user may scroll through this content as needed. The Select button may be selected to return to the alert list screen. It can be seen that the menu control buttons listed in the alert listing screen of are not present in order to maximize display area in the alert box. Also the user may not wish to go to a different mode of the alert application from the alert detail screen so it is not necessary to provide the menu control buttons here.

The screen shot of provides an alternate way in which a user may navigate through alerts. A Flood warning is the alert type and a user may navigate to play view previous or next alerts by touching the backwards or forwards play button. Touching the Done button will return the user to the Alert List of a previous screen.

Next as illustrated in the screen shot of selection of the Video menu button of the Alert box displays for the user the available videos for a location such as Atlanta Ga. in this example. The available media options are listed as no live videos available a video on winter weather preparedness and a video on tornado preparedness. Other types of audio visual information may be listed and accessed if desired such as photos audio streaming audio etc.

Referring now to the My Places menu control button of the alert box accesses locations or places stored in the alert application of the phone and provides the opportunity to add new locations to be monitored or cancel delete locations. In this particular example a location of Orlando Fla. is stored in the application. This allows a user to the alert application to receive alert information about Orlando as a stored and monitored location. This location may be deleted by activating the delete location button and additional information about the location or editing of the location may be accomplished by choosing to view additional location information about Orlando. Moreover selection of the add a location button will bring up a screen that will allow a new location to be added to My Places. Touching the Done button will allow a user to close settings returning to the previously viewed screen. As shown in a new location may be added by entering a city and state a postal zip code an airport code geographical location or other point of interest POI . shows entry of a city in the search edit field through use of the keyboard interface of the user interface in the alert box. The user types in the name of a city postal code airport code geographical location or other POI in the search edit field. In selection of the cancel button returns the user to the previously viewed screen. Also selection of the Find Me button of the alert box enables the user to find their current location using the GPS capabilities of the mobile device.

Referring now to the map panel screenshots of pressing the Map Radar menu button of the alert box allows the user to view radar and map data about a selected alert. A user can navigate to this screen by touching the Map menu button of the alert box. As indicated in there may be different regions of an alert each corresponding to the level of severity of the warning. Thus locations with a Watch may be shown with a yellow color or indicator locations with a Warning may be shown with a red color or indicator and locations with neither Watches nor Warnings may have blue color or indicator. As shown in a geographical area subject to Watches Warnings is outlined on the radar map.

A user may touch the play stop button to play or stop animating radar in the alert box. The information i button may be touched to change map settings such as to choose the layers to be shown on the radar map etc. The refresh button may be touched to refresh the map. The user may touch the Alert button to return to the alert listing screen of the alert box.

Referring now to selection of the Setup menu button by the user allows the user to control certain setting of alerts such as turning alerts on and off. There may be various alert settings of the alert application which the user may set by appropriate selection of alert settings. As shown in this example a user may choose to turn ON or OFF the following alert settings Ice and Fog Storm and Tornados Tornado Watch Tornado Warning Thunderstorm Watch Winter and Frost Winter Storm Watch. There may be any number of additional alert settings provided to the user by the alert application.

In accordance with various embodiments presented herein a next generation mobile weather radio emergency alerting system that will enable a mobile user to receive audio alerts like the NOAA Weather Radio Network visual alerts geographic representation of the location of alerts and video associated with alerts issued by organizations including the National Weather Service FCC Emergency Alert System and the Lightning Prediction Alert Service is provided.

In addition to allowing the user to receive alerts the Mobile Weather Radio using the Tile System will increase the accuracy of alerts that notify the user from a 40 mile radius to a 1 mile radius. This will eliminate a whole series of issues around the NOAA Weather Radios where the user could be woken up or alerted for a condition or threat affecting a location up to 80 miles away.

The weather radio also can track a set of location enabled devices for a user. The set of devices being tracked can include a device being carried by friends when they allow it the user s own device or devices tracking assets. This tracking is done using the Tile structure insuring that the same accuracy is applied if the device is in motion or stationary.

Another primary benefit gained by issuing audio alerts using mobile devices is that the application is simple to setup mobile once setup and more likely to be near a person using the device when an alert is issued.

Therefore at least the following characteristics or features of the various embodiments of Multimedia Alerting described herein are believed to be novel and therefore patentably distinct in accordance with the various embodiments 

Civil Defense Homeland Security or other Emergency Alerting System EAS notifications to the devices location to select the broadcast to render to the user of the device.
