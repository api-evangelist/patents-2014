The embodiments herein may be manufactured used and or licensed by or for the United States Government without the payment of royalties thereon.

Image processing is a form of signal processing for which the input is an image such as for example a photograph or video frame and the output is either an image or series of images or a set of characteristics or parameters related to the image or series of images . Forms of image processing include for example face detection feature detection medical image processing computer vision extraction of information from an image by a computer microscope image processing etc.

Image resolution relates to the detail that an image possesses. For satellite images the resolution generally correlates to the area represented by each pixel. Generally speaking an image is considered to be more accurate and detailed as the area represented by each pixel is decreased. As used herein the term images include digital or analog images film images and or other types of images. When an image is captured by a monochrome camera a single charge coupled device CCD or complementary metal oxide semiconductor CMOS sensor is used to form an image via the light intensity projected onto the sensor. Cameras taking pictures from great distances such as aerial photos may not obtain detailed information about the subject matter. Also the taking of photographs may be subject to motion of the camera and or jitter. Consequently subtle or detail information are not present in the images.

Quantum imaging is a relatively new science that is developing new technology such as Quantum Ghost Imaging QGI to exploit quantum optical information. The exploitation of quantum optical information leads to increased resolution over conventional classical optical imaging. Furthermore quantum imaging is adaptable to adverse imaging situations and there is a benefit to exploiting quantum optical information to image objects through partially obscuring media i.e. optical turbulence obstructions smoke and fog. Imaging through obscuring media is difficult such as the difficulty of driving in foggy weather.

Quantum entanglement is a quantum mechanical phenomenon in which the quantum states of two or more quantum particles are linked together such that the quantum state of one quantum particle appears to interact with its counterpart even though the individual quantum particles may be spatially separated. This apparent interconnection leads to correlations between observable physical properties of remote systems since the interaction of the remote system with quantum state of one of a pair can be observed though observation of the counterpart. For example according to quantum mechanics the spin of a quantum particle is indeterminate until such time as some physical intervention is made to measure the spin which in general could equally be spin up or spin down. However when two members of a spin entangled pair are measured they will either be correlated or anti correlated using spin measurements regardless of the distance between the two particles. It is normally taught in quantum theory that no hidden variable theory can account for these results of quantum mechanics. The statistics of multiple measurements must generally relate to an inequality called Bell s inequality which is violated both by quantum mechanical theory and experimental results.

The non classical two photon interaction or quantum entanglement was described by Albert Einstein et al. Einstein Podolsky Rosen hereinafter Einstein et al. paradox Can Quantum Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete Physical Review Volume 47 May 15 1935 pgs. 777 800. The paradox of quantum entanglement as described therein relates to the concept that as a result of the process of measurement of a first system using quantum mechanics two different physical quantities are obtainable in the second system despite the fact that at the time of the measurements the two systems no longer interact and the second system is not disturbed in any way by the first. Einstein et al were unable to reconcile this quantum mechanical description of reality with the so called classical physics determination that no real change can take place in the second system as a consequence of anything that may be done to the first system after the two systems no longer interact.

The theoretical work reported by Klyshko in Combined EPR and Two Slit Experiments Interference of Advanced Waves Physics Letters A Volume 132 number 6 7 pp. 299 304 1988 see also Soy. Phys. Usp. 31 74 suggested a non classical two photon interaction could exist.

The first two photon imaging experiment was reported by Pittman et al. in Optical Imaging by Means of Two photon Quantum Entanglement Physical Review A Vol. 52 No. 5 November 1995. According to the Pittman article a two photon optical imaging experiment was performed to test the two particle entanglement as described by Albert Einstein et al. referenced above to determine if there was a correlation in position and in momentum for an entangled two photon system using test beam or path and reference beam or path photon pairs. Specifically an aperture placed in front of a fixed detector was illuminated by a signal beam through a convex lens. A sharp magnified image of the aperture was found in the coincidence counting rate when a mobile detector was scanned in the transverse plane of the reference beam at a specific distance in relation to the lens. The experiment was named ghost imaging due to its surprising nonlocal feature.

Additional experiments are reported in Pittman et al. Optical Imaging by Means of Two Photon Entanglement Phys. Rev. A Rapid Comm. Vol. 52 R3429 1995 and ghost interference by Strekalov et al Observation of Two Photon Ghost Interference and Diffraction Phys. Rev. Lett. Vol. 74 3600 1995 which together stimulated the foundation of quantum imaging in terms of multi photon geometrical and physical optics.

Illustrated in is a methodology for resolution improvement performed by the at least one processor comprises the following steps not necessarily in the order recited 

Note that the steps in are comparable to the numbered boxes in as denoted by the reference to Box  correlating to the Box number of .

Referring now to in Box a series or collection of high resolution measurements or frames of the illuminating light source which may be for example the sun are inputted into the memory or input of a processor or image processor. As used herein the terminology processor or image processor as used in the following claims includes a computer multiprocessor CPU minicomputer microprocessor or any machine similar to a computer or processor which is capable of processing algorithms.

In Box using the input from Box the frame data or value of each pixel at each pixel location is determined for each frame. In Box the pixel values in the low resolution set of measurements Pis determined. The low resolution frames may comprise photographs of the same region of interest. The region of interest may be a scene landscape an object a subject person or thing. Where the low resolution source is a low resolution camera the value of a pixel correlates to a bucket value determination and correlates to the light intensity measured by the detector. In the case of an electronic display formed by pixels the intensity of each pixel value at each pixel location Pis determined. At Box the values in Box are multiplied by the values determined in Box . Box represents the Frame Data PProduct. Inasmuch as the Boxes and are arrays of pixel values the Box Product is also an array of values. At Box the products of Box are repeatedly calculated for each frame in a selected plurality of frames and summed together. As an example one hundred frames may be selected. At Box the summation Box Products for the determined in Box is divided by the number of frames such as for example one hundred to determine the Frame Data PProducts Average for the plurality of frames. The Product Average in Box is an array containing pixel values at each pixel location within the frame.

Box represents the multiplication of Boxes and A to form the Average Frame Data Average PProduct Box which is an array. As shown in the bottom portion of the Average Frame Data Average PProduct is subtracted from the Frame Data PProducts Average to form the intermediate Gij Image of Box . In Box the sum of the intermediate Gij Images for the frames 1 N is calculated to produce the final composite image.

In accordance with the method described multiple photo sensor buckets scanned or in an array and high resolution images of the illuminating light source. Depending on the object and the light source that it is scattering and reflecting it is possible that light is scattering or reflecting from any location on the subject such that any or all of the photo sensors in the array has a probability of measuring one or more photons of light. A low resolution camera can be used as the multiple photo sensor bucket array. A higher resolution Gimage of the target can be produced using high resolution images of the illumination source coupled with information from the multiple photo sensor bucket array. Use of the multiple photo sensor bucket array can improve the convergence rate of the high resolution Gimage. Each photo sensor in the multiple photo sensor bucket array may measure light scattered and reflected from distinct portions of the target object with appropriate optics that images the subject onto the multiple photo sensor bucket array.

A concept is that if the nonspatial information resolving single pixel bucket detector that measures light from the target object that is typically used for Gimaging was replaced with a low resolution spatial information resolving device such as a Charge Coupled Device CCD camera and the detector that measures the light from the source of illumination is a high resolution spatial information resolving device i.e. a high resolution CCD then one could use the techniques of Gimaging to generate an image that would be at the resolution and quality of the high resolution device using the extra information measured by the low resolution target object detector. This may be accomplished by treating each nonspatial information resolving pixel of the low resolution detector as a separate bucket measurement to create a Gimage. The generation of Gimages is performed over the entire set of pixels of the low resolution camera and each low resolution Gimage is accumulated into a composite Gimage that provides the final result. It should be noted that prior to generating a low resolution pixel Gimage the low resolution pixel value can be tested to determine by some metric if a Gimage should be computed using that low resolution pixel i.e. an option includes not computing a Gimage if all the values at that low resolution pixel are 0 or below some threshold value.

A single bucket detector may be used to scan over different areas of a target. At each step of the scan a Gimage would be computed and accumulated into a composite Gimage for all positions that the detector scanned.

A third embodiment utilizes the concept occurring when a set of random or pseudo random pixels of the multiple photo sensor bucket array measure light from the target subject. This random set of pixels may be different from one measurement time to another measurement time and these sets of random bucket pixels are used to compute sets of Gimages that are accumulated into a higher resolution and higher quality composite Gimage.

It should be noted that the calculation of the Gimage may be accomplished by using optimization methods such as Compressive Sensing techniques.

Shown in is a laser that sends light through a thermalizing element which creates a light pattern. A beam splitter is used to split the beam from the laser into a target path A and a reference path B. The pattern of the beam is recorded by a charge coupled device CCD or the like which records spatial information concerning the light pattern as discussed more fully in U.S. application Ser. No. 12 330 401 hereby incorporated by reference. In its simplest terms a charge coupled device CCD is a device for the movement of electrical charge from the detector area to an area where the charge can be manipulated for example conversion into a digital value. CCDs may be implemented as shift registers that move charge between capacitive bins in the device. The CCD device may be made up of semiconductors arranged in such a way that the electric charge output of one semiconductor charges an adjacent one. The CCD device may be integrated with an image sensor such as a photoelectric device to produce the charge that is being read for digital imaging. The CCD device may optionally be a camera photodetector array or a photographic device capable of imaging the beam pattern B. The beam pattern comprising the spatial information concerning the light beam B is sent to computer . Light Beam A is directed to the target and the returned and scattered light is collected by a first detector or sensor . Detector may be a plurality of bucket detectors or any kind of detectors which have the capability of detecting a photon strike. Detectors may be of a large variety of photo detectors well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. A feature of the embodiments of is that the detectors individually need not record spatial information regarding the target . However cumulatively spatial information is derived although at low resolution. The spatial information derived by spatial detector is transmitted to the computer which combines and correlates this spatial information with the coincidence data received from detectors . For example the data recorded by detectors may be transmitted to computer in a form resembling that depicted in for example where roughly 16 bucket measurements are represented.

The spatial information from detector is combined with the coincidence information from the detectors in computer . Computer may be a microprocessor processor multiprocessor CPU mainframe or any computing element capable of combining the spatial information from the detector with the coincidence information from detectors . Further description of the coincidence detection feature is found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7 536 012 and 7 812 303 both of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Since the photonic information detected by each particular detector need not encompass spatial information but simply indicate the occurrence of a photon returned from the target this capability facilitates the use of the embodiment systems in environments in which the returned photons may be impacted by environmental conditions such as fog smoke atmospheric particles and the like.

A quantum photon mathematical equation will project the reference light intensity from the CCD . This will be combined with bucket photon information such as that exemplified in for an ensemble of pulses to produce coincidence measurements needed for ghost imaging. The terminology ghost relates to the feature that the spatial information is not reflected from the target but is either derived from the modulation of the laser beam not shown or the spatial information obtained through the use of beam splitter and detector which records spatial information from a beam which has not seen or illuminated the target.

By way of example correlates to the image as produced using the methodology described in FIG. 5A of U.S. Pat. No. 7 812 303 and correlates to an image produced through to the processing stage as depicted at Box of .

As further examples of image processing is an image produced as represented at Box and correlates to the image produced when the process reaches Box .

As further examples of image processing is a low resolution image correlating to Box of where blocks of 2 2 pixels are processed together. is 1 by 1 a spatially averaged set of pixels of the target subject which correlates to an equivalent high resolution image.

The region of interest may be a scene landscape an object a subject person or thing. In Box the low resolution Average Frame Data is determined by computing the average value of each pixel at each pixel location for the plurality of frames. In Box the low resolution Deviation Frame Data is determined by subtracting the low resolution Average Frame Data from the low resolution Frame Data for all pixels in each frame for the plurality of frames.

The method proceeds to . On a quantum level to get the improved image the issue is what high resolution light measured from the illuminating source contributed to the low resolution light measured from the target in a quantative manner. In Box a series of high resolution frames are entered into the memory or input of a processor or image processor. The frames may comprise photographs of the illuminating source of the region of interest. For example in a surveillance application the central station may measure high resolution measurements of the sun while many low resolution images are taken by distributed cameras in distant areas. Combining the low resolution image data in accordance with the procedures detailed herein results in a higher resolution image from each low resolution camera. The region of interest may be a scene landscape an object a subject person or thing. In Box the high resolution Average Frame Data is determined by computing the average value of each pixel at each pixel location for the plurality of frames of the source of illumination. In Box the high resolution Deviation Frame Data is determined by subtracting the high resolution Average Frame Data from the high resolution frame data for all pixels i.e. value of each pixel in each frame for the plurality of frames.

The method proceeds to which shows how to generate a third set of data which is referred to here at SET 3. SET 3 data includes conditional product terms using low resolution pixels having a positive intensity deviation and high resolution positive deviation frame data pixels. SET 3 may be determined as follows In Box low resolution pixels with a Positive Intensity Deviation multiply the high resolution Positive Frame Data Deviation pixels within that set of frames. Positive intensity deviation is defined occurring when the deviation is greater than zero at the pixel location. In Box for each pixel location the processor calculates a the square of the low resolution Positive Intensity Deviation b the product of the low resolution Positive Intensity Deviation the high resolution Positive Deviation Frame Data pixels c the square of the low resolution Positive Deviation Frame Data pixels are recorded and accumulated and d the square of the high resolution Positive Deviation Frame Data pixels are recorded and accumulated. In part a each time a pixel position is used it is recorded and accumulated. The number of times the pixel is used is recorded which will be used to compute the averages. As an example of the square of the low resolution Positive Intensity Deviation if the low resolution pixel value is 8 the average pixel value is 6 the square of the low resolution pixel positive intensity deviation is 2 2 or 4. If the high resolution pixel value is 20 the average pixel value is 16 the square of the high resolution pixel positive intensity deviation is 4 4 or 16. In this example of the product of the low resolution Positive Intensity Deviation the high resolution Positive Deviation Frame Data pixels would 8. These products are computed for each pixel in each frame for the low resolution and high resolution images respectively. Thus there is an array for each product computed in Box . In Boxes A C the pre normalized Positive Positive Product pixel values Box A are determined by dividing the product of the low resolution Positive Intensity Deviation pixels the high resolution Positive Deviation Frame Data pixels by the number of times the pixel is used for the calculation of the positive low resolution deviation times the positive high resolution deviation values the product . The average of the squares of the low resolution Positive Intensity is determined by dividing by the number of times the pixel was used for the calculation of the product Box B . The average of the squares of the high resultion Positive Deviation Frame Data pixels is determined by dividing by the number of times the pixel was used for the calculation of the product Box C .

Continuing to the method proceeds to Box . In Box the standard deviation of the low resolution Positive Intensity Deviation is determined by taking the square root of the average of the squares of the low resolution Positive Intensity Deviations determined in Box B . In Box the standard deviations of the high resolution Positive Deviation Frame Data pixels is computed by taking the square root of the average of the squares of the high resolution Positive Deviation Frame Data pixels determined in Box C . Box determines the Normalized Positive Positive Product pixel values by dividing the pre Normalized Positive Positive Product Box A by the product of the standard deviation of the low resolution Positive Intensity Deviations Box and the standard deviation of the high resolution Positive Deviation Frame Data pixels Box .

The method proceeds via path to which shows how to generate a fourth set of data which is referred to here at SET 4. SET 4 frame data includes conditional product terms using frames having a low resolution negative intensity deviations and high resolution negative deviation frame data pixels. SET 4 may be determined as follows In Box pixels with a low resolution Negative Intensity Deviation multiply the value of the low resolution Intensity Deviation by the high resolution Negative Frame Data Deviation pixels within that set of frames. In Box for each pixel location the processor calculates a the square of the low resolution Negative Intensity Deviation b the product of the low resolution Negative Intensity Deviation the high resolution Negative Deviation Frame Data pixels c the square of the low resolution Negative Deviation Frame Data pixels are recorded and accumulated and d the square of the high resolution Negative Deviation Frame Data pixels are recorded and accumulated. In Boxes A C the pre normalized Negative Negative Product pixel values Box A are determined by dividing the product of the low resolution Negative Intensity Deviations the high resolution Negative Deviation Frame Data pixels by the result of . In Box B the average of the squares of the low resolution Negative Intensity is determined by dividing by . In Box C the average of the squares of the high resolution Negative Deviation Frame Data pixels is determined by dividing by .

From Box in the method can proceed via path to . In Box the standard deviation of the low resolution Negative Intensity Deviation is determined by taking the square root of the average of the squares of the low resolution Negative Intensity Deviation determined in Box A . In Box the standard deviations of the high resolution Negative Deviation Frame Data pixels is computed by taking the square root of the average of the squares of the high resolution Negative Deviation Frame Data pixels determined in Box B. Box determines the Normalized Negative Negative Product pixel values by dividing the pre Normalized Negative Negative Product determined in Box A by the product of the standard deviation of the low resolution Negative Intensity Deviation determined by Box and the standard deviation of the high resolution Negative Deviation Frame Data pixels determined by Box . At the conclusion of Box the method proceeds via path to for determining an improved image data or to for determining alternative improved image data by an alternative embodiment.

Returning to the method also can concurrently proceeds via path to which shows how to generate a fifth set of data which is referred to here at SET 5. SET 5 frame data includes conditional product terms using pixels having a low resolution negative intensity deviation and high resolution positive deviation frame data pixels. SET 5 may be determined as follows In Box pixels with a low resolution Negative Intensity Deviation multiply the values of the low resolution Intensity Deviation by the high resolution Positive Frame Data Deviation pixels within that set of frames. In Box the processor records and accumulates a pixel locations b the square of the low resolution Negative Intensity Deviations c the product of the low resolution Negative Intensity Deviations the high resolution Positive Deviation Frame Data pixels and d the square of the high resolution Positive Deviation Frame Data pixels are recorded and accumulated. In Box A C the pre normalized Positive Negative Product pixel values Box A are determined by dividing the product of the low resolution Negative Intensity Deviations the high resolution Positive Deviation Frame Data pixels by the result of Box A. The average of the squares of the low resolution Negative Intensity Box B is determined by dividing the result of Box B by the result of Box A.

Entangled photon source is an entangled photon source such as of the types illustrated by . The entangled photon source generates entangled photon pairs that are entangled in time energy H V polarization or between other conjugate pair properties of the photons. Element may be for example a polarizing beam splitter dichroic mirror or other optical element that operates to direct one portion of an entangled photon pair towards spatially resolving detector and directs the remaining portion of an entangled photon pair toward spatially resolving detector . Focusing elements may be lenses used to focus the photons onto detector and detector . Spatially resolving detector measures the time and spatial x y location of one part of an entangled pair that has interacted with the remote scene target or subject. Spatially resolving detector measures time and spatial x y location of the second part of an entangled pair that has interacted with the remote scene target or subject. Box B represents coincidence and timing electronics that operates to register when a pixel on detector and a pixel on detector occur inside within a user defined coincidence window T. A coincidence window is a time difference within which two photon measurements are defined to be co incident. The timing electronics further operate to record the time that has elapsed since a user chosen laser pulse and the first coincidence pair detection for ranging calculations. Box indicates a processor memory and algorithms to generate enhanced average second order images of the region of interest. Memory A associated with processor stores input images algorithms intermediate computations and enhanced second order images of the region of interest. Box represents software operationally configured to perform the image improvement and enhancement processes. Display A is operatively connected to processor for displaying the generated enhanced second order or higher order image of the region of interest. Box represents optionally present pointing and aiming e.g. beam steering components that may be used to direct the entangled photon pairs to a specific point within the region of interest.

A second set of entangled photon pairs generated by swapped entangled photon source are directed towards element A shown in the bottom left corner of . The entangled photons from element of are directed towards element A via delay line element and the corresponding set of entangled photons from element of are directed towards element A through beam steering or pointing element . Element A is similar to and directs portions of the entering entangled photon pairs towards measurement devices and . Coincidence measurements of the entangled photons directed to element A are used to generate a reflection image of the target with information that is provided by the shared entanglement properties of the entangled photons that were directed from swapped entangled photon source to focusing device or telescope A. It is to be appreciated that this invention will operate to generate an improved image of the target where the target may be partially absorbing and or partially reflecting. As state above the entangled photons from element of are directed towards element A via delay line element and the corresponding set of entangled photons from element of are directed towards element A through beam steering or pointing element . Displays will display an image created by entangled photons reflected by the target and display A will display an image created by entangled photons that never directly interacted with the target but due to the properties of entanglement display an image of created by corresponding entangled photons a absorbed by target b reflected by the target due to the properties of entangled photon pairs.

As described above generally speaking the progression of image stages in are represented in the presentation and comparison of images in in order to demonstrate that high resolution images are producible from low resolution images using the above principles.

At least some of the embodiments described above may be based upon the calculation of a G ghost image for each bucket detector over the set of all bucket detectors that comprise the low resolution target object detector. Each of the intermediate Gimages are summed into a final composite image of the target object

A ghost or Gimage as used herein may be mathematically expressed as a result of a convolution between the aperture function amplitude distribution function of the object A right arrow over and a function like second order correlation function G right arrow over right arrow over right arrow over right arrow over right arrow over right arrow over 1 where G right arrow over right arrow over right arrow over right arrow over m right arrow over and right arrow over are 2D vectors of the transverse coordinate in the object plane and the image plane respectively and m is the magnification factor. The term function as used herein relates to the Dirac delta function which is a mathematical construct representing an infinitely sharp peak bounding unit area expressed as x that has the value zero everywhere except at x 0 where its value is infinitely large in such a way that its total integral is 1. The function characterizes the perfect point to point relationship between the object plane and the image plane. If the image comes with a constant background as in this experiment the second order correlation function G right arrow over right arrow over in Eq. 1 must be composed of two parts right arrow over right arrow over right arrow over right arrow over 2 where Gis a constant. The value of Gdetermines the visibility of the image. One may immediately connect Eq. 2 with the Gfunction of thermal radiation 3 where GG Gis a constant and G right arrow over right arrow over represents a nonlocal position to position correlation. Although the second order correlation function Gis formally written in terms of Gs as shown in equation 3 the physics are completely different. As we know Gis usually measured by one photodetector representing the first order coherence of the field i.e. the ability of observing first order interference. Here in equation 3 Gmay be measured by independent photodetectors at distant space time points and represents a nonlocal EPR correlation.

When using a bucket detector the calculation of a Gghost image for each bucket detector over the set of all bucket detectors that comprise the low resolution target object detector is used as a basis. Each of the intermediate Gimages are summed into a final composite image of the target object Image 4 where indicates a summation operation. Similarly when using Compressive Sensing CS techniques the R term of Eq. 9 is computed for each bucket for an intermediate image and these intermediate images are then summed as show in Eq. 4 to produce a final image of the target object.

Typically ghost imaging uses two detectors one to observe the light source and the other single pixel or bucket detector to observe the light scattering and reflecting from the target object. 5 where denotes an ensemble average. As used herein and terminology bucket in general means a single pixel detector a detector comprising a plurality or grouping of pixels a low resolution imaging device a low resolution scanning detector or device or the like. The terminology I t means the measurements taken from a single pixel detector a detector comprising a plurality or grouping of pixels a low resolution imaging device a low resolution scanning detector or device or the like.

A relatively new mathematical field named Compressive Sensing CS or Compressive Imaging CI can be used to good effect within the context of Gimaging. The use of compressive techniques in the context of Ghost Imaging was performed by the Katz group see O. Katz et al. Compressive Ghost Imaging Appl. Phys. Lett. 95 131110 2009 hereby incorporated by reference who demonstrated a ghost like imaging proposal of Shapiro see J. Shapiro Computational Ghost Imaging Phys. Rev. A 78 061802 R 2008 hereby incorporated by reference .

The use of CS and Compressive Imaging CI herein is based on finding approximate solutions to the integral equations using the Gradient Projection for Sparse Reconstruction GPSR mathematical methodology where 6 and 7 is the object reflectance. The term J is a matrix where the rows are the illumination patterns at time k and the B vector 8 represents the bucket values. In cases where the system is underdetermined too few B then Lconstraints are applied to complete the system and sparseness is used 

The CS computational strategy takes advantage of the fact that it is normally true in images that not all pixels in an image contain new information and the system is said to be sparse on some basis since fewer degrees of freedom are needed to describe the system than the total number of pixels in the image. The parameter in Eq. 9 is often a constant.

The problem is then solvable using for example an L1 minimization as described further in Compressed Sensing IEEE Transactions on Information Theory Vol. 52 NO. 4 APRIL 2006 and Gradient Projection for Sparse Reconstruction Application to Compressed Sensing and Other Inverse Problems IEEE J. Sel. Top. in Sig. Proc. 1 586 2007. both of which are hereby incorporated by reference .

In another embodiment when illuminating light source comprises entangled photons in order to resolve the issue of multiple counts i.e. counts originating from background photons the following sequence is preformed 

providing a high speed time stamped series of low resolution frames of a given region of interest from the array of pixel locations 

providing a high speed time stamped series of high resolution images of a light source from the spatial detector 

the high speed time stamped frames being such that there is only one photon counted or measured on a pixel in both the low resolution frame and the high resolution frame per unit time if more than one pixel is counted the frame of pixels is discarded This is to ensure proper discrimination of entangled photons from background light. 

determining the value of each pixel at each location per unit time within each high resolution frame to form first arrays of pixel values 

determining the value of each pixel at each location per unit time within each low resolution frame to form a second array of pixel values 

Applications of the embodiments described herein improve the ability to image through obscuring media e.g. smoke or clouds which remains a problem in a variety of fields such as satellite imaging analysts firefighters drivers oceanographers astronomers military personnel and medical personnel. The embodiments described improve the ability to improve resolution in each of these exemplary instances and represents an opportunity to derive more information from images and presumably the decisions made from such images. By way of example improved resolution in x ray or endoscopy medical imagery facilitates lower radiation dosing and diagnosis of abnormal morphologies earlier than currently possible with conventional imaging methodologies. Conventional imaging techniques have to a large extent arrived at the theoretical limits of image resolution owing to wavelength limited resolution optical element distortions and the reflective interaction between photons and an object to be imaged.

As used herein the terminology Gtechnique means where you have two measurements where the actual image is the convolution of the object function right arrow over right arrow over right arrow over right arrow over where the Object function A is convolved with the correlations between two spatially distinct detections.

This application provides further improvements over the embodiments discussed in application Ser. No. 13 477 890. One key difference is that the improved embodiments provide a method to partition the values in the measured data sets i.e. frames into two or more groups for the high resolution frame data reference fields of the illuminating source and overall frame intensities bucket values or low resolution frame data of the region of interest. These groups are then used to compute products or cross correlations between the different groupings. These individual product terms can be mathematically combined via addition and or subtraction processes to generate improve images of the target or scene. This method further adapts the techniques presented in application Ser. No. 13 477 890. For example in application Ser. No. 13 477 890 each pixel of the low resolution image operated as a bucket measurement and intermediate improved images were computed for each low resolution pixel before being added together to provide a final improved image. Deviations of the high resolution reference images and the deviations of the low resolution pixels are operated with to compute intermediate improved images that are then summed to provide a final improved image of the subject. One key advantage to this method is that it is possible with the following embodiments to generate all positive valued images and largely eliminate background and noise effects. Other advantages include the ability to operate on a computed partitioned image using functions such as logarithms and exponentials to further increase contrast or better identify objects and information on their properties.

The following embodiments are predicated on the appreciation that other operations involving the partitioned sets of above average and below average measurements are beneficial to improve image quality in adverse conditions such as turbulence. These operations would include but are not limited to cross correlations between above average bucket overall frame intensities or above average low resolution frame data and below average reference fields. Typically four correlation types are available when data is partitioned into two distinct sets such as above the average and below the average values. In a non normalized form this can be written as

The data sets Iand Iare used in the preferred embodiments of the current invention as the deviations from the average or mean. I M where the M s indicate the measurement either an individual pixel value a low resolution pixel value or a bucket value and the indicates an average over the ensemble of the measurements.

The product terms that comprise a particular Rare computed conditionally. The Rcan be called conditional product terms. For instance Rmay be computed for the set of pixel values Ithat are above the mean for those pixels of data with low resolution pixel values Ithat are above the mean. For example 

The other combinations of above below mean high resolution pixel values and above below mean low resolution pixel values are computed similarly. These conditional Rmay then be added or subtracted from each other to yield improved images of a scene or target. Furthermore it should be noted that the particular combination of the Rbelow R R R R 11 

A second alterative embodiment may include computing a Gimproved image. This improved image is then partitioned into pixels that are for example above the spatial mean Gand pixels that are below the spatial mean G. These alternative positive negative Gpartitioned improved images can display higher contrast and can be further operated upon by using mathematical operations such as logarithms to increase the dynamic range. It is to be recognized that other partitions are possible to tailor results needed for specific applications.

A third embodiment may include computing a Rcorrelation image by calculating the correlation coefficient between the Iand Ipartitions where the Ia and Ib are not aligned in time or frame. For instance at a particular pixel i j there may be 10 frames in which that pixel is above the mean value of that pixel for all frames and there may only be 5 frames for which the Ivalues is above the mean of I. A correlation coefficient may be computed between these two sets of data using 

As an example for imaging measurements of pixel values and bucket values that have been grouped into two sets each of above and below their respective averages there is a total of 80 possible ways to present for output the results of the computed conditional product terms. For instance each conditional product term may be presented for display individually with either a positive or negative sign. Thus individually for the four conditional product terms there is a total of 8 ways to present them for display. Combinations of two conditional product terms with signs allows for 24 options to present for display combinations of three conditional product terms allows for 32 and combinations of all four conditional product terms allows for 16 ways to present for output and display.

Entanglement swapping is a quantum process by which particles that are not entangled become entangled with each other. For example consider that particles 1 P1 and 2 P2 are entangled with each other and that particles 3 P3 and 4 P4 are entangled with each other. To entangle P1 and P4 particles P2 and P3 are interfered on for example a beam splitter and then are measured. The interference and measurement swaps the entanglements P1 P2 and P3 P4 to P1 P4. Particles P2 and P3 are also affected by the measurement device and may be absorbed. The process of entanglement swapping has previously been verified. See e.g. Jian Wei Pan Dik Bouwmeester et al. Experimental Entanglement Swapping Entangling Photons That Never Interacted Physical Review Letters 80 3891 3894 May 1998 which described a process of entanglement swapping with experimental verification using entangled photons. Swapping may be considered as the teleportation of an unknown photon particle state onto another photon particle.

The process of entanglement swapping has many potential applications in the development of quantum technology. Thus far relatively few applications have found uses for entanglement swapping. Potential applications for entanglement swapping in quantum technology include quantum computing quantum communications and in the current invention quantum imaging. There are potentially many benefits to using entanglement swapping for quantum imaging that have not yet been described or exploited. The reason for this is that entanglement swapping has required high precision in its implementation and great expense for equipment that achieves the high precision. The lack of robust applications for entanglement swapping has been another drawback to its implementation in technology. This technology is being miniaturized in solid state devices and some components are being tested on chips. These quantum chips can generated entangled particles and perform interference operations and measurements of quantum states.

It would be beneficial to have an entanglement swapping application that is robust and can be implemented with both available and evolving technologies. One way to make entanglement swapping useful would be to apply it information transfer sharing or communication without the need for a classical communications channel. For example the current Internet radio and telephone are generally considered to be classical communications channels. Another way to make entanglement swapping useful would be to be able to transfer share or communicate by quantum means without the sender or receiver needing access to information or resources held by the other. For example the sender having access to photons P2 P3 and the receiver having access to photons P1 P4 is sufficient to transfer information from sender to receiver. Repetition of this process allows the transfer of images without sending classical information and by only sharing entanglement. This type of communication of information such as data and or images would be difficult to detect by an external observer since there would be no particle or radiation going between the sender and the receiver which an observer would be able to sense and follow. Military and domestic applications requiring stealth and or security would benefit from this capability. Experiments by the inventors have verified the working principles. The experiments started with entangled pairs of photons configured as described in . Photon pairs equivalent to the first set of entangled photon pairs transmitted photons of were manipulated to enable and disable a swapping of entanglement to the second set of entangled photons pairs and the effects of that manipulation were measured with the coincidence detection of the second set of entangled photon pairs. The second set of entangled photon pair coincidence measurements were reduced when the entanglement swapping was disabled with the first set of entangled photon pairs and the second set of entangled photon pair coincidence measurements increased when entanglement swapping was enabled with the first set of entangled photon pairs.

Benefits of entanglement swapping for quantum imaging may include performing an entanglement swap to optimize photon detection efficiency while simultaneously optimizing transmission properties from an illumination source to a target. Another benefit is that an entanglement swap may be used to measure absorption maps of a target without the need to measure reflected photons. Furthermore entanglement swapping may be used to help compute the product of the absorption values at two locations on a target.

Using the environment to enable entanglement swapping provides a direct and remote measurement on the environment. For example absorption of photons by a remote target can be sensed by the enabling of quantum swapping of entangled particles which can be measured remotely without need for the return of photons from the target. It should be noted that besides images of absorption fields of targets any property can be imaged by enabling quantum swapping when the quantum particle is sensitive to the effects of object. Furthermore with time sequencing this provides range information from for example the source of entangled quantum particles to target features. It should be further realized that the source or sources of the entangled quantum particles need not be located with the equipment used to direct particles towards a target sender or located with the equipment that measured those entangled particles that never directly interacted with the target receiver . For example the source or sources of the entangled particles may be on a satellite that would send the entangled particle pairs to the sender equipment and receiver equipment. Alternately both the sender and receiver may have a single entangled quantum particle source and each shares one particle of their entangled particle pairs with the other. The identification of which particles are entangled with each other relative to initial entangled pair creation times may be achieved using an auxiliary time stamp e.g. a laser pulse encoded with time information for each entangled photon pair created that propagates with each particle of each entangled particle pair. Also the use of an entanglement source such as the one described in does not have an issue or question as to the identification of which particles are entangled as there is only a single source that sequentially generates entangled particles. Although not obvious we consider it possible to use thermal light photon number fluctuations and their correlations and quantum illumination for variations of teleportation and swapping in our current inventions with swapping.

Further benefits of entanglement swapping applied to quantum imaging using measurements of reflected photons may include application to quantum imaging of remote targets and microscopy with the images being generated for the user at a distant location with entangled photons that did not interact directly with the target. The reflected photons may be further used to compute the product of reflectance or the product of reflected intensities of at least two locations on the target. Current imaging systems such as cameras are dependent on producing imaging using photons that have directly interacted with the target. The sharing of images taken by a camera normally requires communication by electromagnetic radiation that takes specific paths to communicate a facsimile of the image between sender and receiver. Even quantum teleportation requires a classical communication channel using electromagnetic radiation that takes specific paths to communicate. It would be beneficial to use entanglement swapping to communicate images or quantum images that does not require a classical communications channel to complete the transfer of images between a sender and a distant user at the receiver in order to avoid having the classical communications channel blocked which would also block image communication. Communication information transfer using entanglement swapping would be an entirely quantum process. The speed of quantum information has been recently been reported as being greater than or equal to 1.37 10times the speed of light See el Yin et al. Lower Bound on the Speed of Nonlocal Correlations without Locality and Measurement Choice Loopholes Physical Review Letters 110 260407 June 2013. The benefits of utilizing swapping in the process of quantum communications is that communications would be at the speed of the quantum information even if it is faster than the speed of light which can be beneficial for many applications.

Imaging of a scene or subject is typically accomplished by mapping an illuminated scene or subject onto an image sensor where there is a light measurement component such as film CCD or other sensing device. Light consists of a plurality of photons that may be measured. The illuminating light may be from one or more light sources either natural or artificial or both. Common sources of light include for example the sun coherent incoherent or partially coherent light entangled photons infrared radiation emitted by atoms and molecules accelerating charges lasers light bulbs light emitting diodes LEDs chaotic laser light pseudo thermal light generated by passing laser light through a rotating ground glass or other scattering material stars moons clouds planets space objects fluorescent lamps electrical discharges plasmas bio luminescence and stimulated emission. Although it is not absolutely necessary a lens is often used to perform this mapping. Imaging is often susceptible to adverse affects such as obscuration turbulence low signal to noise ratio such as when operating in low light conditions jitter and noise. Often this type of imaging is referred to as First Order imaging due to the time ensemble or mixed time ensemble averaging of the sensors involved. For instance a first order light intensity image I x y t can be produced by light interacting with a sensor for some time t i.e. shutter or integration time. A single instance of this may be referred to as a frame . Multiple frames of images I x y t may be averaged over some or all of the frames in a sequence of frames to generate an averaged first order image of the subject where indicates an ensemble average. A second order image involves averages of products of two first order intensity or normalized intensity measurements. An enhanced image results from the subtraction of products of averages of first order intensities from the average of the product of the intensities. An intensity or normalized intensity can be decomposed into a mean plus a deviation from the mean or average I .

The terms Iand Iare intensities or normalized intensities measured by sensors 1 and 2 I Iand I Iwith Iand Ibeing functions of space and time i.e. x y t is the ensemble average of intensity or normalized measurements of sensor 1 and Iis the deviation from the mean for the intensity or normalized intensity measurements of sensor 1. is the ensemble average of intensity or normalized measurements of sensor 2 and Iis the deviation from the mean for the intensity or normalized intensity measurements of sensor 2. The deviation is often called a fluctuation.

There is a trend in modern imaging devices i.e. cameras to provide more measured quantum properties at each pixel. Thus the measurements may include measurements such as wavelength color or derived color mappings such as RGB CMY CMYK etc. polarization Stokes parameters spatial modes orbital angular momentum OAM spin etc. For example a color camera may provide separate wavelength measurements red R green G and blue B measurement values at each pixel the polarization Stokes parameters at each pixel and modern infrared IR cameras can provide measurements of long wave infrared LWIR and mid wave infrared MWIR measurement values at each pixel of the imaging device or combinations of these measurements. In the current invention at least one of the available measured quantities is selected to provide the frame data for the generation of the improved image of the region of interest.

It is to be appreciated that measurements of quantities such as wavelength and polarization are typically dependent on the responsiveness of the measurement device to the quantity being measured. As an example color cameras typically use band pass filters arranged in a pattern over the pixels of the measurement device. These filters are usually labeled Red Green and Blue R G and B . The wavelengths that each of the R G B filters pass is centered at a particular wavelength and also passes nearby wavelengths with wavelengths being more distant from the center wavelength being more highly attenuated. This effect is referred to as the bandwidth of the filter. Polarization filters have similar bandwidths with respect to the orientation of the filter. The responsiveness to wavelength polarization etc. of an element on a measurement may also be adjusted by applying for example larger or smaller voltages to increase or decrease the degree to which each element pixel reacts to the wavelength or polarization of light that interacts with that pixel.

The invention can be used with measurements of quantum particles. There are many quantum particles including but not limited to photons electrons neutrons protons atoms ions mesons and positrons. Photons mesons neutral atoms or molecules are bosons. Fermions include quantum particles such as electrons ionized atoms and ionized molecules sometimes referred to as ions.

The invention can be used to generate improved images through a variety of gaseous solid or liquid media or mixtures of these that are at least partially transparent to quantum particles. These media may include but are not limited to for instance glasses diamond silicon water and air. As an example images captured with an underwater camera can be used as input for the inventive process for enhancement as well as images taken through say an air water interface such as an imaging system on a boat looking down into the water or a submerged imaging looking into the air above the water.

As used in the following the terminology photon light source means or is defined to include thermal photon light partially coherent and entangled photon light. As used in the following the terminology media means or is defined to include vacuum air water turbid fluids turbulence fluids soft tissues and partially transmissive solids.

As used herein the terminology subject or object or target may include a photograph a thing a person animate or inanimate subject a plurality of objects the ground ground covering e.g. grass a localized piece or pieces of the environment surface physical entity or entities or anything that can be observed.

As used herein the terminology second order is defined as follows. A second order image involves averages of products of two first order intensity or normalized intensity measurements. Imaging of a scene or subject is typically accomplished by mapping an illuminated scene or subject onto an image sensor where there is a light measurement component such as film CCD or other sensing device.

A second order image involves averages of products of two first order intensity or normalized intensity measurements. An enhanced image results from the subtraction of products of averages of first order intensities from the average of the product of the intensities. An intensity or normalized intensity can be decomposed into a mean plus a deviation from the mean or average.

I Iand I Iwith Iand Ibeing functions of space and time i.e. x y t. Where Iand Iare intensities or normalized intensities measured by sensors 1 and 2. is the ensemble average of intensity or normalized measurements of sensor 1 and Iis the deviation from the mean for the intensity or normalized intensity measurements of sensor 1. is the ensemble average of intensity or normalized measurements of sensor 2 and Iis the deviation from the mean for the intensity or normalized intensity measurements of sensor 2. The deviation is often called a fluctuation. Mathematically the second order enhanced image can be represented by I I I . Simplifying this expression yields . Similarly

The terminology at least second order means an enhanced image contained in or or where N is an integer and where Irepresents an image utilizing a third sensor and Irepresents an image utilizing the nth sensor.
