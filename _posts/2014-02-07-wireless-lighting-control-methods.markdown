The present invention relates generally to the field of lighting and more particularly to control processes for individual or simultaneous adjustment automation and programming of an individual or network of such light bulbs through a wireless interface.

In response to government mandates new lighting technologies such as light emitting diodes LEDs or compact fluorescent lamps CFLs are entering the market at a rapid pace. However these bulbs have limitations that make them unattractive to some users. CFLs have dimming limitations take a few minutes to warm up and have problems with their color output. Additionally CFLs contain mercury a toxic and regulated substance which creates issues with disposal. LEDs are currently very expensive in comparison and the high cost has dissuaded many consumers from their purchase.

Additionally current lighting control and automation solutions are limited in their use in rental or temporary situations where the systems high price required installation and expertise in set up are a problem. Further as mobile computing systems continue to evolve many people have shown a preference towards using their mobile device as a converged platform to control and execute multiple other tasks. Although a multitude of types of light types and luminaires have been created to help create a mood or environment most if not all of these solutions only exist in a single state and are limited by the network power line. This has driven the complexity in bulb wattage fixtures wall switches shades and other attempts at creating the ability to augment the atmosphere created by a light. If you want to dim one bulb current solutions generally only allow for a wall switch dimmer. The ability to address and adjust a single light individually or network of lights simultaneously is currently not possible without extensive installation.

The communication means for to execute these processes can be seen in the mesh network section.

Now referring to a block diagram of a lighting device in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown. The lighting device II Device might take numerous forms or embodiments in design but certain components are common to the various designs while others will be used as is necessary for a specific embodiment. These components may or may not be part of II Device and might be arranged in different fashion and with slight alteration to create different intelligent illuminating embodiments. For example the II Device includes a DC DC power converter a controller processor electrically connected to the DC DC power converter a light emitting diode LED current control circuit communicably coupled to the controller processor and electrically connected to the DC DC power converter and two or more LEDs electrically connected to the LED current control circuit . The LED current control circuit can be a PWM driver switching or multiplexer circuit or light emitting diodes LEDs driver s circuit.

As will be explained in more detail below a method for controlling one or more lighting devices includes the steps of providing the one or more lighting devices sending one or more control signals from the controller processor to the LED current control circuit corresponding to a blended light having a specified color and sending an on off signal having a cycle time from the LED current control circuit to each LED in response to the one or more control signals such that the two or more LEDs produce the blended light having the specified color based on how long each LED is turned ON and or OFF during the cycle time. The LED current control circuit provides an on off signal having a cycle time to each LED in response to one or more control signals received from the controller processor such that the two or more LEDs produce a blended light having a specified color based on how long each LED is turned ON and or OFF during the cycle time.

For example a main circuit board may include the DC DC power converter the controller processor the LED current control circuit the memory the real time clock circuit and the wireless transceiver circuit and antenna . A sensor board may include the hard reset circuit and the ambient light sensor circuit . A LED board may include the two or more LEDs and additional LED related circuitry e.g. LED arms .

The connector performs at least one of two functions. One it can physically connect the II Device to a surface and two it can provide access to a power source. The connector could fasten to a standard surface light socket or electrical socket or combination of the like. Similarly the connector could provide a connection to a power source as an Edison base multiple sizes Plug in Bi pin or Battery connected connection including water activated battery etc. The connector would conduct the electrical current through to the AC to DC converter . In some embodiments such as the Intelligent Illuminating Strip II Strip or Smartstrip the fastener and power connection means of the connector might be separated. For example an electrical plug is connected via a wire to the rest of the Smartstrip and the Smartstrip is fastened in some other manner such as screws or adhesive to a surface. In other embodiments such as the Intelligent Illuminating Bulb II Bulb the connector would be an Edison base or bi pin for which when the connector is inserted into the appropriate light socket the connector would provide appropriate contact to extend the AC or DC power source or supply into the body of the II Bulb . In addition the connector might provide some structural stability in fastening the II Device to a surface.

The AC to DC converter receives power from the connector and outputs the appropriate DC power to the DC DC converter the LED current controlling circuit and LED circuit . Note that a single AC to DC converter can be used in place of the combination of the AC to DC converter and the DC DC converter . The exact power input might vary depending on country specific standards or power sources but as a universal converter the power output will always be DC voltage such as 12 VDC or 18 VDC or 24 VDC. Examples of power inputs include AC power 60V 290V 45 65 Hz or Examples 230 VAC 50 Hz European Indian Standard 110 VAC 60 Hz US Standard or a range of DC power from 12 VDC to 1000 VDC. The AC to DC converter might be housed within the connector or separate from the connector depending on the specific II Device embodiment.

The DC DC converter s receives a power input from the AC DC converter it then converts that power to DC power s required for driving the internal components modules of the II Device . These components include the controller processor memory the real time clock RTC circuit the wireless transceiver circuit antenna and possibly components within the LED current control circuit . It might also supply power to other components such as the hard reset circuit the ambient light sensor circuit and other potential added circuits. There might be multiple converters dependent on the output DC voltages required by different component requirements. Similarly the power output would very dependent on the exact component requirements for example the output might be 5 VDC 3.3 VDC or 1.3 VDC.

The controller processor processes signals received from the memory the real time clock RTC circuit and the wireless transceiver circuit . It might also process signals from other components such as the hard reset circuit the ambient light sensor circuit and other potential added circuits. It also takes action and sends commands to the memory the real time clock RTC circuit and the wireless transceiver circuit . It might also take action and send signals to other components such as the ambient light sensor circuit and other potential added circuits. In one embodiment the computer processor includes a real time clock processor and memory chip.

The processor processes the signals received by the various other components of the embodiment computes necessary actions and sends signals back out to various other components of the embodiment. The processor will vary in terms of power speed and size in different embodiments. Additionally the processor is not limited to the contents listed above and may include other components.

The memory stores data from factory defined settings and from user defined settings. The controller processor will read write data in memory . Data might include factory defined settings such as communication protocols identification and security protocols and other data. Data might also include user defined settings such as user profiles default commands programs and other data. The memory could be inside the processor and or external to the processor as a different integrated circuit or chip s . The controller processor and memory circuits might take a number of different technical specifications. In one embodiment the processor includes a real time clock processor and memory chip. The memory receives information from the processor and stores the commands for retrieval by the processor .

The real time clock circuit includes a battery and a date and time clock based RTC. The controller processor will set the date and time data in the RTC and also read the date and time data from the RTC . The RTC could be internal to the controller processor or it could be an external circuit with respect to the controller processor . The RTC will run on the DC DC power unless no power is provided in which case it will run on the battery included within the real time clock circuit . The battery could be a rechargeable battery in which case the DC DC power when supplied would also charge the rechargeable battery through recharging circuitry. The battery could also be a non chargeable battery. In one embodiment the processor includes a real time clock processor and memory chip. The real time clock is battery powered and could be set for any time and date.

The wireless transceiver circuit allows the II Device to communicate with other wireless devices and or other II Devices. The wireless transceiver circuit includes a transmitter and receiver circuit based on established wireless protocols. These protocols could differ based on different II Device embodiments and changing wireless communication standards. Example wireless protocols include but are not limited to Bluetooth ZigBee Wi Fi and their related variants. The wireless transceiver circuit will be connected to the controller processor and the antenna . In one embodiment the wireless transceiver circuit is composed of a transmitter and receiver circuit based on Bluetooth protocols. In other embodiments the wireless transceiver circuit might utilize other protocols including but not limited to ZigBee WiFi infrared WiMax LTE ZWave or other protocols not listed. In other embodiments the wireless transceiver circuit might include other component parts or circuitry.

The antenna captures wireless communication signals and passes them to the wireless transceiver circuit to decode those signals. The antenna could take multiple forms depending on the protocol and signal frequency required. The physical location of the antenna and or wireless transceiver circuit could be placed in multiple physical locations related to the II Device . For example it might be placed outside of the II Device or inside the II Device . Placing it outside might increase the range of wireless communication for the II Device especially when installed in locations with poor reception. Alternatively the antenna might be built into the physical structure of the II Device or be part of the main board inside the II Device .

In some embodiments the hard reset circuit of the II Device includes a button or switch mechanism and related circuitry. The button or switch would be connected to the controller processor either directly on the same board or through a wired connection. When the button or switch is activated it will send a specific signal to the controller processor to execute the hard reset program for that II Device . The actual button or switch mechanism might be different dependent on the II Device and its application. As example the reset circuit might be a simple resistant button type switch it might be a rotational type switch or it might be a conductive type switch it might be a compression switch based on pushing in some part of the mechanical structure. The location of the hard reset circuit might be co located with other external components such as the ambient light sensor LEDs diffuser housing or other II Device components or structural parts. In this sense the physical location with respect to the II Device might vary. The hard reset function in most embodiments will require access to the DC DC power and thus the II Device would need to be connected to an active power source. In some embodiments though the hard reset circuit would have access to a separate power source such as a battery to provide the controller and related circuitry enough power to execute the hard reset command.

In some embodiments the II Device might have an ambient light sensor circuit . The ambient light sensor circuit consists of one or more ambient light sensors photosensor or similar light detecting component and supporting circuit. The ambient light sensor s in the ambient light sensor circuit detects a level of captured ambient light converts that level into an analog signal and sends that data to the controller processor via an analog to digital A D converter that could be a part of the ambient light sensor circuit or controller processor . The ambient light sensor circuit would consist of one or more ambient light sensors per one or multiple II Devices. In some embodiments the ambient light sensor circuit could be embedded in the II Device itself and in others it might be a separate peripheral device to the wireless lighting control system. Additionally the placement of the sensor s and related circuitry need not be exactly collocated but possibly separated by a wire.

For example the light sensor s could be placed in multiple locations in relation to the II Device a placement of sensor requires external light to reach the light sensor b the sensor s could be placed on the exterior of the light on the housing c the sensor s could be at the end of an extension or wire protruding or d the sensor s could be part of an external peripheral to the light connected via wireless communication e.g. the sensor could be housed with other electronic components such as a processor communication source Bluetooth module Zigbee Wi Fi or other . There could also be multiple types of II Device sensors used a one which senses a range of overall luminosity b one that senses a combination of red green and blue components or cyan yellow magenta or black components or hue saturation and lumens components of the light on it or c in different scenarios the light measured could be in absolute or respective values. The ambient light sensor can be located to detect an ambient light and a light emitted by the II Device such that the controller processor adjusts one or more of the on off signals provided to the LEDs .

LEDs refer to a combination of LEDs or LED arms that are illuminated depending on current passed through from the LED current control circuit . The combination of LED arms or LEDs could be of various types and various colors dependent on the II Device embodiment. For example the LEDs might vary in color such as red green blue and or white LEDs. The LEDs might also vary in their maximum output luminosity. The combination of illuminations of these LEDs could produce various levels of brightness and or color.

The LED current control circuit executes commands from the controller processor to control the current passed through the LEDs . The LED current control circuit might take different forms dependent on the II Device embodiment as per the following schemes solely LED drivers scheme switches and LED driver scheme multiplexer and LED driver scheme and current limiting circuit scheme . In general the controller processor sends commands to LED drivers or or switches or multiplexer or which in turn controls the light output by controlling the average current passed through the LEDs . The average current would affect the overall luminosity of the II Device such as that at lower average currents passed through the LED driver then the II Device would be dimmer.

For embodiments where multiple LED arms and are present unique to the presented schemes is a method to maximize the potential current passed through and subsequent luminosity of each LED arm with limited available current from the AC DC converter . This is done by controlling the current passed through by the LED driver or or so that only one LED driver or or or or or can pass through current at a time. This allows each on off signal to provide a maximum current supplied by the DC DC power converter to the LED . By varying and alternating very short lengths of time that current is passed through different LED arms using LED current control circuit the schemes also allow the multiple LED arms to produce an overall blended light that is capable of various colors saturation and brightness. These schemes allow the II Device to provide the highest level of individual luminosity emitted related to one of the LED arms such as white red blue or green while also allowing for all combinations of color brightness and saturation to be achievable.

In other words the specified color is produced by turning ON the first color LED for a first portion of the cycle time and turning ON the second color LED for a second portion of the cycle time. The two or more LEDs are not turned ON at the same time. The cycle time is preferably short enough such that a user will not notice any flicker which is usually around 85 Hz about 12 ms unless flicker is desired. The on off signal for the first LED includes two or more pulses during a portion of the cycle time that the first LED is turned ON. Likewise the on off signal for the second LED includes two or more pulses during a portion of the cycle time that the second LED is turned ON. The on off signals can be adjusted to provide a specified color saturation and brightness or intensity. The specified brightness or intensity can be determined by a duty cycle of the on off signals.

In one embodiment the light generator is composed of LEDs LED Drivers and a light enhancement cover. The LEDs are of various types and colors. The LED Drivers are the circuitry that drives the LEDs. The LED Drivers take the commands from the processor for turning required LEDs at required brightness or intensity.

One potential scheme for the LED current control circuit is the solely LED drivers scheme . In this scheme the controller processor would send one or multiple Pulse Width Modulation PWM Signals to one or many LED drivers which would control the current flowing through an associated LED arm respectively . There would be the same number of PWM signals sent as there would be LED drivers and LED arms . The total number of LEDs strings arms and LED drivers depend upon the application. LED driver circuit is designed for a particular current level to pass through it so the LED driver circuit will regulate the flow of current through the respective LED arm to the set current level whenever the controller provides a high level signal to it. PWM consists of high and low signals at a fixed frequency. One could change the duration of high and low signals in a given time frame defined as time period 1 frequency . Considering the controller sends one PWM signal to one LED driver to control the average current through one associated LED arm. Varying the duty cycle of the PWM signal changes the average current flowing through the LED driver to the LED arm. The average current affects the overall luminosity of the II Device such as lower average currents pass through the LED driver then the II Device would be dimmer i.e. lowering the average currents passed through the LED driver dims the light produced by the II Device .

LEDs refer to a combination of LEDs or LED arms that are illuminated depending on current passed through from the LED current control circuit . The combination of LED arms or LEDs could be of various types and various colors dependent on the II Device embodiment. For example the LEDs might vary in color such as red green blue and or white LEDs. The LEDs might also vary in their maximum output luminosity. The combination of illuminations of these LEDs could produce various levels of brightness and or color.

The heat sink and related components and parts may be required in some embodiments of the II Device . The heat sink and related components dissipate the heat generated by the LEDs and LED current control circuit . The heat sink could take multiple sizes shapes and materials dependent on the II Device embodiment. Related components refers to the housing and outer structure of the II Device . These materials and arrangement might of course differ depending on the particular II Device embodiment.

The light reflector is used to amplify or focus the illumination generated by the LEDs . The light reflector could be made of different reflective materials and come in different sizes dependent on the specific variation and application of the II Device . The light reflector would be placed behind and or around the LEDs most likely at an arc so that the illumination of the LEDs is reflected focused and amplified through the diffuser . The exact placement angle and arc of the light reflector would vary dependent on the variation and application of different II Devices.

The diffuser is a part of the II Device that spreads and or mixes the illumination produced by the LEDs . The diffuser could be made of different materials and come in different sizes dependent on the specific variation and application of the II Device . Common material might be glass plastics or fiber. The diffuser would be placed over the LEDs so that the illumination passes through the diffuser . The exact placement angle and arc of the diffuser related to the LEDs would vary dependent on the variation and application of different II Devices.

The II Device might take other common embodiments not fully described in this disclosure but not limited to the following a an II Device integrated into a lighting fixture e.g. could be installed fixture with all II Device circuitries built in or non installed fixture such as a plug in lamp b an II Device integrated into a fan e.g. could be installed fixture with all II Device circuitries built in c an II Device that is solely battery powered and affixed to a surface d an II Device utilizing OLEDs as LEDs e an II Device integrated into directly into surfaces walls tables and ceilings clothing appliances electronics Displays music equipment etc. musical instruments pianos guitars etc. and taking power from some source either internally or externally to that integrated part or f an II Device specifically designed for emergency lighting. Considering the control of the II Device the invention herein provides processes and methods to wirelessly control and or program one or many II Devices through one or many wireless devices. These processes and methods shown and described provide maximum utility and range with a given communication protocol and a reliable and efficient system.

As previously mentioned the II Device could be modular i.e. different parts of the II Device as separated by a dashed dot lines A B C D E and F could be detachable from a manufacturing or consumer standpoint . Certain parts or modules of the II Device could be interchangeable with other types of the same module. As example consider an II Device that has different connector modules plug in vs. Edison base yet the rest of the modules are the same. The modules could be connected together through connectors that a user could separate or place back together. The modules might also be structurally fixed together so that disassembly is required to disconnect the modules. Additionally modules within the II Device could be separated physically from each other yet connected electronically in some fashion. There could be different levels of modularity or no modularity at all depending on the specific II Device embodiment.

Given the standard parts and connections of the II Device there could be numerous potential II Device embodiments with differing arrangements combinations or expressions of the components disclosed. Some of these embodiments characteristics and methods will be described below.

Referring now to a circuit diagram of a single LED arm with single LED s in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown. The LED arm is electrically connected to the power supply and the LED driver . The power supply and LED driver are also connected to the ground or negative terminal of the power supply . In certain embodiments the controller processor might send multiple PWM signals to multiple LED drivers to control the current passed through to multiple LED arms . In these cases the LED current control circuit would allow to similarly change the overall brightness or luminosity of the II Device but also adjust the color and or saturation of the light emitted from the II Device . In this latter case of controlling color and saturation the LED arms would need to be of different colors that could create different colors when mixed at different levels. The LED arm can have warm yellow or other colors types of LEDs .

Now referring to a circuit diagram of a solely LED Drivers scheme in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown. For illustrative purposes consider here four PWM signals sent from the controller annotated as PWM1 PWM2 PWM3 and PWM4 and four associated LED drivers annotated as LED Driver1 LED Driver2 LED Driver3 and LED Driver4 . In addition consider four LED arms LED arm1 with red LEDs LED arm2 with green LEDs LED arm3 with blue LEDs and LED arm4 with white LEDs . Based on established color mixing principals the variation in the luminosity of these four colors could produce all color combinations. To achieve this variation the controller could vary and alternate the length of time that the PWM signals are sent to the LED drivers . This would create variations in lengths of time when the LED drivers would receive PWM signals . The length of time would also allow for a similar control in the overall brightness of the luminosity produced by the II Device in addition to the control provided by variations of the duty cycle of the PWM signal itself.

Similarly variations in the length of time that the controller would alternatively send each PWM signal to the respective LED driver which would control the current passed through to the respective LED arm would also provide for a combinatory control of the average luminosity produced by each LED arm and thus allow for control of color and saturation of the light produced. The frequency of PWM signals and the rate at which LED drivers receive the PWM signals from controller processor will be high enough still within the LEDs and LED Drivers technical specifications so that due to the persistence of vision consumers would see a constant light output for example a yellow light instead of fast switching alternate red and green light outputs. The scheme in alternating PWM signals does not allow for simultaneous PWM signals executed by the LED driver at the same time. This maximizes the potential average current passed through LEDs arms and subsequent luminosity of each LED arm considering limited available current from the AC DC converter . It allows for each LED arm to receive the full power provided by the AC DC converter and regulated by the LED driver such that when it is on all the available current could be sent through to the one LED arm.

To further illustrate these concepts below is an example of how the solely LED driver scheme might work. Consider the frequency of PWM signal is 2 KHz or total time period for one signal one high and one low KHz 0.5 ms. Consider the duty cycle of each PWM1 and PWM2 is the same. The higher the duty cycle the brighter the overall luminosity would be and vice versa. Each LED driver is designed for a particular current level i.e. when LED driver or or or is ON when they get high signal from the controller the current passing through the LED driver would be the lesser value of either the designed particular current level or the maximum current that power supply can provide. Assume that the luminosity created per unit of average current is the same for both the red LED arm and the green LED arm . If in 4 ms cycles the controller turns on the PWM1 and turns off PWM2 every first 2 ms and then turns off PWM1 and turns on PWM2 for the next 2 ms with PWM3 and PWM4 are off continuously then the overall light output would be yellow mixture of Red and Green color light each with same luminosity .

Referring now to a timing diagram for the solely LED drivers scheme of is shown. The clock signal has a 0.5 ms cycle time. To produce a type of orange light which consists of 70 red and 30 Green light mixed together PWM1 LED Driver1 should be ON for 70 of the cycle time here 70 of 4 ms 2.8 ms and PWM2 LED Driver2 should be ON for remaining 30 of the cycle time here 30 of 4 ms 1.2 ms . Similarly to produce brighter shade of orange light which may consist of 50 RED 20 Green and 20 White light together PWM1 LED Driver1 should be ON for 50 of the cycle time here 50 of 4 ms 2 ms PWM2 LED Driver2 should be ON for 20 of the cycle time here 20 of 4 ms 0.8 ms PWM3 LED Driver3 should be ON for 0 of the cycle time here 0 of 4 ms 0 ms PWM4 LED Driver4 should be ON for 20 of the cycle time here 20 of 4 ms 0.8 ms and all PWM LED Drivers should be OFF for the remaining 10 of cycle time here 10 of 4 ms 0.4 ms .

In a similar way by varying PWM signal duty cycle for four LEDs Drivers and for a given PWM ON OFF time cycle 4 ms in an example above II Device could produce any color with different shades. When duty cycle is 100 i.e. 100 ON and 0 OFF the PWM LED Driver1 and PWM LED Driver2 are ON for 2 ms alternately every PWM ON OFF cycle of 4 ms II Device will produce highest possible 100 luminosity for the Yellow light. Thus the output luminosity can be varied by varying duty cycle of the PWM signals to LED drivers providing dimming feature to II Device .

The algorithm program in the controller is such that at a time only one LED Driver here or or or is given a PWM signal. This particular scheme is more useful when power supply has limited current output capability. With such algorithm one could achieve maximum luminosity for any color possible. For example let s assume a power supply is rated at a maximum 15V 1 A output and all LEDs have rating of 1 A and LED drivers are designed for 1 A current. To achieve 100 luminosity output from RED LEDs one has to pass 1 A current through RED LEDs Arm continuously. In this case LED Driver1 only will be given PWM signal for entire 4 ms of the PWM cycle and that too at 100 duty cycle. As against in other design if all four LED drivers are designed for th of the possible supply of current i.e. 1 A 0.25 A maximum current will never exceed 0.25 A through any LED arm and will thus limit the output luminosity of that particular LED arm.

The algorithm Program makes sure that only one LED Driver or or or has its PWM signal ON at a time. To produce colors program gives turns ON PWM signals to LED drivers in a serial manner i.e. alternately fast enough so that due to persistence of vision consumer sees the output light as a single defined color instead of flickering Red Green Blue or White lights.

Now referring to a circuit diagram of switches and and LED driver scheme in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown. In this scheme the controller processor would send a Pulse Width Modulation PWM signal to one LED driver which would control the average current flowing through it. In addition there would be a switch for every LED arm between the LED driver and each LED arm and . The controller is connected to each switch and and can send an on off signal for each. Considering an embodiment with four LED arms and subsequently four switches the controller would send a signal to control Switch1 Switch2 Switch3 and Switch4 while also sending a PWM signal to the LED driver to allow current to pass through to the switches . Variation in the average current passing through the LED driver controlled by variations in the PWM sent by the controller would increase or decrease the average current passing through to the subsequent LED arms thus controlling the overall brightness of the LEDs. The switches turning on or off would be able to create different colors and saturation produced by the light. When a switch and gets high signal from the controller it provides path for current to flow from LEDs in LEDs arms to LED driver .

Considering the embodiment contains red green blue and white LED arms and respectively based on established color mixing principals the variation in the luminosity of these four colors could produce all color combinations. To achieve this variation the controller could vary and alternate the length of time that the switches are turned on. This would create variations in lengths of time when the LED driver would pass through current to the LED arms and thus create variations in lengths of time when the LEDs produce light. The length of time would also allow for a similar control in the overall brightness of the luminosity produced by the II Device in addition to the control provided by variations of the duty cycle of the PWM signal itself.

Similarly variations in the length of time that the controller would alternatively send each switch which would control the current passed through from the LED arms to the LED driver would also provide for a combinatory control of the average luminosity produced by each LED arm and thus allow for control of color and saturation of the light produced. The frequency of switch signals will be high enough still within the LEDs and LED Driver s technical specifications so that due to the persistence of vision consumers would see a constant light output for example a yellow light instead of fast switching alternate red and green light outputs.

The scheme in alternating switch signals does not allow for simultaneous switches being on at the same time. This maximizes the potential average current passed through and subsequent luminosity of each LED arm and considering limited available current from the AC DC converter in the power supply . It allows for each LED arm or or or to receive the full power provided by the AC DC converter and regulated by the LED driver such that when it is on all the available current could be sent through to the one LED arm or or or .

To further clarify the scheme consider the following example. A yellow light with no white light added into it can be produced by the controller turning Switch 1 ON and Switch 2 OFF and then Switch 1 OFF and Switch 2 ON continuously at the same frequency fast enough so that due to the persistence of vision consumer sees it as a yellow light output instead of alternate Red and Green light output. LED driver circuit can be designed for a particular current level i.e. it will regulate the flow of current through it to the set current level whenever the controller provides a high signal to it. PWM Pulse Width Modulation consists of high and low signals at a fixed frequency. One could change the duration of high and low signals in a given particular time defined as time period 1 frequency .

An example of how this circuitry works will now be described. Assumptions 1 frequency of PWM set is 2 KHz i.e. total time period for one signal one high and one low KHz 0.5 ms 2 frequency at which switches are turned ON and OFF 250 Hz i.e. total time period for switch to turn ON and OFF 1 250 Hz 4 ms and 3 LED driver is designed for 1 A current i.e. when any switch and LED driver is ON when they get high signal from the controller current passing through it is 1 A or maximum current that power supply can provide whichever is less. The user wants a Yellow light output at half the maximum luminosity possible for which Red and Green LEDs should be illuminated equally by sending same amount of average current through them. Also for half the luminosity the average current passing through RED LEDs arm and Green LEDs arm should be half the maximum average current possible. This is achievable by turning Switches ON OFF and setting PWM as in the timing diagram below. The power supply can provide maximum current of 1 A for any LED arm and at a time.

Switching frequency of 250 Hz cycle of 4 ms When Switch1 is ON Switch2 is OFF letting current flow through only one arm at a time. Also time for which Switch1 is ON and time for which Switch2 is ON are equal thus producing Yellow light as required. However to produce a type of orange light which consists of 70 Red and 30 Green light together SIG1 Switch1 should be ON for 70 of the cycle time here 70 of 4 ms 2.8 ms and SIG2 Switch2 should be ON for remaining 30 of the cycle time here 30 of 4 ms 1.2 ms . Similarly to produce brighter shade of orange light which consists of 50 RED 20 Green and 20 White light together SIG1 Switch1 should be ON for 50 of the cycle time here 50 of 4 ms 2 ms SIG2 Switch2 should be ON for 20 of the cycle time here 20 of 4 ms 0.8 ms SIG4 Switch4 should be ON for 20 of the cycle time here 20 of 4 ms 0.8 ms and all switches are off for the remaining 10 of cycle time here 10 of 4 mA 0.4 ms . is a timing diagram for the switches and LED driver scheme of .

In a similar way by varying the switching combinations for a given time cycle II Device could produce any color with different shades. When duty cycle is 100 i.e. 100 ON and 0 OFF the LED driver is always ON thus letting current pass continuously through an LED arm which has its switch ON in turn providing highest possible luminosity for the color produced. Thus the output luminosity can be varied by varying duty cycle of the PWM signal to the LED driver providing dimming feature to II Device . The algorithm program in the controller is such that at a time only one switch or limited number of switches will be turned ON. Thus making sure that maximum possible current mainly set by LED driver circuit flows through the LED arm of that particular switch at that time. This particular scheme is more useful when power supply has limited current output capability. With such algorithm one could achieve maximum luminosity for any color possible.

For example let s say a power supply AC DC Converter is rated at a maximum 15V 1 A output. Let s assume all LEDs have rating of 1 A. To achieve 100 luminosity output from RED LEDs arm one has to pass 1 A current through RED LEDs arm continuously. In this case SIG1 Switch1 will be ON continuously and PWM duty cycle to LED driver will be 100 as well. However if one designs all four LED drivers to th of the maximum supply current from AC DC converter i.e. 1 A 0.25 A maximum current will never exceed 0.25 A through any LED arm thus limiting the output luminosity of that particular LED arm and combination of LEDs to be ON. Algorithm Program makes sure that only one LED arm is ON at a time and to produce colors other than Red Green Blue and White program turns ON FF the respective switches fast enough so that consumer sees the output light as a defined color due to persistence of vision.

Referring now to a circuit diagram of a multiplexer and a LED driver scheme in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown. In this scheme the controller processor would send a PWM signal to one LED driver which would control the average current flowing through it. In addition there would be multiplexer between the LED driver and each LED arm and . The controller is connected to the multiplexer via two signals. Based on SIG1 and SIG2 signals the multiplexer selects an LED arm and to connect to the LED driver at a time producing light with different colors saturation and brightness. Variation in the average current passing through the LED driver controlled by variations in the PWM sent by the controller would increase or decrease the average current passing through to the subsequent LED arms thus controlling the overall brightness of the LEDs .

Considering the embodiment contains red green blue and white LED arms and respectively based on established color mixing principals the variation in the luminosity of these four colors could produce all color combinations. To achieve this variation the controller could vary and alternate the length of time that the multiplexer signals are turned on to let current pass through to each of the respective LED arms and . This would create variations in lengths of time when the LED driver would pass through current to the LED arms and and thus create variations in lengths of time when the LEDs produce light. The length of time would also allow for a similar control in the overall brightness of the luminosity produced by the II Device in addition to the control provided by variations of the duty cycle of the PWM signal itself.

Similarly variations in the length of time that the controller would alternatively send signals to the multiplexer which would control the current passed through from the LED driver to the LED arm would also provide for a combinatory control of the average luminosity produced by each LED arm and thus allow for control of color and saturation of the light produced. The frequency of signals sent to the multiplexer will be high enough still within the LEDs and LED Drivers technical specifications so that due to the persistence of vision consumers would see a constant light output for example a yellow light instead of fast switching alternate red and green light outputs. The scheme in alternating multiplexer signals does not allow for simultaneous signals to allow current to pass to more than one LED arms at the same time. This maximizes the potential average current passed through and subsequent luminosity of each LED arm and considering limited available current from the AC DC converter . It allows for each LED arm to receive the full power provided by the AC DC converter and regulated by the LED driver such that when it is on all the available current could be sent through to the one LED arm or . The timing method is similar to that of the switches and LED drivers scheme . The multiplexer scheme would vary dependent on the II Device requirements and total number of LED arms.

Now referring to a circuit diagram of current limiting circuit scheme in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown. In this scheme current limiting circuits and control the current passed through to each LED arm and . There would be as many current limiting circuits as LED arms that are required for the specific embodiment of the II Device. The controller processor sends data to the individual current limiting circuit and and defines the current to be passed through to the respective LED arm and . A digital potentiometer could be used to form the current limiting circuit and . The resistance of potentiometer is proportional to the data given to it by controller processor .

For example to produce a yellow light consisting of 50 Red and 50 Green light at 100 possible output luminosity DATA1 and DATA2 will set the currents through current limiting ckt1 and ckt2 such that the current splits in half through two arms DATA3 and DATA4 will be zero . For example if power supply is able to provide 1 A current ckt1 and ckt2 will be set at 0.5 A each. Considering the embodiment contains red green blue and white LED arms and respectively based on established color mixing principals the variation in the luminosity of these four colors could produce all color combinations. Setting assigned currents through all circuits and any color saturation and brightness within specified limits could be achieved. In other embodiments the LEDs can be replaced or augmented with alternative lighting components and technologies including but not limited to CFLs Halogen and Incandescent.

The LED current control circuit executes commands from the controller processor to control the current passed through the LEDs . The LED current control circuit might take different forms dependent on the II Device embodiment as previously described. Each II Bulb would have some arrangement of LEDs that could vary in color and type brightness depending on different II Bulbs. Various types of LEDs would be placed on a LEDs board in a spaced and arranged fashion and connected electronically to other circuitry as explained earlier. The LEDs board consists of electrically connected LEDs placed on a single surface. The combination of LEDs could be of various types and various colors. For example the LEDs might vary in color such as red green blue and or white LEDs. The LEDs might also vary in their maximum output luminosity. The combination of illuminations of these LEDs could produce various levels of brightness and or color. LEDs on the board would be arranged so that the light from them would mix well forming a uniform color and overall light from the II Bulb would spread uniformly in at a particular degree around the circumference of the diffuser . In addition the LED board might be combined or surround other circuitry such as the hard reset circuit and or ambient light sensor . For embodiments where this is the case the LEDs could take a different arrangement to accommodate for the placement of those circuitries.

Referring now to a diagram of a LEDs Board in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown.

Other related components refers to related parts required for the fitment of heat sink and parts required of the housing and inner or outer structure of the II Bulb . These materials and arrangement might of course differ depending on the particular II Bulb embodiment.

As explained earlier there would be a diffuser that is a part of the II Bulb that spreads and or mixes the illumination produced by the LEDs . There could be an ambient sensor a part of ambient sensor circuit and or hard reset button a part of hard reset circuit on the diffuser in which case the diffuser could be transparent at that place. Also the diffuser in that case may have a through hole arrangement for electrical and mechanical connections of the sensor and button to the II Bulb . In the II Bulb as well as explained earlier the light reflector is used to amplify or focus the illumination generated by the LEDs.

Wireless energy receiver may have inbuilt AC DC converter in which case the DC output generated of wireless energy receiver is directly given to the DC DC converter .

Referring now to another embodiment of II Device in the form of LED lighting panel is shown. The panel is mostly used on the ceiling for down lighting.

There could be a common light mixing cover diffuser for all LED groups or multiple light mixing covers diffuser for each or multiple LED groups.

All the required electronic circuitry per II Device would be inside the lighting panel while the positions of the ambient light sensor s of ambient light sensor circuitries and the reset switch of the hard reset circuit could vary. They could reside on the top front wall of the panel on the side walls of the panel . The ambient light sensor and the wireless transceiver circuit could also take other placements as explained earlier. There could be multiple ambient light sensor circuitries on the LED lighting panel with light sensor taking the positions on side walls of the panel as well.

The panel could have single or multiple connectors of various types as explained earlier while describing connector in II Device . In addition theses connectors could be connected to the lighting panel through an electric cable or AC power cord . There would be a mechanical arrangement to fit the lighting panel to the ceiling in the form of an adhesive fastener s screw in mechanism or any other possible arrangement.

It might consist of LEDs board as explained in II Bulb with LEDs facing downwards while Can is installed into the ceiling. The LED Can an embodiment of II Device also consists of other circuitry such as LED current control circuit real time clock circuit etc. as explained in . Here the heat sink is a part of the Can fixture and is connected to the LEDs through LEDs board itself or there could be heat transfer adhesive between the LEDs board and heat sink. There would be a light mixing cover diffuser for LEDs board on top of the Can facing downwards.

All the other required electronic circuitry per of II Device would be inside the lighting Can while the positions of the ambient light sensor s of ambient light sensor circuitries and the reset switch of the hard reset circuit could vary as explained while explaining II Bulb.

The Can could have single or multiple connectors of any types as explained earlier while describing connector in II Device . In addition the connector could be connected to the lighting Can through an electric cable or AC power cord . There would be a mechanical arrangement to fit the lighting Can inside the ceiling through adhesive fasteners screw in mechanisms or any other possible arrangement.

With a wirelessly connected II Device it will be important for the device application to understand the current status of each II Device within the network. In addition it would be beneficial for each smart light or an auxiliary wireless device to know the status and signal strength of other Smart lights within its proximity. This would provide a better user experience and a more efficient lighting control system.

Now referring to a flow chart of a status request update process for a wireless device or auxiliary device to II Device in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown. The basic process for a status request from the wireless device or auxiliary device shown by element would begin with block . Upon a status update defined event the device application will trigger a command through the wireless device or auxiliary device to send a wireless communication to all II Devices in the vicinity . This command will then get extended through the mesh network see communication and mesh network processes for reference in as needed . Upon receipt each II Device will both respond to the command with the current status of that II Device and extend the responses of other II Devices via the mesh network . Upon receipt back by the wireless device or auxiliary device the status information will be interpreted by the device application and either store the information in the device application memory as an input to execute further commands trigger a second communication or command to the II Device network or take some other action . The process completes in block .

Referring now to a flow chart of a status update process for II Device to II Device in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown. The basic process for an internal II Device network status refresh from II Device to II Device shown by element would begin with block . Upon a status update defined event a command will be triggered in one or many Smart lights to send a wireless communication to all II Devices in the vicinity . This command will then get extended through the mesh network . Upon receiving status updates sent by other II Devices the status information will be interpreted by the II Device processor and used to either store the II Device ID s received and some associated data of the status in II Device s memory trigger a second communication or command to the II Device network or take some other action such as reconciling time or program differences . The process for II Device to II Device completes with block . The processes described in part and could be executed in some tandem or integrated fashion dependent on the specific program or task at hand.

Referring now to both the device application auxiliary device II Device itself and related II Devices and II Device network could update status information upon different defined events time periods or processes signified by . For example upon start up or launch of the device application a command could be sent to gather the status information and subsequent layout of each Smart light within the network. As another example after a defined time period while the device application is open the wireless device could send a command to gather the status information and subsequent layout of each II Device within the network. As another example given a different defined time period each II Device could send a command to gather the status information and subsequent layout of each II Device within the network. As another example during certain programs either actively runs through the device application or passively in the II Device network either example b or c could be executed at differing times to better suit the program or application. Or it could be any combination of the previously described examples.

The actual status of each II Device may include but not limited to the following information a the ID and signal strength of other II Device within range b the color and or brightness at which the II Device is currently illuminated c the status of programs defaults and profile information stored in the II Device s memory and d the current time date as stored in the RTC.

There are a number of different potential processes and programs that would require the current status of the II Devices communicated. For the disclosure of this invention it will be assumed that the status of the II Devices will already be known if having the status of one or the network of II Devices is generally required to execute the program or process. In many cases the process of obtaining the status of an II Device is included in description and drawings. In other cases the status need not be required in the program or process.

Now referring to a flow chart of a communication process from a device to II Device in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown through element . The process begins with block . Given a wireless device WD is equipped with hardware and systems to execute wireless communication protocols Bluetooth Wi Fi ZigBee or any other wireless protocol as well as an appropriate device application a user could send a lighting command to an II Device by selecting the command via the device application . Upon the user s selection of a command for a specific II Device the device application would translate the user s requested command into a light setting command and the specific stored ID for the selected II Device . This light setting command would include instructions for the specified II Device ID to execute such as on off color brightness or a program. The light setting command would be translated into the appropriate wireless communication protocol and wirelessly sent via the wireless device . The II Device if in range of the wireless communication or mesh network relay communication would receive the protocol via the II Device s antenna . The transceiver receiver circuitry would decode the wireless protocol to find the light setting command and send that to the controller processor . The controller will execute that command with the respective II Device s related components . Upon successful execution the II Device will respond through the appropriate wireless communication that it has executed the light setting command . The process ends with block .

Referring now to a flow chart of a communication process from a device to multiple II Devices in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown referred to as element . The process begins with block . Similar to the process of sending a light setting command from a wireless device to an II Device given an appropriate wireless device and device application a user could select a command for multiple II Devices via the device application that would send a wireless communication through the wireless device pertaining to multiple II Devices which could be extended through the mesh network . Upon receiving the wireless communications the II Devices could decode execute the command and each respond to verify the command has been executed utilizing the appropriate communication methods shown as . The process would end with block .

Now referring to as well as similar to the process of sending a light setting command from a wireless device to an II Device and the process for sending a light setting command from a wireless device to multiple II Devices a user could use multiple wireless devices or a combination thereof to send a command to one or multiple II Devices. As long as the wireless devices have the appropriate wireless protocol and associated hardware has some version of the device application with an authorized profile and is in range of the II Device or mesh network then the wireless devices could send a command in the same way that one wireless device could to one or multiple II Devices.

Now referring to an II Device within a mesh network a lighting system will be described. The ability for one II Device to receive a wireless communication from a wireless device equipped with the device application and pass on the communication to another II Device to execute the command within the wireless communication. On a broader scale having a network of II Devices be able to extend and relay a wireless device s command to extend the signal range or go beyond the limited number of devices it can communicate with directly or one to one. Additionally have the II Devices within the network confirm the execution of the command and possible automated or user guided troubleshooting steps.

Consider a wireless device WD is equipped with hardware and systems to execute wireless communication protocols Bluetooth Wi Fi ZigBee or any other wireless protocol as well as the installed device application. Each wireless communication system has some limitation in terms of range measured in meters or feet . WD1 can communicate with II Device1 II Device2 and II Device3 directly however it cannot communicate with other II Devices directly because of range limitation. WD1 can communicate with II Device4 by passing the commands and data through II Device3 . Similarly by passing commands data through II Device3 and II Device4 WD1 and II Device5 can communicate with each other. In the diagram WD1 can communicate with each II Device directly or through II Device s . The diagram is an example of mesh network with which the controlling wireless device WD in this case can communicate with all II Device s able to communicate with each other. Communication paths are shown as with obstruction preventing direct communication with some wireless devices.

In diagram above the II Devices are divided in different network levels as follow a II Devices which are in direct vicinity of WD1 are network level 1 called as NWL1 where II Device 1 II Device2 II Device3 are NWL1 II Devices b II Devices which are in the vicinity of NWL1 II Devices but not in direct vicinity of WD1 are network level 2 called as NWL2 II Devices where II Device4 is NWL2 II Device c II Devices which are in the vicinity of NWL2 but not in the vicinity of WD1 or NWL1 are NWL3 II Devices where II Device5 and II Device7 are NWL3 and d similarly II Device6 is NWL4 II Device.

The process for forming a mesh network will now be described. There are multiple processes that the wireless device and network of II Devices could communicate with each other to set up a mesh network dependent on the size of the network number of II Devices the dispersion in location of the II Devices power signal and other factors. The process would generally involve the wireless device communicating with all II Devices within its signal range and having each II Device also communicate to other II Devices within its signal range with an ultimate output sent back to the wireless device including the current status and ID s of all II Devices in signal range for wireless device and each II Device within the network.

WD1 communicates with NWL1 II Devices and stores their ids and statuses in the memory and creates a network among them. Each II Device also communicates with other II Devices and stores their ids and statuses in the memory and creates a network among them. WD1 then sends commands to NWL1 II Devices asking what other II Devices they can communicate with and their ids and statuses. Each NWL1 II Device responds to the commands and provides information on their connections network with ids and statuses. WD1 then sends commands to NWL2 II Devices through respective NWL1 II Device to get the information on the II Devices in their network and their statuses. NWL2 II Devices responds back to WD1 through respective NWL1 II Device with their network information. WD now has all II Device ids in its memory at NWL1 NWL2 and NWL3 levels. In the same fashion WD1 continues to build its network map by sending commands to next network level II Devices in this case NWL4 through intermediary network level II Devices and gets information on their network. This process would continue until either the wireless device receives information from all lights set up within the device application or selected for a particular command or until all II Devices that can be reached through the mesh network have been captured either directly or through the mesh network to the wireless device.

Using the statuses and information from each II Device the application device run on the wireless device would then create a map of the entire network including what II Devices are connected to what II Device and each connection s signal strength and store it into its memory . WD1 can find out the most effective path to communicate with a particular II Device in the mesh network depending upon the signal strengths between WD1 and that particular II Device and signal strengths between WD1 and other II Devices wirelessly connected to other II Devices and that particular II Device. E.g. in diagram above signal strength between WD1 and II Device8 is very low. This may cause communication errors between WD1 and II Device8 . Therefore WD1 can chose to communicate with II Device8 through II Device2 as signal strength between WD1 and II Device2 and that between II Device2 and II Device8 is good leading to less errors in communication. When a command is sent from the wireless device to an II Device through a mesh network the II Device will respond to confirm the command has been executed in a similar path or along a more effective path given any potential changes in the network based on any changes in terms of movement of wireless device signal strength etc. The mesh network could be limited to NWL1 or NWL2 or any other network level based upon the criticality of application and different II Device embodiments.

Considering the fact that some types of communication protocol methods have a limit to the number of devices that can be connected or have communication among the device application will intuitively take these as input constraints to the formation of an optimal mesh network and path for the wireless communication of a command. As example if the wireless communication uses Bluetooth technology there might be some constraints. Considering a piconet topology ad hoc computer network using Bluetooth technology a master Bluetooth device Mostly a Wireless Device or II Device in this case can communicate with a maximum of seven Bluetooth devices at a time. Understanding this constraint the wireless device s and II Devices could execute the mesh network process in such a way to optimize both the total number of II Devices captured by the network and the path to send any specific command through the mesh network. This can be achieved by executing the standard mesh networking process and the device application considering the resulting map of the network to calculate and decide which specific II Devices to keep connected within the direct connection of the wireless device and which to keep connected through other II Devices.

Considering a case where more than seven II Devices are found within the vicinity of the wireless device the device application after receiving the initial network mapping would adjust which II Devices to directly connect to and which to connect to through another II Device to attempt to reduce the number of II Devices directly connected to the wireless device. This would open up the ability of the wireless device to search for and connect to additional II Devices within initial proximity that might not have been able to connect before due to the limit of seven devices. This process would be balanced to ensure those lights that could only connect through another II Device are also accounted for and signal strength is at the highest possible levels. Note that this constraint might not be the case for all versions of Bluetooth topology or technology.

The steps for forming a dynamic mesh network will now be described. Similarly to controlling multiple II Devices with multiple devices multiple wireless devices in this case WD1 WD2 and WD3 could control one or many II Devices via the mesh network. Each wireless device in this case WD1 WD2 and WD3 would execute the mesh network process in relation to its location as explained earlier with reference to wireless device WD1 and II Devices in its vicinity at different network levels such as NWL1 NWL2 and NWL3.

Along the same lines a dynamic mesh networking is required as a wireless device WD can move from one place to another changing for itself the II Devices in NWL1 and possibly the II Devices in other related network levels such NWL2 NWL3 etc. In the dynamic mesh network process the wireless device and II Devices follow the same process as explained in the formation of mesh network but the process is repeated on a continuous basis. Specifically the wireless device and each related II Device would keep updating their individual network as explained earlier after every defined time interval. Each II Device would also keep providing the ids and statuses of II Devices in its network to the wireless device s in a defined time interval. This time interval would vary from a few seconds to hours depending upon the complexity and criticality of the application being run power consumption dispersion of II Devices and total number of wireless devices and II Devices in the network.

In accessing an II Device network through various devices in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown as well. Different types of wireless devices could work together to form extend and translate different communication methods to support the mesh network. These different wireless devices could be standard wireless devices such as smartphones tablets computers or other standard controlling wireless devices with the device application loaded. Alternatively these different wireless devices could be an auxiliary device with some specialized or standardized device application to either perform a specific function or general function in relation to the mesh network.

As example a wireless device located outside of direct contact with the lighting network but within range to another wireless device within range of the lighting network could send commands through the wireless device to the lighting network and subsequent mesh network. In this case the remote wireless device RD would originate the commands and then the localized wireless device WD1 would act as the first network level of the mesh network. Note that the communication method between the remote wireless device RD and the localized wireless device WD1 might be different than the communication method between the localized wireless device WD1 and the II Devices lighting network. As an example the remote wireless device RD may communicate with the localized wireless device WD1 via an internet based protocol while the localized wireless device WD1 communicates with the lighting network via a Bluetooth protocol. Also remote wireless device RD could be another embodiment of Intelligent Illuminating Device .

Additionally the remote wireless device RD might send a communication to the localized wireless device WD1 to send a specific communication to the lighting network upon some defined event. In addition the remote wireless device RD need not necessarily be outside of the range of the lighting control system. The wireless device WD1 may also act as a specialized auxiliary wireless device such as an external ambient light sensor and communicate with other wireless devices.

The Real Time Clock inside of each II Device would need to be periodically updated to ensure accuracy. To achieve this the device application on the wireless device would refer to and share its own current date and time information via the wireless communication and connection process either as part of the status update process or an alternate process. Additionally the II Devices themselves can update and reconcile discrepancies within the date time without the wireless device itself being present in the network. The actual process to update the date time setting of the RTC in an II Device from the wireless device device application might be executed in a number of different ways.

The following are potential but not limited to all examples of how a device to II Device date time update process would be triggered generally represented as element . The wireless device device application might send the date time setting upon every command sent to the II Device network and when received the II Device s would update the current date time setting in the RTC and store latest update date time in the II Device s memory. The wireless device device application might periodically over some time or number of processes send the date time setting upon every command sent to the II Device network and when received the II Device s would update the current date time setting in the RTC and store latest update date time in the II Device s memory. The wireless device device application might send the date time setting only when specific programming commands are sent or active that requires information from the RTC and store latest update date time in the II Device s memory. The wireless device device application might send the date time setting after some time setting is changed within the wireless device device application. Further any combination of the above might be applicable.

Similarly the process where II Devices share and reconcile date time settings might be executed in a number of different ways. The following are potential but not limited to all examples of how an II Device to II Device date time update process would be triggered collectively represented as element . The II Devices might share and reconcile their date time at some multiple of when their status is shared. The II Devices might share and reconcile their date time only when executing certain commands or processes. The II Devices might share and reconcile their date time after some defined period of time. The II Devices might share but only reconcile their date time when they are different. The II Devices might reconcile the date time based on the most recent update of date time setting. Further any combination of the above might be applicable.

Now referring to a flow chart of a wireless device update date time process in II Device in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown and referred to as element . The actual reconciliation process and dependency in commands would proceed as follows beginning with block . When a wireless device update occurs as previously referred to as the II Device receives the date time status update the wireless device sends a date time update to any number of II Devices within range or through the mesh network . When the II Device will update and match its internal time via the II Device s RTC and memory . The II Device s memory will also update the date time value as the original date time when the RTC was updated . The II Device would then confirm the execution of the date time update back to the wireless device . In some cases the wireless device might execute a troubleshooting process if not all II Devices confirm execution of the date time status update . The process would conclude with block .

Referring now to a flow chart of an II Device update date time in II Device in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown and referred to as element . The process begins with block . When an II Device to II Device event occurs as referred to previously as either through a status update or solely a date time communication the II Device s would send a date time communication out to any II Devices either directly within range or within range through the mesh network . When an II Device s receives the date time communication from another II Device the receiving II Device will compare the receiving date time update to its own date time status in the RTC . If the received date time communication was set more recently than that of the II Device s then the receiving II Device will update and match its internal time via the II Device s RTC and memory . The II Device s memory will also update the date time value when the RTC was updated . If the values are the same or the received date time was updated later than the receiving II Device s internally stored date time to then the II Device takes no action and will complete the II Device to II Device date time communication process . Considering a mesh network system where there are numerous paths and scenarios broadly the II Device s themselves will only update their date time when the received date time originated from a more recent date time update. Originated refers to the specific date time when a wireless device sends an update to the II Device s . If an II Device then passes that date time on to another II Device the originated date would still refer to the original date time when the wireless device sent the update to the II Device s .

Referring now to a flow chart of basic control areas in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown and represented by element . Using the device application on a number of different wireless devices a user could communicate and control the wireless lighting system in a number of ways. A user could control a single II Device a combination of II Devices a predetermined group of II Devices multiple groups of II Devices and the whole set up of networked II Devices. Control pertains to adjusting brightness color running a program or setting a program to run at a future time or upon some event. All processes begin with block and continue as follows 

Controlling a single II Device through the application a a user will navigate through screens on the application to select an individual II Device e.g. can arrive by drilling down into a group or selecting the unique II Device to control b once the single II Device is selected the device application will display potential options for control c potential options for control include but are not limited to the following collectively signified by i turning on off to default ii changing brightness saturation and or color and iii running a program now or upon some condition such as time. Alternate options for user customization include but are not limited to i adding the II Device to an existing or new group ii viewing the II Device s group assignments iii viewing a hierarchy of programs and scenes that the II Device is included in and iv troubleshooting the II Device. Once a user has selected the option for control the device application will interpret the selection into a light control setting for the selected II Device and send a wireless communication via the appropriate processes represented here collectively by element . As such once the individual II Device receives the communication it will then interpret the instructions and execute the command then relay confirmation back to the wireless device per the appropriate communications processes.

Controlling multiple II Devices through the application a a user will navigate through screens on the application and select multiple II Devices e.g. can arrive by drilling down into a group or selecting the unique light IDs to control b once the II Device IDs are selected the user will be given options for control c potential options for control include but are not limited to the following collectively signified by i turning on off to default ii changing brightness saturation and or color and iii running a program now or upon some condition such as time. Alternate options for user customization include but are not limited to i adding the II Device to an existing or new group and ii troubleshooting the II Device. Once a user has selected the option for control the device application will interpret the selection into a light control setting for the selected II Devices and send a wireless communication via the appropriate processes represented here collectively by element . As such once the individual II Device receives the communication it will then interpret the instructions and execute the command then relay confirmation back to the wireless device per the appropriate communication processes represented by .

Controlling a group or multiple groups of II Devices through the application. A user will navigate through screens on the application and select a group or multiple groups of II Devices . Groups of II Devices will be user configurable combinations of individual II Devices. They will most closely relate to rooms but can have multiple combinations. Once the group or groups are selected the user will be given options for control including but are not limited to the following collectively represented as element for a group or for multiple groups i turning on off to default ii changing brightness and or color iii running a program now or upon some condition such as time and iv turning on off a program that is set to run in the future or upon some condition.

Alternate options for user customization include but are not limited to i drilling down into individual II Devices for control ii adding the group to an existing or new group iii viewing a hierarchy saved settings programs and scenes that the group is included in and iv troubleshooting the group. Once a user has selected the option for control the device application will interpret the selection into a light control setting for the each II Device within the selected group or groups and send a wireless communication via the appropriate processes represented here collectively by element . As such once each II Device within the selected group s receives the communication it will then interpret the instructions and execute the command then relay confirmation back to the wireless device per the appropriate processes discussed in the communication processes represented by .

Controlling a whole network of lights through the application is similar in fashion to controlling multiple groups represented by a similar sequence of elements and . All basic control processes end at block .

Programming is a process by which an II Device multiple II Devices a group or multiple groups can execute a command or sequence of commands given some other event occurs or condition is met. Similarly an II Device multiple II Devices group or multiple groups could be given a sequence of commands to execute in sequence at some time interval. Unique to the invention disclosed a user can create programmed commands send them wirelessly to any number of specified II Devices and the command would execute given a condition being met. The condition will generally be related to time but many types of conditions could be interpreted into time based activities. For example wireless devices able to access the Internet provide a wealth of potential conditions that could be converted to time passed or the wireless device could passively monitor the condition and send a command when met.

Generally a condition could be executed through these sources a the wireless device sends a command to any number of II Devices to execute a program given a date time passing or date time being met e.g. simulated sunrise timer etc. b the wireless device sends a command to any number of II Devices to execute a program given some other conditionally based input directly available to the II Device e.g. ambient light sensor program c the wireless device sends a command to any number of II Devices to execute a program with the condition being met at that time and the action stored in the II Devices memory e.g. reset process d the wireless device sends a command to any number of II Devices to execute a program with the condition being met at that time and the action specified through the command e.g. starry night e the wireless device sends a command to any number of II Devices to execute a program given some other conditionally based input available to the lighting control network is available to said II Devices e.g. auxiliary ambient light sensor program f the wireless device sends a command to any number of II Devices to execute a program in coordination with wireless communications commands provided sequentially through the device application e.g. music sync g the wireless device runs a program to monitor some condition and upon that condition being met sends a command to any number of II Devices to execute a specified command or sequence of commands e.g. weather alerts h any combination or sequential representation of the above program types.

Creating a program involves similar processes to basic control. A user selects an II Device multiple II Devices group or multiple groups to run a program. The user then selects a program to be run by the selected II Device s a there could be predefined suggested programs based on the items selected e.g. stored in device application memory b the user could create their own program c each program will consist of at least one command to be run when one or more conditions are met or multiple commands to be run sequentially or upon further conditions being met e.g. user to set select condition d the program can be run at that time or saved to run at a future time e.g. the program can be set to repeat on certain dates times such as days of the week every X days or any time lapse interval . The command or series of commands is then sent via the wireless network to each associated II Device s . This is done through the appropriate wireless communication process. Each II Device s then interprets the command or series of commands executes the command or stores the command in memory to be executed when conditions are met. Similarly each II Device s would confirm the program command via the appropriate communication method process.

Now referring to a flow chart of a programming process in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown and referred to as element . Once a program or programs are saved a user can recall and toggle those programs on off. The process begins with block . At the main level of the device application there will be a programs button. When selected this will display all programs associated with the active profile. Each program will be listed with their current status as active vs. inactive. The programs will be sorted based on active vs. inactive status with active listed first. Secondly the programs will be sorted based on the proximity of the associated II Devices to each program . When toggled on the application will send the command or series of commands via the wireless network to each associated II Device s through one or more appropriate communication processes collectively represented here as . The actual light setting associated with the program might be stored in device application so that the wireless communication is to execute a specific program type command. The actual light setting might also be stored in the II Device itself so that the device application wireless device only requests the II Device to run that program. Each II Device s then interprets the command or series of commands and their related program conditions executes the command given a present condition or stores the command in memory to be executed at a later condition time or event. In the latter case once the condition is met the II Device s will execute the program command . Then if there are further conditional commands within the program the II Device will continue to monitor for conditions until they are met and the II Device similarly follows the process to execute the program command . Once no further conditional commands are in the program the program completes and changes to inactive status so that the program commands are deleted from the memory of each related II Device and the program returned to an off status in the device application . Alternately a program that was set to run can be turned off so that the wireless device sends a command to the related II Devices to not execute the conditional command prompted by the program . This command would be communicated through one or more appropriate communication processes collectively represented here as . When received each II Device would change the program to complete and change it to inactive status so that the program commands are deleted from the memory of each related II Device and the program returned to an off status in the device application . The program might still be saved in the device application memory for future use if a saved program. The program run process ends in block .

In the case where program commands would overlap with each other the device application will prompt the user to confirm the program selection. In such case the selected program will overlap any conflicting previously activated program. Alternatively if the program commands originated from multiple devices or profiles the II Devices will execute programs in the order of profile hierarchy. Alternatively the programs might execute in the order of the last received command.

Scenes suggested scenes will now be described. A scene is a predefined setting or program related to multiple II Devices and or groups so that with one user selection any or all II Devices would execute a specified setting or program. This element is useful to support very holistic functional lighting like turning off all II Devices before going to bed turning on some II Devices to walk to the bathroom setting a mood for dinner or a movie or many other personal preferences. A scene is comprised of a defined light setting and or program for each of any number of individual II Devices and or any number of groups. When a scene is activated the device application recalls the defined light setting s and or program and the associated II Device s group s and sends a standard wireless command to each.

Referring now to a flow chart of a process for creating a scene in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown. The scene control selection can be both suggestive and user configurable. A user could drill into each established scene to view or edit the states for each II Device add more II Devices etc. A user could also select a scene to be run at a previous time such as through an automation program. Scenes might display graphically in the user interface with the most used scenes or the scenes containing the II Devices with the closest signal strength higher in order. Users could also drag and drop the order of scenes displayed to their preference.

Once a network of II Devices is set up the application might suggest some pre configured scenes dependent on the number of II Devices set up within the network and the names of the groups most likely rooms that were assigned. More specifically the device application would refer to the list of groups configured by the user and if certain predefined keywords or combinations of words were found within those groups the application would suggest show a scene related to that group or groups in the scene options. Also the device application would refer to the number of II Devices the number of groups and the number of II Devices within each group to create suggested predefined scenes. With more II Devices groups and II Devices within groups more complex scenes could be suggested or more group specific scenes could be suggested. All of II Devices would include scenes all off and all on related to turning all II Devices off within the addressable network or turning all II Devices on. As example for any lighting network containing a group of lights with the word TV Television movie film or related word the application would suggest a lighting scene related to watching a movie such as a soft blue light emitted from each of the II Devices. The types of suggested scenes could vary dependent on different applications.

Through the device application the user can create a new scene referred to as element and beginning in block by first selecting the option to create a scene in the device application and selecting any number of II Device s and or group s with which to start creating the scene . The user would then select create the lighting control setting or program for the selected II Device s and or group s II Device. Here the light setting might be a previously user saved configuration an automated application suggested configuration or a newly created configuration . Once selected the user would then have the option to add additional subsets of II Device s and or groups to the scene which would revert back to a similar configuration process for that selection . Once the user has configured all the II Device s and or group s that they wish the scene comprised of any combination of II Device s and or group s each with a specified light setting or program will be saved and the user could assign a specified name . This information will be stored in the device application memory and the process will end in block .

Note that each II Device within the scene is able to have a different II Device brightness and or color. In addition pre defined programs for II Device s can also be run or activated through a scene in combination with a specific type of lighting to be executed at that time. For example a time to sleep scene might turn off all the II Devices in the network except for one II Device on very low blue light in a child s bedroom and activate the II Device alarms for all bedrooms in the house for a certain time. Once the user has selected the II Devices and lighting output the user can save that scene for future use as referred to previously in . The scene is saved within the device application memory .

Now referring to a flow chart of a process for executing a scene command in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown as element . The process begins in block . To turn a scene on when the device application is open the user would select switch on the desired saved or suggested scene as an option presented in the device application interface . The device application would then retrieve and convert the scene selection into specific light setting commands and or programs to be executed by each of the related II Devices in the scene . The wireless device would then convert the series of II Device light setting commands or programs into the appropriate wireless communications directed at each of the related II Devices within the group . Upon receipt each II Device would execute its related light setting command or program and send the appropriate wireless communication back to the wireless device to confirm execution of the scene . The process completes in block .

Changing and adding unique groupings of II Device Setting up your own groups allows for user configurable set up alteration and assignment of any number of II Device combinations of the addressable lighting network. Within the device application each II Device has its own unique ID. Through the application a user can combine any number of II Devices and or existing groups together to form a group of II Devices. This can be done through user gestures dragging and dropping selecting an individual and assigning to a group or through the easy setup program. Once any number of lights is assigned into a group a user can select commands to all II Devices within the group by simply selecting the group.

Referring now to a flow chart of a process for creating a new group or adding to an existing group in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown as element . The process begins with block . A user selects any number or combination of II Devices and or groups through the device application . The user then selects the option to either create a new group from the selection or add the selection to an existing group . If creating a new group from selection i then the user will need to name the group e.g. the device application might have a list of predefined naming conventions that a user has the option of selecting or they can type their own ii the user would then be prompted through the device application to set a group default light setting for all II Devices within the group e.g. a user could select different unique light settings for each II Device within the group that are all saved under the group light setting see default process for more details iii as the user is selecting the group default light setting if in proximity to the actual lighting network the wireless device would adjust the related II Devices to execute the light settings as the user is toggling different options while selecting a default group setting iv once a user selects and sets the group default light setting then the group setting could be saved to the device application s memory to be run in the future with the process ending in block . For adding the selection to an existing group i the user would then select what group to add the selection to via the device application ii the user would then be prompted to confirm extension of the default group setting to the newly selected II Devices groups or create new light settings for the selected II Devices within the group iii as the user is selecting the group default light setting if in proximity to the actual lighting network the wireless device could adjust the related II Devices to execute the light settings as the user is toggling different options and iv once a user selects and sets the group default light setting then the group setting could be saved to the device application s memory to be run in the future with the process ending in block .

Now referring to a flow chart of a process for executing a group command in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown as element . The process begins in block . User selects group s and related light setting command program through the device application user interface. The application then identifies the II Devices assigned to the selected group through internal memory . Wireless device running application sends commands through wireless communication for those specified II Devices in the group following the appropriate communication methods processes. Each II Device receives and executes the intended light control setting or program . Each II Device responds to the wireless device to confirm execution of the group command following the appropriate communication methods processes. Upon receipt of all confirmations the device application would update the group to active or on in the user interface with the process ending in block . Note that any individual II Device can be assigned to multiple groups. Multiple groups can be combined adjusted or used to create new groups. Also note that in some scenarios not all II Devices assigned to a group could be accessed due to signal range limitations or other problems. In these cases the user would still have the ability to control those II Devices that are accessible at that time. Similarly a notation could be made in the user interface signifying a group that is not fully accessible.

A process will now be described for setting using and changing default light levels for any number of II Devices including switching on off through an external switch such as a wall switch see FIG. so that a user can easily customize save and recall their standard lighting preference. Additionally a process allowing for anyone to turn on the preset default of the II Devices without using the application will also be described. Each II Device will always have an associated default light level. Each II Device might have multiple related default light levels with the following framework. i Manufacturing default for each II Device the most basic light setting stored in each II Device s internal memory. The manufacturing default light setting will always be stored in the II Device s memory. ii Light default for each II Device the active default light setting that will be executed when the II Device is turned on directly as in the process steps of to to not through a group command or upon power restoration. Each II Device can only have one light default. This default light setting is stored within each II Device s memory until the II Device is reset or the light default is changed. When unassigned the light default reverts to the manufacturing default. Group default s The light setting that will be executed by each II Device within the selected group when the selected group is turned on through the device application. The group default is stored within the device application related to each group. Each II Device is able to execute multiple group defaults dependent on which group the user has selected to turn on and their individual commands within the group default. During the set up process or any time after installation a user can change the light default or group default settings through the device application.

The manufacturing default will most likely be a standard high output white type of light. This light setting will be programmed into each II Device during the manufacturing process and stored into the II Device s memory. This default will first be executed when the II Device is powered on for the first time. As such the manufacturing default is independent of the device application. After a light default is assigned the light default setting will take precedence over the manufacturing default however the manufacturing default setting will still stay stored within the II Device s memory. When a light is reset to the manufacturing state either through the hard or soft reset function the light default will be erased and the II Device will revert back to the manufacturing default acting as the light default.

Referring now to a flow chart of a process for creating or adjusting a light default in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown and referred to as . The process begins at block . At any time after setting up an II Device with the device application such as the process described in a user can select or adjust a personalized light default setting. A user can select one or more II Device s through the device application adjust the color and or brightness and set that selection as the light default for the respective II Device s . Upon assignment of the light default the device application via the wireless device will send a wireless communication to the related II Device s through an appropriate communication means. The communication will instruct each II Device to store its respective configured setting in its internal memory as the light default setting instead of the manufacturing default or previously assigned light default . This communication request will then be executed by the controller and related components including the storage of the new light default in the II Device s memory . The assigned light default light setting will also be stored in the device application memory . This would end the process for setting a new or changing an existing light default setting . The light default setting can be changed or adjusted at any time and would follow a similar if not the same process for creating a new light default as described as element . Each II Device can only have one light default at a time.

Now referring to a flow chart of a process for creating or adjust a group default in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown and referred to as . The process begins with block . First the user would select the group to assign or adjust a group default . This could happen either through selection of an existing group in the device application or when a user creates a group as in the process . A selected group might consist of one group or multiple groups together. The user will then need to specify the particular light setting for that selected group s to execute when turned on as a group . Once a group default is selected for the group the associated light setting for each II Device within the group will be stored within the device application to be executed at that time or in the future. If a group default is set for associated II Devices that do not have a light default the group default light setting will also be assigned and communicated to each related II Device as the light default light setting . This will most likely happen during the initial set up and grouping process. In this scenario the device application and related wireless device will execute the wireless command similar to that in setting a light default and the group default process will be complete as signified by block . Similarly if unedited at the light default level future changes to the group default will similarly change the respective light default setting. When an II Device associated with the group already has an assigned light default but that light default was originally set by creating that same group default that is being configured then the light default will be adjusted as the group default it was originated from is adjusted and each II Device will execute the process to adjust its default light setting with the group default light setting as in the process . The group default process will then be complete as signified by block . If the light default setting did not originate from the group default being configured then the light default will not be updated and the group default process will be complete as signified by block . When the group default is executed it follows a similar process as that for executing a group command or .

Referring now to a flow chart of a power restoration process in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown and referred to as process element . The process begins with block . Anytime an II Device goes from not having an electric current to having an electric current for any period of time the II Device will execute the power restoration mode . If a light default is assigned to the II Device the power restoration mode will trigger the II Device to recall the light default setting from its internal memory and execute the light default setting . If unassigned the II Device will recall the manufacturing default setting from its internal memory and execute the manufacturing default setting . In addition the power restoration event and or association in executing either the light default setting or manufacturing default setting could act as an input event or condition for specific programs such as the quick set up or quick grouping processes or as a status defined event or part of the II Device s next status update as described in or . The process ends with block . This would commonly occur when a light switch is changed from off to on or from on to off to on. A user would not need to utilize the device application to trigger the light default action in this sense. The power restoration mode or more simply turning the power source to the II Device off will cease any currently running the II Device is executing it at that time program scene or setting but will not erase any program that is active set to be run in the future and its associated setting from the II Device s memory. A user could choose not to utilize the power restoration mode can by turning it off through the user s settings on the device application.

Now referring to a flow chart of a process for executing a default command through an on off toggle in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown and referred to as . The process begins with block . A user would select the desired II Device s and or group s through the device application and toggles the basic on command related to executing the selection s respective defaults . When toggled on the device application would retrieve the appropriate saved default including the related II Device s and their associated light settings . The wireless device would then send an appropriate wireless communication to the II Device s group s to execute their respective light setting . Each related II Device would then receive and execute the command and then it will respond to the wireless device confirming execution of the command following the appropriate communication methods processes. The process would end with block . A user could turn off or adjust any running default command through the process outline above . Referring now to diagrams of various screens on device application in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention are shown. The device application will generally be run on a wireless device such as a smartphone table or computer. In these cases the device application will most likely have the below screens and sections to support user control of the wireless lighting control system. A user could toggle between screens through various human computer interaction methods dependent on the wireless device but most commonly will be gestures and or touch selections.

As shown in a device displaying a favorites screen will display a list of user generated favorite commands relating to II Devices groups programs and scenes. Each item displayed on the screen as exemplified by as one item would be a specific selection of II Devices and an associated action that could be activated through toggling of the on off button represented by . When selected the wireless device and related II Devices will execute the related communication method for that command. A user can also add or delete favorite settings through this screen or various other screens for example a user could select in the figure to perform this command.

As shown in a device displaying a screen will display a list of all groups created within the device application s profile. Each or multiple groups as exemplified by one group as could be selected to turn on to the group default setting or off exemplified by the selection of . Each or multiple groups could also be selected and then given some specific command or other option as outlined in the groups section. When selected the wireless device and related II Devices in the group s will execute the related communication method for that command. A user can also select a group to view the individual II Device screen filtered to just that group. A user can add edit and or delete group s and default group settings through this screen or various other screens for example a user could select in the figure to perform this command.

As shown in a device displaying a programs screen will display a list of all programs created or suggested manufacturing default programs within the device application s profile with an on off status for each program. Each program as exemplified as one program by could be selected to turn on or off a command potentially executed by toggling . Additionally each program could be selected edited or deleted. When a program command is selected the wireless device and related II Devices to the program will execute the related communication method for that program. A user can add or delete program s through this screen or various other screens for example a user could select in the figure to perform this command.

As shown in a device displaying a scene screen will display a list of all scenes created or suggested manufacturing default scenes within the device application s profile with an on off status for each program. Each scene as exemplified as one item by could be selected to turn on or off a command potentially executed by toggling . Additionally each scene could be selected edited or deleted. When a scene command is selected the wireless device and related II Devices to the scene will execute the related communication method for that scene. A user can add or delete scene s through this screen or various other screens for example a user could select in the figure to perform this command.

As shown in a configure screen is used to adjust the color brightness saturation and other configuration for selections of II Device s group s program s and or scene s . The configure screen might be different depending on the selection and specific type of configuration. In general the configuration screen will consist of the three level lighting control interface and a list of the selection II Device s group s . There would most likely be related configuration screens for the selection of program conditions scene creation editing and other more complex configurations.

More specifically certain II Devices with color and white could be controlled through three levels color saturation and brightness . This functionality is derived by the capabilities of the schemes in the LED controlling circuit and related LEDs and supported device application. Color levels would be derived by combining different variations and combinations in the average luminosity passed through the II Device s LEDs. A color level selection refers to an input on a user interface that would go to create any number of colors derived from the mixing of the LEDs found in the II Device. The color level could be controlled incrementally or at fixed points for example a user could select a color level from a color slider . Alternatively a user could select specific colors from the color level such as blue green red etc. as represented by .

Brightness levels would be derived by either increasing or decreasing the average current passed through the LEDs of the II Device but in the same proportion as that required for the selected color. The difference in brightness levels would only be apparent in variations in the luminosity of the light emitted from the II Device. The color will stay constant when adjusting the brightness. Similarly a brightness level selection could be controlled incrementally or at fixed points for example a user could select a brightness level from a slider . Alternatively a user could select specific brightness levels such as 25 50 dim bright etc. as represented by .

Saturation levels would be derived by adding or subtracting some proportional amount of average current passed through the white LEDs with respect to the average current combinations of the set color. The overall effect of increasing the saturation level would be reducing the relative amount of white light produced by the II Device in relation to the colored LEDs. The overall effect of decreasing the saturation level would be increasing the relative amount of white light produced by the II Device in relation to the colored LEDs. Similarly the saturation level selection could be controlled incrementally or at fixed points for example a user could select a saturation level from a slider . Alternatively a user could select specific saturation levels such as 25 50 lighter darker etc. as represented by . Note that the change in saturation selected through the device application would not necessarily have a linear relationship to the amount of white light added or reduced but it could be exponential or through some other calculation. The overall effect and process would manage the saturation levels so that the perceived difference is gradual to the user while managing for the constraint in the amount of current available to the LEDs.

As shown in a device displaying a II Device screen will display a list of all II Devices either selected or identified within the device application s profile the screen represented by . Each II Device as exemplified as one II Device by could be selected to turn on or off to the light default a command potentially executed by toggling or configured in some other fashion. Additionally each II Device or combination of II Devices could be selected edited or given some other command or selection as outline in the basic control section. When an II Device command is selected the wireless device and related II Device s will execute the related communication method for example a user could select in the figure to perform these types of commands.

Now referring to a flow chart of a quick set up process for connected lights in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown and referred to as . A process that allows an II Device or multiple II Devices to quickly and securely establish a connection with a wireless device and the associated device application and with other connected II Devices around it. The process begins in block . Each II Device when initially purchased or reset will be in a manufacturing state . When in a manufacturing state upon receiving initial power current the II Device s will enter power restoration mode as described in . The II Device s will then be prone to discovery by a wireless device with the associated device application . The II Device s would also execute the manufacturing default light setting . Upon launch of the quick set up process on the device application the wireless device and II Device s in the manufacturing state will then identify and connect to each other if within range or through an extended mesh network in the manufacturing state to create a secure paired connection . The device application on the wireless device will then store each detected II Device s unique ID so that it can communicate with it in the future. Each II Device would similarly recognize and store a unique ID associated to the user s device profile so that only that smartphone profile ID can send directions to the II Device in the future . Similarly the II Devices could send commands and communicate with each other.

In some embodiments the set up process could use different color light settings as cues in the set up process. For example the II Device would display a certain color upon initial power up signaling to the user that the II Device is not connected to the network. Then upon establishing connection to a profile the II Device would change colors to signal the connection has been established . Next a user might confirm that all II Devices are connected and select an option in the device application to move forward with the set up . If not all connected then execute troubleshooting steps with user. Identify problem II Device. Execute quick troubleshooting steps step closer screw in secure connection to power source. User can possibly provide confirmation through the device application that all II Devices are a specific color. All II Devices become connected and user selects option that II Devices are not all connected then prompt to select color of light. Should be color of unpaired light or no light if unpaired light ask user to step closer to the II Device and select OK. Then should connect and user can continue set up. If no light ask user to make sure that the II Device is firmly screwed in and the light switch is on. Then proceed through set up menu. Once user confirms set up of installed II Devices they can continue with any further set up or customization processes such as adding names defaults and favorites. A user can repeat this process to continue setting up other II Devices until all intended II Devices are set up and the quick set up process is complete .

Referring now to a flow chart of a quick group process through power restoration in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown and referred to as process element . A quick group process through power restoration provides a quick way for a user to combine II Devices into a named group through use of the power restoration mode. It could be a guided process within the set up process of the II Devices network through the device application as described in . It also could be run after the initial set up of the II Device network. The process begins with block . Upon launch of the quick group process through the device application though device application instruction or in the natural course of set up the user will turn off the power source to the related II Devices that they would like to group then turn the power source back on . When done this will prompt the related II Devices to enter the power restoration mode . This action will most likely be through the use of a wall switch. The II Devices will execute the appropriate default setting as discussed in . The device application and related wireless device will then search for all II Devices that have entered the power restoration mode through various communication methods previously discussed record their unique IDs and display the associated II Devices through the user interface on the device application or some other type of user feedback means . The user will then be prompted to confirm that the correct II Devices were captured . Could use color cues to help with the confirmation as discussed in . If user does not confirm then go to troubleshooting steps . If yes then continue with the process to create a new group as outlined in . After setting up a quick group the user might then be asked if they would like to set up another quick group through the device application . If yes then repeat the quick group process . If no then end quick group process .

Upon initial set up of a lighting network a user will create a profile. Profile refers to a combination of unique username and password that would be related to one or many user s accounts. The profile would have multiple purposes 1 to provide an authentication method for communication within the wireless lighting system network of II Devices and wireless devices 2 to associate and save user preferences and configured settings of the wireless lighting system to the device application and possibly saved elsewhere and 3 provide a user associated account for billing support or other services. Through the initial set up process as described in each II Device within a lighting control system will store the Profile s username and password or some encrypted version of the profile s username password in its memory. Similarly the wireless device and device application will store all II Device ID s within the lighting control system lighting network to the device application memory.

Now referring to a flow chart of a profile authentication process in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown and referred to as . See also for other related process information. The profile authentication process begins in block . Upon any communication from a wireless device or other II Device to one or many II Devices the wireless communication will include some version possibly encrypted of the associated profile . Upon receipt of a wireless communication each II Device will verify or authenticate the command by referring to the stored profile s in the communication. If the profile from the wireless communication recovered from the II Devices memory matches that of the stored profile s then the II Device will execute the appropriate response specified by the wireless communication . If not then the II Device will disregard the communication . The process ends then at block . Referring now to a flow chart of a process for saving settings under a profile in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown and referred to as element . The process begins in block . After a user has created a profile when a user creates any number of settings or information as represented as programs defaults groups scenes favorites or other information the settings and related information can be saved to the device application memory under the heading of the user s profile . This would allow for replication and or back up of user preferences to avoid loss of data and user convenience . In addition this would allow for sharing duplication and restoration of user settings through authentication means by referring to the user profile .

In some cases a user could save their profile and associated settings to a computer either through the back up of the application to application management software or through some light control system specific back up software. In addition the profile information and settings could be saved or backed up through a direct connection or through some wireless connection. In addition the profile information could be saved to a remote data center or in the cloud .

After a profile is saved or backed up a user could restore settings and profile information to an existing or new wireless device device application . A user could share the profile information and authentication as described in and included here as block . A similar process would be used for adding a new wireless device with device application running the same profile or duplication . Note that there may be multiple profiles assigned to one lighting control system or II Device network. Similarly the same device application could host multiple user profiles. The same profile could be shared across multiple wireless devices. The timing and exact process of a profile saving event might differ depending on the device application. It might happen and reoccur at automatically at given time periods or events or require some input from the user to either specify events times or require a user to select a save option. Though the actual process might be ongoing for the purposes of this description the process ends in block .

All II Devices s will have unique id s . Ids will depend upon the types of II Device embodiments a there could be different types of II Devices depending upon the application where they will be used e.g. II Devices made for higher light luminosity output and limited color range could be called as type 1 II Device while II Device with only white light output with controllable brightness could be called as type 2 II Device. Similarly there would be different types of II Devices based upon different shapes and or sizes and or features and or light outputs in terms of colors and brightness. b there could be numerous potential ID structuring of the II Devices but consider the below as a representative example 

II Device id will have following structure with aaabbbccc . aaa could be any number of characters defining the device as II Device. These characters will be common and at the same place in the ids of all II Device. bbb could be any number of characters defining the type of II Device. These characters will be common for a particular type of II Device but will be different for different types of II Devices. These characters will at the same place in the id of all II Devices. ccc could be any number of characters and with that II Devices will get a unique id. For example consider id illdev001001012712 illdev012234010512 for two different II Devices here first ten characters II Device in both the ids will identify the device as II Device. Next four characters t001 in first id and t012 in second id identifies the devices as different types of II Devices. Last 9 characters 001012712 in first id and 234010512 in second id combined with other characters defines a unique id for the two II Devices.

The wireless lighting control system including both wireless devices and II Devices will be able to differentiate its related commands from other wireless communication system commands through the unique IDs prefix such as aaa . Additionally a wireless communication within the wireless lighting control system would also be associated with a profile id for authentication purposes. When a wireless device then sends a command to an II Device it will send the command directed at the specific ID required to execute that command. Similarly there could be a command related to a specific ID that is embedded in a command sent to another II Device ID in this case the second command would communicate to send the command to the second II Device. See mesh network processes for further information.

Profile Sharing. A user s profile including their configured settings can be transferred in a multitude of ways from an authenticated device application wireless device to other non authenticated device applications wireless devices to provide authentication share profile settings and information or other profile related information. Utilizing the device application there is an option to pass on authorization to the lighting control system II Device network from one wireless device to another wireless device. Additionally a user can share or copy their profile saved settings with another wireless device. The receiving wireless device would need to have some version of the device application on their device. There are a few different processes one could take to execute profile sharing but consider the below as an example 

Now referring to a block diagram of a device to device profile sharing process in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown and referred to as . To execute this process one would open the authenticated device application on one wireless device as represented by . Then open the device application on the receiving or new wireless device as represented by . A user would then select command on the authenticated wireless device application to share profile. Might in some cases need to select command on the non authenticated wireless device to receive shared profile. The authenticated wireless device might then be prompted to select what aspect of the settings to share such as provide access to network share groupings share programming copy full profile settings or mirror full profile settings. Upon selection of aspects to share the wireless devices would then connect via a wireless communication Bluetooth most likely and begin transferring the selected information as represented by from the authenticated wireless device to the receiving wireless device. Upon receiving the selected information the user should have access to whatever aspects were selected.

Referring now to a flow chart of a process for adding an authenticated profile directly through the II Device in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown and referred to as . In this process the authenticated profile would send a wireless communication to the wireless control system II Device network represented by with the command to add the non authenticated profile to each II Device s list of authenticated profiles. Each II Device represented here collectively as would then execute the command and add the authenticated profile to each II Device s list of authenticated profiles as represented collectively by . Once complete the non authenticated profile would then be authenticated and able to communicate and control the lighting control system II Device network as represented by . Also consider that a user could share transfer a profile to one other device through text. An alternate way to share profile and settings would be to select an option through the application to send a text message to another phone. This method would be useful when both devices are not present and the second device is a mobile device. The text message would include a unique URL to download the application and auto populate the profile username and possibly the password. In addition consider that multiple devices could simply refer or log in to an existing authenticated profile that has been saved to some accessible source. This would allow any wireless device with an associated device application to access receive or create and authenticate a new profile by logging in with the authenticated profile s credentials username password .

Now referring to a flow chart of a hard reset process in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown. The process begins with block . A hard reset with physical button and restore to system will now be described. Included in the design of the II Device might be an external button that when pushed resets the II Device back to its original manufacturing state. This will be helpful when moving II Devices from different locations or power sources for troubleshooting purposes and for security purposes especially when a user no longer has access to the application device. The physical description and system composing the hard reset can be found in the II Device section HHHH. The process by which the hard reset occurs will be referred to as and is described as follows beginning with block a a user will physically activate the reset button on the outside of an II Device b a signal will then be sent to the internal processor of the II Device with commands to execute the hard reset program that will erase all user added memory and return to the manufactured state c the processor and related components of the II Device will execute the required commands of the hard reset program d all user added memory will be erased from the II Device not including factory added memory e the II Device will return back to the manufacturing state . The process for set up would continue with . The hard reset process ends with block .

Referring now to a flow chart of a soft reset through application in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown and referred to as . Included in the device application is an option that when selected will reset an II Device or multiple II Devices back to their original manufacturing state. This will be helpful when moving II Devices from different locations or power sources for troubleshooting purposes and for security purposes. The soft reset process begins with block . Within the application device a user would select a setting that activates the soft resets command and program . This setting may or may not require authentication through entering of the users profile and password . The user would then select specific the II Device s and or groups including the entire lighting network with which to execute the soft reset function . A user might use the color coding process to select individual II Devices.

Upon selection a wireless communication will be sent from the wireless device device application to each illuminated device selected through the appropriate communication methods . When each II Device receives the communication the processor and related components will execute the soft reset program and commands and all user added memory will be erased from the II Device . Each II Device will return to the manufacturing state . The process for set up would continue with . The soft reset process ends with block .

Now referring to a flow chart of a process for adding a new II Device into an existing II Device network in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown and referred to as . This is the process by which a user can easily introduce into the II Device network.

Introducing a new II Device to an existing II Device network follows a similar process as first setting up an II Device for the first time. Process is similar to quick set up and easy room set up processes. There are many potential processes to adding an II Device s to an existing network here is one example. The process begins with block . The intended II Device s will be in a manufacturing default either coming from initial purchase or through a reset process . A user will connect the II Device s to a power source most likely by screwing in and turning on a light switch and the II Device s will receive power and enter the power restoration mode . Upon receiving power the II Device s will enter II Device s will be prone to discovery by the device application run on a wireless device and other II Devices within proximity . In addition the II Device s will execute the manufacturing default light setting . Then upon a user input on the device application or through a status update process where the new II Devices are found the device application will execute the process for adding an II Device to the application . To elaborate the status update process as discussed in might call for the device application to look for all II Devices in proximity. This search will include identifying those II Devices that are not yet assigned to a profile or in a manufacturing state. Next the device application and associated wireless device establish a connection with the II Device s . The device application might then provide an option for the user to confirm whether they are adding other II Devices to the II Device network . If a user selects no it will ignore the II Device s request to pair and end the process of adding a new II Device to an existing network . This might happen by rare chance when people in neighboring buildings install II Devices at the same time within range from each other. If a user selects yes to confirm the addition of new II Device s the II Device s and device application will follow the process outline in blocks collectively represented here by block . This includes storing the light ID in the device application memory and storing the profile ID in the device application memory. Then in place of block to move forward with the set up process a user might then be prompted with other choices on how to set up and customize the II Devices within the network including adding the selection to an existing group creating a new group with new or mirrored settings for the selection or creating custom settings for each II Device in the selection . Depending on the user s request the appropriate set up would continue as described in other various set up processes until complete .

Now referring to a block diagram of a color coding identification process in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown and referred to as . It might be difficult for a user to select a specific II Device s for troubleshooting or configuration especially as the number of II Devices within a network increases. To improve the process of selecting specific II Device s described here is a method to temporarily change the color of II Devices in the II Device network and similarly provide a display of different II Devices on the device application that mimic the same colors of their representative II Devices. This process might be executed in relation to a number of different activities or processes. We ll assume for simplicity sake that any potential processes could trigger the process to color the II Devices and refer to such an event as color coding process trigger .

Upon a color coding process trigger the device application would assign a different color to each of any number of selected II Devices and or groups. The device application wireless device would then send a wireless communication to each of the selected II Devices to execute a light control setting relating to the assigned color for that II Device. The device application as represented by would then display all of the selected II Devices with a representation of the light that s emitted by that particular II Device each represented as . A user would then be able to visually see which II Device relates to the II Device representations in the device application and easily select the intended II Device s . For example the II Device represented by would be colored red in some fashion and the actual corresponding II Device would emit the same red color.

Referring now to various diagrams of sorting screens based on various criterions in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention are shown. For certain screens within the device application it would be beneficial to sort the list of II Devices and or groups in some fashion that would be relevant to the user. Disclosed here are some basic sorting methods with which to sort certain lists found within screens of the device application.

As shown in and represented by it would often be the case that a user would want to command or control II Devices in closer physical proximity than those in further proximity to the user. To support this scenario certain lists in the device application could be sorted by signal strength with stronger signals displayed first in the device application represented as example by . This could relate to lists of a II Devices sorted based on individual signal strength b Groups sorted based on average signal strength of related II Devices c Programs scenes sorted based on average signal strength of related II Devices. The figure represents a list of groups sorted by signal strength with each group and its associated signal strength represented by .

As shown in and represented by it would often be the case that a user would want to command or control II Devices that are currently executing some command. To support this scenario certain lists in the device application could be sorted by their active status with items that are on displayed first represented as example by . This could relate to lists of a II Devices II Devices that are on displayed first b Groups Groups that are on displayed first c Programs scenes Programs scenes that are active displayed first. The figure represents a list of groups sorted by active status with each group and its associated signal strength represented by .

As shown in and represented by considering that at times all II Devices might not be available because their power source is turned off light switch or they are out of range it might be beneficial to sort filter certain lists of items in the device application based on received statuses so that only those II Devices for which statuses are received by the wireless device are displayed or displayed first represented as example by . This would relate mostly to II Devices and groups but possibly to programs and scenes where the un addressable II Devices number is large. The figure represents a list of groups sorted by addressable status with each group and its associated signal strength represented by .

It would often be the case that a user would want to sort or filter items in the device application based on some personal preferences or settings. This might be flexible and configurable or permanent depending on the application. Note that different sorting methods could be combined in different ways so as to first sort by one method and then another. This would vary depending on the specific screen in the device application.

Now referring to a flow chart of an automation programming process in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown and referred to as . Automation refers to the program to be activated at user specified conditions pertaining to day s of the week times and or dates. The process begins with block . A user will select an option in the device application to create a program specifically here an automation program . The user will select any combination and number of II Device s or group s . The user will then select the intended light setting or program to be executed based on the automation condition . This might originate from new user customization existing saved user favorites and defaults or as a suggested setting or program . The intended light setting might be a single action or more of a program in itself as multiple actions run successively. For example a simple automation program would turn the II Device s on to a specific setting and color at a defined time. Alternately another automation program would be to turn II Device s on and off successively. The user will then select a specific day s of the week date and or time to execute the setting and or program . The request could be a single event or repeating event selected by the user. For example start on date time stop on date time. Or run every third Monday of the month etc. A user would have the option to save the automation program and or execute the automation program at that time . If the user saves the automation program it can be re run at another time by following the process described in . If the user chooses to execute the newly created automation program the device application wireless device in coordination with the respective II Devices will execute the command as described in as if the program was activated as beginning with block . After both cases the creation process would conclude as represented by .

Similar to all programs the user can toggle automation programs on off via the device application. When the program is off the II Device s will not store the command in memory. When the automation program is toggled on in the future the command will be resent to the appropriate II Devices. In the case that conflicting programs are active with the user requested II Device s and time the device application might notify the user and ask for the user to select which program they would like to keep active. Alternately the II Device s will internally have a priority level assigned to different profiles and or types of requests.

An alarm timer relates to a program process by which at a certain user designated time or lapse of time an action would occur in any number of II Devices or group of II Devices. The alarm timer processes are similar to those described for general programs and automation programs. Through the device application a user would select the program to run the alarm or timer and select the II Devices and or groups to execute the program. An alarm selection signifies that at a certain selected time the selected II Devices and or groups would execute an alarm command to adjust lighting to the user s requested command. The requested command might be of a dynamic nature or a program in itself so as an execution of multiple commands in sequence such as a flashing or changing of color or brightness. When an alarm program is selected the device application would interpret the time requested by the user and send a command to the lights and or groups selected to execute the command or series of commands at that specified time. Each II Device would receive the commands through the wireless communication interpret the commands by the processor and then store the request in memory to be executed at a later time. Inside each II Device the processor would monitor the internal real time clock and look for a match in the clock s time to the alarm program request stored in memory. If it matches then the processor would execute the alarm command s .

A timer selection signifies that after a certain amount of time passes an II Device or combination of II Devices would act in some predefined manor. The user would first select the II Device s and or group s or multiple to run the program. Then the user selects the amount of time in minutes hours etc. via their application. Once selected then the device running the application will send a wireless signal to the designated II Device s with the specific amount of time to count down from. At the point when all the II Device s confirm receipt of the timer request to the device s application the timer will begin in unison with all II Device s applicable. Each II Device will then countdown using internal real time clock processor and other embedded components. If multiple II Devices they will count down individually but all in unison. When the timer reaches zero the II Device s will execute the command requested by the user. A user can request to repeat any timer programs to count down and then repeat. The application interface might also present a timer display showing the amount of time counting down. Upon reaching zero the application might also present some other actions within the application. This time down feature might also be valued for gaming scenarios using the II Devices as signals.

Referring now to a flow chart of a music sync process in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown and referred to as . This is a type of program specifically for automatically synchronizing the II Device s to music played on the same enabled device. The process begins with block . Through the device application or through a specialty device application the user will access the music sync program . The user would then select the II Device s with which to sync the music . The user will then select the type of II Device arrangement and the light setting theme . Options for selection could depend on a number of different factors such as the number of II Devices selected the proximity of the selected II Devices suggested options user history or saved preferences or completely new customized configurations . For example considering the arrangement if the number of II Devices is then the device application will only sync to a mono type interpretation of the audio. If number of II Devices is 2 or more then the device application will evenly distribute and assign each II Device to either of the 2 primary L R stereo channels within the music file. The device application will visibly show each II Device and to which channel L R the II Device is assigned to.

Further considering arrangement if a music file is able to carry multiple channels or if the music file can be broken into multiple channels based on frequency pitch or other aspects of sound an II Device could similarly be assigned or distributed across multiple II Devices. Similarly considering selection of the light theme the device application might display potential lighting themes options for the user to select or the user can customize their own preferences. Here there might be default settings that have a color and or brightness theme associated with each channel. The settings will be variations of color or themes of color assigned to each channel. For example one might include all colors available randomly assigned to each II Device. Another option might allow for the channel colors to change over time. Another option might suggest only red hued colors or any other type of color hue. Once an arrangement and lighting theme is selected the user will be able to see and verify the selection . At any time the user will be able to reconfigure the arrangement or light themes such as to move or reassign lights to different channels select between mono or stereo lighting modes or choose a different theme. Once the configuration is selected the application device will notify the selected II Devices of the command and ensure all II Devices are ready and addressable . This will be done via the appropriate communication and control processes. The user would then select music file s stored on the device or streaming music to be played . As the music is played through the device application the device application will interpret the music file wavelengths to send continuing commands to each II Device previously selected to turn on and off adjust brightness and change colors depending on the music construct within that channel at that time and the selected arrangement and theme .

Possibilities for interpreting the music construct is as follows For each music channel in the music file L R when there some output of sound to be played or amplitude in the music that would correlate with the light s assigned to that channel to turn on to emit light . For example if a bass drum is played in the left channel the audible sound would coordinate to the visible light from that assigned left channel s II Device s . For each channel as previously assigned the brightness of the light emitted by each II Device could brighten or dim dependent on the respective increase or decrease in amplitude of the music within that channels music file. Such as that louder sounds would coordinate with brighter lights and vice versa. Respective amplitude would be the dependent variable not true amplitude. Additionally different pitch ranges might correlate with different color combinations of light output. Additionally the bpm beats per minute might be interpreted so that after a standard measure of bars time of playing the color or channel assignment of the II Devices might change.

A user could also adjust the overall brightness maximum output to their preference through the device application similarly referred to in the figure as . This information would be taken into context before relaying commands through to the II Devices. The application device would automatically or through user input manage and match the output of audio to the output of lighting commands and delay the audio output to any delay in communication to the II Devices so as the actual sound heard through a speaker would match the same time that the light illuminated from the II Device s . The application would continue to run on the device while continuing to interpret translate the music and channels played into commands to be executed by the assigned II Device s . When the music sync program application is stopped or exited the assigned II Devices would revert back to their previous programmed state if applicable or default level . The music sync program application would complete .

A predefined program so a user can set their II Devices to slowly turn on with certain color displays at specific times to simulate the effect of a sunrise. In many parts of the world people have to get up before the sun this process allows for a user to select their II Devices to turn on slowly mimicking a sunrise before their alarm or at a certain time to help wake them up. Setting up the program through the device application a user could select the special program through the predefined program list or through the groups menu. The sunrise program would be a suggested program for those groups containing the word bedroom . The user would be able to adjust the length and type of sunrise if they choose. Type relates to variations in color schemes. The user will be asked to enter a time for the sunrise program to execute or to create an alarm with the sunrise. If the alarm program is also set the two could be run simultaneously or within one program. Once set and accepted the application device will communicate the automation program request to the selected light s . The light s will receive the automation program request and store the program in memory to be executed upon the requested time. The program settings could be saved for future use or set to run at any frequency similar to any automation program.

Executing the program. When the sunrise program is active the program will be executed similar to any other automation or alarm program. The suggested colors used in the sunrise program will most likely include orange and red colors that would brighten over time until fully lit when the alarm or timer condition is met. Blue LEDs might also be included to provide the short wavelength light mimicking that of the sun.

In some embodiments a light will be connected or equipped with an ambient light sensor that can detect the light levels present within an area relay that information to the II Device s controller which could be interpreted as a program input resulting in a change in the lighting brightness and or color. Various programs are possible to utilize the II Device sensor s information as an input to causing some output in terms of a change in the brightness and or color of one or more II Devices. In one program example a user will select a preferred light level for II Device s or group s through the device application. Each II Device can have a different setting giving the user to select any number of unique combinations. Selecting the preferred level might also be done through the user defined defaults for each II Device. When selected the device application will then send a request through the controlling device to each II Device that the user has selected through the program asking for each II Device s related ambient light sensor information. The device application upon receiving the light sensor information will store the default settings in the application or device s memory relative to each II Device. Alternatively the II Device itself will record the sensor information in its own memory. The user can then at any other time activate an automatic adjustment program. Upon activation the device application will send a communication to each II Device associated with the program. The communication will instruct each II Device to compare the current II Device sensor information against that associated with the preferred lighting level. This information would either stored in the II Device s memory or relayed via the device application s communication.

The II Device would then adjust its brightness and or color depending on the light sensor data s relationship between the current and preferred lighting level. Simplified if the current light sensor showed less luminosity than the preferred level then the II Device would increase its own brightness. Alternately if the current light sensor showed more luminosity than the preferred level then the II Device would decrease its own brightness. The relationship between the difference in current and preferred light received will not be an equal or absolute relationship to the change in the brightness of the light. Alternatively it will be some functional relationship dependent on the absolute and respective levels of light. The program and or II Devices themselves would repeat this process for the duration that the program is active.

Now referring to a block diagram of a LED driver scheme in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown. Various LEDs arms and are driven by the LED drivers and as shown. The LEDs drivers turn ON or OFF based on the ON or OFF signal provided by the microcontroller processor as shown. When LED driver is ON current passes through its LEDs arm and LEDs in that arm produces light. LEDs arms LEDs1 LEDs2 LEDs3 and LEDs4 can have different types of LEDs including different colors and different electronic ratings. Each LEDs arm may have one or multiple LEDs in a series or parallel or combinations of those. With the driver scheme as per color mixing can be achieved by controlling the signals to the LED Drivers Sig1 Sig2 Sig3 and Sig4 which in turn control the ON OFF times of the LED drivers individually i.e. by toggling the pins individually to ON or OFF states at a frequency that could be above 85 Hz. To limit the sum of the currents going through different LED drivers at a time one could make sure not to have multiple pins controlling signals Sig1 Sig2 Sig3 and Sig4 of the LED drivers ON at a time. This could be achieved by a program running in the processor that controls the pins ON OFF states. In this way one need not have a PWM control of the LEDs drivers which also helps to optimize the frequency required to run the LED drivers taking into the consideration their maximum and minimum frequency of operation and flickering issues associated with the LEDs being driven by their respective drivers.

An example of how this circuitry and program controlling the pins work will now be described with a specific case having these assumptions 1 The high level ON signal if passing through each of the Pins Pin1 Pin2 Pin3 and Pin4 in passes at every 10 ms of a time period 2 The ON signals through each of the pins are not overlapping 3 LED drivers are designed for 1 A output current i.e. when any Pin is set high ON it makes the respective driver ON allowing up to 1 A current pass through its LED arm 4 The user wants a yellow light output at the maximum luminosity possible for which LEDs1 and LEDs2 should be illuminated equally by sending same amount of average current through them 5 LEDs1 LEDs2 LEDs3 and LEDs4 arms have multiple RED Green Blue and White LEDs in series respectively 6 For full luminosity of yellow light that can be produced through this scheme the average current passing through RED LEDs and Green LEDs should be half the maximum average current possible through them which can be achieved by turning LEDs drivers ON OFF as per the timing diagram in . For 40 of the maximum luminosity of yellow light RED LEDs should be ON for 20 time and Green LEDs should be ON for 20 time as shown with the signals SIG1 and SIG2 in . Similarly to produce a type of orange light consisting of 40 of Red 20 Green and 10 of White could be achieved as per .

The 10 ms time period in the timing diagrams in B and are divided based on the count set into the controller processor which may come from another device communicating through various means such as Smartphone computer etc. connected through wires or wirelessly. Consider that the 10 ms time period is just an example. Referring to this time period can vary based on the counts for respective LEDs with which the ON or OFF times for a particular LED signal are calculated. For example consider that the RGB or equivalent counts to control the II Device are such that the Red is required to be ON for 20 of the overall time Green is required to be ON for 30 of time and White required to be ON for 50 . Here Red SIG1 turns ON for 2 ms and then turns OFF as soon as Red turns OFF Green SIG2 turns ON for 3 ms and then turns OFF and as soon as Green turns OFF White SIG4 turns ON for 5 ms and then turns OFF and this cycle repeats. Here the total ON OFF time cycle for any LED is 10 ms. Now consider a second scenario where the RGB or equivalent counts are such that the Red is required to be ON for 50 and Green is required to be ON for 50 . Here Red SIG1 turns ON for 2 ms then turns OFF as soon as Red turns OFF Green SIG2 will turn ON for 2 ms and then turns OFF and cycle repeats. Here the total ON OFF cycle time for LED is 4 ms which is different than the previous scenario. In addition consider a third scenario where Red is required to be ON for 25 and Green is required to be ON for 25 . Here Red SIG1 turns ON for 1 ms then turns OFF as soon as Red turns OFF Green SIG2 will turn ON after 1 ms for ams and then turns OFF and cycle repeats. In this scenario the time cycle is still 4 ms but the total time Red and Green are ON is 50 as compared to previous scenario giving 50 less brightness out of the Red and White LEDs in the same time cycle of 4 ms. Having flexibility in the time cycle as for different color and or brightness combinations helps in reducing the overheads for the processor in calculating the cycle time and ON and OFF times for each LED. To further explain with an example consider that the Red Green Blue and White counts for a particular color are Red equal to 255 Green equal to 127 and Blue and White equal to 0. Also consider that the processor s internal clock generates the overall time period and triggers ON and OFF signals for LEDs. In this situation the processor can count down from 255 to 0 or count up from 0 to 255 forming a time period let s assume that turns out to be 2.55 ms for which Red SIG1 will be ON. While immediately after Red turns OFF Green SIG2 will be triggered with the turn ON signal and will remain ON until the countdown is from 127 to 0 which making Green turned ON for 1.27 ms. Similarly if the counts are 255 for RED 100 for Green and 200 for Blue LED the countdown for each of these LEDs will directly generate the time cycle where Red SIG1 is now ON for 2.55 ms then OFF turning Green SIG2 immediately ON for 1.00 ms and when Green SIG2 turns OFF after 1.00 ms Blue SIG3 turns ON for 2.00 ms and then Turns OFF immediately turning ON Red SIG1 and repeating the cycle. In these two scenarios as explained the ON OFF time cycle for LED is 3.82 ms 2.55 ms 1.27 ms for first scenario while ON OFF time cycle is for LED in second situation is 5.55 ms 2.55 ms 1.00 ms 2.00 ms . In these scenarios the 100 counts countdown is equivalent to 1.00 ms however then it could be different depending upon the processor type clock it is running ON the clock division multiplication being taken place inside the processor and division multiplication defined for Red Green Blue and White counts to ensure they are proportional to each other. For example even if in one scenario the count for Red is 255 for Green is 100 and for Blue and White is 0 the processor may multiply or divide the count by certain number such as multiply 2 making them 510 200 0 and 0 for Red Green Blue and White respectively to address any limitations of the LED driver s minimum turn ON and OFF time requirements and to ensure minimum cycle requirement for maintaining the persistence of vision requirement which many times considered as minimum of 85 Hz cycle . This way the overheads of complex calculations for calculating the time cycle ON OFF time for each LED are minimized saving processor s processing power for other required calculations and giving better response. In addition there is no need of using complex PWM Pulse Width Modulation of the signal and calculations required to calculate parameters of PWM every time to control the light output. With this configuration a processor that is cost effective and has low processing power can be used.

In the process is explained in general. Controller processor receives counts corresponding to at least one LED output in Block . The controller processor multiplies or divides the count if and when required considering the ON OFF trigger cycle that is dependent on processors internal clock cycle and persistence of vision requirement in block . After the counts for LEDs are calculated in block the controller processor turns the signal ON by toggling the signal pin to logic 1 for first color LED out of given N LEDs and starts the countdown from respective calculated LED count to 0 and then turns the signal OFF by toggling the signal pin to logic 0. In block controller processor waits with next countdown when all LEDs are supposed to be OFF depending upon the brightness level requirement. The countdown could be as low as 0. For example the LED counts calculated for full intensity of color with Red Blue Green and White are 252 100 0 and 0 respectively then the counts for Blue Green and White for 75 intensity would be 189 75 0 and 0. For full intensity the Red signal will become high i.e. Red LED ON for countdown from 254 to 0 and then it will become low i.e. Red LED OFF. Immediately after that the Green signal will become high i.e. Green LED ON for countdown from 100 to 0 then it will turn OFF. As Blue and White counts are 0 they will not Turn ON but remain OFF. Thereafter the cycle with RED turning ON immediately continues. However for 50 intensity the Red signal will turn high i.e. Red LED ON for countdown from 189 to 0 and then it will turn OFF and will remain OFF for countdown from 63 calculated as 252 189 to 0. Immediately after that Green will turn ON for countdown from 75 to 0 and then it will turn OFF and will remain OFF for countdown from 25 calculated as 100 75 to 0. With Blue and White counts 0 Blue and White LED will always remain OFF. The cycle repeats until new counts are available. This countdown method could be different however it will be intended to keep percentage of Signal of a particular LED ON out of entire time cycle same as calculated in above example. Blocks and explain the process in general. The cycle repeats until the new counts for LEDs for new color and brightness combination are provided or calculated as shown in general in blocks and .

With such control of LED drivers and which include non overlapping ON signals for two or more LED drivers one gets the ability to get the brightest light possible from the LEDs in respective arm in the scheme with the limited power available from the power supply. One is able to design the LED drivers for the maximum possible current possible through LED arm irrespective of how many additional LED arms are required from the given power supply. For example one can keep one LED driver ON continuously and pass maximum current possible through its LED arm and get highest possible output. Similarly if one could pass ON signal for first half of the cycle through one LED arm by keeping its LED driver ON for that time and ON signal for the second half of the cycle through other LED arm getting maximum light output for the color formed by mixing the lights from the LED arms in the proportion of their ON times.

This also allows optimizing the frequency of the ON OFF signal to LED drivers reducing the dependency upon limitation of the time required for drivers to change their state i.e. from ON to OFF and vice versa as compared to the sequential non overlapping PWM signals. It also reduces the overhead on the controller processor as it need not create many numbers of PWM signals for controlling various drivers which in turn controls current through respective LED arms of LEDs. It is now achievable by toggling the pins from high ON state to low OFF state only. In addition the controller can be programmed to keep OFF time between the two non overlapping ON signals as shown in . This helps drivers to start earlier making sure that the current through it reaches to the required peak level i.e. turns ON fully by the time it is supposed to do so.

All these defaults could be executed with various ON OFF cycles provided by an external electronic switch controlling the power of the II Device such as wall switch in this case. For example the Manufacturing Default could be executed when the wall switch associated with the II Device is turned ON and OFF two times in a specific time period such as four seconds. A particular Passive Light Default could be achieved by turning II Device ON and OFF four times in five seconds through a light switch . Similarly other light defaults can be executed with other switch ON OFF combination cycles. The ON OFF combinations here are type of a trigger for the II Device or and various such combinations form different triggers. These triggers through a switch are particular ON and OFF times those are stored during the process by controller processor in its internal memory or memory on board or memory of an external peripherals or controlling devices such as that of a remote controlling device with which II Device or is communicating wirelessly. Then these stored ON OFF times are compared to check if any defined trigger in the similar memory has been generated based on which II Device or execute particular light default or light settings.

One way to achieve this is by defining various ON OFF times defining triggers into the II Device s memory . When II Devices or is switched ON OFF at a particular cycle this cycle is stored and compared by the controller processor or remote controlling device to execute the required default. The II Device s RTC or clock of remote controlling device could be used to monitor and store the ON OFF switching times the into a specific memory.

In addition the user can provide triggers not only though a switch controlling power to II Devices but other external devices connected through wire s electrically or wirelessly to the II Device or . Furthermore Light Defaults could be a specific light setting with a specific color and brightness or a light program that changes the light output as a function of time or other events.

Referring II Device could be controlled signals through remote controlling device that has at least one or combination of built in sensor s in following categories 

Referring the above mentioned sensor could be a part of a remote controlling device capable of communicating with and controlling the II Device s . In addition referring to above mentioned sensors could be a part of other peripheral device that could communicate with II Device s through other intermediate remote controlling device s . In the an example is shown where a remote controlling device with motion sensor or accelerometer is shaken or moved or rotated in a particular direction at least once to produce a predefined signal that in turn makes remote controlling device to send a command or data to the II Device to execute a particular light setting or function. Similarly in device with sensor sends command or data for such predefined signal to II Device directly or through intermediate remote controlling device to execute a particular light setting or function .

The II Device system will have a specific Software Development Kit SDK and or Application Program Interface API for developer s to build various programs and features for the II Devices s . Referring to the software developer gathers requirements from the customer or the market and converts the requirements into specifications and algorithms that consist of various Lighting Automation and Controlling Functions see defined for the intelligent illumination device . II Device will contain unique functions which could be used by a software application developer to implement different applications or feature. For example the functions may include 

Referring to depending on location and proximity the wireless signal strength between an II Device and a controlling device can vary. In addition any impediments such as a wall can also have an effect reducing the wireless signal strength between an II Device s and and a Remote Wireless Device capable of communicating with II Device s and . The remote wireless device and II Device s and can then be put in a state where when signal strengths and are detected beyond a certain threshold then the II Device should execute a command.

The exact threshold and the command could be user adjusted or preset. In this scenario a user with the remote wireless device which could be remote controlling device for II Device s and could move around an area where the II Device s are stationary and while moving around the signal strengths and would vary and only those II Device s with a signal strength and above the certain threshold would be activated. Similarly when the remote wireless device continues to move and the signal strength diminishes past the threshold then the II Device s and can have a separate command such as turning off.

The II Device s and and the remote wireless device might be set by a user in a state to monitor signal strength and and thus execute the proximity program. It might also be scheduled by a user to be executed at set times. In some scenarios the controlling device will search for II Devices assess their signal strength and and send commands to the II Devices that have signal strengths and above the threshold. In other scenarios the II Devices will search for the remote wireless or controlling device to come into direct range assess the signal strength and and take action accordingly. Or it can be some combination of the two. The search between the II Devices and the remote wireless or controlling device can be continuous or intermittent at some defined time e.g. every second.

In some cases variations or some effect on signal strength and can be interpreted as some barrier such as a wall between the II Device and the remote wireless or controlling device . If the signal strength and is interpreted as having a barrier such as a wall between the II Device and the controlling device then the command to turn on might be disregarded even if the signal strength and is above the threshold for activation. In addition the controlling device or II Devices might have information related to the general layout of the II Devices and barriers in between. This can come from user generated information historical use patterns or II Devices relative signal strengths and from each other. The remote wireless or controlling device might use this information to similarly make assumptions on whether an II Device is intended to be controlled within proximity. For example assume II Device 1 and 2 are in room A and II Device 3 and 4 are within room B. If in Room A then the true signal strength for II Device 1 and 2 would be beyond the proximity threshold but consider II Device 3 is also beyond the proximity threshold but II Device 4 is not beyond the proximity threshold. Here the controlling device could interpret this as the user being in room A and only send a proximity command to II Device 1 and 2 ignoring II Device 3.

Various application interfaces will now be described. On the controlling device for II Device the user interface for the application can be made to be intuitive and representative of the lighting environment. There are multiple potential facets that could be combined to create an intuitive user interface not limited to a real time representation of some or all lights their status and any active programs.

Referring to in terms of representation the II Devices can be set up in a representation similar to that of an overhead view of the space in which the II Devices are installed i.e. a visual or virtual representation . In this case there can be a user led or automated process to place II Devices in respective locations on the screen. In addition there might be a user generated or automated process where a user set s up their II Devices within the framework of rooms such as living room in the figure. Here a user would be prompted to create an approximate representation of the walls of a room then drag or input where the II Devices are related to the room layout . The creation of the walls can be done in multiple ways using direct user input dragging using corners or using predefined shapes as well as camera functionality and estimation tools. Once a room is defined and II Devices within a room are defined a user can select the room as a whole or drill into individual lights within the room.

Further a user can add II Devices to an existing room or create new rooms as representations and add other II Devices into that room. Here multiple rooms could be joined together to create a full overhead layout with walls or spaces in between as per representation in the figure. Multiple rooms can be joined together to create different floors so that a user can select between overhead representations of different floors. Further multiple II Devices can be combined together to create smaller clusters or groups of II Devices. Here the cluster would be editable but treated at the layer in the general user interface as one II Device.

This provides a scalable user interface depending on the number of II Devices and the number of rooms configured by the user but also provides an easy representation of all lights at any time. A user can select a whole house a floor a room or individual lights within the selection area by zooming in or zooming out. In addition a user can select any combination of floors rooms or lights to select or create a quick grouping at any time. The overhead representation would include whether each individual II Device is on or off the brightness and potentially any active or scheduled programs or lighting effects. In addition to working as a representation of multiple II Devices the overhead representation can be utilized for other intelligent devices or sensors related to the environment.

As the II Devices can represent colors as well as variations of white with different saturation levels the application representation in the controlling device needs to have a similar representation. Referring to in the application interface this can be represented by having a color area a white light amplitude saturation area and brightness area . The color area could be a color wheel or box representative of the available color combinations the white area could be a rotating or directional level . When the white light area is at the lowest level the color area would be fully saturated with bright colors shown as R G and B. When the white light area is at its highest level the color area would be almost completely white. In between incremental increases in the white light level would have an effect to add less saturation to the color area looking like a white gradient overlaid on the color area shown with sB sG and sR stands for less saturation of R G and B . Here if multiple II Devices with differing ranges in color saturation are present the controlling device will note this and only allow the white light level to reduce to the appropriate level representative of the less flexible II Devices range.

Any selection could also be saved by the user to a default area on the screen for quick selection such as presets i.e. when user presses defined preset the selected II Device would emit the color brightness and saturation of the selected preset. In addition brightness could also be adjusted independently as a proportional amount of brightness emitted by the II Devices by controlling the brightness area . All these representation areas could be given different intuition however the concept of controlling the color saturation and brightness of II Device s through user interface would remain the same.

As an alternative to wireless control through a controlling device some embodiments might rather or also have a manual hue adjustment option with some mechanical input such as a button a knob or the like. A user can adjust the hue color or brightness of the II Device. One example of a button would be a rotating ring around the edge of the II Device that in different positions would relate to different hues or colors. With torque a user could turn the ring to create different ring effects. Another example would be a very low voltage conductive area on the outside of the light that when touched would change the color or hue. Again another version might be a button or switch somewhere on the embodiment that when turned would create a different hue brightness or color.

Now referring to a flow chart of scheduling programs for operating a lighting device in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown. The user selects II Device s to be programmed with scheduling lighting programs effects or configurations through user interface on a remote wireless device such as wireless controlling device or smartphone in block . For scheduling a single II Device or a group of II Devices the user enters program s with at least one parameter such as date time to turn II Device ON OFF or change light output brightness saturation color duration of the program number of repeats through user interface on controlling device in block . The programs are created and stored or are already stored in at least one of the memories such as the processor controller s internal memory on board memory in the memory of remote wireless device or any other peripheral device communicating to II Device directly through wires or wirelessly or indirectly through other intermediate devices in block . In case of multiple programs those could conflict light outputs from the same II Device s the user can assign priorities to the programs to avoid conflicting situations for II Device s light output in block . The user programs the II Device s and II Device s run the program s in block .

Referring now to a flow chart of selecting a lighting sequence of a lighting device in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown. The user selects at least one II Device on which user wants to run the lighting sequence lighting programs effects or configurations through a user interface on a remote wireless device such as smartphone or a wireless controlling device in block . The user sends command to run at least one lighting sequence which is stored in at least one of the memories such as the processor controller s internal memory on board memory in the memory of remote wireless device or any other peripheral device communicating to II Device directly through wires or wirelessly or indirectly through other intermediate devices in block . In case of multiple lighting sequences those could conflict light outputs from the same II Device s the user can assign priorities to the lighting sequences to avoid conflicting situations for II Device s light output in block . Thereafter the user programs the II Device s and II Device s run the program s in block .

Now referring to a flow chart of storing various parameters for a lighting device in accordance with the present invention is shown. The II Device and or remote device stores various parameters such as the II Device ON and OFF schedules color brightness values at particular times and for given durations programs in at least one type of the memory beginning in block . The remote device software or the software storing the data learns the pattern or behavior of the user or II Device usage and interprets it as a function of at least one of the parameters such as time of the day date weather respective user room occupancy inputs from sensors etc. in block . With the learned pattern or behavior the II Device or remote device automatically enacts the pattern or behavior giving better user experience and improved energy efficiency of the II Device usage in block . The software keeps learning the behavior of II Device usage and optimizing the automatic performance thereafter in block .

Referring to instead of a user interacting directly via touch with the application on the controlling device alternatively a user could use voice commands to execute and control one or many II Devices. The user turns ON the device application for controlling II Device s in block and provides voice commands to the remote controlling device to control II Device s in block . Example voice commands can include but are not limited to Lights Turn ON Lights Turn OFF Lights Dim To certain Percent Turn ON X Lights Lights Start Certain Program Lights Stop certain Program etc. The voice command can also act as general setting and configurations executing a program executing a scene or setting a schedule those could be default commands with factory settings or user created commands.

The voice service could be integrated into the device application or use the controlling device s own voice service. Popular voice commands such as Turn on X light could be added to the reference database. The X in this consideration could be related to the level of control the user is selecting. For example Turn on All lights would turn on all II Devices. Turn on Bedroom lights would turn on those II Devices in the room named bedroom . The step includes that software interprets and recognizes the voice commands and convert those to specific electrical signals if the commands are meant for IID s . Another step includes the remote device sending the commands to the II Device s and II Device s acting according to the commands. The commands can also always start with specific word or set of words so that the software recognizes the voice commands are for controlling the II Device s that also helps it ignore other unrelated voice inputs.

Forming a network of II Devices with its controlling device s and adding II Device s in the existing network of its wireless controlling devices s such as Smartphone will now be described. Referring to the setup process may include the wireless controlling device that is able to control the II Devices in which wireless controlling device searches for powered II Devices and adds them into its network. When a user wants to add new II Device s to the existing network the controlling device searches for all the II Devices in the vicinity but shows only ones that are not part of the existing network and user can add these new ones to the network. User can specifically ask device to search for new II Devices in the vicinity by going into the setup mode onto the device application . This way it is convenient for the user to look and add only the new II Device s instead of looking at the entire list of the devices and finding the right ones to add into the network. This is achieved by comparing the identification numbers of the existing II Devices into the network with II Devices to be added into the network .

In some scenarios such entertainment stage where multiple lights are part of the system on the stage very precise synchronization of the light effects may be required i.e. no or very minimal delay in the light output changes of various lights is required. There are two ways where the remote wireless device RD controls or communicate with various II Devices . First RD is connected to all II Devices in the vicinity and send commands or communicates with one by one in a serial fashion. Second RD communicates with one or few of the II Devices in the vicinity and asks connected II Devices to communicate with other devices such as by forming a mesh network. In both the cases all II Devices may not get commands simultaneously or in parallel because of which II Devices actions might not look synchronized even for the same command. More the number of II Devices more the time required to send command to each II Device in the vicinity and worse the synchronization will be. This could be solved with wireless protocols such as Bluetooth Low Energy or BLE4.0 which support broadcasting. With this technique the Remote Wireless Device will broadcast the commands and all the II Devices in the vicinity within the range would get the commands simultaneously and act as per the commands. Referring to the II Device s are selected individually or by group s on the device application to run any program and the Remote Controlling Device RD broadcasts the data or commands and all II Devices within the range receive it and act accordingly at the same time. In broadcast method here II Devices could be only in listening mode and need not send any acknowledgement to any other device or need not connect to any other device including RD . With this there is less traffic of the wireless data flow providing better control over limited bandwidth availability less communication error and less lost packets of data transmitted. In addition there could be various individual or groups of II Devices that RD want to send commands at a time using broadcast method . With broadcast all II Devices within the range receive the data command from RD. The II Devices would check if the commands are intended for them as individually or part of a group . And only those II DEVICE s would act respond as per the commands to whom the command is intended for . This is possible by having an identification number such as for individual II DEVICE s or group of II DEVICE s in the broadcast commands from RD . In addition if required the remote device with the device application could broadcast at least one command intended to at least one II Device asking to go into listening mode . In listening mode II Device do not broadcast or transmit the messages to other wireless devices reducing the required bandwidth traffic. This may be required especially if II Devices are broadcasting any information or communicating to other devices causing increase in traffic in the available communication bandwidth. With II Devices going into the listening mode the traffic will reduce helping reliability of the message transfer from remote wireless device to II Devices.

The modularity so that one can build his her own lighting fixture will now be described. The lighting industry has been dependent on the existing form factors of lighting devices such as bulb specific fixture strip light panels etc. which are manufactured by the lighting companies and specified to designers. There is no easy tool where form factors of lights can be designed and produced at a unit level and can be installed in the infrastructure as required. With this there are limitations at the lighting installations level because of dependencies on the available form factors which also define the light output in terms of beam angle lumens color temperature number of colors that can be produced input socket size and other dimensions etc. Access to chose and use various parts of any light system in various capabilities and forms would give any individual or designer to design a specific light required for a specific area or room of an infrastructure. For example with various forms having different specifications of different parts of any light such as input power module optics module control module diffuser lens types of LEDs form factors of LEDs such as on strip on different shape of printed circuit boards meant for bulb fixtures panels etc. designer would be able to design his own lighting devices as per his requirements. Various parts of a lighting device with different specifications where each part with at least one function such as providing input power trough mains input controlling device etc. could be made compatible to at least one other part performing different function so that when these parts come together they can form different variations of lighting device with permutations and combinations. Referring to an example is shown of forming lighting devices from various parts. An input power and control module when combined with one variation of optics module gives one variation of lighting device . Similarly when one variation of input power and control module combined with another variation of optics module gives another variation of lighting device . Furthermore the optic module could be of different parts with one diffuser lens or another diffuser lens part of it giving variations in optics module here in terms of light output.

A software tool can provide a user or designer with all variations of all parts modules that can be used to virtually form or design or create multiple different lighting devices through permutations and combinations. The user is able to select the various parts modules required to design the lighting device using the software and potentially able to test the design for various parameters. Referring to the user or designer can launch the software for designing the lighting device. On the software tool the user can see various available parts modules or combinations thereof which can be chosen and combined with different permutations and combinations to form at least one lighting device. The parts include but not limited to 

Now referring to a block diagram showing a lighting device for geographical travel especially from one time zone to the other or space travel. The overhead light on a passenger seat could be made intelligent such as II Device which can be programmed to provide simulated cycle of the sunlight throughout the day which could help reduce the effect of jet lag or other travel fatigue especially when the geographical locations of travel are far affecting the circadian clock of the user . The user can program the II Device to provide the simulated light based on his travel locations and day and times of the travel. Or user can input the information such as travel destinations and travel timings so that software controlling the II device calculates and provide required simulated light output. The II Device here need not be wireless but could be wired directly to the controlling or programming device which provides the user interface for providing the inputs or directly programming the II Device . There are numerous applications of such system such as in airplanes where user with simulated lighting could have better sleep pattern and minimize the jet lag effect.

Referring to a flow chart illustrating how a user might want to program at least one II DEVICE to produce light as a function of at least one variable is shown. The variables are such that when changed could affect user s daily activities and may include but are not limited to 

There are multiple steps to create such programs for II DEVICE . First step involves launching the lighting device software on a wireless device while in the next step the device software gathers information on at least one type of variables mentioned above either from the wireless network or user provides the required information directly. Another step involves user programming at least one II DEVICE to produce particular light at particular times as a function of at least one such variable mentioned above. The program s can be saved in the internal memory of II DEVICE or external memory such as that of wireless device and can be repeated by user as and when required as shown in step . The user can change modify add programs in block .

The user can also program the II DEVICE as a function of at least one variable mentioned above and at least one variable as below 

Referring to the lighting device software is launched and the II Device s to be programmed are selected . The user can define the color temperature of the light output as a function of time . For example the user can define the cool color temperature light output from the morning wake up time till the afternoon and later on day light color temperature light output till the evening and then warm temperature until the user goes to sleep. The function could be step function as described or could also be defined to gradually change the color temperature light output from one point of time to the other . For example the cooler temperature to the warmer temperature change could be with some function such as linear or exponential . In addition with the variables mentioned above the II Device s or Device application can learn the behavior of the user that can be used directly to create program s to produce the required light output at required times. This program can be a default program and user could customize it with the inputs of various times color temperature changes at those times and function for gradual change in the color temperature from the one color temperature to the other. The user interface on the wireless device communicating with the II Device s would provide the ability to the user to provide the time color temperature and function inputs. The programs created could be stored in the internal memory or external memory such as that of the wireless device . In addition the programs could be modified or more programs could be added as and when required through the user interface on the wireless device .

There could be multiple programs running for at least one II DEVICE either internally in II DEVICE itself or in external wireless devices such as Smartphone running application for II DEVICE . These programs could be function of time with which there may be conflicts while running various programs. The priority needs to be assigned to ensure the important programs override the less important programs for II DEVICE s . Referring to the lighting device software is launched . This can be achieved by having user assign the priority for various programs through the user interface software running on the wireless device for controlling II DEVICE s . The priority can be assigned in terms of numerical values or level such as High Medium Less . There could be pre defined or default programs with assigned priority which cannot be changed. On the user interface the user can see all programs running for single or multiple II Devices in a list or grid or any other format and can assign the priority as required . The priority can be stored in the internal memory of II Device or the external memory such as memory communicable coupled to the wireless device communicating with the II Device . Different programs can have different priorities as a function of day or sensor input or any other condition . For example the program of light output in terms of color temperature change as a function of time of the day can have higher priority over the program for light output from II Device as a function of weather changes unless the weather condition becomes very harsh crossing the defined limit and warning has to be given to the user with certain color light output from the II Device s . The user can change modify add priorities to the programs as and when required .

Laser diode can be a part of the II Device as at least one type of LED. Laser diodes are employed for entertainment lighting effects. The II Device can have the laser diode of one or multiple colors light output controlled in a similar fashion as other color LEDs are controlled. However considering the potential health hazards of the laser diode output light an important provision can be made to limit the duration and average current flowing through the laser diode. The II Device software could impose the limit on the maximum average current passing through the Laser Diode by limiting the duty cycle of the PWM signal passing through the Laser Diode or by limiting the maximum ON time as compared to OFF time of the signal for Laser Diode . In addition the II Device can also limit the duration of the Laser Diode total duration of the functioning . For example the duration for which it is functioning could be limited to 5 minutes in a particular given time interval such as hour. This could be achieved by using the internal clock of the processor or real time clock of the II Device . With Laser Diode a user could provide entertaining lighting effect by emitting the laser beams at various places in the room. The user can change the settings of the limits .

Any selection level of a system level room group or individual II Device can be set in combination with a command configuration program or effect to execute at a designated future time as represented in . Similar to a program here an extension of program is to interpret that a user can schedule any number of II Devices to do certain things at different times outlined in flow chart . Including but not necessarily in this order the scheduling program a user would select any combination of II Devices . Then a user would select an automation or time characteristic including but not limited to time start end day start end day of the week start end or duration. The schedule could then be set to have additional properties such as repeatability repeating on some schedule effect commands such as fade in or fade out commands or the like. Also the user may specify the light command associated with the schedule select a pre defined light command . One II Device can have multiple future schedules. Similarly any selection level such as a room can have multiple schedules.

The selected schedule may then be stored in the related II Devices within the user interface or stored in an outside network like cloud storage . At the appropriate scheduled condition the II Devices in coordination with the related components of the lighting network would execute the set command in accordance with the additional properties . The schedule may be presented to the user in a variety of ways a user can see the set future scheduled events for any selection level of II Devices. These scheduled events could be organized and sorted based on the soonest to occur showing first. In addition the scheduled events could have representations on what the command is including color brightness program effect or the like. Moreover the II Device could show inherited schedules from higher levels of hierarchy such that a single II Device could show a schedule set for a group that it is associated with. Furthermore the schedule could be associated to a user.

Referring to an option could be made in the user interface to enact an eco mode for any level of control . The eco mode would be geared towards optimizing efficiency with regards to energy usage. For example the selected lights would be dimmer using less energy. In addition other applications like proximity sunset sunrise monitoring ambient light sensing and other information could be used to create an eco footprint.

For example when a user selects the eco mode option it can set a reduced energy usage for the related II Devices that would be lower than the overall maximum energy usage . The lowered energy usage here could be attributed and associated with a reduction in light output wireless strength or light qualities such as CRI or color temperature. In addition the lowered maximum energy usage might be variable over time with respect to the general maximum energy usage . This variable energy usage could be related to an additional condition such as time of day seasonality available sunlight as a proportion of the general energy usage or with respect to other conditions . For example the Eco mode might be triggered or controlled with respect to overall power grid demand. Here a signal could be sent to the WD or directly to the II Devices indicating a high demand period of energy use as a condition . In response a variable eco mode maximum energy usage could be set so that the power consumption of the II Devices is reduced. The Eco mode could be a general selection mode on top of any other command limiting the overall brightness produced by the II Devices. Or the eco mode could be limited to a set number of II Devices and any other configuration would be in replacement to the Eco configuration.

As shown in in a monitoring program each II Device or the controlling device has the ability to monitor when and for how long and at what setting the related II Device is active or inactive and the II Device can associate that with an approximate energy usage required and relay that information back to the controlling device. The controlling device can then summarize and display that information in a user interface screen to summarize the energy usage of one or many II Devices. The energy usage might be translated to alternative metrics such as s or carbon dioxide offset. This information could be tracked under multiple parameters such as YTD past week lifetime and the like. This information could be stored locally in the app saved to an associated cloud location or sent to an alternate source such as a utility monitoring program or the like.

As the connected device has access to the web either through a local area network or a wireless network the application could access various data feeds via the connected device on the web that can be used as programming inputs to one or more II Devices as referenced in . The data feed would be accessed by the IID or connected device . Alternatively there could be a bridge or secondary connected device within the lighting network that is connected to the web and has access to the web service data feeds . The data would then be mapped and interpreted into one or more light settings for the one or more IIDs . The mapping and interpretation could be through a combination of predefined or user defined methods.

The data feeds could be accessed with one or more data access settings including but not limited to a one time access continuously accessed accessed upon a condition or event or upon user input. Example conditions for the data programming could be defined from a time of day calendar day day of week additional data condition additional program or any combination thereof. For example various local weather data feeds could be accessed through various web services on the connected device. This information could then be used to create different lighting configurations or settings such as a light being bluer or redder based on the temperature. In addition the weather information could be used to assume the overall overcast conditions and level of brightness and similarly adjust any number of II Devices accordingly.

A user could schedule the data programming functions for a set time or reoccurring dates times associated to any number of II Devices. For example a user could set a weather program to have an II Device to reflect the weather outside on weekdays from 7 am to 8 am. Only at that time would the II Device and the controlling devices look for the data information send it to the associated II Device and the associated command.

Other forms of data include but are not limited to stock or commodity trading or market information incoming phone calls or messages application or web alerts such as those from social media applications sunset sunrise times or any other data feed indicators.

There can be a program as shown in where the application device can be set to record a series of actions executed by the II Devices and played back at a later time . Initially a setting would be selected within the controlling device to begin the recording . The controlling device and or II Devices would then monitor any interaction and or actions taken by one or more II Devices . The user s interaction and actions could come from an outside program or through direct user interaction through the controlling device to one or many II Devices over a time period. The intended one or more series of interactions and actions can then be recorded and committed to memory . Afterwards the recording of the sequence of one or more commands can be replayed upon a user request or through some other program . This would allow someone to set up favorite effect or program sequences and recall the sequence of settings at any time. The sequence could be a function of a general step by step sequence or it may be a function of time between each step of the sequence. A user could have the ability after recording to edit the recording in various ways cropping cutting adjusting the time or changing any number of different aspects of the recorded lighting sequence as required.

Within the device application a user can create or have access to predefined lighting effects. These effects can simulate certain environments ambiances or functional aspects. A user can select an effect select any number of II Devices either through groups rooms or individual control then execute that effect at that time or upon a further schedule. These effects range from simulating certain environments such as a moving blue ocean flickering orange candlelight a strobe or other effects to other lighting effects beneficial for film or general use such as fire television lightning headlights flashes of light from explosions gun fire. Further the effect might be linked to some other event such as taking a photo and having a flash effect.

A photo or video is composed of a series of pixels that have an associated color. In this sense these pixels can be extracted to relate to a command given to one or many II Devices in an image reflection program as referenced in . The associated commands could be similar all relating to a general type of pixel or each different with different selected pixels associated to different II Devices. From photo or video an image including content and information relating to color elements or pixels within that photo or video will be obtained either through the controlling device the application interface a display signal or an outside means . The image and associated color element could be broken out into one or more different areas of the picture . Additionally the image could be compressed converted or modified as needed. This break up could be done based on contrasting dominant color schemes x y coordinates or quadrants within the image a user selection a random sampling of the image or some combination of the previous. These various broken out areas can then be interpreted either via an average modal or other approach into one or more colors . These colors can then be mapped to one or more II Devices . In addition the assignment of pixels to one or many II Devices can be user generated or automated. If automated the device application could use information on the layout of the II Devices in the proximity location to help identify spatial relationships where the II Devices are related to a frame. The related II Devices would then emit a light associated with the interpreted colors .

A sequence of pictures or video could similarly be monitored as a sequence of images or frames over time . This could be done based on every frame or a defined number of frames to optimize the performance. The photo or video could be viewed directly on the connected device or a separate display such as a television. If in a separate display the connected device could be an intermediary between the display and the II Devices. Alternatively the display can be directly connected to the II Devices or have a connected router or bridge that can monitor the display and send a command directly to the II Devices. The overall effect would provide a light setting or sequence that extends the visual display of an image to the ambient environment. This would immerse a user within an image or video and create the potential for a surround effect with lighting.

Referring to a process for creating a scene in a quick and convenient fashion is described . Through general use a user will go through the effort of personalizing and creating a combination of light settings in relation to one or more II Devices or scenes. It would therefore be convenient to the user to easily save and replay these scenes without going through the process of retuning each individual II Device. Instead the wireless device working with the device application can at any time capture the scene as the current state of the one or more II Devices and their respective light setting . The capture can either be through a manual user interaction with the device application or upon some other event such as through an automated timeframe or as part of a program . Additionally the capture of the scene could be taken from a static lighting setting or as a single frame from within a dynamic light setting. The one or more II Devices could be captured in an individual or a group form.

After capturing the scene the one or more II Devices and their related light settings could be saved to the device or application memory as a new scene . The process of saving could be automatic or require manual input or interaction to save. The saved new scene could then be viewed or edited to adjust any metadata or settings related to the one or more II Devices and their related light settings. The scene could also be replayed or executed at a later time either through a user interaction within the device application or through some user or pre defined program . At which point the one or more II Devices will then emit the saved light settings as originally captured and stored within the scene .

As lighting is fairly well and universally distributed the function of the II Devices might be used to provide various location services and interactions as represented in . Here one or more II Devices could be placed in an area . The II Devices defined at a minimum of requiring a wireless transceiver receiver and one or more LEDs. The II Devices would be set to send out a periodic message that includes an identifier for each specific II Device . The identifier could be user defined or predefined. Similarly the II Devices could monitor or listen for the presence of other wirelessly addressable devices within range as example if the II Device uses Bluetooth then the II Device would look for all available Bluetooth devices within range. Also the II Devices could alternate between a sending and listening mode .

The II Device could then find one or more compatible wirelessly addressable device within range or the wirelessly addressable device could find one or more II Devices within range . After the one or more II Devices and the one or more wirelessly addressable devices find each other a predefined or user defined action may result . One example action includes prompting the wirelessly addressable device with a message or advertisement . Another example action includes matching the II Device identifier with some other information stored within the wirelessly addressable device or a related device application . Here the II Device identifier could be associated to a specific location key within the space. Another example action includes the wirelessly addressable device sending a command to the one or more II Device to change to a different light setting . At the same time a sequence within a device application on the wirelessly addressable device could be triggered that changes the view of the device application to bring up location specific content . Similarly the one or more II Devices could change to draw attention to that space perhaps changing color brightness or executing a lighting effect.

There might also be a sequence of actions taken as a combination or result of any of the predefined actions between the one or more II Devices and the wirelessly addressable devices . As example after a first action between an II Device and the wirelessly addressable device where the II Device identifier is recorded by the wirelessly addressable device the wirelessly addressable device could send a message through the web to a separate database that records the interaction taking place along with other metadata including the time of the interaction the length of the interaction the signal strength of the interaction or other information.
