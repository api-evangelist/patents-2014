title: Automated, tiered data retention
abstract: The automatic, tiered retention storage system according to certain aspects can automatically classify data items based on content, such as based on the inclusion of search terms in the data items, or based on metadata or other characteristics associated with the data. Based on the classification, the system can assign the data items to corresponding user-defined “buckets.” In some embodiments, each bucket is associated with a particular tier in the storage system having a specific retention period.

This application is a continuation in part of the assignee s U.S. application Ser. No. 13 787 404 filed Mar. 6 2013 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 608 531 filed on Mar. 8 2012.

Any and all applications if any for which a foreign or domestic priority claim is identified in the Application Data Sheet of the present application are hereby incorporated by reference under 37 CFR 1.57.

Businesses worldwide recognize the commercial value of their data and seek reliable cost effective ways to protect the information stored on their computer networks while minimizing impact on productivity. Protecting information is often part of a routine process that is performed within an organization.

A company might back up critical computing systems such as databases file servers web servers and so on as part of a daily weekly or monthly maintenance schedule. The company may similarly protect computing systems used by each of its employees such as those used by an accounting department marketing department engineering department and so forth.

Given the rapidly expanding volume of data under management companies also continue to seek innovative techniques for managing data growth in addition to protecting data. For instance companies often implement migration techniques for moving data to lower cost storage over time and data reduction techniques for reducing redundant data pruning lower priority data etc.

Enterprises also increasingly view their stored data as a valuable asset. Along these lines customers are looking for solutions that not only protect and manage but also leverage their data. For instance solutions providing data analysis capabilities improved data presentation and access features and the like are in increasing demand.

Enterprises are generating ever increasing volumes of data and corresponding storage requirements. However different types of data may have varying degrees of importance and all of the data may not need to be retained according to the same criteria such as for the same period of time.

Due to the above challenges there is a need for a data storage system that implements a data retention policy in an efficient manner. In order to address these and other challenges certain storage systems disclosed herein automatically classify stored data e.g. backup and or primary production data into a set of pre defined groups according to a retention scheme. The system can also automatically prune the data based on various retention periods associated with the pre defined groups. Depending on the configuration the system classifies the data based on the contents type or other characteristics e.g. metadata associated with the data.

The automatic tiered retention storage system according to certain aspects can automatically classify data items based on content metadata or any other appropriate characteristic of the data and assign the data items to corresponding user defined buckets. In some embodiments each bucket is associated with a particular tier in the storage system having a specific retention period. The criteria for classification can be defined according to user preference. For example the user may wish to classify files based on content using search terms and or based on metadata. Files can be classified based on subject matter e.g. as indicated by content and or metadata for example some other appropriate parameter associated with the files or any combination thereof. Emails for instance may be classified according to subject line content sender recipient message body content presence or type of attachment s etc. The automatic classification may be implemented as part of a broader storage policy.

A user defined retention policy can specify the retention periods associated with the buckets or the retention periods can be automatically assigned e.g. to a default retention period. After the data is classified according to the criteria in the policy and assigned to the appropriate bucket it can be copied or otherwise associated with the appropriate bucket e.g. migrated to an appropriate tier . The data in a particular bucket is kept in the bucket for the specified retention period and pruned when the retention period is met.

In this manner the automated tiered retention data storage system can facilitate management and reduction of data by making classification of data items and their retention in various buckets automatic. The system works as a filter and allows for efficient migration and or pruning of data in a meaningful intelligent manner according to the needs of the organization. Rather than having to manually extract the data items to retain for a certain period of time the user can define a retention policy to store the designated items e.g. all emails associated with a CEO or other employee for a specified length of time and the automatic tiered retention storage system automates the process. In this way the user or system administrator can save a significant amount of time and effort in managing and reducing the amount of data in an organization.

Thus the invention may be embodied or carried out in a manner that achieves or optimizes one advantage or group of advantages as taught herein without necessarily achieving other advantages as may be taught or suggested herein.

Systems and methods are described herein for implementing automated retention policy in a data storage system. Examples of such systems and methods are discussed in further detail herein e.g. with respect to . Automated retention policy may be implemented by information management systems such as those that will now be described with respect to . And as will be described the componentry for implementing automated retention policy described herein can be incorporated into such systems.

With the increasing importance of protecting and leveraging data organizations simply cannot afford to take the risk of losing critical data. Moreover runaway data growth and other modern realities make protecting and managing data an increasingly difficult task. There is therefore a need for efficient powerful and user friendly solutions for protecting and managing data.

Depending on the size of the organization there are typically many data production sources which are under the purview of tens hundreds or even thousands of employees or other individuals. In the past individual employees were sometimes responsible for managing and protecting their data. A patchwork of hardware and software point solutions have been applied in other cases. These solutions were often provided by different vendors and had limited or no interoperability.

Certain embodiments described herein provide systems and methods capable of addressing these and other shortcomings of prior approaches by implementing unified organization wide information management. shows one such information management system which generally includes combinations of hardware and software configured to protect and manage data and metadata generated and used by the various computing devices in the information management system .

The organization which employs the information management system may be a corporation or other business entity non profit organization educational institution household governmental agency or the like.

Generally the systems and associated components described herein may be compatible with and or provide some or all of the functionality of the systems and corresponding components described in one or more of the following U.S. patents and patent application publications assigned to CommVault Systems Inc. each of which is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference herein 

The illustrated information management system includes one or more client computing device having at least one application executing thereon and one or more primary storage devices storing primary data . The client computing device s and the primary storage devices may generally be referred to in some cases as a primary storage subsystem .

Depending on the context the term information management system can refer to generally all of the illustrated hardware and software components. Or in other instances the term may refer to only a subset of the illustrated components.

For instance in some cases information management system generally refers to a combination of specialized components used to protect move manage manipulate and or process data and metadata generated by the client computing devices . However the term may generally not refer to the underlying components that generate and or store the primary data such as the client computing devices themselves the applications and operating system residing on the client computing devices and the primary storage devices .

As an example information management system may sometimes refer only to one or more of the following components and corresponding data structures storage managers data agents and media agents. These components will be described in further detail below.

There are typically a variety of sources in an organization that produce data to be protected and managed. As just one illustrative example in a corporate environment such data sources can be employee workstations and company servers such as a mail server a web server or the like. In the information management system the data generation sources include the one or more client computing devices .

The client computing devices may include without limitation one or more workstations personal computers desktop computers or other types of generally fixed computing systems such as mainframe computers and minicomputers.

The client computing devices can also include mobile or portable computing devices such as one or more laptops tablet computers personal data assistants mobile phones such as smartphones and other mobile or portable computing devices such as embedded computers set top boxes vehicle mounted devices wearable computers etc.

In some cases each client computing device is associated with one or more users and or corresponding user accounts of employees or other individuals.

The term client computing device is used herein because the information management system generally serves the data management and protection needs for the data generated by the client computing devices . However the use of this term does not imply that the client computing devices cannot be servers in other respects. For instance a particular client computing device may act as a server with respect to other devices such as other client computing devices . As just a few examples the client computing devices can include mail servers file servers database servers and web servers.

The client computing devices may additionally include virtualized and or cloud computing resources. For instance one or more virtual machines may be provided to the organization by a third party cloud service vendor. Or in some embodiments the client computing devices include one or more virtual machine s running on a virtual machine host computing device operated by the organization. As one example the organization may use one virtual machine as a database server and another virtual machine as a mail server. A virtual machine manager VMM e.g. a Hypervisor may manage the virtual machines and reside and execute on the virtual machine host computing device.

Each client computing device may have one or more applications e.g. software applications executing thereon which generate and manipulate the data that is to be protected from loss.

The applications generally facilitate the operations of an organization or multiple affiliated organizations and can include without limitation mail server applications e.g. Microsoft Exchange Server file server applications mail client applications e.g. Microsoft Exchange Client database applications e.g. SQL Oracle SAP Lotus Notes Database word processing applications e.g. Microsoft Word spreadsheet applications financial applications presentation applications browser applications mobile applications entertainment applications and so on.

The applications can include at least one operating system e.g. Microsoft Windows Mac OS X iOS IBM z OS Linux other Unix based operating systems etc. which may support one or more file systems and host the other applications .

As shown the client computing devices and other components in the information management system can be connected to one another via one or more communication pathways . The communication pathways can include one or more networks or other connection types including as any of following without limitation the Internet a wide area network WAN a local area network LAN a Storage Area Network SAN a Fibre Channel connection a Small Computer System Interface SCSI connection a virtual private network VPN a token ring or TCP IP based network an intranet network a point to point link a cellular network a wireless data transmission system a two way cable system an interactive kiosk network a satellite network a broadband network a baseband network other appropriate wired wireless or partially wired wireless computer or telecommunications networks combinations of the same or the like. The communication pathways in some cases may also include application programming interfaces APIs including e.g. cloud service provider APIs virtual machine management APIs and hosted service provider APIs.

Primary data according to some embodiments is production data or other live data generated by the operating system and other applications residing on a client computing device . The primary data is stored on the primary storage device s and is organized via a file system supported by the client computing device . For instance the client computing device s and corresponding applications may create access modify write delete and otherwise use primary data .

Primary data is generally in the native format of the source application . According to certain aspects primary data is an initial or first e.g. created before any other copies or before at least one other copy stored copy of data generated by the source application . Primary data in some cases is created substantially directly from data generated by the corresponding source applications .

The primary data may sometimes be referred to as a primary copy in the sense that it is a discrete set of data. However the use of this term does not necessarily imply that the primary copy is a copy in the sense that it was copied or otherwise derived from another stored version.

The primary storage devices storing the primary data may be relatively fast and or expensive e.g. a disk drive a hard disk array solid state memory etc. . In addition primary data may be intended for relatively short term retention e.g. several hours days or weeks .

According to some embodiments the client computing device can access primary data from the primary storage device by making conventional file system calls via the operating system. Primary data representing files may include structured data e.g. database files unstructured data e.g. documents and or semi structured data. Some specific examples are described below with respect to .

It can be useful in performing certain tasks to break the primary data up into units of different granularities. In general primary data can include files directories file system volumes data blocks extents or any other types or granularities of data objects. As used herein a data object can refer to both 1 any file that is currently addressable by a file system or that was previously addressable by the file system e.g. an archive file and 2 a subset of such a file.

As will be described in further detail it can also be useful in performing certain functions of the information management system to access and modify metadata within the primary data . Metadata generally includes information about data objects or characteristics associated with the data objects.

Metadata can include without limitation one or more of the following the data owner e.g. the client or user that generates the data the last modified time e.g. the time of the most recent modification of the data object a data object name e.g. a file name a data object size e.g. a number of bytes of data information about the content e.g. an indication as to the existence of a particular search term to from information for email e.g. an email sender recipient etc. creation date file type e.g. format or application type last accessed time application type e.g. type of application that generated the data object location network e.g. a current past or future location of the data object and network pathways to from the data object frequency of change e.g. a period in which the data object is modified business unit e.g. a group or department that generates manages or is otherwise associated with the data object and aging information e.g. a schedule such as a time period in which the data object is migrated to secondary or long term storage boot sectors partition layouts file location within a file folder directory structure user permissions owners groups access control lists ACLS system metadata e.g. registry information combinations of the same or the like.

In addition to metadata generated by or related to file systems and operating systems some of the applications maintain indices of metadata for data objects e.g. metadata associated with individual email messages. Thus each data object may be associated with corresponding metadata. The use of metadata to perform classification and other functions is described in greater detail below.

Each of the client computing devices are associated with and or in communication with one or more of the primary storage devices storing corresponding primary data . A client computing device may be considered to be associated with or in communication with a primary storage device if it is capable of one or more of storing data to the primary storage device retrieving data from the primary storage device and modifying data retrieved from a primary storage device .

The primary storage devices can include without limitation disk drives hard disk arrays semiconductor memory e.g. solid state drives and network attached storage NAS devices. In some cases the primary storage devices form part of a distributed file system. The primary storage devices may have relatively fast I O times and or are relatively expensive in comparison to the secondary storage devices . For example the information management system may generally regularly access data and metadata stored on primary storage devices whereas data and metadata stored on the secondary storage devices is accessed relatively less frequently.

In some cases each primary storage device is dedicated to an associated client computing devices . For instance a primary storage device in one embodiment is a local disk drive of a corresponding client computing device . In other cases one or more primary storage devices can be shared by multiple client computing devices . As one example a primary storage device can be a disk array shared by a group of client computing devices such as one of the following types of disk arrays EMC Clariion EMC Symmetrix EMC Celerra Dell EqualLogic IBM XIV NetApp FAS HP EVA and HP 3PAR.

The information management system may also include hosted services not shown which may be hosted in some cases by an entity other than the organization that employs the other components of the information management system . For instance the hosted services may be provided by various online service providers to the organization. Such service providers can provide services including social networking services hosted email services or hosted productivity applications or other hosted applications .

Hosted services may include software as a service SaaS platform as a service PaaS application service providers ASPS cloud services or other mechanisms for delivering functionality via a network. As it provides services to users each hosted service may generate additional data and metadata under management of the information management system e.g. as primary data . In some cases the hosted services may be accessed using one of the applications . As an example a hosted mail service may be accessed via browser running on a client computing device .

The primary data stored on the primary storage devices may be compromised in some cases such as when an employee deliberately or accidentally deletes or overwrites primary data during their normal course of work. Or the primary storage devices can be damaged or otherwise corrupted.

For recovery and or regulatory compliance purposes it is therefore useful to generate copies of the primary data . Accordingly the information management system includes one or more secondary storage computing devices and one or more secondary storage devices configured to create and store one or more secondary copies of the primary data and associated metadata. The secondary storage computing devices and the secondary storage devices may be referred to in some cases as a secondary storage subsystem .

Creation of secondary copies can help meet information management goals such as restoring data and or metadata if an original version e.g. of primary data is lost e.g. by deletion corruption or disaster allowing point in time recovery complying with regulatory data retention and electronic discovery e discovery requirements reducing utilized storage capacity facilitating organization and search of data improving user access to data files across multiple computing devices and or hosted services and implementing data retention policies.

Types of secondary copy operations can include without limitation backup operations archive operations snapshot operations replication operations e.g. continuous data replication CDR data retention policies such as or information lifecycle management and hierarchical storage management operations and the like. These specific types operations are discussed in greater detail below.

Regardless of the type of secondary copy operation the client computing devices access or receive primary data and communicate the data e.g. over the communication pathways for storage in the secondary storage device s .

A secondary copy can comprise a separate stored copy of application data that is derived from one or more earlier created stored copies e.g. derived from primary data or another secondary copy . Secondary copies can include point in time data and may be intended for relatively long term retention e.g. weeks months or years before some or all of the data is moved to other storage or is discarded.

In some cases a secondary copy is a copy of application data created and stored subsequent to at least one other stored instance e.g. subsequent to corresponding primary data or to another secondary copy in a different storage device than at least one previous stored copy and or remotely from at least one previous stored copy. Secondary copies may be stored in relatively slow and or low cost storage e.g. magnetic tape . A secondary copy may be stored in a backup or archive format or in some other format different than the native source application format or other primary data format.

In some cases secondary copies are indexed so users can browse and restore at another point in time. After creation of a secondary copy representative of certain primary data a pointer or other location indicia e.g. a stub may be placed in primary data or be otherwise associated with primary data to indicate the current location on the secondary storage device s .

Since an instance a data object or metadata in primary data may change over time as it is modified by an application or hosted service or the operating system the information management system may create and manage multiple secondary copies of a particular data object or metadata each representing the state of the data object in primary data at a particular point in time. Moreover since an instance of a data object in primary data may eventually be deleted from the primary storage device and the file system the information management system may continue to manage point in time representations of that data object even though the instance in primary data no longer exists.

For virtualized computing devices the operating system and other applications of the client computing device s may execute within or under the management of virtualization software e.g. a VMM and the primary storage device s may comprise a virtual disk created on a physical storage device. The information management system may create secondary copies of the files or other data objects in a virtual disk file and or secondary copies of the entire virtual disk file itself e.g. of an entire .vmdk file .

Secondary copies may be distinguished from corresponding primary data in a variety of ways some of which will now be described. First as discussed secondary copies can be stored in a different format e.g. backup archive or other non native format than primary data . For this or other reasons secondary copies may not be directly useable by the applications of the client computing device e.g. via standard system calls or otherwise without modification processing or other intervention by the information management system .

Secondary copies are also often stored on a secondary storage device that is inaccessible to the applications running on the client computing devices and or hosted services . Some secondary copies may be offline copies in that they are not readily available e.g. not mounted to tape or disk . Offline copies can include copies of data that the information management system can access without human intervention e.g. tapes within an automated tape library but not yet mounted in a drive and copies that the information management system can access only with at least some human intervention e.g. tapes located at an offsite storage site .

The secondary storage devices can include any suitable type of storage device such as without limitation one or more tape libraries disk drives or other magnetic non tape storage devices optical media storage devices solid state storage devices NAS devices combinations of the same and the like. In some cases the secondary storage devices are provided in a cloud e.g. a private cloud or one operated by a third party vendor .

The secondary storage device s in some cases comprises a disk array or a portion thereof. In some cases a single storage device e.g. a disk array is used for storing both primary data and at least some secondary copies . In one example a disk array capable of performing hardware snapshots stores primary data and creates and stores hardware snapshots of the primary data as secondary copies .

Creating secondary copies can be a challenging task. For instance there can be hundreds or thousands of client computing devices continually generating large volumes of primary data to be protected. Also there can be significant overhead involved in the creation of secondary copies . Moreover secondary storage devices may be special purpose components and interacting with them can require specialized intelligence.

In some cases the client computing devices interact directly with the secondary storage device to create the secondary copies . However in view of the factors described above this approach can negatively impact the ability of the client computing devices to serve the applications and produce primary data . Further the client computing devices may not be optimized for interaction with the secondary storage devices .

Thus in some embodiments the information management system includes one or more software and or hardware components which generally act as intermediaries between the client computing devices and the secondary storage devices . In addition to off loading certain responsibilities from the client computing devices these intermediary components can provide other benefits. For instance as discussed further below with respect to distributing some of the work involved in creating secondary copies can enhance scalability.

The intermediary components can include one or more secondary storage computing devices as shown in and or one or more media agents which can be software modules residing on corresponding secondary storage computing devices or other appropriate devices . Media agents are discussed below e.g. with respect to .

The secondary storage computing device s can comprise any appropriate type of computing device and can include without limitation any of the types of fixed and portable computing devices described above with respect to the client computing devices . In some cases the secondary storage computing device s include specialized hardware and or software componentry for interacting with the secondary storage devices .

To create a secondary copy the client computing device communicates the primary data to be copied or a processed version thereof to the designated secondary storage computing device via the communication pathway . The secondary storage computing device in turn conveys the received data or a processed version thereof to the secondary storage device . In some such configurations the communication pathway between the client computing device and the secondary storage computing device comprises a portion of a LAN WAN or SAN. In other cases at least some client computing devices communicate directly with the secondary storage devices e.g. via Fibre Channel or SCSI connections .

Some or all primary data objects are associated with a primary copy of object metadata e.g. Meta1 11 which may be file system metadata and or application specific metadata. Stored on the secondary storage device s are secondary copy objects A C which may include copies of or otherwise represent corresponding primary data objects and metadata.

As shown the secondary copy objects A C can individually represent more than one primary data object. For example secondary copy data object A represents three separate primary data objects C and C represented as C and C respectively . Moreover as indicated by the prime mark a secondary copy object may store a representation of a primary data object or metadata differently than the original format e.g. in a compressed encrypted deduplicated or other modified format.

The information management system can incorporate a variety of different hardware and software components which can in turn be organized with respect to one another in many different configurations depending on the embodiment. There are critical design choices involved in specifying the functional responsibilities of the components and the role of each component in the information management system . For instance as will be discussed such design choices can impact performance as well as the adaptability of the information management system to data growth or other changing circumstances.

As noted the number of components in the information management system and the amount of data under management can be quite large. Managing the components and data is therefore a significant task and a task that can grow in an often unpredictable fashion as the quantity of components and data scale to meet the needs of the organization.

For these and other reasons according to certain embodiments responsibility for controlling the information management system or at least a significant portion of that responsibility is allocated to the storage manager .

By distributing control functionality in this manner the storage manager can be adapted independently according to changing circumstances. Moreover a host computing device can be selected to best suit the functions of the storage manager . These and other advantages are described in further detail below with respect to .

The storage manager may be a software module or other application. The storage manager generally initiates coordinates and or controls storage and other information management operations performed by the information management system e.g. to protect and control the primary data and secondary copies of data and metadata.

As shown by the dashed arrowed lines the storage manager may communicate with and or control some or all elements of the information management system such as the data agents and media agents . Thus in certain embodiments control information originates from the storage manager whereas payload data and metadata is generally communicated between the data agents and the media agents or otherwise between the client computing device s and the secondary storage computing device s e.g. at the direction of the storage manager . In other embodiments some information management operations are controlled by other components in the information management system e.g. the media agent s or data agent s instead of or in combination with the storage manager .

According to certain embodiments the storage manager provides one or more of the following functions 

The storage manager may maintain a database of management related data and information management policies . The database may include a management index or other data structure that stores logical associations between components of the system user preferences and or profiles e.g. preferences regarding encryption compression or deduplication of primary or secondary copy data preferences regarding the scheduling type or other aspects of primary or secondary copy or other operations mappings of particular information management users or user accounts to certain computing devices or other components etc. management tasks media containerization or other useful data. For example the storage manager may use the index to track logical associations between media agents and secondary storage devices and or movement of data from primary storage devices to secondary storage devices .

Administrators and other employees may be able to manually configure and initiate certain information management operations on an individual basis. But while this may be acceptable for some recovery operations or other relatively less frequent tasks it is often not workable for implementing on going organization wide data protection and management.

Thus the information management system may utilize information management policies for specifying and executing information management operations e.g. on an automated basis . Generally an information management policy can include a data structure or other information source that specifies a set of parameters e.g. criteria and rules associated with storage or other information management operations.

The storage manager database may maintain the information management policies and associated data although the information management policies can be stored in any appropriate location. For instance a storage policy may be stored as metadata in a media agent database or in a secondary storage device e.g. as an archive copy for use in restore operations or other information management operations depending on the embodiment. Information management policies are described further below.

According to certain embodiments the storage manager database comprises a relational database e.g. an SQL database for tracking metadata such as metadata associated with secondary copy operations e.g. what client computing devices and corresponding data were protected . This and other metadata may additionally be stored in other locations such as at the secondary storage computing devices or on the secondary storage devices allowing data recovery without the use of the storage manager .

As shown the storage manager may include a jobs agent a user interface and a management agent all of which may be implemented as interconnected software modules or application programs.

The jobs agent in some embodiments initiates controls and or monitors the status of some or all storage or other information management operations previously performed currently being performed or scheduled to be performed by the information management system . For instance the jobs agent may access information management policies to determine when and how to initiate and control secondary copy and other information management operations as will be discussed further.

The user interface may include information processing and display software such as a graphical user interface GUI an application program interface API or other interactive interface through which users and system processes can retrieve information about the status of information management operations e.g. storage operations or issue instructions to the information management system and its constituent components.

The storage manager may also track information that permits it to select designate or otherwise identify content indices deduplication databases or similar databases or resources or data sets within its information management cell or another cell to be searched in response to certain queries. Such queries may be entered by the user via interaction with the user interface .

Via the user interface users may optionally issue instructions to the components in the information management system regarding performance of storage and recovery operations. For example a user may modify a schedule concerning the number of pending secondary copy operations. As another example a user may employ the GUI to view the status of pending storage operations or to monitor the status of certain components in the information management system e.g. the amount of capacity left in a storage device .

In general the management agent allows multiple information management systems to communicate with one another. For example the information management system in some cases may be one information management subsystem or cell of a network of multiple cells adjacent to one another or otherwise logically related in a WAN or LAN. With this arrangement the cells may be connected to one another through respective management agents .

For instance the management agent can provide the storage manager with the ability to communicate with other components within the information management system and or other cells within a larger information management system via network protocols and application programming interfaces APIs including e.g. HTTP HTTPS FTP REST virtualization software APIs cloud service provider APIs and hosted service provider APIs. Inter cell communication and hierarchy is described in greater detail in U.S. Pat. No. 7 035 880 which is incorporated by reference herein.

As discussed a variety of different types of applications can reside on a given client computing device including operating systems database applications e mail applications and virtual machines just to name a few. And as part of the as part of the process of creating and restoring secondary copies the client computing devices may be tasked with processing and preparing the primary data from these various different applications . Moreover the nature of the processing preparation can differ across clients and application types e.g. due to inherent structural and formatting differences between applications .

The one or more data agent s are therefore advantageously configured in some embodiments to assist in the performance of information management operations based on the type of data that is being protected at a client specific and or application specific level.

The data agent may be a software module or component that is generally responsible for managing initiating or otherwise assisting in the performance of information management operations. For instance the data agent may take part in performing data storage operations such as the copying archiving migrating replicating of primary data stored in the primary storage device s . The data agent may receive control information from the storage manager such as commands to transfer copies of data objects metadata and other payload data to the media agents .

In some embodiments a data agent may be distributed between the client computing device and storage manager and any other intermediate components or may be deployed from a remote location or its functions approximated by a remote process that performs some or all of the functions of data agent . In addition a data agent may perform some functions provided by a media agent e.g. encryption and deduplication.

As indicated each data agent may be specialized for a particular application and the system can employ multiple data agents each of which may backup migrate and recover data associated with a different application . For instance different individual data agents may be designed to handle Microsoft Exchange data Lotus Notes data Microsoft Windows file system data Microsoft Active Directory Objects data SQL Server data SharePoint data Oracle database data SAP database data virtual machines and or associated data and other types of data.

A file system data agent for example may handle data files and or other file system information. If a client computing device has two or more types of data one data agent may be used for each data type to copy archive migrate and restore the client computing device data. For example to backup migrate and restore all of the data on a Microsoft Exchange server the client computing device may use one Microsoft Exchange Mailbox data agent to backup the Exchange mailboxes one Microsoft Exchange Database data agent to backup the Exchange databases one Microsoft Exchange Public Folder data agent to backup the Exchange Public Folders and one Microsoft Windows File System data agent to backup the file system of the client computing device . In such embodiments these data agents may be treated as four separate data agents by even though they reside on the same client computing device .

Other embodiments may employ one or more generic data agents that can handle and process data from two or more different applications or that can handle and process multiple data types instead of or in addition to using specialized data agents . For example one generic data agent may be used to back up migrate and restore Microsoft Exchange Mailbox data and Microsoft Exchange Database data while another generic data agent may handle Microsoft Exchange Public Folder data and Microsoft Windows File System data.

Each data agent may be configured to access data and or metadata stored in the primary storage device s associated with the data agent and process the data as appropriate. For example during a secondary copy operation the data agent may arrange or assemble the data and metadata into one or more files having a certain format e.g. a particular backup or archive format before transferring the file s to a media agent or other component. The file s may include a list of files or other metadata. Each data agent can also assist in restoring data or metadata to primary storage devices from a secondary copy . For instance the data agent may operate in conjunction with the storage manager and one or more of the media agents to restore data from secondary storage device s .

As indicated above with respect to off loading certain responsibilities from the client computing devices to intermediary components such as the media agent s can provide a number of benefits including improved client computing device operation faster secondary copy operation performance and enhanced scalability. As one specific example which will be discussed below in further detail the media agent can act as a local cache of copied data and or metadata that it has stored to the secondary storage device s providing improved restore capabilities.

Generally speaking a media agent may be implemented as a software module that manages coordinates and facilitates the transmission of data as directed by the storage manager between a client computing device and one or more secondary storage devices . Whereas the storage manager controls the operation of the information management system the media agent generally provides a portal to secondary storage devices .

Media agents can comprise logically and or physically separate nodes in the information management system e.g. separate from the client computing devices storage manager and or secondary storage devices . In addition each media agent may reside on a dedicated secondary storage computing device in some cases while in other embodiments a plurality of media agents reside on the same secondary storage computing device .

A media agent and corresponding media agent database may be considered to be associated with a particular secondary storage device if that media agent is capable of one or more of routing and or storing data to the particular secondary storage device coordinating the routing and or storing of data to the particular secondary storage device retrieving data from the particular secondary storage device and coordinating the retrieval of data from a particular secondary storage device .

While media agent s are generally associated with one or more secondary storage devices the media agents in certain embodiments are physically separate from the secondary storage devices . For instance the media agents may reside on secondary storage computing devices having different housings or packages than the secondary storage devices . In one example a media agent resides on a first server computer and is in communication with a secondary storage device s residing in a separate rack mounted RAID based system.

In operation a media agent associated with a particular secondary storage device may instruct the secondary storage device e.g. a tape library to use a robotic arm or other retrieval means to load or eject a certain storage media and to subsequently archive migrate or retrieve data to or from that media e.g. for the purpose of restoring the data to a client computing device . The media agent may communicate with a secondary storage device via a suitable communications link such as a SCSI or Fiber Channel link.

As shown each media agent may maintain an associated media agent database . The media agent database may be stored in a disk or other storage device not shown that is local to the secondary storage computing device on which the media agent resides. In other cases the media agent database is stored remotely from the secondary storage computing device .

The media agent database can include among other things an index including data generated during secondary copy operations and other storage or information management operations. The index provides a media agent or other component with a fast and efficient mechanism for locating secondary copies or other data stored in the secondary storage devices . In one configuration a storage manager index or other data structure may store data associating a client computing device with a particular media agent and or secondary storage device as specified in a storage policy. A media agent index or other data structure associated with the particular media agent may in turn include information about the stored data.

For instance for each secondary copy the index may include metadata such as a list of the data objects e.g. files subdirectories database objects mailbox objects etc. a path to the secondary copy on the corresponding secondary storage device location information indicating where the data objects are stored in the secondary storage device when the data objects were created or modified etc. Thus the index includes metadata associated with the secondary copies that is readily available for use in storage operations and other activities without having to be first retrieved from the secondary storage device . In yet further embodiments some or all of the data in the index may instead or additionally be stored along with the data in a secondary storage device e.g. with a copy of the index .

Because the index maintained in the database may operate as a cache it can also be referred to as an index cache. In such cases information stored in the index cache typically comprises data that reflects certain particulars about storage operations that have occurred relatively recently. After some triggering event such as after a certain period of time elapses or the index cache reaches a particular size the index cache may be copied or migrated to a secondary storage device s . This information may need to be retrieved and uploaded back into the index cache or otherwise restored to a media agent to facilitate retrieval of data from the secondary storage device s . In some embodiments the cached information may include format or containerization information related to archives or other files stored on the storage device s . In this manner the index cache allows for accelerated restores.

In some alternative embodiments the media agent generally acts as a coordinator or facilitator of storage operations between client computing devices and corresponding secondary storage devices but does not actually write the data to the secondary storage device . For instance the storage manager or the media agent may instruct a client computing device and secondary storage device to communicate with one another directly. In such a case the client computing device transmits the data directly to the secondary storage device according to the received instructions and vice versa. In some such cases the media agent may still receive process and or maintain metadata related to the storage operations. Moreover in these embodiments the payload data can flow through the media agent for the purposes of populating the index cache maintained in the media agent database but not for writing to the secondary storage device .

The media agent and or other components such as the storage manager may in some cases incorporate additional functionality such as data classification content indexing deduplication encryption compression and the like. Further details regarding these and other functions are described below.

As described certain functions of the information management system can be distributed amongst various physical and or logical components in the system. For instance one or more of the storage manager data agents and media agents may reside on computing devices that are physically separate from one another. This architecture can provide a number of benefits.

For instance hardware and software design choices for each distributed component can be targeted to suit its particular function. The secondary computing devices on which the media agents reside can be tailored for interaction with associated secondary storage devices and provide fast index cache operation among other specific tasks. Similarly the client computing device s can be selected to effectively service the applications residing thereon in order to efficiently produce and store primary data .

Moreover in some cases one or more of the individual components in the information management system can be distributed to multiple separate computing devices. As one example for large file systems where the amount of data stored in the storage management database is relatively large the management database may be migrated to or otherwise reside on a specialized database server e.g. an SQL server separate from a server that implements the other functions of the storage manager . This configuration can provide added protection because the database can be protected with standard database utilities e.g. SQL log shipping or database replication independent from other functions of the storage manager . The database can be efficiently replicated to a remote site for use in the event of a disaster or other data loss incident at the primary site. Or the database can be replicated to another computing device within the same site such as to a higher performance machine in the event that a storage manager host device can no longer service the needs of a growing information management system .

The distributed architecture also provides both scalability and efficient component utilization. shows an embodiment of the information management system including a plurality of client computing devices and associated data agents as well as a plurality of secondary storage computing devices and associated media agents .

Additional components can be added or subtracted based on the evolving needs of the information management system . For instance depending on where bottlenecks are identified administrators can add additional client computing devices secondary storage devices and corresponding media agents and or secondary storage devices .

Moreover each client computing device in some embodiments can communicate with any of the media agents e.g. as directed by the storage manager . And each media agent may be able to communicate with any of the secondary storage devices e.g. as directed by the storage manager . Thus operations can be routed to the secondary storage devices in a dynamic and highly flexible manner. Further examples of scalable systems capable of dynamic storage operations are provided in U.S. Pat. No. 7 246 207 which is incorporated by reference herein.

In alternative configurations certain components are not distributed and may instead reside and execute on the same computing device. For example in some embodiments one or more data agents and the storage manager reside on the same client computing device . In another embodiment one or more data agents and one or more media agents reside on a single computing device.

In order to protect and leverage stored data the information management system can be configured to perform a variety of information management operations. As will be described these operations can generally include secondary copy and other data movement operations processing and data manipulation operations and management operations.

Data movement operations according to certain embodiments are generally operations that involve the copying or migration of data e.g. payload data between different locations in the information management system . For example data movement operations can include operations in which stored data is copied migrated or otherwise transferred from primary storage device s to secondary storage device s from secondary storage device s to different secondary storage device s or from primary storage device s to different primary storage device s .

Data movement operations can include by way of example backup operations archive operations information lifecycle management operations such as hierarchical storage management operations replication operations e.g. continuous data replication operations snapshot operations deduplication operations single instancing operations auxiliary copy operations and the like. As will be discussed some of these operations involve the copying migration or other movement of data without actually creating multiple distinct copies. Nonetheless some or all of these operations are referred to as copy operations for simplicity.

A backup operation creates a copy of primary data at a particular point in time. Each subsequent backup copy may be maintained independently of the first. Further a backup copy in some embodiments is stored in a backup format. This can be in contrast to the version in primary data from which the backup copy is derived and which may instead be stored in a native format of the source application s . In various cases backup copies can be stored in a format in which the data is compressed encrypted deduplicated and or otherwise modified from the original application format. For example a backup copy may be stored in a backup format that facilitates compression and or efficient long term storage.

Backup copies can have relatively long retention periods as compared to primary data and may be stored on media with slower retrieval times than primary data and certain other types of secondary copies . On the other hand backups may have relatively shorter retention periods than some other types of secondary copies such as archive copies described below . Backups may sometimes be stored at on offsite location.

Backup operations can include full synthetic or incremental backups. A full backup in some embodiments is generally a complete image of the data to be protected. However because full backup copies can consume a relatively large amount of storage it can be useful to use a full backup copy as a baseline and only store changes relative to the full backup copy for subsequent backup copies.

For instance a differential backup operation or cumulative incremental backup operation tracks and stores changes that have occurred since the last full backup. Differential backups can grow quickly in size but can provide relatively efficient restore times because a restore can be completed in some cases using only the full backup copy and the latest differential copy.

An incremental backup operation generally tracks and stores changes since the most recent backup copy of any type which can greatly reduce storage utilization. In some cases however restore times can be relatively long in comparison to full or differential backups because completing a restore operation may involve accessing a full backup in addition to multiple incremental backups.

Any of the above types of backup operations can be at the file level e.g. where the information management system generally tracks changes to files at the file level and includes copies of files in the backup copy. In other cases block level backups are employed where files are broken into constituent blocks and changes are tracked at the block level. Upon restore the information management system reassembles the blocks into files in a transparent fashion.

Far less data may actually be transferred and copied to the secondary storage devices during a block level copy than during a file level copy resulting in faster execution times. However when restoring a block level copy the process of locating constituent blocks can sometimes result in longer restore times as compared to file level backups. Similar to backup operations the other types of secondary copy operations described herein can also be implemented at either the file level or the block level.

Because backup operations generally involve maintaining a version of the copied data in primary data and also maintaining backup copies in secondary storage device s they can consume significant storage capacity. To help reduce storage consumption an archive operation according to certain embodiments creates a secondary copy by both copying and removing source data. Or seen another way archive operations can involve moving some or all of the source data to the archive destination. Thus data satisfying criteria for removal e.g. data of a threshold age or size from the source copy may be removed from source storage. Archive copies are sometimes stored in an archive format or other non native application format. The source data may be primary data or a secondary copy depending on the situation. As with backup copies archive copies can be stored in a format in which the data is compressed encrypted deduplicated and or otherwise modified from the original application format.

In addition archive copies may be retained for relatively long periods of time e.g. years and in some cases are never deleted. Archive copies are generally retained for longer periods of time than backup copies for example. In certain embodiments archive copies may be made and kept for extended periods in order to meet compliance regulations.

Moreover when primary data is archived in some cases the archived primary data or a portion thereof is deleted when creating the archive copy. Thus archiving can serve the purpose of freeing up space in the primary storage device s . Similarly when a secondary copy is archived the secondary copy may be deleted and an archive copy can therefore serve the purpose of freeing up space in secondary storage device s . In contrast source copies often remain intact when creating backup copies.

Snapshot operations can provide a relatively lightweight efficient mechanism for protecting data. From an end user viewpoint a snapshot may be thought of as an instant image of the primary data at a given point in time. In one embodiment a snapshot may generally capture the directory structure of an object in primary data such as a file or volume or other data set at a particular moment in time and may also preserve file attributes and contents. A snapshot in some cases is created relatively quickly e.g. substantially instantly using a minimum amount of file space but may still function as a conventional file system backup.

A snapshot copy in many cases can be made quickly and without significantly impacting primary computing resources because large amounts of data need not be copied or moved. In some embodiments a snapshot may exist as a virtual file system parallel to the actual file system. Users in some cases gain read only access to the record of files and directories of the snapshot. By electing to restore primary data from a snapshot taken at a given point in time users may also return the current file system to the state of the file system that existed when the snapshot was taken.

Some types of snapshots do not actually create another physical copy of all the data as it existed at the particular point in time but may simply create pointers that are able to map files and directories to specific memory locations e.g. disk blocks where the data resides as it existed at the particular point in time. For example a snapshot copy may include a set of pointers derived from the file system or an application. Each pointer points to a respective stored data block so collectively the set of pointers reflect the storage location and state of the data object e.g. file s or volume s or data set s at a particular point in time when the snapshot copy was created.

In some embodiments once a snapshot has been taken subsequent changes to the file system typically do not overwrite the blocks in use at the time of the snapshot. Therefore the initial snapshot may use only a small amount of disk space needed to record a mapping or other data structure representing or otherwise tracking the blocks that correspond to the current state of the file system. Additional disk space is usually required only when files and directories are actually modified later. Furthermore when files are modified typically only the pointers which map to blocks are copied not the blocks themselves. In some embodiments for example in the case of copy on write snapshots when a block changes in primary storage the block is copied to secondary storage or cached in primary storage before the block is overwritten in primary storage. The snapshot mapping of file system data is also updated to reflect the changed block s at that particular point in time. In some other cases a snapshot includes a full physical copy of all or substantially all of the data represented by the snapshot. Further examples of snapshot operations are provided in U.S. Pat. No. 7 529 782 which is incorporated by reference herein.

Another type of secondary copy operation is a replication operation. Some types of secondary copies are used to periodically capture images of primary data at particular points in time e.g. backups archives and snapshots . However it can also be useful for recovery purposes to protect primary data in a more continuous fashion by replicating the primary data substantially as changes occur. In some cases a replication copy can be a mirror copy for instance where changes made to primary data are mirrored to another location e.g. to secondary storage device s . By copying each write operation to the replication copy two storage systems are kept synchronized or substantially synchronized so that they are virtually identical at approximately the same time. Where entire disk volumes are mirrored however mirroring can require significant amount of storage space and utilizes a large amount of processing resources.

According to some embodiments storage operations are performed on replicated data that represents a recoverable state or known good state of a particular application running on the source system. For instance in certain embodiments known good replication copies may be viewed as copies of primary data . This feature allows the system to directly access copy restore backup or otherwise manipulate the replication copies as if the data was the live primary data . This can reduce access time storage utilization and impact on source applications among other benefits.

Based on known good state information the information management system can replicate sections of application data that represent a recoverable state rather than rote copying of blocks of data. Examples of compatible replication operations e.g. continuous data replication are provided in U.S. Pat. No. 7 617 262 which is incorporated by reference herein.

Another type of data movement operation is deduplication which is useful to reduce the amount of data within the system. For instance some or all of the above described secondary storage operations can involve deduplication in some fashion. New data is read broken down into blocks e.g. sub file level blocks of a selected granularity compared with blocks that are already stored and only the new blocks are stored. Blocks that already exist are represented as pointers to the already stored data.

In order to stream line the comparison process the information management system may calculate and or store signatures e.g. hashes corresponding to the individual data blocks and compare the hashes instead of comparing entire data blocks. In some cases only a single instance of each element is stored and deduplication operations may therefore be referred to interchangeably as single instancing operations. Depending on the implementation however deduplication or single instancing operations can store more than one instance of certain data blocks but nonetheless significantly reduce data redundancy. Moreover single instancing in some cases is distinguished from deduplication as a process of analyzing and reducing data at the file level rather than the sub file level.

Depending on the embodiment deduplication blocks can be of fixed or variable length. Using variable length blocks can provide enhanced deduplication by responding to changes in the data stream but can involve complex processing. In some cases the information management system utilizes a technique for dynamically aligning deduplication blocks e.g. fixed length blocks based on changing content in the data stream as described in U.S. Pat. No. 8 364 652 which is incorporated by reference herein.

The information management system can perform deduplication in a variety of manners at a variety of locations in the information management system . For instance in some embodiments the information management system implements target side deduplication by deduplicating data e.g. secondary copies stored in the secondary storage devices . In some such cases the media agents are generally configured to manage the deduplication process. For instance one or more of the media agents maintain a corresponding deduplication database that stores deduplication information e.g. datablock signatures . Examples of such a configuration are provided in U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2012 0150826 which is incorporated by reference herein. Deduplication can also be performed on the source side or client side e.g. to reduce the amount of traffic between the media agents and the client computing device s and or reduce redundant data stored in the primary storage devices . Examples of such deduplication techniques are provided in U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2012 0150818 which is incorporated by reference herein.

In some embodiments files and other data over their lifetime move from more expensive quick access storage to less expensive slower access storage. Operations associated with moving data through various tiers of storage are sometimes referred to as information lifecycle management ILM operations.

One type of ILM operation is a hierarchical storage management HSM operation. A HSM operation is generally an operation for automatically moving data between classes of storage devices such as between high cost and low cost storage devices. For instance an HSM operation may involve movement of data from primary storage devices to secondary storage devices or between tiers of secondary storage devices . With each tier the storage devices may be progressively relatively cheaper have relatively slower access restore times etc. For example movement of data between tiers may occur as data becomes less important over time.

In some embodiments an HSM operation is similar to an archive operation in that creating an HSM copy may though not always involve deleting some of the source data. For example an HSM copy may include data from primary data or a secondary copy that is larger than a given size threshold or older than a given age threshold and that is stored in a backup format.

Often and unlike some types of archive copies HSM data that is removed or aged from the source copy is replaced by a logical reference pointer or stub. The reference pointer or stub can be stored in the primary storage device to replace the deleted data in primary data or other source copy and to point to or otherwise indicate the new location in a secondary storage device .

According to one example files are generally moved between higher and lower cost storage depending on how often the files are accessed. When a user requests access to the HSM data that has been removed or migrated the information management system uses the stub to locate the data and often make recovery of the data appear transparent even though the HSM data may be stored at a location different from the remaining source data. The stub may also include some metadata associated with the corresponding data so that a file system and or application can provide some information about the data object and or a limited functionality version e.g. a preview of the data object.

An HSM copy may be stored in a format other than the native application format e.g. where the data is compressed encrypted deduplicated and or otherwise modified from the original application format . In some cases copies which involve the removal of data from source storage and the maintenance of stub or other logical reference information on source storage may be referred to generally as on line archive copies . On the other hand copies which involve the removal of data from source storage without the maintenance of stub or other logical reference information on source storage may be referred to as off line archive copies .

An auxiliary copy is generally a copy operation in which a copy is created of an existing secondary copy . For instance an initial or primary secondary copy may be generated using or otherwise be derived from primary data whereas an auxiliary copy is generated from the initial secondary copy . Auxiliary copies can be used to create additional standby copies of data and may reside on different secondary storage devices than initial secondary copies . Thus auxiliary copies can be used for recovery purposes if initial secondary copies become unavailable. Exemplary compatible auxiliary copy techniques are described in further detail in U.S. Pat. No. 8 230 195 which is incorporated by reference herein.

The information management system may also perform disaster recovery operations that make or retain disaster recovery copies often as secondary high availability disk copies. The information management system may create secondary disk copies and store the copies at disaster recovery locations using auxiliary copy or replication operations such as continuous data replication technologies. Depending on the particular data protection goals disaster recovery locations can be remote from the client computing devices and primary storage devices remote from some or all of the secondary storage devices or both.

As indicated the information management system can also be configured to implement certain data manipulation operations which according to certain embodiments are generally operations involving the processing or modification of stored data. Some data manipulation operations include content indexing operations and classification operations can be useful in leveraging the data under management to provide enhanced search and other features. Other data manipulation operations such as compression and encryption can provide data reduction and security benefits respectively.

Data manipulation operations can be different than data movement operations in that they do not necessarily involve the copying migration or other transfer of data e.g. primary data or secondary copies between different locations in the system. For instance data manipulation operations may involve processing e.g. offline processing or modification of already stored primary data and or secondary copies . However in some embodiments data manipulation operations are performed in conjunction with data movement operations. As one example the information management system may encrypt data while performing an archive operation.

In some embodiments the information management system content indexes data stored within the primary data and or secondary copies providing enhanced search capabilities for data discovery and other purposes. The content indexing can be used to identify files or other data objects having pre defined content e.g. user defined keywords or phrases metadata e.g. email metadata such as to from cc bcc attachment name received time etc. .

The information management system generally organizes and catalogues the results in a content index which may be stored within the media agent database for example. The content index can also include the storage locations of or pointer references to the indexed data in the primary data or secondary copies as appropriate. The results may also be stored in the form of a content index database or otherwise elsewhere in the information management system e.g. in the primary storage devices or in the secondary storage device . Such index data provides the storage manager or another component with an efficient mechanism for locating primary data and or secondary copies of data objects that match particular criteria.

For instance search criteria can be specified by a user through user interface of the storage manager . In some cases the information management system analyzes data and or metadata in secondary copies to create an off line content index without significantly impacting the performance of the client computing devices . Depending on the embodiment the system can also implement on line content indexing e.g. of primary data . Examples of compatible content indexing techniques are provided in U.S. Pat. No. 8 170 995 which is incorporated by reference herein.

In order to help leverage the data stored in the information management system one or more components can be configured to scan data and or associated metadata for classification purposes to populate a metabase of information. Such scanned classified data and or metadata may be included in a separate database and or on a separate storage device from primary data and or secondary copies such that metabase related operations do not significantly impact performance on other components in the information management system .

In other cases the metabase s may be stored along with primary data and or secondary copies . Files or other data objects can be associated with user specified identifiers e.g. tag entries in the media agent or other indices to facilitate searches of stored data objects. Among a number of other benefits the metabase can also allow efficient automatic identification of files or other data objects to associate with secondary copy or other information management operations e.g. in lieu of scanning an entire file system . Examples of compatible metabases and data classification operations are provided in U.S. Pat. Nos. 8 229 954 and 7 747 579 which are incorporated by reference herein.

The information management system in some cases is configured to process data e.g. files or other data objects secondary copies etc. according to an appropriate encryption algorithm e.g. Blowfish Advanced Encryption Standard AES Triple Data Encryption Standard 3 DES etc. to limit access and provide data security in the information management system .

The information management system in some cases encrypts the data at the client level such that the client computing devices e.g. the data agents encrypt the data prior to forwarding the data to other components e.g. before sending the data media agents during a secondary copy operation. In such cases the client computing device may maintain or have access to an encryption key or passphrase for decrypting the data upon restore. Encryption can also occur when creating copies of secondary copies e.g. when creating auxiliary copies. In yet further embodiments the secondary storage devices can implement built in high performance hardware encryption.

Certain embodiments leverage the integrated ubiquitous nature of the information management system to provide useful system wide management functions. As two non limiting examples the information management system can be configured to implement operations management and e discovery functions.

Operations management can generally include monitoring and managing the health and performance of information management system by without limitation performing error tracking generating granular storage performance metrics e.g. job success failure information deduplication efficiency etc. generating storage modeling and costing information and the like.

Such information can be provided to users via the user interface in a single integrated view. For instance the integrated user interface can include an option to show a virtual view of the system that graphically depicts the various components in the system using appropriate icons. The operations management functionality can facilitate planning and decision making. For example in some embodiments a user may view the status of some or all jobs as well as the status of each component of the information management system . Users may then plan and make decisions based on this data. For instance a user may view high level information regarding storage operations for the information management system such as job status component status resource status e.g. network pathways etc. and other information. The user may also drill down or use other means to obtain more detailed information regarding a particular component job or the like.

In some cases the information management system alerts a user such as a system administrator when a particular resource is unavailable or congested. For example a particular primary storage device or secondary storage device might be full or require additional capacity. Or a component may be unavailable due to hardware failure software problems or other reasons. In response the information management system may suggest solutions to such problems when they occur or provide a warning prior to occurrence . For example the storage manager may alert the user that a secondary storage device is full or otherwise congested. The storage manager may then suggest based on job and data storage information contained in its database an alternate secondary storage device .

Other types of corrective actions may include suggesting an alternate data path to a particular primary or secondary storage device or dividing data to be stored among various available primary or secondary storage devices as a load balancing measure or to otherwise optimize storage or retrieval time. Such suggestions or corrective actions may be performed automatically if desired. Further examples of some compatible operations management techniques and of interfaces providing an integrated view of an information management system are provided in U.S. Pat. No. 7 343 453 which is incorporated by reference herein. In some embodiments the storage manager implements the operations management functions described herein.

The information management system can also be configured to perform system wide e discovery operations in some embodiments. In general e discovery operations provide a unified collection and search capability for data in the system such as data stored in the secondary storage devices e.g. backups archives or other secondary copies . For example the information management system may construct and maintain a virtual repository for data stored in the information management system that is integrated across source applications different storage device types etc. According to some embodiments e discovery utilizes other techniques described herein such as data classification and or content indexing.

As indicated previously an information management policy can include a data structure or other information source that specifies a set of parameters e.g. criteria and rules associated with secondary copy or other information management operations.

One type of information management policy is a storage policy. According to certain embodiments a storage policy generally comprises a logical container that defines or includes information sufficient to determine one or more of the following items 1 what data will be associated with the storage policy 2 a destination to which the data will be stored 3 datapath information specifying how the data will be communicated to the destination 4 the type of storage operation to be performed and 5 retention information specifying how long the data will be retained at the destination.

Data associated with a storage policy can be logically organized into groups which can be referred to as sub clients . A sub client may represent static or dynamic associations of portions of a data volume. Sub clients may represent mutually exclusive portions. Thus in certain embodiments a portion of data may be given a label and the association is stored as a static entity in an index database or other storage location.

Sub clients may also be used as an effective administrative scheme of organizing data according to data type department within the enterprise storage preferences or the like. Depending on the configuration sub clients can correspond to files folders virtual machines databases etc. In one exemplary scenario an administrator may find it preferable to separate e mail data from financial data using two different sub clients.

A storage policy can define where data is stored by specifying a target or destination storage device or group of storage devices . For instance where the secondary storage device includes a group of disk libraries the storage policy may specify a particular disk library for storing the sub clients associated with the policy. As another example where the secondary storage devices include one or more tape libraries the storage policy may specify a particular tape library for storing the sub clients associated with the storage policy and may also specify a drive pool and a tape pool defining a group of tape drives and a group of tapes respectively for use in storing the sub client data.

Datapath information can also be included in the storage policy. For instance the storage policy may specify network pathways and components to utilize when moving the data to the destination storage device s . In some embodiments the storage policy specifies one or more media agents for conveying data e.g. one or more sub clients associated with the storage policy between the source e.g. one or more host client computing devices and destination e.g. a particular target secondary storage device .

A storage policy can also specify the type s of operations associated with the storage policy such as a backup archive snapshot auxiliary copy or the like. Retention information can specify how long the data will be kept depending on organizational needs e.g. a number of days months years etc. 

The information management policies may also include one or more scheduling policies specifying when and how often to perform operations. Scheduling information may specify with what frequency e.g. hourly weekly daily event based etc. or under what triggering conditions secondary copy or other information management operations will take place. Scheduling policies in some cases are associated with particular components such as particular sub clients client computing device and the like. In one configuration a separate scheduling policy is maintained for particular sub clients on a client computing device . The scheduling policy specifies that those sub clients are to be moved to secondary storage devices every hour according to storage policies associated with the respective sub clients.

When adding a new client computing device administrators can manually configure information management policies and or other settings e.g. via the user interface . However this can be an involved process resulting in delays and it may be desirable to begin data protecting operations quickly.

Thus in some embodiments the information management system automatically applies a default configuration to client computing device . As one example when a data agent s is installed on a client computing devices the installation script may register the client computing device with the storage manager which in turn applies the default configuration to the new client computing device . In this manner data protection operations can begin substantially immediately. The default configuration can include a default storage policy for example and can specify any appropriate information sufficient to begin data protection operations. This can include a type of data protection operation scheduling information a target secondary storage device data path information e.g. a particular media agent and the like.

Other types of information management policies are possible. For instance the information management policies can also include one or more audit or security policies. An audit policy is a set of preferences rules and or criteria that protect sensitive data in the information management system . For example an audit policy may define sensitive objects as files or objects that contain particular keywords e.g. confidential or privileged and or are associated with particular keywords e.g. in metadata or particular flags e.g. in metadata identifying a document or email as personal confidential etc. .

An audit policy may further specify rules for handling sensitive objects. As an example an audit policy may require that a reviewer approve the transfer of any sensitive objects to a cloud storage site and that if approval is denied for a particular sensitive object the sensitive object should be transferred to a local storage device instead. To facilitate this approval the audit policy may further specify how a secondary storage computing device or other system component should notify a reviewer that a sensitive object is slated for transfer.

In some implementations the information management policies may include one or more provisioning policies. A provisioning policy can include a set of preferences priorities rules and or criteria that specify how clients or groups thereof may utilize system resources such as available storage on cloud storage and or network bandwidth. A provisioning policy specifies for example data quotas for particular client computing devices e.g. a number of gigabytes that can be stored monthly quarterly or annually . The storage manager or other components may enforce the provisioning policy. For instance the media agents may enforce the policy when transferring data to secondary storage devices . If a client computing device exceeds a quota a budget for the client computing device or associated department is adjusted accordingly or an alert may trigger.

While the above types of information management policies have been described as separate policies one or more of these can be generally combined into a single information management policy . For instance a storage policy may also include or otherwise be associated with one or more scheduling audit or provisioning policies. Moreover while storage policies are typically associated with moving and storing data other policies may be associated with other types of information management operations. The following is a non exhaustive list of items the information management policies may specify 

Policies can additionally specify or depend on a variety of historical or current criteria that may be used to determine which rules to apply to a particular data object system component or information management operation such as 

As indicated by the dashed box the second media agent B and the tape library B are off site and may therefore be remotely located from the other components in the information management system e.g. in a different city office building etc. . In this manner information stored on the tape library may provide protection in the event of a disaster or other failure.

The file system sub client and its associated primary data A in certain embodiments generally comprise information generated by the file system and or operating system of the client computing device and can include for example file system data e.g. regular files file tables mount points etc. operating system data e.g. registries event logs etc. and the like. The e mail sub client on the other hand and its associated primary data B include data generated by an e mail client application operating on the client computing device and can include mailbox information folder information emails attachments associated database information and the like. As described above the sub clients can be logical containers and the data included in the corresponding primary data A B may or may not be stored contiguously.

The exemplary storage policy A includes a backup copy rule set a disaster recovery copy rule set and a compliance copy rule set . The backup copy rule set specifies that it is associated with a file system sub client and an email sub client . Each of these sub clients are associated with the particular client computing device . The backup copy rule set further specifies that the backup operation will be written to the disk library A and designates a particular media agent A to convey the data to the disk library A. Finally the backup copy rule set specifies that backup copies created according to the rule set are scheduled to be generated on an hourly basis and to be retained for 30 days. In some other embodiments scheduling information is not included in the storage policy A and is instead specified by a separate scheduling policy.

The disaster recovery copy rule set is associated with the same two sub clients . However the disaster recovery copy rule set is associated with the tape library B unlike the backup copy rule set . Moreover the disaster recovery copy rule set specifies that a different media agent B than the media agent A associated with the backup copy rule set will be used to convey the data to the tape library B. As indicated disaster recovery copies created according to the rule set will be retained for 60 days and will be generated on a daily basis. Disaster recovery copies generated according to the disaster recovery copy rule set can provide protection in the event of a disaster or other data loss event that would affect the backup copy A maintained on the disk library A.

The compliance copy rule set is only associated with the email sub client and not the file system sub client . Compliance copies generated according to the compliance copy rule set will therefore not include primary data A from the file system sub client . For instance the organization may be under an obligation to store maintain copies of email data for a particular period of time e.g. 10 years to comply with state or federal regulations while similar regulations do not apply to the file system data. The compliance copy rule set is associated with the same tape library B and media agent B as the disaster recovery copy rule set although a different storage device or media agent could be used in other embodiments. Finally the compliance copy rule set specifies that copies generated under the compliance copy rule set will be retained for 10 years and will be generated on a quarterly basis.

At step 1 the storage manager initiates a backup operation according to the backup copy rule set . For instance a scheduling service running on the storage manager accesses scheduling information from the backup copy rule set or a separate scheduling policy associated with the client computing device and initiates a backup copy operation on an hourly basis. Thus at the scheduled time slot the storage manager sends instructions to the client computing device to begin the backup operation.

At step 2 the file system data agent A and the email data agent B residing on the client computing device respond to the instructions received from the storage manager by accessing and processing the primary data A B involved in the copy operation from the primary storage device . Because the operation is a backup copy operation the data agent s A B may format the data into a backup format or otherwise process the data.

At step 3 the client computing device communicates the retrieved processed data to the first media agent A as directed by the storage manager according to the backup copy rule set . In some other embodiments the information management system may implement a load balancing availability based or other appropriate algorithm to select from the available set of media agents A B. Regardless of the manner the media agent A is selected the storage manager may further keep a record in the storage manager database of the association between the selected media agent A and the client computing device and or between the selected media agent A and the backup copy A.

The target media agent A receives the data from the client computing device and at step 4 conveys the data to the disk library A to create the backup copy A again at the direction of the storage manager and according to the backup copy rule set . The secondary storage device A can be selected in other ways. For instance the media agent A may have a dedicated association with a particular secondary storage device s or the storage manager or media agent A may select from a plurality of secondary storage devices e.g. according to availability using one of the techniques described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 246 207 which is incorporated by reference herein.

The media agent A can also update its index to include data and or metadata related to the backup copy A such as information indicating where the backup copy A resides on the disk library A data and metadata for cache retrieval etc. After the 30 day retention period expires the storage manager instructs the media agent A to delete the backup copy A from the disk library A.

At step 5 the storage manager initiates the creation of a disaster recovery copy B according to the disaster recovery copy rule set . For instance at step 6 based on instructions received from the storage manager at step 5 the specified media agent B retrieves the most recent backup copy A from the disk library A.

At step 7 again at the direction of the storage manager and as specified in the disaster recovery copy rule set the media agent B uses the retrieved data to create a disaster recovery copy B on the tape library B. In some cases the disaster recovery copy B is a direct mirror copy of the backup copy A and remains in the backup format. In other embodiments the disaster recovery copy C may be generated in some other manner such as by using the primary data A from the storage device as source data. The disaster recovery copy operation is initiated once a day and the disaster recovery copies A are deleted after 60 days.

At step 8 the storage manager initiates the creation of a compliance copy C according to the compliance copy rule set . For instance the storage manager instructs the media agent B to create the compliance copy C on the tape library B at step 9 as specified in the compliance copy rule set . In the example the compliance copy C is generated using the disaster recovery copy B. In other embodiments the compliance copy C is instead generated using either the primary data B corresponding to the email sub client or using the backup copy A from the disk library A as source data. As specified compliance copies C are created quarterly and are deleted after ten years.

While not shown in at some later point in time a restore operation can be initiated involving one or more of the secondary copies A B C. As one example a user may manually initiate a restore of the backup copy A by interacting with the user interface of the storage manager . The storage manager then accesses data in its index and or the respective storage policy A associated with the selected backup copy A to identify the appropriate media agent A and or secondary storage device A.

In other cases a media agent may be selected for use in the restore operation based on a load balancing algorithm an availability based algorithm or other criteria. The selected media agent A retrieves the data from the disk library A. For instance the media agent A may access its index to identify a location of the backup copy A on the disk library A or may access location information residing on the disk A itself.

When the backup copy A was recently created or accessed the media agent A accesses a cached version of the backup copy A residing in the media agent index without having to access the disk library A for some or all of the data. Once it has retrieved the backup copy A the media agent A communicates the data to the source client computing device . Upon receipt the file system data agent A and the email data agent B may unpackage e.g. restore from a backup format to the native application format the data in the backup copy A and restore the unpackaged data to the primary storage device .

The formatting and structure of secondary copies can vary depending on the embodiment. In some cases secondary copies are formatted as a series of logical data units or chunks e.g. 512 MB 1 GB 2 GB 4 GB or 8 GB chunks . This can facilitate efficient communication and writing to secondary storage devices e.g. according to resource availability. For example a single secondary copy may be written on a chunk by chunk basis to a single secondary storage device or across multiple secondary storage devices . In some cases users can select different chunk sizes e.g. to improve throughput to tape storage devices.

Generally each chunk can include a header and a payload. The payload can include files or other data units or subsets thereof included in the chunk whereas the chunk header generally includes metadata relating to the chunk some or all of which may be derived from the payload. For example during a secondary copy operation the media agent storage manager or other component may divide the associated files into chunks and generate headers for each chunk by processing the constituent files.

The headers can include a variety of information such as file identifier s volume s offset s or other information associated with the payload data items a chunk sequence number etc. Importantly in addition to being stored with the secondary copy on the secondary storage device the chunk headers can also be stored to the index of the associated media agent s and or the storage manager index . This is useful in some cases for providing faster processing of secondary copies during restores or other operations. In some cases once a chunk is successfully transferred to a secondary storage device the secondary storage device returns an indication of receipt e.g. to the media agent and or storage manager which may update their respective indexes accordingly.

During restore chunks may be processed e.g. by the media agent according to the information in the chunk header to reassemble the files. Additional information relating to chunks can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 8 156 086 which is incorporated by reference herein.

The systems and methods described with respect to can be used to implement automated retention policy. In some embodiments a tiered retention module is a software module that forms a part of or resides on the storage manager or alternatively the media agents . The tiered retention module can additionally be a software module executing on one or more of the client computers . In some embodiments the tiered retention module may be implemented as a part of the data agent . Automated retention policies will now be discussed in more detail with respect to .

The system and corresponding components of may be similar to or the same as the system and similarly named components of . Moreover depending on the embodiment the system of may additionally include any of the other components shown in that are not specifically shown in e.g. one or more storage manager databases one or more media agent databases one or more storage manager indexes one or more media agent indexes etc. . The system may include one or more of each component. All components of the system can be in direct communication with each other or communicate indirectly via the client the storage manager the media agent or the like. In certain embodiments some of the components in shown as separate components can reside on a single computing device or vice versa. For example the tiered retention module can be on the storage manager or on a separate computing device.

An automatic tiered retention module generally manages and classifies data in the information store and or the storage devices according to a user defined or predefined policy for retention in different buckets within the storage system . As will be described in greater detail herein the buckets can be logically organized in a hierarchy. Moreover the bucket hierarchy can be physically distributed across the various memory components in the storage system . For instance the buckets can be implemented in one or more of the secondary storage devices . In some embodiments the tiered retention module is a software module that forms a part of or resides on the storage manager or alternatively the media agents . The tiered retention module can additionally be a software module executing on one or more of the client computers . In some embodiments the tiered retention module may be implemented as a part of the data agent . The tiered retention module will be discussed in more detail with respect to .

The system and corresponding components of may be similar to or the same as the system and similarly named components of . Moreover depending on the embodiment the system of may additionally include any of the other components shown in that are not specifically shown in e.g. one or more information stores etc. . The system may include one or more of each component. All components of the system can be in direct communication with each other or communicate indirectly via the client the storage manager the media agent or the like. In certain embodiments some of the components in shown as separate components can reside on a single computing device or vice versa. For example the tiered retention module can be on the storage manager or on a separate computing device.

With further reference to the interaction between the various components of the automatic tiered retention system will now be described in greater detail with respect to data flow steps indicated by the numbered arrows.

At data flow step 1 a tiered retention storage policy is received by the storage manager . The policy can be defined by a system administrator or another user. Alternatively the policy can be preconfigured in the storage manager . For instance the storage manager may access a default tiered retention policy if it does not receive one from the user or other entity.

The tiered retention storage policy includes criteria for automatically classifying data such as user data stored in the info store and or in the storage devices . The classification criteria can depend on the user s specific requirements and the user can define it accordingly. Details regarding automatic classification will be discussed below in connection with data flow step 3.

At data flow step 2 data in the information store is copied to the storage devices . While described with respect to a backup copy operation for the purposes of illustration the techniques described herein are compatible with other types of storage operations such as for example replication snapshots archiving and the like. A description of some storage operations compatible with embodiments described herein is provided above. The data agents can initiate the backup of data through the media agents and the media agents migrate or otherwise copy the data to the storage devices . One or more data agents may communicate with one or more media agent and one or more media agents may communicate with one or more storage device . In certain embodiments the data migrated to the storage devices is initially placed in the default tier in the storage devices which may be associated with a default retention e.g. relatively short period.

At data flow step 3 the tiered retention module monitors data in the storage devices and based on the results of the monitoring automatically classifies the data according to the tiered retention policy. Data in the storage devices may be analyzed at any granularity. For instance the data can organized and or processed as files e.g. emails Microsoft Office documents media files etc. pages which may span more than one file data blocks which may correspond to portions of files or in any other appropriate fashion.

The retention policy may specify that the tiered retention module applies the retention policy e.g. classifies copies and or prunes the data according to a desired schedule. For example the system may repeatedly apply the retention policy e.g. classify copy and or prune the data after the passage of a pre determined amount of time such as on a regular basis e.g. after a particular time interval such as a certain number of hours or days or on an intermittent basis. In some embodiments the schedule dictates that the tiered retention module classifies and assigns data to appropriate buckets incrementally as the data is added to the system. In this manner the classification and or pruning can be applied to data as it is stored e.g. onto the secondary storage devices . As an example the scheduling policy can dictate that the tiered retention module classify and or copy the data upon receipt of a pre determined amount of new data such as where a pre determined amount of new backup data is stored on the storage devices . In this case classification into buckets may occur on newly stored data only after receiving a threshold amount of new data since the last incremental application of the classification process. By classifying the data in increments new data items can be sorted efficiently without having to re sort old data items. In some cases the policy can comprise a combination of time based and incremental approaches. For instance in one embodiment only newly stored data is classified into buckets while substantially all of the data is analyzed for pruning. Even where classification generally occurs only on incremental data upon implementation of a new retention policy substantially all of the data may be initially classified into buckets in order to recalibrate according to the new policy. In general selection of an appropriate scheduling policy reduces manual processing by administrators saving resources.

Based on the tiered retention policy the tiered retention module can classify data based on a wide variety of parameters including content of the data metadata associated with the data or any other appropriate characteristic or attribute of the data.

In one embodiment the tiered retention module searches through the data based on certain e.g. user specified search terms and classifies the data based on the results of the search. For instance where the data is organized in a plurality of files the user specifies certain search terms and the tiered retention module searches through the content of the files metadata associated with the files or both. The search can be a semantic search concept search or any other type of enhanced search.

Where the files comprise emails for example the policy can classify data according to email content subject matter as indicated by content and or metadata or parameters related to email. Email parameters can include mailbox owner sender receiver date etc. As an example a corporation may define a tiered retention policy which dictates that emails relating to financial documents are retained by the storage system for a certain number of years based on subject matter e.g. subject matter of content and or metadata could indicate that the email is associated with the accounting department of an organization . As another example a retention policy may also dictate that emails sent to and or received from a certain employee e.g. the CEO are stored for a particular number of years. The tiered retention module can identify such emails based on metadata indicating the mailbox owner the sender or recipient email address or some other appropriate means.

Multiple metadata properties may be used together and metadata properties could be used in conjunction with content. Metadata may be stored in a metabase as described in greater detail in application Ser. No. 11 563 940 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 747 579 issued Jun. 29 2010 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Some example scenarios where the automatic classification described herein may be particularly useful include the following 

The data that is classified according to a particular retention policy is assigned to a corresponding bucket in the storage system . As used herein the term bucket can refer to a data storage container having a particular set of retention parameters associated with it. Retention parameters can include without limitation 1 a retention period defining a length of time data included in a particular bucket is kept until the data is pruned or otherwise deleted from the bucket 2 a storage class or type e.g. primary backup secondary backup archive a particular tier in a hierarchical storage management system etc. 3 a type of media associated with the bucket e.g. magnetic drive tape drive solid state drive etc.

Moreover buckets can be delineated logically physically or a combination thereof. For example a first set of one or more of the buckets may reside logically and physically on a first one of the storage devices a second set of one or more of the buckets may reside on a second one of the storage devices and so on. In other cases one or more of the buckets may comprise a single logical entity but is distributed across more than one of the storage devices . In yet further configurations one or more of the storage devices correspond to a single bucket. In another embodiment the buckets are delineated by storage device type and storage devices having a first type correspond to a first bucket or set of buckets storage devices having a second type correspond to a second bucket or set of buckets etc.

The retention period for the buckets can vary e.g. 1 2 5 10 or more hours days or years . Moreover the retention period can correspond to the length of time the data will be kept after it is placed in the bucket to the length of time the data will be kept after it was originally created by an application on the client or stored in the client information store or to some other appropriate duration. After the time period expires the tiered retention module prunes the data from the particular bucket. For instance the data may be pruned at the next scheduled application of the pruning logic according to the retention policy. The time period can be set by the user e.g. at data flow step 1 in some cases or can be part of a pre determined retention policy. In some cases the tiered retention module sets the retention period based on some other characteristic associated with the particular bucket. For example the retention period can be based on the type of data associated with the bucket e.g. emails finance or accounting related files etc. the type of media associated with the bucket and the like. In other embodiments a default retention period is used.

Buckets may also be defined based on criteria for adding data to a bucket instead of or in addition to retention period. For instance buckets may be associated with particular content and metadata.

As shown in the buckets may be organized in a hierarchy in certain cases. For example parent buckets at a first level in the hierarchy can each be further broken down into child buckets at lower levels in the hierarchy. And the files or other data can be assigned to the various buckets based on content metadata etc. For example child buckets may generally have longer associated retention periods than the parent bucket from which they depend.

As an illustration the retention policy may dictate that all user generated files associated with employees of a pharmaceutical company be placed in a parent bucket having a 3 year retention period. The policy may further dictate that certain ones of the user generated files be further allocated amongst a plurality of child buckets having different e.g. longer retention periods than the parent bucket. For instance any emails associated with a particular employee of an organization e.g. the Chief Executive Officer CEO or Chief Technical Officer CTO may be assigned to a first child bucket having a 7 year retention period. The tiered retention module may assign to the first child bucket any emails in that particular employee s inbox that were sent by that employee that were received by that employee etc. Another child bucket having a 5 year retention period may include any documents related to or referencing a particular brand or type of medicine. Child buckets are described in greater detail below with respect to .

The parent bucket in certain embodiments includes all data in the child bucket and logically the child bucket can therefore be a subset of the parent bucket. In one embodiment the parent bucket and the child bucket each maintain separate copies of their respective data items. In another embodiment only a single copy of the data item exists for the parent bucket and the child bucket and the copy is not pruned until after the longer of the parent and child retention periods expires. For instance when the shorter of the parent and child retention periods expires the tiered retention module may determine whether or not the data belongs to another bucket before pruning the data. And upon determining that the data belongs to a bucket having an unexpired retention period the tiered retention module decides not to prune that particular data item.

As mentioned above the storage devices include one or more buckets that are each associated with a particular classification and have different retention periods. And the buckets in the storage devices can each have separate copies of data belonging to them. For example if an email belongs in both the 3 year bucket and the 5 year bucket each bucket has a copy of the email so that the different buckets can operate and be managed substantially independently of other buckets. In one embodiment the copies of at least some of the data items are pointers to the actual data. For instance where deduplication technology is used the data items may comprise pointers to deduplicated data blocks. In other embodiments each bucket has actual copies of all of the data items rather than pointers. Particularly where the buckets retain their own copies of the respective data items the tiered retention module can treat the buckets independently which can simplify processing. For instance in such cases the system can simply prune data items from a bucket upon expiration of the retention period even if the same data item exists in another bucket. Thus the copy of the data in a bucket with a shorter retention period is removed from that bucket upon expiration of the retention period even if that data item it is also included in a bucket with a longer retention period.

After the data is migrated to the corresponding buckets in the storage devices the data may be content indexed to facilitate searching of the data. The content index may be a common content index for the buckets having the same retention period. For example a bucket could include multiple buckets within it that are based on different classifications such as CEO emails and financial documents and the system could have one content index for the entire bucket instead of having a content index for each bucket. Alternatively each bucket based on a classification could have a separate content index. In other embodiments data is not content indexed and a user can navigate through the data by browsing. For example the user can read through all CEO emails without using a particular tool.

As described above the entire process of classifying storing and pruning data based on content and or metadata may be automatic from the creation of the data item by the corresponding user application to pruning of the data item from the system . In particular the classification of data to store for different periods of time can be accomplished automatically. In this way the amount of data a corporation or an organization needs to maintain can be dramatically reduced and become more manageable. Moreover the automated nature of the process avoids the manual search process involved in some existing data retention solutions. This allows organizations to retain data in a manner that suits the needs of the organization while dedicating far fewer resources and expense to the data pruning process.

At data flow step 1 the storage manager accesses the tiered retention policy. For instance the tiered retention policies may be preconfigured policies that are stored in the storage manager or may be received by the storage manager e.g. via user input as explained with respect to .

At data flow step 2 the storage manager transmits the retention policies and rules to the client s . In other embodiments the policy is input at the client . Where there are multiple clients the policies can be the same across all clients or can instead be client specific and differ depending on the client.

As previously mentioned the tiered retention module may be a software module that resides on the client or on a separate computing device. If on the client the tiered retention module can be a standalone module or can be a part of the data agent .

At data flow step 3 the tiered retention module monitors data generated by the applications and based on the results of the monitoring automatically classifies the data according to the tiered retention policy. In some cases the tiered retention module monitors the data after the data has been stored in the information store . For instance the tiered retention module may access the data from the information store and process the data according to the retention policy. In other cases the tiered retention module monitors the data before it is actually stored in the information store . For instance the tiered retention module may perform a snooping function to intercept communications between the application s and the information store . In this manner the tiered retention module can process the intercepted data without actually reading from the information store . In yet other configurations the tiered retention module obtains the data directly from the applications .

The data in the information store may be content indexed as it enters the system. Alternatively the content indexing may be done at a later time.

At data flow step 4 the classified data is copied to the corresponding bucket in the storage system . For instance the data agent can initiate the backup of data through media agents which then conduct the data to the storage devices . Or the tiered retention module may interact with the media agents and or data agents to migrate the data to the buckets . While described with respect to a backup copy operation for the purposes of illustration the techniques described herein are compatible with other types of storage operations such as for example replication snapshots archiving and the like. A description of some storage operations compatible with embodiments described herein is provided above.

At block the system administrator or user creates a tiered retention policy to automatically classify data to be stored retained in a bucket and the policy is received by the storage manager. Alternatively the policies could be preconfigured and preloaded in the storage manager. For instance a default policy may reside at the storage manager and be used if a user defined storage policy is not received.

At block the tiered retention module according to some embodiments processes the data in the storage devices and determines whether the data should be placed in a particular bucket according to the tiered retention policy. As discussed above the processing of block can occur according to a scheduling policy such as at a pre determined time increments e.g. a pre determined number of hours days etc. . Or the processing can occur based on some other triggering event such as when a new tiered retention policy is activated or after a threshold amount of new unclassified data is migrated to the storage devices which has not yet been classified by the tiered retention module .

In other embodiments such as in the configuration of the tiered retention module resides on one or more clients and the tiered retention module monitors the data in the information store . The tiered retention module may monitor the data after it has been saved to the information store or before it is saved to the information store e.g. by performing a snooping function .

If the tiered retention module determines that certain data belongs in a tiered retention bucket s as shown in block the data is automatically assigned to the corresponding bucket s as shown in block . In some embodiments if the data does not belong in a particular bucket the data is assigned to a default bucket as shown in block . Once the data is assigned to a particular bucket or buckets at block an instance of the data is created for each assigned bucket as shown in block . In other embodiments where a data item belongs to more than one bucket only one physical copy of the data item is retained and a pointer or other logical reference to the data item is retained for at least some of the buckets including the data item.

If it is determined that the retention period for a specific bucket is met as shown in block the data instance in the bucket is pruned from the bucket at block . If data was assigned to the default bucket at block the data instance for the data item is pruned at block if the default retention period is met as shown in block . If all the data in the bucket is pruned the bucket itself may be deleted.

The routine can include fewer more or different blocks than those illustrated in without departing from the spirit and scope of the description. Moreover it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art and others that some or all of the functions described in this disclosure may be embodied in software executed by one or more processors of the disclosed components and mobile communication devices. The software may be persistently stored in any type of non volatile storage.

In the example illustrated in out of all company documents Corporation A decides to store all CEO emails for 7 years. A system administrator or a user defines a tiered retention policy so that all emails with the CEO as the mailbox owner are stored for a term of at least 7 years. Thus the policy dictates that all emails having metadata indicating that the CEO is the mailbox owner is assigned to a 7 year bucket having a retention period of 7 years. The tiered retention module monitors data in the storage devices according to the tiered retention policy e.g. according to a time based schedule and determines whether there are any data items to assign to the 7 year bucket defined by the policy. If certain emails meet the criteria for the 7 year bucket they are classified as CEO emails to retain for 7 years and assigned to the 7 year bucket .

According to the policy above all CEO emails are stored in the 7 year bucket . However even CEO emails may not all be of equal importance. Therefore a multi tiered retention scheme may be defined for CEO emails. For example the company may want to keep CEO emails discussing accounting matters for a longer period such as 15 years. Thus as one example the tiered retention policy defines a further classification criteria in addition to the mailbox owner CEO including a search term e.g. the term accounting with or without other related words . Where one or more search terms are used as a part of the classification criteria the search term criteria is met if the tiered retention module finds the data item content and or metadata. Thus the tiered retention module would search through the emails and the classification criteria would be met for emails where the mailbox owner is the CEO and where the search term accounting is included in the email content and or metadata. A corresponding 15 year bucket is created in the storage devices and the emails belonging to the 15 year bucket defined by this policy are migrated to the 15 year bucket .

Emails that are addressed to a particular individual may have unique importance. Thus the CEO s emails to the CTO could be stored in yet another 9 year bucket with a 9 year retention period. Accordingly for the 9 year bucket the classification criteria would dictate that e mails having the CEO as the mailbox owner and the CTO as the email recipient are placed in the 9 year bucket . As another example the policy could assign CEO emails relating to the stock market to yet another different bucket with an 11 year retention term. Finally data not belonging to any particular bucket is stored in a default bucket for example with a 1 year retention period.

Because all buckets may operate independently of one another even though certain emails would be included in multiple buckets in the above example each bucket would maintain a pointer to or a copy of the data. That is certain emails belonging to both the 7 year bucket and 15 year bucket would not by virtue of being included in the 15 year bucket be removed from the 7 year bucket at the time they are added to the 15 year bucket . The 7 year bucket and the 15 year bucket would each have its own copy of the data in some form i.e. pointer or actual copy so that the data can be pruned from the bucket when the retention period is up without regard to whether the data is included in other buckets or not.

As shown in the data stored in the various buckets may be content indexed to allow users to search the data. Data items sharing a same parent bucket could share a common content index. For instance any of the 15 year 9 year and 11 year buckets and which are child buckets of the 7 year bucket in the bucket hierarchy would share a common content index. Alternatively the data in the buckets can be browsed without being content indexed.
