Prostacyclin or PGI2 is a member of the family of lipid molecules known as eicosanoids. It is a potent vasodilator antiproliferative anti thrombotic agent that mediates its effects as an agonist of the IP receptor. The IP receptor is a G protein coupled receptor that upon activation by prostacyclin stimulates the formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate cAMP . Prostacyclin counteracts the vasoconstrictor and pro thrombotic activity of endothelin.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension PAH is a life threatening disease characterized by a progressive pulmonary vasculopathy leading to right ventricular hypertrophy. Exogenous administration of an agonist of the IP receptor has become an important strategy in the treatment of PAH. See e.g. Tuder et al. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care. Med. 1999 159 1925 1932 Humbert et al J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2004 43 13S 24S Rosenzweig Expert Opin. Emerging Drugs 2006 11 609 619 McLaughlin et al Circulation 2006 114 1417 1431 Rosenkranz Clin. Res. Cardiol. 2007 96 527 541 Driscoll et al Expert Opin. Pharmacother. 2008 9 65 81. .

The prostacyclin analogue epoprostenol flolan is at least as effective as transplantation in terms of survival. Despite this it is not used as frontline therapy due to significant tolerability convenience and cost issues. Instead patients with PAH are often treated first with either endothelin receptor antagonists e.g. bosentan and or PDE5 inhibitors e.g. sildenafil which are better tolerated but can have limited efficacy. Prostacyclin analogues are used mainly as add on treatment as severity of the disease progresses and tolerability and convenience become less of an issue.

Two key issues prevent current prostacyclin analogues being used as frontline therapy in PAH. Firstly they are very unstable with an extremely short half life meaning they must be constantly infused via an in dwelling intra venous i.v. catheter that is both inconvenient for the patient and also associated with a significant risk of infection and sepsis. Secondly they are associated with significant side effects including nausea jaw pain headache and other side effects associated with systemic hypotension.

One solution to these issues is iloprost which is available as a nebulised formulation that has reduced tolerability issues but the short half life results in a 6 9 times daily dosing regime. More recently researchers made efforts to generate stable orally available IP receptor agonists. These ligands would improve patient convenience and compliance but high levels of systemic drug is required to achieve pharmacodynamic effects in the lung thus possibly generating similar side effects to those observed with i.v. flolan.

The present invention describes stable highly selective IP receptor agonists that are suitable for oral and inhaled delivery. The present invention offers a significant improvement over existing prostacyclin analogues and enables their use in less severe patients. In addition long term activation of the IP receptor has been shown to reverse remodeling associated with PAH therefore earlier intervention with the present invention may have significant effects on disease progression and potentially may show reversal.

In addition pharmaceutical research has considerable interest in developing IP receptor agonists for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis. IP deficient mice have been shown to be more susceptible to bleomycin induced lung fibrosis than wild type animals Lovgren A K at al. 2006 291 L144 56 and the IP receptor agonist iloprost increases survival in bleomycin treated mice Zhu et al 2010 Respir Res. 11 1 34 .

Furthermore IP receptor signaling has been shown to exert beneficial effects in fibrotic conditions of various organs in animal models and in patients. Benefits of IP receptor agonist were shown for fibrosis of the heart lung skin pancreas and liver and in systemic sclerosis.

Fibrotic conditions can occur in most organs secondary to chronic inflammation indications throughout the body and are likely to share common causes. Therefore antifibrotic agents such as IP receptor agonists of the present invention are of potential benefit in all indications that are associated with fibrotic tissue remodeling.

There is considerable interest in developing agonists of the IP receptor for use in the treatment of other diseases such as atherothrombosis preeclampsia. It is highly desirable to develop a stable inhaled agonists of the IP receptor which may lead to improved management of PAH.

As used herein the term pharmaceutically acceptable salts refers to salts that retain the biological effectiveness and properties of the compounds of this invention and which typically are not biologically or otherwise undesirable. In many cases the compounds of the present invention are capable of forming acid and or base salts by virtue of the presence of amino and or carboxyl groups or groups similar thereto.

Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts can be formed with inorganic acids and organic acids e.g. acetate aspartate benzoate besylate bromide hydrobromide bicarbonate carbonate bisulfate sulfate camphorsulfonate chloride hydrochloride chlortheophyllonate citrate ethanedisulfonate fumarate gluceptate gluconate glucuronate hippurate hydroiodide iodide isethionate lactate lactobionate laurylsulfate malate maleate malonate mandelate mesylate methylsulphate naphthoate napsylate nicotinate nitrate octadecanoate oleate oxalate palmitate pamoate phosphate hydrogen phosphate dihydrogen phosphate polygalacturonate propionate stearate succinate sulfosalicylate tartrate tosylate trifluoroacetate and xinafoate salts.

Inorganic acids from which salts can be derived include for example hydrochloric acid hydrobromic acid sulfuric acid nitric acid phosphoric acid and the like.

Organic acids from which salts can be derived include for example acetic acid propionic acid glycolic acid oxalic acid maleic acid malonic acid succinic acid fumaric acid tartaric acid citric acid benzoic acid mandelic acid methanesulfonic acid ethanesulfonic acid toluenesulfonic acid 1 hydroxy 2 naphtoic acid and sulfosalicylic acid.

Inorganic bases from which salts can be derived include for example ammonium salts and metals from columns I to XII of the periodic table. In certain embodiments the salts are derived from sodium potassium ammonium calcium magnesium iron silver zinc and copper particularly suitable salts include ammonium potassium sodium calcium and magnesium salts.

Organic bases from which salts can be derived include for example primary secondary and tertiary amines substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines cyclic amines basic ion exchange resins and the like. Certain organic amines include isopropylamine benzathine cholinate diethanolamine diethylamine lysine meglumine piperazine and tromethamine.

The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be synthesized from a parent compound a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally such salts can be prepared by reacting free acid forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base such as Na Ca Mg or K hydroxide carbonate bicarbonate or the like or by reacting free base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate acid. Such reactions are typically carried out in water or in an organic solvent or in a mixture of the two. Generally use of non aqueous media like ether ethyl acetate ethanol isopropanol acetone or acetonitrile is desirable where practicable. Lists of additional suitable salts can be found e.g. in Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences 20th ed. Mack Publishing Company Easton Pa. 1985 and in Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts Properties Selection and Use by Stahl and Wermuth Wiley VCH Weinheim Germany 2002 .

Furthermore the compounds of the present invention including their salts can also be obtained in the form of their hydrates or include other solvents used for their crystallization.

Compounds of the invention i.e. compounds of formula I Ia II or IIa that contain groups capable of acting as donors and or acceptors for hydrogen bonds may be capable of forming co crystals with suitable co crystal formers. These co crystals may be prepared from compounds of formula I Ia II or IIa by known co crystal forming procedures. Such procedures include grinding heating co subliming co melting or contacting in solution compounds of formula I Ia II or IIa with the co crystal former under crystallization conditions and isolating co crystals thereby formed. Suitable co crystal formers include those described in WO 2004 078163. Hence the invention further provides co crystals comprising a compound of formula I Ia II or IIa.

As used herein the term an optical isomer or a stereoisomer refers to any of the various stereo isomeric configurations which may exist for a given compound of the present invention and includes geometric isomers. It is understood that a substituent may be attached at a chiral center of a carbon atom. Therefore the invention includes enantiomers diastereomers or racemates of the compound. Enantiomers are a pair of stereoisomers that are non superimposable mirror images of each other. A 1 1 mixture of a pair of enantiomers is a racemic mixture. The term is used to designate a racemic mixture where appropriate. Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that have at least two asymmetric atoms but which are not mirror images of each other. The absolute stereochemistry is specified according to the Cahn Ingold Prelog R S system. When a compound is a pure enantiomer the stereochemistry at each chiral carbon may be specified by either R or S. Resolved compounds whose absolute configuration is unknown can be designated or depending on the direction dextro or levorotatory which they rotate plane polarized light at the wavelength of the sodium D line. Certain of the compounds described herein contain one or more asymmetric centers or axes and may thus give rise to enantiomers diastereomers and other stereoisomeric forms that may be defined in terms of absolute stereochemistry as R or S . The present invention is meant to include all such possible isomers including racemic mixtures optically pure forms and intermediate mixtures. Optically active R and S isomers may be prepared using chiral synthons or chiral reagents or resolved using conventional techniques. If the compound contains a double bond the substituent may be E or Z configuration. If the compound contains a disubstituted cycloalkyl the cycloalkyl substituent may have a cis or trans configuration. All tautomeric forms are also intended to be included.

Any asymmetric atom e.g. carbon or the like of the compound s of the present invention can be present in racemic or enantiomerically enriched for example the R S or R S configuration. In certain embodiments each asymmetric atom has at least 50 enantiomeric excess at least 60 enantiomeric excess at least 70 enantiomeric excess at least 80 enantiomeric excess at least 90 enantiomeric excess at least 95 enantiomeric excess or at least 99 enantiomeric excess in the R or S configuration. Substituents at atoms with unsaturated bonds may if possible be present in cis Z or trans E form.

Accordingly as used herein a compound of the present invention can be in the form of one of the possible isomers rotamers atropisomers tautomers or mixtures thereof for example as substantially pure geometric cis or trans isomers diastereomers optical isomers antipodes racemates or mixtures thereof.

Any resulting mixtures of isomers can be separated on the basis of the physicochemical differences of the constituents into the pure or substantially pure geometric or optical isomers diastereomers racemates for example by chromatography and or fractional crystallization.

Any resulting racemates of final products or intermediates can be resolved into the optical antipodes by known methods e.g. by separation of the diastereomeric salts thereof obtained with an optically active acid or base and liberating the optically active acidic or basic compound. In particular a basic moiety may thus be employed to resolve the compounds of the present invention into their optical antipodes e.g. by fractional crystallization of a salt formed with an optically active acid e.g. tartaric acid dibenzoyl tartaric acid diacetyl tartaric acid di O O p toluoyl tartaric acid mandelic acid malic acid or camphor 10 sulfonic acid. Racemic products can also be resolved by chiral chromatography e.g. high pressure liquid chromatography HPLC using a chiral adsorbent.

Since the compounds of the invention are intended for use in pharmaceutical compositions it will readily be understood that they are each preferably provided in substantially pure form for example at least 60 pure more suitably at least 75 pure and preferably at least 85 especially at least 98 pure are on a weight for weight basis . Impure preparations of the compounds may be used for preparing the more pure forms used in the pharmaceutical compositions these less pure preparations of the compounds should contain at least 1 more suitably at least 5 and preferably from 10 to 59 of a compound of the invention.

Compounds of the present invention are either obtained in the free form as a salt thereof or as prodrug derivatives thereof.

When both a basic group and an acid group are present in the same molecule the compounds of the present invention may also form internal salts e.g. zwitterionic molecules.

The present invention also provides pro drugs of the compounds of the present invention that converts in vivo to the compounds of the present invention. A pro drug is an active or inactive compound that is modified chemically through in vivo physiological action such as hydrolysis metabolism and the like into a compound of this invention following administration of the prodrug to a subject. The suitability and techniques involved in making and using pro drugs are well known by those skilled in the art. Prodrugs can be conceptually divided into two non exclusive categories bioprecursor prodrugs and carrier prodrugs. See Ch. 31 32 Ed. Wermuth Academic Press San Diego Calif. 2001 . Generally bioprecursor prodrugs are compounds which are inactive or have low activity compared to the corresponding active drug compound that contain one or more protective groups and are converted to an active form by metabolism or solvolysis. Both the active drug form and any released metabolic products should have acceptably low toxicity.

Carrier prodrugs are drug compounds that contain a transport moiety e.g. that improve uptake and or localized delivery to a site s of action. Desirably for such a carrier prodrug the linkage between the drug moiety and the transport moiety is a covalent bond the prodrug is inactive or less active than the drug compound and any released transport moiety is acceptably non toxic. For prodrugs where the transport moiety is intended to enhance uptake typically the release of the transport moiety should be rapid. In other cases it is desirable to utilize a moiety that provides slow release e.g. certain polymers or other moieties such as cyclodextrins. Carrier prodrugs can for example be used to improve one or more of the following properties increased lipophilicity increased duration of pharmacological effects increased site specificity decreased toxicity and adverse reactions and or improvement in drug formulation e.g. stability water solubility suppression of an undesirable organoleptic or physiochemical property . For example lipophilicity can be increased by esterification of a hydroxyl groups with lipophilic carboxylic acids e.g. a carboxylic acid having at least one lipophilic moiety or b carboxylic acid groups with lipophilic alcohols e.g. an alcohol having at least one lipophilic moiety for example aliphatic alcohols .

Exemplary prodrugs are e.g. esters of free carboxylic acids and S acyl derivatives of thiols and O acyl derivatives of alcohols or phenols wherein acyl has a meaning as defined herein. Suitable prodrugs are often pharmaceutically acceptable ester derivatives convertible by solvolysis under physiological conditions to the parent carboxylic acid e.g. lower alkyl esters cycloalkyl esters lower alkenyl esters benzyl esters mono or di substituted lower alkyl esters such as the amino mono or di lower alkylamino carboxy lower alkoxycarbonyl lower alkyl esters the lower alkanoyloxy lower alkoxycarbonyl or di lower alkylaminocarbonyl lower alkyl esters such as the pivaloyloxymethyl ester and the like conventionally used in the art. In addition amines have been masked as arylcarbonyloxymethyl substituted derivatives which are cleaved by esterases in vivo releasing the free drug and formaldehyde Bundgaard 2503 1989 . Moreover drugs containing an acidic NH group such as imidazole imide indole and the like have been masked with N acyloxymethyl groups Bundgaard Elsevier 1985 . Hydroxy groups have been masked as esters and ethers. EP 039 051 Sloan and Little discloses Mannich base hydroxamic acid prodrugs their preparation and use.

Any formula given herein is also intended to represent unlabeled forms as well as isotopically labeled forms of the compounds. Isotopically labeled compounds have structures depicted by the formulas given herein except that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having a selected atomic mass or mass number. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen carbon nitrogen oxygen phosphorous fluorine and chlorine such as H H C C C N F P P S Cl I respectively. The invention includes various isotopically labeled compounds as defined herein for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as H C and C are present. Such isotopically labeled compounds are useful in metabolic studies with C reaction kinetic studies with for example H or H detection or imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography PET or single photon emission computed tomography SPECT including drug or substrate tissue distribution assays or in radioactive treatment of patients. In particular an F or labeled compound may be particularly desirable for PET or SPECT studies. Isotopically labeled compounds of this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the schemes or in the examples and preparations described below by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non isotopically labeled reagent.

Further substitution with heavier isotopes particularly deuterium i.e. H or D may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability for example increased in vivo half life or reduced dosage requirements or an improvement in therapeutic index. It is understood that deuterium in this context is regarded as a substituent of a compound of the formula I Ia II or IIa. The concentration of such a heavier isotope specifically deuterium may be defined by the isotopic enrichment factor. The term isotopic enrichment factor as used herein means the ratio between the isotopic abundance and the natural abundance of a specified isotope. If a substituent in a compound of this invention is denoted deuterium such compound has an isotopic enrichment factor for each designated deuterium atom of at least 3500 52.5 deuterium incorporation at each designated deuterium atom at least 4000 60 deuterium incorporation at least 4500 67.5 deuterium incorporation at least 5000 75 deuterium incorporation at least 5500 82.5 deuterium incorporation at least 6000 90 deuterium incorporation at least 6333.3 95 deuterium incorporation at least 6466.7 97 deuterium incorporation at least 6600 99 deuterium incorporation or at least 6633.3 99.5 deuterium incorporation .

Isotopically labeled compounds of formula I Ia II or IIa can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the accompanying Examples and Preparations using an appropriate isotopically labeled reagents in place of the non labeled reagent previously employed.

Pharmaceutically acceptable solvates in accordance with the invention include those wherein the solvent of crystallization may be isotopically substituted e.g. DO d acetone d DMSO.

The skilled person will appreciate that the general synthetic routes detailed above show common reactions to transform the starting materials as required.

Compounds of formula I Ia II or IIa in free form may be converted into salt form and vice versa in a conventional manner understood by those skilled in the art. The compounds in free or salt form can be obtained in the form of hydrates or solvates containing a solvent used for crystallisation. Compounds of formula I Ia II or IIa can be recovered from reaction mixtures and purified in a conventional manner. Isomers such as stereoisomers may be obtained in a conventional manner e.g. by fractional crystallisation or asymmetric synthesis from correspondingly asymmetrically substituted e.g. optically active starting materials.

The compounds of Formula I Ia II or IIa or pharaceutical salts thereof can be prepared e.g. using the reactions and techniques described below and in the Examples. The reactions may be performed in a solvent appropriate to the reagents and materials employed and suitable for the transformations being effected. It will be understood by those skilled in the art of organic synthesis that the functionality present on the molecule should be consistent with the transformations proposed. This will sometimes require a judgment to modify the order of the synthetic steps or to select one particular process scheme over another in order to obtain a desired compound of the invention.

The various substituents on the synthetic intermediates and final products shown in the following reaction schemes can be present in their fully elaborated forms with suitable protecting groups where required as understood by one skilled in the art or in precursor forms which can later be elaborated into their final forms by methods familiar to one skilled in the art. The substituents can also be added at various stages throughout the synthetic sequence or after completion of the synthetic sequence. In many cases commonly used functional group manipulations can be used to transform one intermediate into another intermediate or one compound of formula I Ia II or IIa into another compound of formula I Ia II or IIa. Examples of such manipulations are conversion of an ester or a ketone to an alcohol conversion of an ester to a ketone interconversions of esters acids and amides alkylation acylation and sulfonylation of alcohols and amines and many others. Substituents can also be added using common reactions such as alkylation acylation halogenation or oxidation. Such manipulations are well known in the art and many reference works summarize procedures and methods for such manipulations. Some reference works which gives examples and references to the primary literature of organic synthesis for many functional group manipulations as well as other transformations commonly used in the art of organic synthesis are 5Edition Wiley and Chichester Eds. 2001 Larock Ed. VCH 1989 Katritzky et al. series editors Pergamon 1995 and Trost and Fleming series editors Pergamon 1991 . It will also be recognized that another major consideration in the planning of any synthetic route in this field is the judicious choice of the protecting group used for protection of the reactive functional groups present in the compounds described in this invention. Multiple protecting groups within the same molecule can be chosen such that each of these protecting groups can either be removed without removal of other protecting groups in the same molecule or several protecting groups can be removed using the same reaction step depending upon the outcome desired.

Antiplatelet agents antiplatelets are prescribed for a variety of conditions. For example in coronary artery disease they are used to help prevent myocardial infarction or stroke in patients who are at risk of developing obstructive blood clots e.g. coronary thrombosis .

In a myocardial infarction the heart muscle does not receive enough oxygen rich blood as a result of a blockage in the coronary blood vessels. If taken while an attack is in progress or immediately afterward preferably within 30 min antiplatelets can reduce the damage to the heart.

A transient ischemic attack TIA or mini stroke is a brief interruption of oxygen flow to the brain due to decreased blood flow through arteries usually due to an obstructing blood clot. Antiplatelet drugs have been found to be effective in preventing TIAs. Angina is a temporary and often recurring chest pain pressure or discomfort caused by inadequate oxygen rich blood flow ischemia to some parts of the heart. In patients with angina antiplatelet therapy can reduce the effects of angina and the risk of myocardial infarction.

Stroke is an event in which the brain does not receive enough oxygen rich blood usually due to blockage of a cerebral blood vessel by a blood clot. In high risk patients taking antiplatelets regularly has been found to prevent the formation of blood clots that cause first or second strokes. Angioplasty is a catheter based technique used to open arteries obstructed by a blood clot. Whether or not stenting is performed immediately after this procedure to keep the artery open antiplatelets can reduce the risk of forming additional blood clots following the procedure s .

Coronary bypass surgery is a surgical procedure in which an artery or vein is taken from elsewhere in the body and grafted to a blocked coronary artery rerouting blood around the blockage and through the newly attached vessel. After the procedure antiplatelets can reduce the risk of secondary blood clots.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common type of sustained irregular heart rhythm arrhythmia . Atrial fibrillation affects about two million Americans every year. In atrial fibrillation the atria the heart s upper chambers rapidly fire electrical signals that cause them to quiver rather than contract normally. The result is an abnormally fast and highly irregular heartbeat. When given after an episode of atrial fibrillation antiplatelets can reduce the risk of blood clots forming in the heart and traveling to the brain embolism .

IP receptor agonists can also be used alone or in combination with thrombolytic therapy for example tissue type plasminogen activator t PA to provide cardioprotection following MI or postischemic myocardial dysfunction or protection from ischemic injury during percutaneous coronary intervention and the like including complications resulting therefrom. IP receptor agonists can also be used in antiplatelet therapies in combination with for example alpha tocopherol vitamin E echistatin a disintegrin or in states of hypercoagulability heparin. See e.g. Chan. J. Nutr. 1998 128 1593 1596 Mardla et al Platelets 2004 15 319 324 Bernabei et al Ann. Thorac. Surg. 1995 59 149 153 Gainza et al J. Nephrol. 2006 19 648 655.

Compounds of and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts hereinafter referred to alternatively as agents of the invention are useful as pharmaceuticals. In particular the compounds are suitable IP receptor agonist and may be tested in the following assays.

Activity of compounds at the IP receptor IP receptor is assessed by measuring cAMP accumulation in CHO cells stably expressing the IP receptor CHO IP using the PerkinElmer AlphaScreen assay. This technology measures the endogenous production of cAMP in a non radioactive luminescence proximity homogenous assay. A biological reaction occurs between streptavidin coated donor beads biotinylated cAMP and anti cAMP acceptor beads bringing the donor and acceptor beads close enough together so that upon excitation a fluorescence signal is produced. On production of endogenous cAMP competition between the biotinylated cAMP and cellular derived cAMP causes a reduction in the fluorescent signal. The reduction in signal is proportional to the amount of cAMP being produced thus it is possible to quantify the amount of cAMP being produced on stimulation with agonist.

Test and reference compounds are prepared at 100 final in 100 DMSO and diluted 1 3 using a Biomek Fx Beckman Coulter . This is followed by an intermediate dilution to give 5 final in assay buffer HBSS containing 5 mM HEPES 0.1 w v BSA . 5 L of 5 final test compounds reference compounds and buffer DMSO control are then transferred to a 384 well white OptiPlate containing 20 L CHO IP cell suspension 15 000 cells well prepared from frozen and plate is incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. A cAMP standard curve is constructed for each experiment concentration range of 10000 nM to 0.001 nM in assay buffer and 25 L of each concentration added to the last two columns of the assay plate. The incubation is terminated by the addition of lysis buffer dHO 0.3 v v Tween 20 containing 20 units mLstreptavidin coated donor beads and biotinylated cAMP pre incubated for 30 minutes and 20 units mLanti cAMP acceptor beads which are added to the lysis buffer just before addition to the assay plate. The assay plate is then incubated at room temperature in the dark for 60 minutes with gentle shaking and read on the Envision plate reader Perkin Elmer .

The raw data of the reference compounds test compounds and controls are converted into cAMP concentrations using the cAMP standard curve in GraphPadPrism GraphPad Software Inc . ECas well as maximal values of the agonist curves are determined using a 4 parameter logistic equation. The maximum response values of all test compounds are determined using the top of the treprostinil concentration response curve.
