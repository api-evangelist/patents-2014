title: Textual code provided in temporal and change operators of a technical computing environment
abstract: A device receives a state chart that includes a state block, and receives a time-based or an event-based operator (time-based/event-based operator) associated with the state block. The time-based/event-based operator includes textual code understood by a textual engine of technical computing environment (TCE), and a portion of the time-based/event-based operator is not understood by a graphical engine of the TCE. The device transforms the portion of the time-based/event-based operator into a form that is understood by the graphical engine, and initiates execution of the state chart. The device processes, during the execution of the state chart, the transformed portion of the time-based/event-based operator and the state block with the graphical engine to generate graphical results. The device processes, during the execution of the state chart, the textual code of the time-based/event-based operator with the textual engine to generate textual results, and combines the graphical results with the textual results.

This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 based on U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 827 863 filed May 28 2013 the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

The following detailed description of example implementations refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements.

A technical computing environment TCE may include a computing environment that allows users to perform tasks related to disciplines such as but not limited to mathematics science engineering medicine business etc. more efficiently than if the tasks were performed in another type of computing environment such as an environment that required the user to develop code in a conventional programming language such as C C Fortran Pascal etc. The TCE may use an array a vector and or a matrix as basic elements.

The TCE may provide a graphical environment for modeling and simulating combinatorial and sequential decision logic based on state machines and flow charts. The decision logic may enable users to combine graphical and tabular representations including state transition diagrams flow charts state transition tables and truth tables to model how a system reacts to events time based conditions and external input signals. The graphical environment may generate models such as a textual model a graphical model with one or more model elements e.g. blocks one or more input signals and one or more output signals a combination of a textual model and a graphical model etc. The TCE may exist for creating computer generated models such as graphical behavioral models that represent dynamic systems. A model may include a plurality of graphical objects such as blocks or icons. A model may be executed to simulate the operation or behavior of the system being modeled. Executing the model may be referred to as simulating the model.

The TCE may provide a textual environment that includes a high level language and an interactive environment for numerical computation visualization and programming. The textual environment may enable users to analyze data develop algorithms create models and applications manipulate matrices plot functions and data implement algorithms create user interfaces and interface with programs written in other languages including C C Java and Fortran. Unlike the graphical environment which models how a system reacts to events and time based conditions the textual environment includes an imperative or declarative language with no concept of logical model physical and or simulation time and events.

Conventional action languages for the graphical environment e.g. Stateflow consisted of statically typed scalar based languages such as for example C C etc. are diagrams of an overview of an example implementation described herein. In the example a textual environment of the TCE may be provided in a graphical environment of the TCE. Time based and event based simulation may be introduced into the language of the textual environment while maintaining the syntax and style of the language. The textual environment may have no concept of time or events without a user explicitly maintaining timers in the textual environment language. The graphical environment may provide several operators that refer to an elapsed simulation time or a change of events. The operators may include temporal or time based operators e.g. after before every etc. change or event based operators e.g. hasChanged hasChangedFrom hasChangedTo etc. etc. For example an operator after 5 sec may instruct the TCE to perform a specified act after five seconds e.g. in simulation have elapsed since another act occurred e.g. a state was first entered .

As shown below in the textual environment may be enhanced so that textual code understood by the textual environment may be utilized with operators such as temporal operators change operators etc. With reference to a user may utilize a TCE of a computing device to create a state chart. The state chart may include state block A and state block B. State block A may include a representation of a calculation to be performed and state block B may include a representation of a further calculation to be performed. As further shown in state block A may include textual code e.g. en u 1 t understood by a textual environment of the TCE and state block B may include textual code e.g. en v u 5 portions of which may be understood by the textual environment of the TCE.

As further shown in a temporal operator e.g. after eig A 1 10 1 10 sec may be provided at a transition from state block A to state block B. The temporal operator may include textual code e.g. eig A 1 10 1 10 understood by the textual environment of the TCE. The temporal operator may cause the state chart to transition from state block A to state block B when a certain amount e.g. equal to an eigenvalue of A 1 10 1 10 of seconds sec have elapsed. When the state chart is executed by the TCE state block A may be entered and may execute the textual code e.g. en u 1 t to generate results. State block B may be transitioned to when the conditions of the temporal operator are satisfied e.g. after eig A 1 10 1 10 seconds have elapsed . State block B may execute the textual code e.g. en v u 5 and may output results of the execution.

As shown in when executing the state chart the TCE may execute the temporal operator e.g. after eig A 1 10 1 10 sec by providing the temporal operator to a graphical engine of the TCE. The graphical engine may divide the temporal operator into a textual portion and a graphical portion. The textual portion may include syntax that is understood by a textual engine of the textual environment. For example the textual portion may include the syntax eig A 1 10 1 10 of the temporal operator. The graphical portion may include syntax that is understood by a graphical engine of the graphical environment. For example the graphical portion may include the syntax after and sec of the temporal operator.

As further shown in the graphical engine may provide the textual portion to the textual engine and the textual engine may process the textual portion to generate textual results. For example the textual engine may calculate an eigenvalue of A 1 10 1 10 as being equal to 4.85. The eigenvalue of A 1 10 1 10 may be referred to as textual results. The textual engine may provide the graphical portion to the graphical engine and the graphical engine may process the graphical portion to generate graphical results. For example the graphical engine may determine whether the condition after 4.85 seconds is satisfied. The determination of whether the condition is satisfied may be referred to as graphical results. The graphical engine may combine the textual results with the graphical results to generate textual graphical results. For example the textual graphical results may include whether the condition after 4.85 seconds is satisfied. The textual graphical results may be provided to the state chart. If the condition after 4.85 seconds is satisfied state block A may transition to state block B. If the condition after 4.85 seconds is not satisfied state block A may not transition to state block B.

Such an arrangement may enable a user of a TCE to utilize the language of the textual environment with time based and event based operators provided by the graphical environment. This may provide the user with tools to create a variety of state charts and or models based on the language of the textual environment.

Client device may include a device capable of receiving generating storing processing executing and or providing information in a manner described herein. For example client device may include a computing device such as a desktop computer a laptop computer a tablet computer a handheld computer a server a mobile phone e.g. a smart phone a radiotelephone etc. or a similar device. In some implementations client device may receive information from and or transmit information to server device .

TCE may be provided within a computer readable medium of client device . Alternatively or additionally TCE may be provided in another device e.g. server device that is accessible by client device . TCE may include hardware or a combination of hardware and software that provides a computing environment that allows users to perform tasks related to disciplines such as but not limited to mathematics science engineering medicine business etc. more efficiently than if the tasks were performed in another type of computing environment such as an environment that required the user to develop code in a conventional programming language such as C C Fortran Pascal etc. In some implementations TCE may include a dynamically typed programming language e.g. the M language a MATLAB language a MATLAB compatible language a MATLAB like language etc. that can be used to express problems and or solutions in mathematical notations. A model may be declarative in that the model may not allow the user to explicitly specify when a state of a machine that the model is executing on changes. In a declarative model the user may not explicitly specify an order in which state changes in the model. In an imperative model the user may explicitly specify when a particular state may change e.g. relative to other state changes .

For example TCE may use an array as a basic element where the array may not require dimensioning. These arrays may be used to support array based programming where an operation may apply to an entire set of values included in the arrays. Array based programming may allow array based operations to be treated as high level programming that may allow for example operations to be performed on entire aggregations of data without having to resort to explicit loops of individual non array operations. In addition TCE may be adapted to perform matrix and or vector formulations that can be used for data analysis data visualization application development simulation modeling algorithm development etc. These matrix and or vector formulations may be used in many areas such as statistics image processing signal processing control design life sciences modeling discrete event analysis and or design state based analysis and or design etc.

TCE may further provide mathematical functions and or graphical tools e.g. for creating plots surfaces images volumetric representations etc. . In some implementations TCE may provide these functions and or tools using toolboxes e.g. toolboxes for signal processing image processing data plotting parallel processing etc. . In some implementations TCE may provide these functions as block sets or in another way such as via a library etc.

TCE may be implemented as a text based environment e.g. MATLAB software Octave Python JavaScript Comsol Script MATRIXx from National Instruments Mathematica from Wolfram Research Inc. Mathcad from Mathsoft Engineering Education Inc. Maple from Maplesoft Extend from Imagine That Inc. Scilab from The French Institution for Research in Computer Science and Control INRIA Virtuoso from Cadence Modelica or Dymola from Dassault Systemes etc. and a graphically based environment e.g. Simulink software Stateflow software SimEvents software Simscape software etc. by The MathWorks Inc. VisSim by Visual Solutions LabView by National Instruments Dymola by Dassault Systemes SoftWIRE by Measurement Computing WiT by DALSA Coreco VEE Pro or SystemVue by Agilent Vision Program Manager from PPT Vision Khoros from Khoral Research Gedae by Gedae Inc. Scicos from INRIA Virtuoso from Cadence Rational Rose from IBM Rhapsody or Tau from Telelogic Ptolemy from the University of California at Berkeley aspects of a Unified Modeling Language UML or SysML environment etc. . In some implementations TCE may include a hybrid environment that includes one or more of the above referenced text based environments and one or more of the above referenced graphically based environments.

TCE may include a programming language e.g. the MATLAB language that may be used to express problems and or solutions in mathematical notations. The programming language may be dynamically typed and or array based. In a dynamically typed array based computing language data may be contained in arrays and data types of the data may be determined e.g. assigned at program execution time.

For example suppose a program written in a dynamically typed array based computing language includes the following statements 

Now suppose the program is executed for example in a TCE such as TCE . During run time when the statement A hello is executed the data type of variable A may be a string data type. Later when the statement A int32 1 2 is executed the data type of variable A may be a 1 by 2 array containing elements whose data type are 32 bit integers. Later when the statement A 1.1 2.2 3.3 is executed since the language is dynamically typed the data type of variable A may be changed from the above 1 by 2 array to a 1 by 3 array containing elements whose data types are floating point. As can be seen by this example data in a program written in a dynamically typed array based computing language may be contained in an array. Moreover the data type of the data may be determined during execution of the program. Thus in a dynamically type array based computing language data may be represented by arrays and data types of data may be determined at run time.

TCE may provide mathematical routines and a high level programming language suitable for non professional programmers and may provide graphical tools that may be used for creating plots surfaces images volumetric representations or other representations. TCE may provide these routines and or tools using toolboxes e.g. toolboxes for signal processing image processing data plotting parallel processing etc. . TCE may also provide these routines in other ways such as for example via a library local or remote database e.g. a database operating in a computing cloud remote procedure calls RPCs and or an application programming interface API . TCE may be configured to improve runtime performance when performing computing operations. For example TCE may include a just in time JIT compiler.

In some implementations TCE may provide a graphical environment for modeling and simulating combinatorial and sequential decision logic based on state machines and flow charts. The decision logic may enable users to combine graphical and tabular representations including state transition diagrams flow charts state transition tables and truth tables to model how a system reacts to events time based conditions and external input signals. The graphical environment may generate models such as a textual model a graphical model with one or more model elements e.g. blocks one or more input signals and one or more output signals a combination of a textual model and a graphical model etc.

In some implementations TCE may provide a textual environment that includes a high level language and an interactive environment for numerical computation visualization and programming. The textual environment may enable users to analyze data develop algorithms create models and applications manipulate matrices plot functions and data implement algorithms create user interfaces and interface with programs written in other languages including C C Java and Fortran. Unlike the graphical environment which models how a system reacts to events and time based conditions the textual environment may include an assignment based imperative language with no concept of logical model physical and or simulation time and events.

In some implementations and as further shown in TCE may include a parser a transformer a graphical engine and a textual engine . Parser may include a component that parses TCE code e.g. a model or a chart into a graphical portion and a textual portion. The graphical portion may include information associated with a graphical hierarchy graphical symbols etc. of the TCE code.

In some implementations parser may parse the textual portion into two or more portions e.g. a time based portion and an output portion and may parse the graphical portion into two or more portions e.g. a functional portion and a non functional portion . In some implementations parser may parse TCE code into other types of portions.

For example one or more graphical symbols may not be understood by graphical engine and may be provided to transformer . Transformer may transform the received graphical portion into a form that is understood by graphical engine .

Graphical engine may receive the transformed graphical portion and the graphical portion that did not need to be transformed and may process the received information.

Thus implementations described herein are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.

The number of components shown in is provided as an example. In practice device may include additional components fewer components different components or differently arranged components than those shown in . Additionally or alternatively one or more components of device may perform one or more functions described as being performed by another one or more components of device .

As shown in process may include receiving a chart with a textual portion and a graphical portion block . For example TCE may enable a user of client device to create a model or to instruct client device to receive the model from another source e.g. server device a CD ROM a flash memory etc. . In some implementations the model may include a chart with a graphical hierarchy of one or more chart elements e.g. areas or regions associated with one or more states referred to herein as state blocks one or more input signals and one or more output signals. For example assume that a chart has state blocks A B and C and that state block A includes state block B and a transition to state block C. An arrangement that includes a state block containing one or more state blocks and or transitions to one or more state blocks may be referred to as a graphical hierarchy. Each of the chart elements may correspond to a status of a physical device a subsystem a model etc. of a system being modeled e.g. chart elements may behavioral so that a state may correspond to a status of a device a subsystem etc. .

In some implementations the chart may include graphical symbols transitions and or state transitions associated with the state blocks of the chart. The graphical symbols may include for example textual information that provides event based conditions time based conditions invariants etc. to the state blocks transitions junctions etc. In some implementations one or more of the state blocks transitions and or state transitions may include textual code that may be understood and processed by textual engine of TCE . The textual code may include for example one or more functions matrices data etc. that may be understood and processed by textual engine .

In some implementations TCE may cause client device to display a user interface so that the user may create and or view the model and the chart. For example the user may utilize the user interface to create the state blocks for the chart and to connect the state blocks together. The user may associate the graphical symbols with the state blocks and or other elements of the chart e.g. transitions state transitions junctions etc. and may add the textual code in the one or more state blocks. The user may utilize the user interface to provide the chart within the model.

As further shown in process may include parsing the chart into a textual portion and a graphical portion block . For example parser of TCE may receive information associated with the chart and may identify based on the information a portion of the chart that may be understood and processed by textual engine e.g. a textual portion and a portion of the chart that may be understood and processed by graphical engine e.g. a graphical portion . In some implementations parser may have access to a data structure e.g. a database that stores syntax associated with the language of the textual environment of TCE e.g. and understood by textual engine . Parser may compare the chart information with the syntax stored in the data structure and may determine that particular portions of the chart information match the syntax. Parser may designate the matching portions of the chart information as the textual portion. For example parser may designate functions arrays matrices algorithms etc. in the chart as the textual portion.

In some implementations parser may have access to a data structure e.g. a database that stores information associated with the graphical environment of TCE e.g. and understood by graphical engine . Parser may compare the chart information with information stored in the data structure and may determine that particular portions of the chart information match the information in the data structure. Parser may designate the matching portions of the chart information as the graphical portion. For example parser may designate time based conditions event based conditions other conditions hierarchy information etc. as the graphical portion.

As further shown in for the textual portion block TEXTUAL PORTION process may include processing the textual portion with the textual engine to generate textual results block . For example parser may provide the textual portion of the chart to textual engine and textual engine may process the textual portion of the chart to generate textual results. In some implementations textual engine may execute the textual portion of the chart to generate the textual results. For example assume that the textual portion of the chart includes a function for performing matrix calculations on data. In such an example textual engine may execute the function so that the matrix calculations are performed on the data. The matrix resulting from the calculations may be referred to as textual results. In another example assume that the textual portion of the chart includes an algorithm for performing data analysis. In this example textual engine may execute the algorithm so that the data analysis is performed. The results of the data analysis may be referred to as textual results.

As further shown in for the graphical portion block GRAPHICAL PORTION process may include transforming if necessary the graphical portion into a form understood by the graphical engine block . For example parser may determine whether any of the graphical portion of the chart will not be understood by graphical engine . In some implementations parser may identify text in the graphical portion that may not be understood by graphical engine . For example assume that the graphical portion includes the text before abs a eig b 1 10 1 10 sec and that graphical engine does not understand the text since graphical engine needs to calculate a time to execute the text. In this example parser may provide the text to transformer and transformer may transform the text into a form understood by graphical engine . For example transformer may transform the text to utilize counters maintained by the graphical environment e.g. Simulink so that a time e.g. one second two seconds etc. may be calculated by graphical engine . In some implementations transformer may provide the transformed text to graphical engine for processing. In some implementations the text provided in the graphical portion may include textual operations e.g. after abs a eig b 1 10 1 10 sec that are understood by the textual environment such as for example TCE operations.

In some implementations parser may provide the remaining graphical portion e.g. which may be understood by graphical engine directly to graphical engine . In some implementations parser may determine that all of the graphical portion may be understood by graphical engine . In such a situation parser may provide the entire graphical portion to graphical engine and transformer may not be utilized.

As further shown in for the graphical portion block GRAPHICAL PORTION process may include processing the graphical portion with the graphical engine to generate graphical results block . For example parser may provide to graphical engine the graphical portion of the chart that is understood by graphical engine . Transformer may provide to graphical engine any of the graphical portion that has been transformed into a form that is understood by graphical engine . Graphical engine may process the graphical portion of the chart to generate graphical results. In some implementations graphical engine may execute the graphical portion of the chart to generate the graphical results. For example assume that the graphical portion of the chart includes instructions to combine graphical and tabular representations. In such an example graphical engine may execute the instructions so that the graphical and tabular representations are combined. The resulting combination may be referred to as graphical results. In another example assume that the graphical portion of the chart includes an event based condition e.g. transition to state block A when a function is calculated . In this example graphical engine may execute the event based condition so that state block A is transitioned to. The results of the execution of the event based condition may be referred to as graphical results. In some implementations graphical engine may execute textual information.

As further shown in process may include combining the textual results with the graphical results to generate chart results block . For example TCE may combine the textual results generated by textual engine with the graphical results generated by graphical engine to generate chart results. In some implementations the chart results may include results associated with execution of the chart. For example assume that the textual results include a calculation of a function bar and that the graphical results include utilizing the calculation when a state block B is transitioned to. In such an example the chart results may include transitioning to state block B and utilizing the calculation of the function bar. In another example assume that the textual results include performing a matrix calculation and that the graphical results include computing the time period based on the array based computations. In such an example the chart results may include determining when the time period has expired and utilizing the matrix calculation after the time period has expired and or utilizing the matrix calculation to determine the time period. In some implementations the chart may model reactive systems via state machines and flow charts within a model. In some implementations the chart may use a variant of a finite state machine notation which may enable representation of hierarchy parallelism event broadcast and or history within the chart. In some implementations the chart may provide state transition tables and or truth tables. In some implementations the chart may represent discrete modes of a system by a state may control how a system responds to faults and failures within the system and may schedule when specific tasks occur e.g. either within the chart or within an overall model .

As further shown in process may include utilizing the chart results to execute the model and generate model results block . For example TCE may utilize the chart results in the model e.g. during execution of the model to generate model results. In some implementations the model results may include results associated with execution of the model based on the chart results. For example assume that the chart results include transitioning to state block B and utilizing a calculation of a function bar. After state block B is transitioned to and the function bar is calculated TCE may utilize the function calculation in the model to generate the model results. In another example assume that the chart results include determining when a time period has expired and utilizing the computations to determine the time period. After the matrix calculation is performed TCE may utilize the matrix calculation in the model to generate the model results and or to determine the time period.

Although shows example blocks of process in some implementations process may include additional blocks fewer blocks different blocks or differently arranged blocks than those depicted in . Additionally or alternatively two or more of the blocks of process may be performed in parallel.

The sine wave block may include a representation of a sine wave that is to be displayed by the scope block. In example assume that the sine wave block provides a chart in signal e.g. a sine wave signal to the chart block. The chart block may include a representation of a chart that processes the sine wave signal so that it may be understood by the scope block. The chart block may include a graphical portion and a textual portion. The chart block may receive the chart in signal and may process the chart in signal to produce a chart out signal e.g. a voltage time signal to be displayed by the scope block . The chart block may provide the chart out signal to the scope block. The scope block may include a representation of an oscilloscope that displays constantly varying signal voltages as a function of time. The scope block may receive the chart out signal and may display the signal e.g. a voltage time signal . In some implementations the chart block may include a chart that may be executed based on different execution semantics provided by a user and or inferred from the model. The execution semantics may include dynamic notions associated with continuous time for example computing the time derivatives of a dynamic system based on matrix calculations etc. In some implementations the chart may be provided in an environment that includes multiple domains.

As further shown in TCE may instruct client device to display an option to execute the model. For example user interface may display a window or some other display mechanism that requests whether the user wants to execute the model. If the user elects to execute the model e.g. via selection of a Yes button with a mouse or other selection mechanism TCE may execute the model. In some implementations the user may select a Play button with the mouse and TCE may execute the model. In order to execute the model assume that TCE needs to execute the chart block as shown in a user interface of . In some implementations the model may include computational semantics associated with graphical and textual elements and may include computational semantics associated with various blocks in the model. In some implementations TCE may debug the model before or during execution of the model or generation of code.

As shown in user interface the chart may include a graphical hierarchy of state blocks A B C and D. The graphical hierarchy may include the arrangement of the state blocks in the chart. For example state block A may be transitioned to first state block B may be transitioned to second state block C may be transitioned to third and state block D may be transitioned to last. The state blocks may include state information provided by graphical symbols. For example state block A may include the graphical symbols en a data 3 and du u buffer chart in u buffer 1 end 1 e.g. which may be parsed by graphical engine into a portion du that may be understood by graphical engine and another portion u buffer chart in u buffer 1 end 1 that may be understood by textual engine state block B may include the graphical symbols en chart out a data state block C may include the graphical symbols en foo and state block D may include the graphical symbols en chart out data. Some or all of the graphical hierarchy state blocks A B C and D and the graphical symbols may be understood by graphical engine . State block A may also include textual code e.g. a function foo that may be understood by textual engine . In some implementations the textual code may include text for a function e.g. foo bar etc. text for a matrix e.g. C 1 2 3 array based text dynamically typed text dynamic assignments script or function name spaces etc. e.g. text that ignores certain output arguments a function with logic that involves a caller s number of output arguments fixed point quantities that use integer containers to specify approximate floating point values . In some implementations graphical engine may execute graphical code and textual code e.g. C code but may not execute dynamically typed and or array based code. In some implementations textual engine may execute the dynamically typed array based code.

As further shown in when the chart wakes up the default transitions of the chart may be executed. For example an action in a default transition e.g. data 4 u buffer zeros 128 1 may be executed and state block A may be marked as active. Graphical symbols of state block A e.g. an entry action en a data 3 may be executed and default transitions inside state block A may be executed to establish an active child of state block A e.g. mark state block B as active . Graphical symbols of state block B e.g. an entry action en chart out a data may be executed and the chart execution may be complete e.g. the chart may go to sleep since no child states remain. When the chart sleeps state blocks A and B may be active. A next time the chart wakes up graphical symbols of state block A e.g. the during action du u buffer chart in u buffer 1 end 1 may be executed since there are no direct outer transitions of state block A. Outer transitions of state block B may be checked and since there is no condition the transition to state block C may be assumed to be true. Therefore the chart may transition from state block B to state block C. State block C may become active and state block A may remain active. The chart may keep waking up according to solver settings and or system dynamics and may wake up many times or a few times. Every time the chart wakes up the outer transitions of all active state blocks may be checked for example in a top down manner. If an outer transition of a particular state block is not true a during action of the particular state block may be executed. Otherwise a transition may occur to a next state block. This may result in one or more executions of the during action of state block A e.g. du u buffer chart in u buffer 1 end 1 .

At some point the chart may wake up with a condition specified in an outer transition of state block C e.g. after 3 sec being true after state block C is first entered. When this condition is true a transition from state block C may occur. State block C may be marked as inactive when state block C is exited. State block A may be marked as inactive since the outer transition of state block C e.g. after 3 sec leaves a graphical boundary of state block A. State block C may transition to state block D and state block D may be marked as active. At this time only state block D may be active in the chart. Graphical symbols of state block D e.g. an entry action en chart out data may be executed at this time.

As further shown in TCE may instruct client device to display an option to execute the chart or may automatically execute the chart when the model is executed. For example user interface may display a window or some other display mechanism that requests whether the user wants to execute the chart. If the user elects to execute the chart e.g. via selection of a Yes button with a mouse or other selection mechanism TCE may execute the chart to generate chart information as further shown in . Chart information may include information associated with the graphical hierarchy state blocks A B C and D the graphical symbols the textual code and or execution of the graphical hierarchy state blocks A B C and D the graphical symbols and or the textual code. In some implementations the chart may be executed based on conditions in a model e.g. a time based block diagram model . For example if a temperature in a model of an HVAC system exceeds a certain value e.g. at a particular time a status of a heater device may change from on to off.

In some implementations TCE may begin searching at a lowest level of the graphical hierarchy for data and or a function and move up the graphical hierarchy level by level until the data function is found. In some implementations TCE may include a global or logical workspace that may be searched first or last for example for data and or a function. In some implementations TCE may execute the chart by executing one or more transitions by executing in microsteps by executing all events and actions at a hierarchical level etc. Each microstep may result in a set of transitions that result in a stable state configuration e.g. the result of one state chart execution . A state machine may continue to execute microsteps until no state transitions are possible from a current state configuration.

As shown in assume that TCE provides chart information to parser . For example TCE may provide to parser the information associated with the graphical hierarchy and the state of the chart e.g. the hierarchy and active state information of state blocks A B C and D the information associated with the graphical symbols e.g. chart out data after 3 sec etc. the information associated with the textual code e.g. the function foo and or the execution of the graphical hierarchy state blocks A B C and D the graphical symbols and or the textual code. Parser may parse chart information into information associated with graphical symbols that are not understood by graphical engine information associated with the graphical hierarchy and state blocks A B C and D and information associated with the textual code.

Information may not be generated if all of the graphical symbols in chart information are understood by graphical engine . In such a situation parser may provide information associated with the graphical symbols directly to graphical engine . In one example information may include the text after 3 sec or after abs a eig b 1 10 1 10 sec which may not be understood by graphical engine since graphical engine does not understand TCE language syntax e.g. abs a eig b . In this example parser may provide the text to transformer and transformer may transform the text into a form understood by graphical engine e.g. transformed graphical symbols as shown in . For example transformer may transform the text to utilize counters maintained by the graphical environment e.g. Simulink so that a time e.g. one second two seconds etc. may be calculated by graphical engine . Information associated with the graphical hierarchy and state blocks A B C and D may include for example the hierarchy and state information of state blocks A B C and D information identifying that state A is a parent state for state B etc. Information associated with the textual code may include for example information associated with the function foo.

As shown in graphical engine may receive information associated with graphical symbols e.g. chart out a data transformed graphical symbols e.g. counters information associated with the graphical hierarchy and state e.g. the hierarchy and state information of state blocks A B C and D and information associated with the textual code e.g. the functions foo abs eig A 

Graphical engine may provide information associated with textual code to textual engine . Textual engine may process information to generate textual results . In example assume that textual results include numerical results from executing the textual code e.g. the function foo and or an intermediate representation IR from compiling the textual code. Textual engine may provide textual results to graphical engine . Graphical engine may process information transformed graphical symbols information and textual results to generate chart results . In example assume that chart results include the calculations performed by one or more of state blocks A B C and or D numerical results from executing the textual code e.g. the function foo and or an intermediate representation IR from compiling the textual code.

After one or more portions of the chart are executed and chart results are generated TCE may utilize chart results to execute the model. For example as described above in connection with the chart may wake up and execute one or more of state blocks A B C and D. In some implementations the chart may execute one or more portions of a model and or the model may execute one or more portions of the chart. As shown in TCE may cause client device to display a user interface that includes the executed model. As shown in user interface the chart block may receive an input signal e.g. a sine wave from the sine wave block and may output a voltage time signal based on the input signal to the scope block. As further shown the voltage time signal may correspond to the calculations performed by state blocks A B C and or D and or the calculation of the function foo.

As indicated above are provided merely as an example. Other examples are possible and may differ from what was described with regard to .

As shown in process may include receiving a TCE state chart with one or more state blocks block . For example TCE may cause client device to display a user interface to a user of client device . The user interface may include mechanisms e.g. menus buttons icons libraries etc. that enable the user to create a state chart for TCE . In some implementations the user may wish to create a state chart with one or more chart elements e.g. state blocks one or more input signals and one or more output signals. Each of the state chart elements may be associated with a state of a physical device a subsystem another model etc. of a system being modeled.

In some implementations the user of client device may utilize TCE to import the state chart into TCE from memory e.g. memory or storage component of client device . In some implementations the user of client device may utilize TCE to import the state chart into TCE from another source such as for example server device or an external memory device e.g. a CD ROM a flash memory etc. .

As further shown in process may include receiving a temporal change operator associated with a state block and including textual code block . For example the user may utilize the user interface to provide a state block in the state chart and to associate an operator with the state block. In some implementations the state block and the operator may be included in the state chart if the state chart is imported into TCE . In some implementations the operator may include textual code that may be understood and processed by textual engine of TCE . The textual code may include for example one or more functions matrices arrays data etc. that may be understood and processed by textual engine .

In some implementations the operator may include a temporal or time based operator. A temporal operator may utilize a sample rate of a state chart an expression typed by the user etc. For example assume that a sample rate of the state chart is 5 milliseconds msec and that the user inputs an expression after PAR msec . TCE may automatically transform the expression into 5 counter PAR to avoid floating point division and to provide efficient integer multiplication. The temporal operator may include keywords e.g. sec msec usec etc. that let the user specify units of a time interval for the temporal operator. In some implementations the temporal operator may include syntax such as for example after before every etc. For example a temporal operator after 10 sec may return true after ten seconds have elapsed since a current active state is entered. In another example if a temporal operator after 3 sec is provided at a transition between state blocks A and B the temporal operator may cause a transition from state block A to state block B three seconds after state block A is entered.

In some implementations the operator may include a change or event based operator that may cause TCE to automatically check whether a variable value has changed since an event e.g. a last time a state was activated . In some implementations the change operator may include syntax such as for example hasChanged hasChangedFrom hasChangedTo etc. For example the hasChanged operator may cause TCE to check whether a variable changes value from a beginning of a last time step e.g. a time a state was activated to a beginning of a current time step. The hasChangedFrom operator may cause TCE to check whether a variable changes from a specified value at a beginning of a last time step to a different value at a beginning of a current time step. The hasChangedTo operator may cause TCE to check whether a variable changes to a specified value at a beginning of a current time step from a different value at a beginning of a last time step.

In some implementations the change operator may cause TCE to return a 1 if the value changes or a 0 if the value does not change. For example hasChanged u may cause TCE to return a 1 if u changes value since a last time step. If u is a matrix hasChanged u may cause TCE to return a 1 if any element of u changes value since the last time step. In another example hasChangedFrom u v may cause TCE to return a 1 if u changes from a value specified by v since a last time step. In another example hasChangedTo u v may cause TCE to return a 1 if u changes to a value specified by v in a current time step. In some implementations if two floating point variables are compared TCE may account for a small tolerance e.g. automatically determined by TCE or provided by the user to consider the variables equivalent e.g. within the tolerance . In some implementations the operator may include other types of operators.

As further shown in process may include initiating execution of the TCE state chart block . For example the user may instruct TCE to execute the state chart and TCE may initiate execution of the state chart based on the user s instructions. In some implementations TCE may initiate execution of the state chart when the user inputs a command or selects a display mechanism e.g. a button a menu item etc. that instructs TCE to execute the state chart. For example TCE may cause client device to display an Execution button in the user interface. When the user selects the Execution button the selection may cause TCE to initiate execution of the state chart. In another example TCE may cause client device to display a command window in the user interface. The user may enter a command e.g. execute state chart in the command window and TCE may initiate execution of the state chart based on the entered command.

As further shown in process may include processing the operator and the state block s with a graphical engine of the TCE to generate graphical results block . For example parser of TCE may receive chart information associated with the state chart. In some implementations the chart information may include information associated with state blocks temporal operators change operators textual code etc. provided in the state chart. TCE may identify based on the chart information a portion of the state chart that may be understood and processed by textual engine e.g. a textual portion and a portion of the state chart that may be understood and processed by graphical engine e.g. a graphical portion . In some implementations graphical engine may have access to a data structure e.g. a database that stores syntax associated with the language of the textual environment of TCE e.g. and understood by textual engine . Graphical engine may compare the chart information with the syntax stored in the data structure and may determine that particular portions of the chart information match the syntax. Graphical engine may designate the matching portions of the chart information as the textual portion. For example graphical engine may designate the textual code provided in the operator as the textual portion.

In some implementations graphical engine may have access to a data structure e.g. a database that stores information associated with the graphical environment of TCE e.g. and understood by graphical engine . Graphical engine may compare the chart information with information stored in the data structure and may determine that particular portions of the chart information match the information in the data structure. Graphical engine may designate the matching portions of the chart information as the graphical portion. For example graphical engine may designate state information associated with the state block of the state chart the operator etc. as the graphical portion.

Graphical engine may process the graphical portion of the state chart to generate graphical results. In some implementations graphical engine may execute the graphical portion of the state chart to generate the graphical results. For example graphical engine may execute any functions expressions etc. provided in the state blocks of the state chart and may execute the operator. If the operator is a temporal operator e.g. after 5 sec graphical engine may execute the temporal operator to determine whether five seconds have elapsed since a state has been entered. In this example the results of the execution of the temporal operator may be referred as graphical results. If the operator is a change operator e.g. hasChanged u graphical engine may execute the change operator to determine whether u changes value since a last time step. In this example the results of the execution of the change operator may be referred as graphical results.

As further shown in process may include processing the textual code with a textual engine of the TCE to generate textual results block . For example graphical engine may provide the textual portion of the state chart to textual engine and textual engine may process the textual portion of the state chart to generate textual results. In some implementations textual engine may execute the textual portion of the state chart to generate the textual results. For example assume that the textual code of an operator in the state chart includes a calculation e.g. eig Z for performing calculations on a matrix Z. In such an example textual engine may execute the calculation so that the matrix calculations are performed on matrix Z. The results from the calculations may be a matrix and may be referred to as textual results. In another example assume that the textual code of an operator of the state chart includes a comparison e.g. average y 10 . In this example textual engine may execute the calculation average y so that the average is calculated. The results of the execution and of the comparison may be referred to as textual results.

As further shown in process may include combining the graphical results and the textual results to generate chart results block . For example TCE may combine the graphical results generated by graphical engine and the textual results generated by textual engine to create chart results. In some implementations the chart results may include results associated with execution of the state chart. For example assume that the state chart includes two state blocks e.g. state block A and state block B that state block A calculates a function e.g. x x 2 and that state block B calculates another function e.g. y x sin 9.67 . Further assume that a transition from state block A to state block B includes a change operator e.g. hasChangedTo x 10 . In this example the textual results may include the calculations of variables x and y and the graphical results may include entering state block A and transitioning to state block B when the change operator is satisfied e.g. when variable x has changed to a value of ten . Thus the chart results may include entering state block A calculating variable x transitioning to state block B when a value of variable x is equal to ten and calculating variable y.

In some implementations textual engine may combine the textual results with the graphical results to generate the chart results. In some implementations graphical engine may combine the textual results with the graphical results to generate the chart results.

As further shown in process may include outputting or storing the chart results block . For example TCE may cause client device to provide the chart results for display to the user. In some implementations TCE may cause client device to store the chart results in memory e.g. memory storage component etc. associated with client device and or server device . In some implementations TCE generate output code based on the chart results and may cause client device to embed the output code in a physical device e.g. a robot manufacturing equipment etc. .

Although shows example blocks of process in some implementations process may include additional blocks fewer blocks different blocks or differently arranged blocks than those depicted in . Additionally or alternatively two or more of the blocks of process may be performed in parallel.

As further shown in a temporal operator e.g. after fft y 1 10 1 10 msec may be provided at a transition between state block A and state block B. The temporal operator may include textual code e.g. fft y 1 10 1 10 understood by textual engine of TCE . The temporal operator may cause the state chart to transition from state block A to state block B when a certain amount e.g. equal to a fast Fourier transform of variable y 1 10 1 10 of milliseconds msec have elapsed. In example assume that the user instructs TCE to execute the state chart by entering an execute state chart command or by selecting an execute state chart button as further shown in .

TCE may execute the state chart based on the user s instructions. When the state chart is executed by TCE state block A may execute the textual code e.g. en y u1 u2 to generate results. State block B may be entered when the condition of the temporal operator is satisfied e.g. after fft y 1 10 1 10 milliseconds have elapsed . State block B may execute the textual code e.g. en z 0.7 sin y and may output results of the execution.

As shown in when executing the state chart TCE may provide chart information to graphical engine of TCE . Chart information may include for example information associated with the arrangement of state block A and state block B information associated with the temporal operator e.g. after fft y 1 10 1 10 msec and information associated with other textual code e.g. the textual code provided in state block A and state block B . Graphical engine may divide chart information into a textual portion and a graphical portion. In example assume that the textual portion includes the syntax fft y 1 10 1 10 of the temporal operator and the other textual code e.g. provided in state blocks A and B . Further assume that the graphical portion includes the syntax after and msec of the temporal operator and the information associated with the arrangement of state block A and state block B.

As further shown in graphical engine may provide the textual portion to textual engine and textual engine may process the textual portion to generate textual results. In example assume that textual engine calculates y 1 10 1 10 variable z and the fast Fourier transform of y 1 10 1 10 e.g. as being equal to 6.87 . The calculations of y 1 10 1 10 variable z and the fast Fourier transform of y 1 10 1 10 may be referred to as textual results. Textual engine may provide the textual results to graphical engine . Graphical engine may process the graphical portion to generate graphical results. In example assume that graphical engine determines whether the condition after 6.87 milliseconds is satisfied. The determination of whether the condition is satisfied may be referred to as graphical results. Graphical engine may combine the textual results with the graphical results to generate chart results . In example assume that chart results include the final calculation of variable z. TCE may cause client device to display chart results to the user and or to store chart results .

Now assume that the user utilizes TCE to create another state chart or to import the other state chart into TCE . As shown in TCE may cause client device to display the other state chart in a user interface as the user creates the other state chart or after the user imports the other state chart. The other state chart may include a first state block e.g. state block A a second state block e.g. state block B a third state block e.g. state block C and a fourth state block e.g. state block D . State block A may include a representation of a first calculation to be performed state block B may include a representation of a second calculation to be performed state block C may include a representation of a third calculation to be performed and state block D may include a representation of a fourth calculation to be performed. As further shown in state block A may include textual code e.g. en u z1 z2 and exit u w y x state block B may include textual code e.g. en w w 1 state block C may include textual code e.g. en y y 1 and state block D may include textual code e.g. en x x 1 . The textual code of state blocks A D may be understood by textual engine of TCE .

As further shown in a first change operator e.g. hasChanged sqrt u 1.1 may be provided at a transition between state block A and state block B. The first change operator may include textual code e.g. sqrt u 1.1 understood by the textual environment of TCE . The first change operator may cause the state chart to transition from state block A to state block B when the square root of variable u changes e.g. to greater than 1.1 from a beginning of a last time step to a beginning of a current time step. The operator may behave differently in an array based language than in a scalar form. For example if u is an array then the sqrt operator may generate an array. A comparison with 1.1 may be made for the array and a logical result may be that every element of u is larger than 1.1 or that only one element of u is larger than 1.1.

As further shown in a second change operator e.g. hasChangedFrom w 3 may be provided at a transition between state block B and state block C. The second change operator may include textual code e.g. w understood by the textual environment of TCE . In some implementations a change operator hasChangedFrom array1 array2 may indicate that array1 is different at least in one element from array2. The second change operator may cause the state chart to transition from state block B to state block C when variable w changes from a value e.g. 3 since a last time step.

As further shown in a third change operator e.g. hasChangedTo y 10 may be provided at a transition between state block C and state block D. The third change operator may include textual code e.g. y understood by the textual environment of TCE . The third change operator may cause the state chart to transition from state block C to state block D when variable y changes to a value e.g. 10 in a current time step.

As further shown in a fourth change operator e.g. hasChangedFrom x 3 may be provided at a transition between state block D and state block A. The fourth change operator may include textual code e.g. x understood by the textual environment of TCE . The fourth change operator may cause the state chart to transition from state block D to state block A when variable x changes from a value e.g. 3 since a last time step.

In example assume that the user instructs TCE to execute the other state chart by entering an execute state chart command or by selecting an execute state chart button as further shown in . TCE may execute the other state chart based on the user s instructions. When the other state chart is executed by TCE state block A may execute the textual code e.g. en u z1 z2 to generate results. State block A may transition to state block B when the conditions of the first change operator are satisfied e.g. when the square root of variable u changes to greater than 1.1 between time steps . State block B may execute the textual code e.g. en w w 1 to generate results.

State block B may transition to state block C when the conditions of the second change operator are satisfied e.g. when variable w changes from 3 since a last time step . State block C may execute the textual code e.g. en y y 1 to generate results. State block C may transition to state block D when the conditions of the third change operator are satisfied e.g. when variable y changes to 10 in a current time step . State block D may execute the textual code e.g. en x x 1 to generate results. State block D may transition to state block A when the conditions of the fourth change operator are satisfied e.g. when variable x changes from 3 since a last time step . State block A may execute the textual code e.g. exit u w y x and may output results of the execution.

As shown in when executing the other state chart TCE may provide chart information to graphical engine of TCE . Chart information may include for example information associated with the arrangement of state blocks A D information associated with the change operators e.g. hasChanged hasChangedFrom and hasChangedTo and information associated with other textual code e.g. the textual code provided in state blocks A D . Graphical engine may divide chart information into a textual portion and a graphical portion. In example assume that the textual portion includes the syntax sqrt u 1.1 u w y and x of the change operators and the other textual code. Further assume that the graphical portion includes the syntax hasChanged hasChangedFrom and hasChangedTo of the change operators and the information associated with the arrangement of state blocks A D.

As further shown in graphical engine may provide the textual portion to textual engine and textual engine may process the textual portion to generate textual results. In example assume that variables z1 z2 w y and x all equal one 1 initially. Further assume that textual engine calculates variable u e.g. initially as equal to 2 variable w e.g. until variable w is equal to 4 variable y e.g. until variable y is equal to 10 variable x e.g. until variable x is equal to 4 and the square root of variable u e.g. as being equal to 1.414 which is greater than 1.1 . The calculations of variable u variable w variable y variable x and the square root of variable u may be referred to as textual results. Textual engine may provide the textual results to graphical engine and graphical engine may process the graphical portion to generate graphical results. In example assume that graphical engine determines whether the conditions of the change operators are satisfied. The determination of whether the conditions are satisfied may be referred to as graphical results. Graphical engine may combine the textual results with the graphical results to generate chart results . In example assume that chart results include the final calculation of variable u e.g. w y x 4 10 4 18 . TCE may cause client device to display chart results to the user and or to store chart results .
