This application is a Divisional Application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 101 462 filed on Dec. 10 2013 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 895 623 filed on Oct. 25 2013 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 735 660 filed on Dec. 11 2012 the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The present invention relates to small molecule inhibitors of site amyloid precursor protein APP Cleaving Enzyme 1 BACE1 . In particular this invention relates to inhibiting the production of A beta peptides that can contribute to the formation of neurological deposits of amyloid protein which may be applicable in the treatment of Alzheimer s Disease AD and other neurodegenerative and or neurological disorders in mammals. In addition this invention is related to the treatment of diabetes and obesity in mammals including humans.

Dementia results from a wide variety of distinctive pathological processes. The most common pathological processes causing dementia are Alzheimer s disease AD cerebral amyloid angiopathy CM and prion mediated diseases see e.g. Haan et al. Clin. Neurol. Neurosurg. 1990 92 4 305 310 Glenner et al. J. Neurol. Sci. 1989 94 1 28 . AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory impairment and cognitive dysfunction. AD affects nearly half of all people past the age of 85 the most rapidly growing portion of the United States population. As such the number of AD patients in the United States is expected to increase from about 4 million to about 14 million by 2050.

The accumulation of amyloid A peptides is believed to be one of the underlying causes of Alzheimer s Disease AD which is the most common cause of cognitive decline in the elderly Hardy Allsop Trends Pharmacol Sci. 1991 12 10 383 8 Selkoe Behav. Brain Res. 2008 192 1 106 13 . A the major protein constituent of amyloid plaques is derived from sequential cleavage of the type I integral membrane protein amyloid precursor protein APP by two proteases and secretase. Proteolytic cleavage of APP by the site APP cleaving enzymes BACE1 and BACE2 generates a soluble N terminal ectodomain of APP sAPP and the C terminal fragment C99. Subsequent cleavage of the membrane bound C99 fragment by the secretase liberates the various A peptide species of which A 40 and A 42 are the most predominant forms Vassar et al J. Neurosci. 2009 29 41 12787 94 Marks Berg Neurochem. Res. 2010 35 181 210 . Therefore limiting the generation of A directly through inhibition of BACE1 is one of the most attractive approaches for the treatment of AD as BACE1 inhibitors could effectively inhibit the formation of all predominant A peptides.

In addition it has been determined that BACE1 knock out mice had markedly enhanced clearance of axonal and myelin debris from degenerated fibers accelerated axonal regeneration and earlier reinnervation of neuromuscular junctions compared with littermate controls. These data suggest BACE1 inhibition as a therapeutic approach to accelerate regeneration and recovery after peripheral nerve damage. See Farah et al. J. Neurosci. 2011 31 15 5744 5754 .

Insulin resistance and impaired glucose homoeostasis are important indicators of Type 2 diabetes and are early risk factors of AD. In particular there is a higher risk of sporadic AD in patients with Type 2 diabetes and AD patients are more prone to Type 2 diabetes Butler Diabetes 53 474 481 2004. . Recently it has also been proposed that AD should be reconsidered as Type 3 Diabetes de la Monte J. Diabetes Sci. Technol. 2008 2 6 1101 1113 . Of special interest is the fact that AD and Type 2 diabetes share common pathogenic mechanisms and possibly treatments Park SA. J. Clin. Neurol. 2011 7 10 18 Raffa Br. J. Clin. Pharmacol 2011 71 3 365 376 . Elevated plasma levels of A the product of BACE activities were recently associated with hyperglycemia and obesity in humans see Meakin et al. Biochem J. 2012 441 1 285 96 Martins Journal of Alzheimer s Disease 8 2005 269 282 . Moreover increased A production prompts the onset of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in mice C zar Castellano Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 302 E1373 E1380 2012 Delibegovic Diabetologia 2011 54 2143 2151 . Finally it is also suggested that circulating A could participate in the development of atherosclerosis in both humans and mice De Meyer Atherosclerosis 216 2011 54 58 Catapano Atherosclerosis 210 2010 78 87 Roher Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1812 2011 1508 1514 .

Therefore it is believed that BACE1 levels may play a critical role in glucose and lipid homoeostasis in conditions of chronic nutrient excess. Specifically BACE1 inhibitors may be potentially useful for increasing insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle and liver as illustrated by the fact that reduction in BACE1 decreases body weight protects against diet induced obesity and enhances insulin sensitivity in mice see Meakin et al. Biochem. J. 2012 441 1 285 96 . Of equal interest is the identification of LRP1 as a BACE1 substrate and the potential link to atherosclerosis Strickland Physiol. Rev. 88 887 918 2008 Hyman J. Biol. Chem. Vol. 280 No. 18 17777 17785 2005 .

Likewise inhibition of BACE2 is proposed as a treatment of Type 2 diabetes with the potential to preserve and restore cell mass and stimulate insulin secretion in pre diabetic and diabetic patients. WO2011 020806 . BACE2 is a cell enriched protease that regulates pancreatic cell function and mass and is a close homologue of BACE1. Pharmacological inhibition of BACE2 increases cell mass and function leading to the stabilization of Tmem27. See Esterhazy et al. Cell Metabolism 2011 14 3 365 377 . It is suggested that BACE2 inhibitors are useful in the treatment and or prevention of diseases associated with the inhibition of BACE2 e.g. Type 2 diabetes with the potential to preserve and restore cell mass and stimulate insulin secretion in pre diabetic and diabetic patients WO2011 020806 .

Aminodihydrothiazine or thioamidine compounds are described in US2009 0082560 WO 2009 091016 and WO 2010 038686 as useful inhibitors of the secretase enzyme. PCT application PCT IB2012 054198 filed by Pfizer Inc on Aug. 17 2012 also describes aminodihydrothiazine compounds that are useful inhibitors of the secretase enzyme. The present invention is directed to novel thioamidine compounds and their use in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases including AD as well as the treatment of metabolic diseases and conditions such as diabetes and obesity.

All patents patent applications and references referred to herein are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.

Other features and advantages of this invention will be apparent from this specification and the appendent claims which describe the invention. It is to be understood that both the foregoing and the following detailed description are exemplary only and are not restrictive of the invention as claimed.

The present invention may be understood more readily by reference to the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention and the examples included therein. It is to be understood that this invention is not limited to specific methods of synthesis which may of course vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting.

In this specification and in the claims that follow reference will be made to a number of terms that shall be defined to have the following meanings 

The term alkyl refers to a linear or branched chain saturated hydrocarbyl substituent i.e. a substituent obtained from a hydrocarbon by removal of a hydrogen in one embodiment from one to six carbon atoms and in another embodiment from one to four carbon atoms and in another embodiment one to three carbon atoms. Non limiting examples of such substituents include methyl ethyl propyl including n propyl and isopropyl butyl including n butyl isobutyl sec butyl and tert butyl pentyl isoamyl hexyl and the like.

In some instances the number of carbon atoms in a hydrocarbyl substituent i.e. alkyl cycloalkyl etc. is indicated by the prefix C C or C wherein x is the minimum and y is the maximum number of carbon atoms in the substituent. Thus for example C C alkyl or Calkyl refers to an alkyl substituent containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Illustrating further C C cycloalkyl or C cycloalkyl refers to saturated cycloalkyl containing from 3 to 6 carbon ring atoms.

The term alkoxy refers to a straight chain saturated alkyl or branched chain saturated alkyl bonded through an oxygen atom. Non limiting examples of such alkoxy groups are methoxy ethoxy propoxy isopropoxy butoxy isobutoxy tertiary butoxy and pentoxy.

The term aryl means a carbocyclic aromatic system containing one two or three rings wherein such rings may be fused. If the rings are fused one of the rings must be fully unsaturated and the fused ring s may be fully saturated partially unsaturated or fully unsaturated. The term fused means that a second ring is present i.e. attached or formed by having two adjacent atoms in common i.e. shared with the first ring. The term fused is equivalent to the term condensed . The term aryl embraces aromatic radicals such as phenyl naphthyl tetrahydronaphthyl indanyl biphenyl benzo b 1 4 oxazin 3 4H onyl 2 3 dihydro 1H indenyl and 1 2 3 4 tetrahydronaphthalenyl.

The term cycloalkyl refers to a nonaromatic ring that is fully hydrogenated and exists as a single ring. Examples of such carbocyclic rings include cyclopropyl cyclobutyl cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl.

The term halo or halogen refers to fluorine which may be depicted as F chlorine which may be depicted as Cl bromine which may be depicted as Br or iodine which may be depicted as I .

The term heteroaryl refers to an aromatic ring structure containing from 5 to 6 ring atoms in which at least one of the ring atoms is a heteroatom i.e. oxygen nitrogen or sulfur with the remaining ring atoms being independently selected from the group consisting of carbon oxygen nitrogen and sulfur. Examples of heteroaryl substituents include 6 membered ring substituents such as pyridyl pyrazyl pyrimidinyl and pyridazinyl and 5 membered ring substituents such as triazolyl imidazolyl furanyl thiophenyl pyrazolyl oxazolyl isoxazolyl thiazolyl 1 2 3 1 2 4 1 2 5 or 1 3 4 oxadiazolyl and isothiazolyl. In a group that has a heteroaryl substituent the ring atom of the heteroaryl substituent that is bound to the group may be one of the heteroatoms or it may be a ring carbon atom. Similarly if the heteroaryl substituent is in turn substituted with a group or substituent the group or substituent may be bound to one of the heteroatoms or it may be bound to a ring carbon atom. The term heteroaryl also includes pyridyl N oxides and groups containing a pyridine N oxide ring. Further examples include furyl thienyl oxazolyl thiazolyl imidazolyl pyrazolyl triazolyl tetrazolyl isoxazolyl isothiazolyl oxadiazolyl thiadiazolyl pyridinyl pyridazinyl pyrimidinyl pyrazinyl pyridin 2 1H onyl pyridazin 2 1H onyl pyrimidin 2 1H onyl pyrazin 2 1H onyl imidazo 1 2 a pyridinyl pyrazolo 1 5 a pyridinyl 5 6 7 8 tetrahydroisoquinolinyl 5 6 7 8 tetrahydroquinolinyl 6 7 dihydro 5H cyclopenta b pyridinyl 6 7 dihydro 5H cyclopenta c pyridinyl 1 4 5 6 tetrahydrocyclopenta c pyrazolyl 2 4 5 6 tetrahydrocyclopenta c pyrazolyl 5 6 dihydro 4H pyrrolo 1 2 b pyrazolyl 6 7 dihydro 5H pyrrolo 1 2 b 1 2 4 triazolyl 5 6 7 8 tetrahydro 1 2 4 triazolo 1 5 a pyridinyl 4 5 6 7 tetrahydropyrazolo 1 5 a pyridinyl 4 5 6 7 tetrahydro 1H indazolyl and 4 5 6 7 tetrahydro 2H indazolyl. The heteroaryl can be further substituted as defined herein.

Examples of single ring heteroaryls and heterocycloalkyls include furanyl dihydrofuranyl tetrahydrofuranyl thiophenyl dihydrothiophenyl tetrahydrothiophenyl pyrrolyl isopyrrolyl pyrrolinyl pyrrolidinyl imidazolyl isoimidazolyl imidazolinyl imidazolidinyl pyrazolyl pyrazolinyl pyrazolidinyl triazolyl tetrazolyl dithiolyl oxathiolyl oxazolyl isoxazolyl thiazolyl isothiazolyl thiazolinyl isothiazolinyl thiazolidinyl isothiazolidinyl thiaoxadiazolyl oxathiazolyl oxadiazolyl including oxadiazolyl 1 2 4 oxadiazolyl 1 2 5 oxadiazolyl or 1 3 4 oxadiazolyl pyranyl including 1 2 pyranyl or 1 4 pyranyl dihydropyranyl pyridinyl piperidinyl diazinyl including pyridazinyl pyrimidinyl piperazinyl triazinyl including s triazinyl as triazinyl and v triazinyl oxazinyl including 2H 1 2 oxazinyl 6H 1 3 oxazinyl or 2H 1 4 oxazinyl isoxazinyl including o isoxazinyl or p isoxazinyl oxazolidinyl isoxazolidinyl oxathiazinyl including 1 2 5 oxathiazinyl or 1 2 6 oxathiazinyl oxadiazinyl including 2H 1 2 4 oxadiazinyl or 2H 1 2 5 oxadiazinyl morpholinyl.

The term heteroaryl also includes fused ring systems having one or two rings wherein such rings may be fused wherein fused is as defined above. It is to be understood that if a carbocyclic or heterocyclic moiety may be bonded or otherwise attached to a designated substrate through differing ring atoms without denoting a specific point of attachment then all possible points are intended whether through a carbon atom or for example a trivalent nitrogen atom. For example the term pyridyl means 2 3 or 4 pyridyl the term thienyl means 2 or 3 thienyl and so forth.

In some instances the number of atoms in a cyclic substituent containing one or more heteroatoms i.e. heteroaryl or heterocycloalkyl is indicated by the prefix x to y membered wherein x is the minimum and y is the maximum number of atoms forming the cyclic moiety of the substituent. Thus for example 5 to 6 membered heteroaryl refers to a heteroaryl containing from 5 to 6 atoms including one or more heteroatoms in the cyclic moiety of the heteroaryl. The heteroatoms for this invention are selected from nitrogen oxygen and sulfur.

If substituents are described as independently having more than one variable each instance of a substituent is selected independent of the other from the list of variables available. Each substituent therefore may be identical to or different from the other substituent s .

As used herein the term Formula I may be hereinafter referred to as a compound s of the invention the present invention and compound of Formula I. Such terms are also defined to include all forms of the compound of Formula I including hydrates solvates isomers crystalline and non crystalline forms isomorphs polymorphs tautomers and metabolites thereof. For example the compounds of the invention or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may exist in unsolvated and solvated forms. When the solvent or water is tightly bound the complex will have a well defined stoichiometry independent of humidity. When however the solvent or water is weakly bound as in channel solvates and hygroscopic compounds the water solvent content will be dependent on humidity and drying conditions. In such cases non stoichiometry will be the norm.

The compounds of the invention may exist as clathrates or other complexes. Included within the scope of the invention are complexes such as clathrates drug host inclusion complexes wherein the drug and host are present in stoichiometric or non stoichiometric amounts. Also included are complexes of the compounds of the invention containing two or more organic and or inorganic components which may be in stoichiometric or non stoichiometric amounts. The resulting complexes may be ionized partially ionized or non ionized. For a review of such complexes see J. Pharm. Sci. 64 8 1269 1288 by Haleblian August 1975 .

The compounds of the invention have asymmetric carbon atoms. The carbon carbon bonds of the compounds of the invention may be depicted herein using a solid line a solid wedge or a dotted wedge . The use of a solid line to depict bonds to asymmetric carbon atoms is meant to indicate that all possible stereoisomers e.g. specific enantiomers racemic mixtures etc. at that carbon atom are included. The use of either a solid or dotted wedge to depict bonds to asymmetric carbon atoms is meant to indicate that only the stereoisomer shown is meant to be included. It is possible that compounds of Formula I may contain more than one asymmetric carbon atom. In those compounds the use of a solid line to depict bonds to asymmetric carbon atoms is meant to indicate that all possible stereoisomers are meant to be included. For example unless stated otherwise it is intended that the compounds of Formula I can exist as enantiomers and diastereomers or as racemates and mixtures thereof. The use of a solid line to depict bonds to one or more asymmetric carbon atoms in a compound of Formula I and the use of a solid or dotted wedge to depict bonds to other asymmetric carbon atoms in the same compound is meant to indicate that a mixture of diastereomers is present.

Stereoisomers of Formula I include cis and trans isomers optical isomers such as R and S enantiomers diastereomers geometric isomers rotational isomers conformational isomers and tautomers of the compounds of the invention including compounds exhibiting more than one type of isomerism and mixtures thereof such as racemates and diastereomeric pairs . Also included are acid addition or base addition salts wherein the counterion is optically active for example D lactate or L lysine or racemic for example DL tartrate or DL arginine.

When any racemate crystallizes crystals of two different types are possible. The first type is the racemic compound true racemate referred to above wherein one homogeneous form of crystal is produced containing both enantiomers in equimolar amounts. The second type is the racemic mixture or conglomerate wherein two forms of crystal are produced in equimolar amounts each comprising a single enantiomer.

The compounds of Formula I may exhibit the phenomenon of tautomerism and are regarded as compounds of the invention. For example the compounds of Formula I may exist in several tautomeric forms including the 2 amino dihydrothiazine form Ia and the 2 imino tetrahydrothiazine form Ib. All such tautomeric forms and mixtures thereof are included within the scope of compounds of Formula I. Tautomers exist as mixtures of a tautomeric set in solution. In solid form usually one tautomer predominates. Even though one tautomer may be described the present invention includes all tautomers of the compounds of Formula I and salts thereof. Examples of tautomers are described by the compounds of Formula Ia and Ib and collectively and generically are referred to as compounds of Formula I.

The compounds of this invention may be used in the form of salts derived from inorganic or organic acids. Depending on the particular compound a salt of the compound may be advantageous due to one or more of the salt s physical properties such as enhanced pharmaceutical stability in differing temperatures and humidities or a desirable solubility in water or oil. In some instances a salt of a compound also may be used as an aid in the isolation purification and or resolution of the compound.

Where a salt is intended to be administered to a patient as opposed to for example being used in an in vitro context the salt preferably is pharmaceutically acceptable. The term pharmaceutically acceptable salt refers to a salt prepared by combining a compound of Formula I with an acid whose anion or a base whose cation is generally considered suitable for human consumption. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are particularly useful as products of the methods of the present invention because of their greater aqueous solubility relative to the parent compound. For use in medicine the salts of the compounds of this invention are non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Salts encompassed within the term pharmaceutically acceptable salts refer to non toxic salts of the compounds of this invention which are generally prepared by reacting the free base with a suitable organic or inorganic acid.

Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of the present invention when possible include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric hydrobromic hydrofluoric boric fluoroboric phosphoric metaphosphoric nitric carbonic sulfonic and sulfuric acids and organic acids such as acetic benzenesulfonic benzoic citric ethanesulfonic fumaric gluconic glycolic isothionic lactic lactobionic maleic malic methanesulfonic trifluoromethanesulfonic succinic toluenesulfonic tartaric and trifluoroacetic acids. Suitable organic acids generally include for example aliphatic cycloaliphatic aromatic araliphatic heterocyclic carboxylic and sulfonic classes of organic acids.

Specific examples of suitable organic acids include acetate trifluoroacetate formate propionate succinate glycolate gluconate digluconate lactate malate tartrate citrate ascorbate glucuronate maleate fumarate pyruvate aspartate glutamate benzoate anthranilate stearate salicylate p hydroxybenzoate phenylacetate mandelate embonate pamoate methanesulfonate ethanesulfonate benzenesulfonate pantothenate toluenesulfonate 2 hydroxyethanesulfonate sufanilate cyclohexylaminosulfonate algenate hydroxybutyrate galactarate galacturonate adipate alginate butyrate camphorate cam phorsulfonate cyclopentanepropionate dodecylsulfate glycoheptanoate glycerophosphate heptanoate hexanoate nicotinate 2 naphthalesulfonate oxalate palmoate pectinate 3 phenylpropionate picrate pivalate thiocyanate and undecanoate.

Furthermore where the compounds of the invention carry an acidic moiety suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may include alkali metal salts e.g. sodium or potassium salts alkaline earth metal salts e.g. calcium or magnesium salts and salts formed with suitable organic ligands e.g. quaternary ammonium salts. In another embodiment base salts are formed from bases which form non toxic salts including aluminum arginine benzathine choline diethylamine diolamine glycine lysine meglumine olamine tromethamine and zinc salts.

Organic salts may be made from secondary tertiary or quaternary amine salts such as tromethamine diethylamine N N dibenzylethylenediamine chloroprocaine choline diethanolamine ethylenediamine meglumine N methylglucamine and procaine. Basic nitrogen containing groups may be quaternized with agents such as lower alkyl C C halides e.g. methyl ethyl propyl and butyl chlorides bromides and iodides dialkyl sulfates e.g. dimethyl diethyl dibutyl and diamyl sulfates long chain halides e.g. decyl lauryl myristyl and stearyl chlorides bromides and iodides arylalkyl halides e.g. benzyl and phenethyl bromides and others.

In one embodiment hemisalts of acids and bases may also be formed for example hemisulfate and hemicalcium salts.

Also within the scope of the present invention are so called prodrugs of the compound of the invention. Thus certain derivatives of the compound of the invention that may have little or no pharmacological activity themselves can when administered into or onto the body be converted into the compound of the invention having the desired activity for example by hydrolytic cleavage. Such derivatives are referred to as prodrugs. Further information on the use of prodrugs may be found in Pro drugs as Novel Delivery Systems Vol. 14 ACS Symposium Series T. Higuchi and V. Stella and Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design Pergamon Press 1987 ed. E. B. Roche American Pharmaceutical Association . Prodrugs in accordance with the invention can for example be produced by replacing appropriate functionalities present in the compounds of any of Formula I with certain moieties known to those skilled in the art as pro moieties as described for example in Design of Prodrugs by H. Bundgaard Elsevier 1985 .

The present invention also includes isotopically labeled compounds which are identical to those recited in Formula I but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the present invention include isotopes of hydrogen carbon nitrogen oxygen sulfur fluorine and chlorine such as H H C C C N O O P S F and Cl respectively. Compounds of the present invention prodrugs thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said compounds or of said prodrugs which contain the aforementioned isotopes and or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Certain isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as H and C are incorporated are useful in drug and or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated i.e. H and carbon 14 i.e. C isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium i.e. H can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability for example increased in vivo half life or reduced dosage requirements and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labeled compounds of Formula I of this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Schemes and or in the Examples and Preparations below by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non isotopically labeled reagent.

As used herein eating disorders refer to illnesses in which the patient suffers disturbances in his her eating behaviors and related thoughts and emotions. Representative examples of obesity related eating disorders include overeating bulimia binge eating disorder compulsive dieting nocturnal sleep related eating disorder pica Prader Willi syndrome and night eating syndrome.

 Patient refers to warm blooded animals such as for example guinea pigs mice rats gerbils cats rabbits dogs cattle goats sheep horses monkeys chimpanzees and humans.

The term pharmaceutically acceptable means the substance or composition must be compatible chemically and or toxicologically with the other ingredients comprising a formulation and or the mammal being treated therewith.

The term therapeutically effective amount means an amount of a compound of the present invention that i treats or prevents the particular disease condition or disorder ii attenuates ameliorates or eliminates one or more symptoms of the particular disease condition or disorder or iii prevents or delays the onset of one or more symptoms of the particular disease condition or disorder described herein.

The term treating as used herein unless otherwise indicated means reversing alleviating inhibiting the progress of delaying the progression of delaying the onset of or preventing the disorder or condition to which such term applies or one or more symptoms of such disorder or condition. The term treatment as used herein unless otherwise indicated refers to the act of treating as treating is defined immediately above. The term treating also includes adjuvant and neo adjuvant treatment of a subject.
