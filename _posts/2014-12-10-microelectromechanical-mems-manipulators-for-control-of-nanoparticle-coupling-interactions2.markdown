title: Microelectromechanical (MEMS) manipulators for control of nanoparticle coupling interactions
abstract: A nanopositioning system for producing a coupling interaction between a first nanoparticle and a second nanoparticle. A first MEMS positioning assembly includes an electrostatic comb drive actuator configured to selectively displace a first nanoparticle in a first dimension and an electrode configured to selectively displace the first nanoparticle in a second dimensions. Accordingly, the first nanoparticle may be selectively positioned in two dimensions to modulate the distance between the first nanoparticle and a second nanoparticle that may be coupled to a second MEMS positioning assembly. Modulating the distance between the first and second nanoparticles obtains a coupling interaction between the nanoparticles that alters at least one material property of the nanoparticles applicable to a variety of sensing and control applications.

The United States Government claims certain rights in this invention pursuant to Contract No. W 31 109 ENG 38 between the United States Government and the University of Chicago and or pursuant to DE AC02 06CH11357 between the United States Government and UChicago Argonne LLC representing Argonne National Laboratory.

The present invention relates generally to the field of controlled nanoparticle interaction. More particularly the present invention relates to microelectromechanical MEMS manipulators and methods of using a MEMS manipulator to control nanoparticle location to produce coupling interactions that modulate one or more properties of the nanoparticles.

This section is intended to provide a background or context to the invention that is inter alia recited in the claims. The description herein may include concepts that could be pursued but are not necessarily ones that have been previously conceived or pursued. Therefore unless otherwise indicated herein what is described in this section is not prior art to the description and claims in this application and is not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.

A common approach to making closely spaced metal nanoparticles is through advanced lithographic methods. Electron beam lithography is frequently used to make nanostructures on the scale of a few 10 s of nanometers in size and with similar spacing between nanostructures. However prior efforts in this regard suffer from the inability to reliably produce features on this length scale with high precision. Defects in shape size and or spacing generally arise when producing nanostructures on the scale of 10 nm in length using lithographic techniques. Currently lithography techniques cannot reliably fabricate nanostructures with a spacing of 10 nm or less. Furthermore lithography yields static structures and does not allow for optimization of optical and electronic coupling between the nanoparticles as real time control over the distance between nanoparticles is not achievable.

As a result of these limitations attempts have been made to use rough mechanical means to essentially push two particles together. J. Merlein et al. Nature Photonics 2 230 2008 Electron beam lithography has been used to create two nanoparticles with an initial spacing of about 85 nm. Subsequently an atomic force microscope tip is used to push one of the particles closer to the other. This is a crude method to move nanoparticles closer and suffers from deficiencies such as damaging the nanoparticles the substantial time needed to accomplish movement and a complete lack of reversibility in the degree of coupling between the nanoparticles. Attempts at applying MEMS to move two swords of silicon coated Au structures to near contact have also been made IEEE Transducers 2009 conference Jun. 21 25 2009 . Here the silicon swords had micron lengths and included coarse position control.

Achieving nanoparticle separation on the scale of less than 10 nm is generally beyond the reliable capability of modern nanofabrication tools. In addition to the nanoparticle spacing issue the ability to modulate this distance in a reversible manner would be of value for a wide range of next generation nanoscale devices. For example controlled coupling of nanoparticles could be used as a switching framework to control optical and electrical energy flow in nanoscale devices. Another example that could benefit from this technology would be a sensor where strongly interacting fields of the involved nanoparticles produce shifts in the absorption and scattering resonances of the particles. Another benefit of close nanoparticle coupling would be the gain in the sensitivity of spectroscopies including surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy SERS that result from large field confinement and enhancement effects in the gaps between nanoparticles. For example by positioning molecules within this small region molecular spectroscopy of a single molecule can be achievable. Precise control of the distance between nanoparticles is also needed to manage the efficiency of bow tie nanoantennas. Nanoantenna structures are best known for providing a mechanism for focusing light into the nanoscale gap between conductors. It is expected that these structures could ultimately provide optical readout for on chip nanophotonic logic or light routing devices.

It thus would be beneficial to obtain closely spaced nanoparticles that produce coupling interactions that modulate properties of the nanoparticles for example electronic and optical properties. This is a challenging goal because the degree of interaction between nanoparticles generally increases with decreasing distance between the nanoparticles. The degree of interaction is generally nonlinearly dependant on the distance. In other words a small distance between the nanoparticles is desired and a distance of less than 10 nm is preferred.

MEMS technology may be applied to dynamically control the distance between nanoparticles and as a consequence control their interaction. Several MEMS devices and different types of actuation mechanisms electrostatic thermal piezoelectric optical and magnetic can be used for this purpose. Electrostatic actuation can provide fast and very precise position control. The advanced MEMS positioning device of one embodiment of the present invention comprises an array of electrostatically actuated comb drive MEMS actuators coupled to a positioning element such as a micron size needle. The comb drive actuators include a releasable comb portion and an anchored comb portion. The MEMS positioning device may further include a restoring force element coupled to the comb drive actuator and a portion of the micro needle. The nanoparticle and or nanostructure may be disposed on the micro needle and in one preferred embodiment is located at the distal tip of the micro needle.

The configuration of the present system enables real time adjustment of nanoparticle position to modulate the gap between nanoparticles within a precision of less than about 1 nm. In operation when a voltage is applied to the array of comb drive actuators the releasable comb portion moves toward the anchored comb portion. This motion displaces the coupled micro needle along a first axis and induces a mechanical deformation of the coupled restoring force element. The mechanical deformation of the restoring force element provides a restoring force useful to control the displacement of the coupled micro needle. The MEMS positioning device may further include a lateral electrode to induce lateral motion of the micro needle along a second axis. The second axis may be substantially orthogonal with respect to the first axis. As such the array of comb drives provide motion control in a first dimension and the lateral electrodes allow perpendicular displacement of the micro needle in a second dimension. In this way the relative position of the nanoparticles may be independently modulated in two degrees of freedom. Modulation in additional degrees of freedom may further be achieved by including additional electrodes and or positioning elements associated with the positioning device.

In an embodiment a first MEMS positioning device and a second MEMS position device are arranged with respect to each other such that the nanoparticles disposed on the respective micro needles may be brought into close proximity thereby decreasing the distance between the nanoparticles with respect to an initial position. In a preferred embodiment the nanoparticles may be brought within less than about 10 nm of each other. In another preferred embodiment the nanoparticles may be brought within less than about 1 nm of each other.

Accordingly an object of the present system is to achieve nanoparticle nanoparticle spacing of less than about 10 nm. According to another object of the present system electrically controllable and tunable spacing between nanoparticles in two degrees of freedom is provided. Yet another object of the present system is to obtain positioning capabilities of a plurality of nanoparticles with precision better than about 1 nm. Still another object is to provide a method for achieving these capabilities.

In one set of embodiments a nanopositioning system for producing a coupling interaction between a first nanostructure and a second nanostructure comprises a first MEMS positioning assembly. The first MEMS positioning assembly includes a first static comb drive actuator and a first dynamic comb drive actuator. The first static comb drive actuator is configured to selectively displace the first dynamic comb drive actuator along a first axis in relation to the first static comb drive actuator upon application of a voltage to the first static comb drive actuator. The first MEMS positioning assembly further includes a first restoring force element having a first end and a second end. The first end of the restoring force element is operatively attached to the first dynamic comb drive actuator and the second end is attached to the first static comb drive actuator. The first MEMS positioning assembly also includes a first positioning electrode configured to selectively displace the first dynamic comb drive actuator along a second axis in relation to the first static comb drive actuator upon application of a voltage to the first positioning electrode. A first nanostructure is operatively connected to the first dynamic comb drive actuator. Accordingly the first nanostructure is selectively positionable along the first axis and along the second axis modulating a distance between the first nanostructure and the second nanostructure to obtain a coupling interaction that alters at least one property of the first nanostructure and the second nanostructure.

In another set of embodiments a method for selectively modifying a property of a plurality of nanoparticles through a coupling interaction between the plurality of nanoparticles comprises providing a first nanoparticle providing a first MEMS positioning assembly having a first positioning portion. The first MEMS positioning assembly is configured to selectively displace the first positioning portion along a first axis in response to a first voltage and to selectively displace the first positioning portion along a second axis substantially normal to the first axis in response to a second voltage. The method further comprises coupling the first nanoparticle to the first positioning portion providing a second nanoparticle spaced a distance from the first nanoparticle and modulating the distance between the first nanoparticle and the second nanoparticle by displacement of the first positioning portion along at least one of the first axis and the second axis to obtain a coupling interaction between the first nanoparticle and the second nanoparticle. The coupling interaction alters at least one property of the first nanoparticle and the second nanoparticle.

In a further set of embodiments an electrostatic nanopositioning system for modulating a distance between a first nanostructure and a second nanostructure to control an interaction between the first nanostructure and the second nanostructure comprises a first nanopositioner configured to receive a first nanoparticle a second nanopositioner configured to receive a second nanoparticle spaced a distance from the first nanoparticle so as to cause a coupling interaction between the first nanoparticle and the second nanoparticle. Each of the first nanopositioner and the second nanopositioner include a positioning portion selectively moveable along a respective first path by an array of electrostatic comb drive actuators and selectively moveable along a respective second path by an electrode. Each of the first nanopositioner and the second nanopositioner further include a restoring force element coupled to the positioning portion. The restoring force element is deformable in response to movement of the positioning portion along the respective first path. The coupling interaction between the first nanostructure and the second nanostructure is controllable by modulating the distance between the first nanostructure and the second nanostructure by movement of at least one of the first nanostructure and the second nanostructure along at least one of the respective first paths and the respective second paths.

These and other advantages and features of the invention together with the organization and manner of operation thereof will become apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein like elements have like numerals throughout the several drawings described below.

An exemplary nanoparticle MEMS positioning system shown in comprises one or more voltage controlled actuators detailed below.

At least a portion of the MEMS positioning system may be located on a substrate .

With reference to the array of comb drive actuators includes a plurality of actuator elements . Each of the plurality of actuator elements comprises a static comb portion and a dynamic comb portion associated with the static comb portion .

As depicted in the static link member may be substantially parallel to the plurality of comb teeth associated with the anchored comb portion . The static link member further electrically couples each of the static comb portions to a first electrical contact . The array of the comb drive actuators may be fabricated from for example silicon.

The dynamic comb portion is disposed in an actuator opening in a base portion of the MEMS positioning system . Each of the comb bases associated with a dynamic comb portion is coupled to a dynamic link . The dynamic link and each of the comb bases that are associated with the dynamic comb portion may include a plurality of openings to minimize the mass of the releasable comb portion . The dynamic link may include a boom that extends away from the base portion . As depicted in the boom extends in a plane substantially parallel to the substrate and substantially parallel to the plurality of comb teeth . However in other embodiments the boom may be configured to achieve any desired position and or displacement profile.

With reference to a first restoring force element may operatively couple the boom and the static comb portion . As depicted the first restoring force element comprises an elongated U spring element with a static comb end and a boom end . However in various embodiments the first restoring force element may comprise other configurations. As shown in the static comb end is coupled to a leading edge of the static comb portion . The boom end is coupled to the boom . As explained in detail below the first restoring force element moderates the displacement of the boom and the attached micro needle . depicts the first restoring force element in an extended configuration with a first lateral distance d between the static comb end and the boom end . shows the first restoring force element in a retracted configuration with a second distance d less than d between the static comb end and the boom end . The first restoring force element may be configured such that the retracted configuration is the natural position of the first restoring force element . shows another embodiment of the MEMS positioning system having a centrally located boom disposed between a first static comb portion and first dynamic comb portion and a second static comb portion and second dynamic comb portion . In this embodiment a pair of first restoring force elements and are provided and associated with opposite lateral sides of the boom .

By applying a voltage to the MEMS positioning system the electrostatically actuated comb drive actuators move the nanopositioners closer together or further apart along a substantially linear first axis. In particular applying a voltage to the first electrical contact the dynamic comb portion moves generally along the X axis as shown in relative to the static comb portion . shows the MEMS positioning system in a fully extended orientation where the comb teeth of the dynamic comb portion are partially received in the comb openings of the static comb portion . In this orientation the first restoring force element is extended and the boom and micro needle are extended away from the static comb portion . shows the MEMS positioning system in a fully retracted orientation where the comb teeth of the dynamic comb portion lie outside the comb openings of the static comb portion . In this orientation the first restoring force element is retracted and the boom and micro needle translated toward the static comb portion .

The MEMS positioning system is reversible. That is the MEMS positioning system is selectively moveable between the orientations of . The MEMS positioning system may be further be positioned at any intermediate orientation with respect to the orientations depicted in . Accordingly a nanostructure coupled to the MEMS positioning system may be selectively positioned with a high degree of precision in a first dimension substantially defined by the X axis. In an embodiment the MEMS positioning system is configured to provide adjustable position control of an attached nanoparticle to within about 1 nm or better resolution. Precise and adjustable positioning permits customized control of coupling interactions between two or more nanoparticles for a variety of applications.

As shown in the MEMS positioning system may further include a second restoring force element . The second restoring force element as depicted couples the dynamic comb portion to the base portion . The second restoring force element may be configured substantially similar to first restoring force element . For example in the second restoring force element comprises an elongated U spring element with a dynamic comb end and a base end . However the second restoring force element may comprise other configurations. As shown in the dynamic comb end is coupled to a trailing edge of the dynamic comb portion . The base end is coupled to the base portion . The second restoring force element works in conjunction with the first restoring force element to moderate the displacement of the boom and the attached micro needle .

The MEMS positioning system may also include a lateral electrode . As shown in the lateral electrode is located proximate at least a portion of the dynamic link and may be substantially parallel to the dynamic link . Alternatively the lateral electrode may be located near the boom or another location where it may act on the dynamic comb portion . The lateral electrode is electrically coupled to a second electrical contact . The lateral electrode is capable of producing lateral motion of the dynamic comb portion including the boom and the micro needle . In other words application of a voltage to the lateral electrode causes a displacement substantially in the plane of and substantially normal to the axial displacement of the dynamic link . In general the MEMS positioning system is configured such that the range of lateral displacement is less than the range of the axial displacement. However fine control of the position of MEMS positioning system and any coupled nanostructure simultaneously in two dimensions along the X and Y axes is achieved through electrical control of the electrostatically actuated comb drive actuators and the lateral electrode . Position control in additional dimensions e.g. along the Z axis and or rotations about one or more axes may be achieved by associating additional electrodes or other positioning elements with the dynamic comb portion and or the MEMS positioning system generally.

With reference to the micro needle may be coupled to a distal end of the boom . The micro needle may comprise various configurations as necessitated by the application of the MEMS positioning system . However as depicted the micro needle is a narrow member that extends substantially coaxially from a distal end of the boom . The micro needle and the boom may be constructed from a single member or the micro needle may be coupled to the boom using fabrication and or attachment techniques known in the art. In various embodiments the micro needle may be eliminated entirely.

A nanostructure as shown in may be disposed on one or more surfaces of the micro needle . For example a nanodot nanosphere nanorod nanoplate nanotriangle nanopyramids and other structures may be operatively and or directly coupled to the micro needle . Additionally the various nanostructures may be disposed on a portion of the boom . As described below the configuration of the nanostructure may be selected in view of the particular application or other parameter or material property. As shown in a nanodot D or D may be located on an upper surface of the micro needle . show a nanopyramid P located on an upper surface of the micro needle . depict a nanosphere S or S located on an upper surface of the micro needle .

Various nanostructures may be associated with the MEMS positioning system using standard deposition tools. For example electron beam lithography is one technique that may be used to form the desired nanostructure that may be associated with the MEMS positioning system . Alternatively a focused ion beam technique may be used to directly deposit the nanostructure on the MEMS positioning system . As seen in the various nanostructures can be placed with a high degree of precision on the micro needle including proximate a distal edge . However one or more nanostructures may located anywhere on the micro needle or on another portion of the MEMS positioning system . The nanostructures can encompass a wide range of materials for various applications in sensing nanooptics and nanoelectronics. The various nanostructures that may be associated with the MEMS positioning system may be constructed of any appropriate material or materials capable of forming a nanostructure. For example nanostructures of various noble metals e.g. Au Ag Pt etc. carbon and other materials may be constructed and associated with the MEMS positioning system . For instance depict a pair of plasmonic Pt nanodots D D . show a pair Au nanopyramids P P . In various embodiments nanostructures of different materials may be positioned relative to each other using one or more of the MEMS positioning systems .

A nanostructure MEMS positioning system may comprise two or more MEMS positioning systems configured for interaction such that two or more nanostructures may be selectively positioned with respect to each other. As depicted in a pair of MEMS positioning systems are see opposingly arranged to locate a pair of nanodots D D see in relation to each other. The boom of the first MEMS positioning system is substantially coaxial with the boom of the second MEMS positioning system . As such axial displacement of the micro needle by the first MEMS positioning system substantially along the X axis modulates the distance i.e. increases or decreases the distance between the nanodots D D . Alternatively and or in conjunction with the displacement of the first micro needle by the first MEMS positioning system the second MEMS positioning system may be actuated to cause an axial displacement of the respective micro needle substantially along the X axis. shows the nanodots D D positioned to have a separation distance of about 2 m. show the nanopyramids P P selectively positioned in proximity to each other such that the respective apexes of the nanopyramids P P are aligned. Accordingly a tunable bow tie nanoantenna is formed where operation of the nanoantenna may be selectively controlled by modulating the distance between the nanopyramids P P .

Additionally the MEMS positioning systems may be configured to modulate the position of the attached nanostructures in a second dimension e.g. along the Y axis. For example displacement in the second dimension substantially normal to axial displacement along the X axis is achieved via the lateral electrode see . As such precise and reliable coupling of the nanoparticles may be achieved by approximating the MEMS positioning systems relative to each other along the X and Y axes. Multi axis positioning of the nanoparticles can produce a range of applications as described below based on the control of the optical and electronic properties induced by closely spaced interacting nanoparticles. Further positioning control may be achieved by providing additional electrodes and or positioning elements as needed.

In other embodiments other nanostructure placement configurations may be used depending on for example the application and or structure. For example shows an arrangement of a pair of MEMS positioning systems and not fully shown where the respective micro needles are configured to at least partially overlap. In the embodiment of the booms are substantially parallel and disposed in a plane but are laterally offset by a distance approximately equal to the width of one of the micro needles . In various embodiments the booms may be coaxial and the lateral offset may be achieved by positioning one or more of the micro needles in the lateral Y axis direction by imparting a displacement via the lateral electrode . In still other embodiments two or more MEMS positioning systems may be arranged in space as necessary to provide positioning control of a plurality of nanostructures.

The described embodiments may provide opportunities to develop new sensor technologies and switchable control of energy flow in various forms e.g. optical electronic heat etc. In particular the present embodiments may be applied to create coupled plasmonic nanoparticles a key element under development for opto electronic applications including sensors communications interconnects and wavefront control. The foregoing systems and methods have numerous applications including but not limited to 

Plasmons are of significant interest for next generation sub wavelength waveguides but researchers currently do not have a reliable way to externally control the flow of plasmons between nanostructures. An optical or plasmonic switch may be constructed by for example bringing together a first plasmonic nanoparticle and a second plasmonic nanoparticle using the devices and methods already described. By modulating the distance between the first plasmonic nanoparticle and the second plasmonic nanoparticle a shift in the resonance of the particles may be used as a nanoscale optical switch by varying the absorption at different wavelengths. According to the embodiments described herein an electrically addressable plasmonic switch might be formed by modulating the distance between the nanostructures i.e. decreasing the distance between the nanostructures to induce plasmon flow and then separating the nanostructures to turn off plasmon flow.

A critical limitation in the area of optical interconnects is the absence of a technology to modulate optical signals that are smaller than the wavelength of the light used in the signal. Plasmons are electromagnetic waves localized in very small regions but there is not a reliable method to manipulate plasmons in a controlled manner. Integration of metallic nanoparticles with MEMS or NEMS devices as in the described embodiments may allow for control of the relative amplitude or phase of various plasmons in arbitrary spatial locations. In doing so an ideal device for applications like inter chip optical interconnects may be constructed. Devices constructed according the various embodiments described herein may have the potential to reliably and controllably manipulate plasmons for such applications.

Tuning the distance between nanoparticles according to embodiments described herein can optimize field confinement and enhancement effects that other SERS nanostructures cannot currently approach. By positioning molecules in this small region molecular spectroscopy of a single molecule can be achievable through SERS techniques. The gains in field strength are not limited to SERS as other material properties such as absorption and emission can be modified through controllable field enhancement by modulation of nanoparticle position.

Plasmonic antennae that can operate at the nanoscale are key to next generation nanophotonic structures. Antennae act to collect and confine electromagnetic waves for use in photonic devices. A bow tie configuration such as depicted in is one such antenna structure and comprises two triangular structures with a gap between the apex of the two triangles. However miniaturizing antennae structure for use in nanophotonics requires gaps to be formed that are generally too small to be constructed with current lithography technology. The embodiments described herein enable both a sufficiently small gap and selective tunability in the gap distance for optimization of the antennae collection performance to be achieved. It is expected that these structures may ultimately provide optical readout for on chip nanophotonic logic or routing light devices.

In addition to plasmon coupling new techniques to control energy and charge transport within nanostructures are needed. By placing energy or charge donors and acceptors on opposing nanopositioners tunable control of energy and charge flow could be achieved. This applies to both organic and inorganic materials that are integrated with the nanopositioners.

Embodiments described herein could also enable the positioning of nanoparticles to be modulated through the use of an AC field and the ability to use lock in detection of the modulated properties for extraordinarily enhanced signal to noise in sensing and spectroscopy applications.

Embodiments of the MEMS positioning devices described herein could permit multiplexing of a signal across multiple nanopositioners for parallel signal processing and achieve corresponding gains in efficiency for sensing and spectroscopy.

The foregoing description of embodiments of the present invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the present invention to the precise form disclosed and modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teachings or may be acquired from practice of the present invention. The embodiments were chosen and described in order to explain the principles of the present invention and its practical application to enable one skilled in the art to utilize the present invention in various embodiments and with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated.
