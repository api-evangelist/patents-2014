title: Press load process for warhead
abstract: A method of filling a projectile case with energetic material includes isostatically pressing a column of the powder to create a pre-formed billet (PFB). The single PFB is placed in and then pressed into the projectile case to create the finished warhead. The single PFB effectively fills a projectile case having a large l/d ratio. The single PFB eliminates the problems and poor quality associated with pressing multiple increments in a projectile case.

A conventional press loading process for a projectile uses multiple increments of powder to achieve specified quality requirements. Warhead projectiles typically are shaped with a length to diameter l d ratio that balances ballistics and payload. When press loading projectiles with larger l d ratios quality and performance issues arise due to an inherent inefficiency in pressing long charges of powder. It is known that friction forces both inter particle and wall boundary are quality factors that must be minimized during the press loading process. Otherwise the pressed charge will have a density gradient marked by significant degradation along its central axis and further from the press punch. Consequently long powder charges cannot be pressed to meet density and mass specifications. The conventional pressing process relies on multiple pressed increments of powder to reduce the l d ratio to a manageable amount.

Conventional load procedures typically require that multiple increments of powder or pre consolidated pellets are loaded and compacted individually. For example for a cylindrical die efficient consolidation of energetic material is only achieved if the punch diameter is equal to or greater than the length of the container l d less than 1 . Thus in the conventional process the powder is poured and pressed incrementally. Inefficient cohesion between subsequent compacted layers and sharp corners left behind upon withdrawal of the punch may cause the layers to crack and de laminate internally. Poorly bonded layers and low density areas manifest themselves as transverse cracks and internal voids. When a warhead is launched the case is propelled forward while the energetic fill is forced against the back of the case under its own momentum. This phase referred to as setback acceleration harbors severe risk of unintended initiation as any transverse cracks in the energetic material may close violently. Conversely with particularly insensitive compositions a warhead may not reliably initiate if a detonation wave cannot cross these large transverse voids.

To obtain consistent quality through the entire length of a column of energetic material each pressed increment requires a complete cycling of all the pressing steps and parameters including loading vacuum dwell pressure dwell pressure cycling and unloading. Generally the use of fewer increments reduces the total cycle time but decreases the overall quality. A balanced process can be achieved but throughput in a production setting is always choked by incremental press loading.

A need exists for a faster method of press loading energetic material that results in consistently high quality throughout the column of energetic material.

One aspect of the invention is a method of filling a projectile case with energetic material. The method includes providing the energetic material in a powder form. A column of the powder is isostatically pressed to create a pre formed billet PFB . The PFB is placed in the projectile case and pressed in the projectile case. The projectile case is filled using only one PFB.

The method may include placing the PFB in a projectile case having an l d ratio greater than or equal to one.

The step of isostatically pressing may include only pressing the column of powder radially and not pressing the column axially.

The step of isostatically pressing may include pressing a mold in which the column of powder is disposed.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

A novel method of loading energetic material in a warhead enables filling a projectile having a large l d ratio with only a single increment of energetic material while maintaining high quality. The method may be used to compact powders into long closed containers such as the warhead of a rocket or projectile.

The process relies on the use of pre formed billets PFBs produced by isostatic pressing. Isostatic pressing is a technique that uses hydraulic fluid contained within a pressure vessel to generate uniform forces on a powder filled flexible container. The flexible container is called bag tooling. In traditional isostatic presses the bag tooling is submerged in hydraulic fluid within a pressure vessel. In newer isostatic presses hydraulic fluid does not contact the mold directly. This method is known in industry as dry bag isostatic pressing. Consolidation forces are applied radially to the mold. The radially applied forces compact the mold and the energetic powder uniformly along the central longitudinal axis. The compaction of the powder volume reduces its cross sectional area in proportion to the square of the radius of the area. Isostatic pressing is an efficient method of applying compaction forces uniformly upon all exposed surfaces.

The finished PFB is strong flat on one end fairly straight along its central axis and has a rough finish. The mold base plate and cap can be designed to form a variety of shapes and features needed for press loading. The shapes and features may include for example ogives domes shoulders bellies etc.

In the isostatic pressing process the pressure temperature vacuum level and dwell time may be controlled parameters. Pressing the PFB isostatically may require known tooling made of polyurethane and metal. Because the PFB is isostatically pressed on its radius there are no density gradients along the central longitudinal axis along the length L . PFBs of almost any l d ratio can be isostatically pressed without degrading the density consistency needed for warheads.

Once a PFB has been isostatically pressed it can be immediately loaded into a waiting projectile case for final press loading or it can be moved into raw material inventory for future press loading. Either way the PFB is the single increment charge necessary to implement the remainder of the warhead loading process.

After the PFB is isostatically pressed conventional press tooling and platforms may be used to deform the PFB inside a projectile case . Depending on the projectile case strength the mechanical properties of the energetic material and the pressing parameters the press tooling can be designed to meet safety regulations and quality standards. In addition to the pressing parameters controlled in the isostatic pressing process ram position may also be controlled when pressing the PFB in the projectile case .

Well characterized energetic material properties provide a reliable basis for developing mathematical models for predicting behavior of the column of energetic material under consolidation stress. Stress fields and density mapping shown through finite element analysis FFA can provide insights to tooling design and press process development time temperature pressure . The PFB will deform under relatively low force. To fill corners of a projectile case with energetic material and to raise the fill density to near theoretical maximums greater pressing forces may be required.

Prior to pressing the PFB into an empty projectile case the projectile case is aligned and supported by tooling so that the projectile case remains fully constrained during the pressing step. The PFB may be pressed to a density of for example about 95 of the theoretical maximum density so that the energetic material readily deforms and flows in the projectile case void. Once the energetic material begins to flow and fills the void its density begins to rise as the pressure increases. The deformation of the PFB within the consolidation zone in the projectile case is radially outward toward the case wall. The radially outward deformation minimizes wall friction and counter forces applied to the advancing press punch.

The novel process has several advantages over conventional incremental powder pressing. Because only one compacted increment is loaded and pressed the final product has no transverse cracks. A single PFB can be used to press load longer projectiles than can be pressed with prior art processes. The production time is faster. The novel process can integrate easily into conventional pressing platforms.
