This invention is directed to a feed composition and methods of affecting the carcass composition of an animal by the administration of SARM compounds. According to this invention SARMs improve meat production in feedlot animals by increasing the is lean mass reducing the fat mass and or percent fat mass improving feed efficiency and modulation of meat quality.

The production of swine for food use is an important industry in the United States with more than 100 million pigs produced each year. There is demand among producers for agents that increase productivity and performance such as by increasing the proportion of meat per carcass decreasing the amount of fat decreasing the percent fat mass increasing the feed efficiency increasing average daily gain ADG decreasing feed to gain ratio F G and modulation of meat quality.

The androgen receptor AR is a ligand activated transcriptional regulatory protein that mediates induction of male sexual development and function through its activity with endogenous androgens. The androgenic hormones are steroids which are produced in the body by the testes and the cortex of the adrenal gland or can be synthesized in the laboratory. Androgenic steroids play an important role in many physiologic processes including the development of muscle and bone mass. The endogenous steroidal androgens include testosterone and dihydrotestosterone DHT . Other steroidal androgens include esters of testosterone such as the cypionate propionate phenylpropionate cyclopentylpropionate isocarporate enanthate and decanoate esters and other synthetic androgens such as 7 Methyl Nortestosterone MENT and its acetate ester Sundaram et al. 7 Alpha Methyl Nortestosterone MENT .

Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators SARMs include nonsteroidal compounds which retain the anabolic activity of endogenous androgens with reduced androgenic activity i.e. lesser effects in the prostate . SARMs beneficially promote muscle growth in humans and can treat suppress prevent or inhibit muscle wasting.

The ability of a SARM to beneficially promote muscle growth in humans can be used as an alternative means to promote lean muscle deposition in animals feedlot animals beef cattle or finishing livestock.

Currently Paylean Ractopamine hydrochloride is the only commercially available feed additive to increase growth rates and lean efficiency in finishing swine. Ractopamine mediates its effect by stimulating adrenergic receptor.

 adrenergic agonists are a class of chemical compounds that stimulates receptors in the autonomic nervous system. This stimulation of receptors has the effect is of promoting growth in animals when the agonists are fed to the animals.

Although agonists are effective in promoting the production of lean mass there are three major drawbacks which limit the market for Paylean . The most significant drawback to using agonists is the increased susceptibility to stress in treated animals resulting in increased injuries. Secondly the European Union has banned agonists from use in food producing animals since 1996. Finally treatment with agonists results in rapid desensitization of the adrenergic receptors thereby limiting the amount of time an animal can benefit from this treatment typically 

Accordingly there is a need for methods in which new compounds may be used to improve carcass characteristics and increase lean mass gain in animals.

A muscle is a tissue of the body that primarily functions as a source of power. There are three types of muscles in the body a skeletal muscle the muscle responsible for moving extremities and external areas of the bodies b cardiac muscle the heart muscle and c smooth muscle the muscle that is in the walls of arteries and bowel.

A wasting condition or disorder is defined herein as a condition or disorder that is characterized at least in part by an abnormal progressive loss of body organ or tissue mass. A wasting condition can occur as a result of a pathology such as for example cancer or an infection or it can be due to a physiologic or metabolic state such as disuse deconditioning that can occur for example due to prolonged bed rest or when a limb is immobilized such as in a cast. A wasting condition can also be age associated. The loss of body mass that occurs during a wasting condition can be characterized by a loss of total body weight or a loss of organ weight such as a loss of bone or muscle mass due to a decrease in tissue protein.

In one embodiment muscle wasting or muscular wasting used herein interchangeably refer to the progressive loss of muscle mass and or to the progressive weakening and degeneration of muscles including the skeletal or voluntary muscles which control movement cardiac muscles which control the heart and smooth muscles. In one embodiment the muscle wasting condition or disorder is a chronic muscle wasting condition or disorder. Chronic muscle wasting is defined herein as the chronic i.e. persisting over a long period of time progressive loss of muscle mass and or to the chronic progressive weakening and degeneration of muscle.

The loss of muscle mass that occurs during muscle wasting can be characterized by a muscle protein breakdown or degradation by muscle protein catabolism. Protein catabolism occurs because of an unusually high rate of protein degradation an unusually low rate of protein synthesis or a combination of both. Protein catabolism or depletion whether caused by a high degree of protein degradation or a low degree of protein synthesis leads to a decrease in muscle mass and to muscle wasting. The term catabolism has its commonly known meaning in the art specifically an energy burning form of metabolism.

Muscle wasting can occur as a result of a pathology disease condition or disorder. In one embodiment the pathology illness disease or condition is chronic. In another embodiment the pathology illness disease or condition is genetic. In another embodiment the pathology illness disease or condition is neurological. In another embodiment the pathology illness disease or condition is infectious. As described herein the pathologies diseases conditions or disorders for which the compounds and compositions of the present invention are administered are those that directly or indirectly produce a wasting i.e. loss of muscle mass that is a muscle wasting disorder.

In one embodiment muscle wasting in a subject is a result of the subject having a muscular dystrophie muscle atrophy X linked spinal bulbar muscular atrophy SBMA .

The muscular dystrophies are genetic diseases characterized by progressive weakness and degeneration of the skeletal or voluntary muscles that control movement. The muscles of the heart and some other involuntary muscles are also affected in some forms of muscular dystrophy. The major forms of muscular dystrophy MD are duchenne muscular dystrophy myotonic dystrophy becker muscular dystrophy limb girdle muscular dystrophy facioscapulhumeral muscular dystrophy congenital muscular dystrophy oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy distal muscular dystrophy and emery dreifuss muscular dystrophy.

Muscular dystrophy can affect people of all ages. Although some forms first become apparent in infancy or childhood others may not appear until middle age or later. Duchenne Md. is the most common form typically affecting children. Myotonic dystrophy is the most common of these diseases in adults.

Muscle atrophy MA is characterized by wasting away or diminution of muscle and a decrease in muscle mass. For example Post Polio MA is a muscle wasting that occurs as part of the post polio syndrome PPS . The atrophy includes weakness muscle fatigue and pain.

Another type of MA is X linked spinal bulbar muscular atrophy SBMA also known as Kennedy s Disease . This disease arises from a defect in the androgen receptor gene on the X chromosome affects only males and its onset is in adulthood. Because the primary disease cause is an androgen receptor mutation androgen replacement is not a current therapeutic strategy. There are some investigational studies where exogenous testosterone propionate is being given to boost the levels of androgen with hopes of overcoming androgen insensitivity and perhaps provide an anabolic effect. Still use of supraphysiological levels of testosterone for supplementation will have limitations and other potentially serious complications.

Sarcopenia is a debilitating disease that afflicts the elderly and chronically ill patients and is characterized by loss of muscle mass and function. Further increased lean body mass is associated with decreased morbidity and mortality for certain muscle wasting disorders. In addition other circumstances and conditions are linked to and can cause muscle wasting disorders. For example studies have shown that in severe cases of to chronic lower back pain there is paraspinal muscle wasting.

Muscle wasting and other tissue wasting is also associated with advanced age. It is believed that general weakness in old age is due to muscle wasting. As the body ages an increasing proportion of skeletal muscle is replaced by fibrous tissue. The result is a significant reduction in muscle power performance and endurance.

In another embodiment muscle wasting or other tissue wasting may be a result of alcoholism and may be treated with the compounds and compositions of the invention representing embodiments thereof.

In one embodiment the invention provides a use of SARM compound as described herein or its prodrug analog isomer metabolite derivative pharmaceutically acceptable salt pharmaceutical product polymorph crystal impurity N oxide hydrate or any combination thereof for the treatment of a wasting disease disorder or condition in a subject.

In some embodiments wasting is due to infection with enterovirus Epstein Barr virus herpes zoster HIV trypanosomes influenze coxsackie rickettsia trichinella schistosoma or mycobacteria and this invention in some embodiments provides methods of treatment thereof.

Cachexia is weakness and a loss of weight caused by a disease or as a side effect of illness. Cardiac cachexia i.e. a muscle protein wasting of both the cardiac and skeletal muscle is a characteristic of congestive heart failure. Cancer cachexia is a syndrome that occurs in patients with solid tumors and hematological malignancies and is manifested by weight loss with massive depletion of both adipose tissue and lean muscle to mass.

Cachexia is also seen in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome AIDS human immunodeficiency virus HIV associated myopathy and or muscle weakness wasting is a relatively common clinical manifestation of AIDS. Individuals with HIV associated myopathy or muscle weakness or wasting typically experience significant weight loss generalized or is proximal muscle weakness tenderness and muscle atrophy.

The androgen receptor AR binding affinity of SARMs was determined by using an in vitro competitive radioligand binding assay with 17 methyl H Mibolerone H MIB PerkinElmer a high affinity AR ligand. Recombinant androgen receptor ligand binding domain AR LBD was combined with H MIB in buffer A 10 mM Tris pH 7.4 1.6 mM disodium EDTA 0.26 M sucrose 10 mM sodium molybdate 1 mM PMSF to determine the equilibrium dissociation constant K of H MIB. Protein was incubated with increasing concentrations of H MIB with and without a high concentration of unlabeled MIB in order to determine total and non specific binding. Non specific binding was then subtracted from total binding to determine specific binding and graphed using SigmaPlot and non linear regression for ligand binding curve with one site saturation to determine the Kof MIB 1.84 nM . In addition the concentration of H MIB required to saturate AR LBD was determined to be 4 nM.

Compound of formula S II was tested in a range of concentrations from 10to 10M using the conditions described above. Following incubation plates were harvested with GF B filters on the Unifilter 96 Harvester PerkinElmer and washed three times with ice cold buffer B 60 mM Tris pH 7.2 . The filter plates were dried at RT then 36 l Microscint O cocktail was added to each well and sealed with TopSeal A.

Male Sprague Dawley rats weighing approximately 200 g were purchased from Harlan Bioproducts for Science Indianapolis Ind. . The animals were maintained on a 12 h light dark cycle with food 7012C LM 485 Mouse Rat Sterilizable Diet Harlan Teklad Madison Wis. and water available ad libitum. The animal protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Tennessee. The anabolic and androgenic activity of the compound of formula S II was studied in intact animals acutely orchidectomized ORX animals and chronically 9 days ORX rats.

The test article for this study was weighed and dissolved in 10 DMSO Fisher diluted with PEG 300 Acros Organics N.J. for preparation of the appropriate dosage concentrations. The animals were housed in groups of 2 to 3 animals per cage. Animals were randomly assigned to one of seven groups consisting of 4 to 5 animals per group. Control groups intact and ORX were administered vehicle daily. Compound of formula S II was administered via oral gavage at doses of 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1 mg day to both intact and ORX groups. Where appropriate animals were castrated on day one of the study. Treatment with compound of formula S II began nine days post ORX and was administered daily via oral gavage for fourteen days.

The animals were sacrificed under anesthesia ketamine xyalzine 87 13 mg kg and body weights were recorded. In addition ventral prostate seminal vesicles and levator ani muscle were removed individually weighed normalized to body weight and expressed as a percentage of intact control. Student s T test was used to compare individual dose groups to the intact control group. Significance was defined a priori as a P value

A series of dose response studies in intact and castrated rats in order to evaluate the potency and efficacy of compound of formula S II in both androgenic prostate and seminal vesicles and anabolic levator ani muscle tissue was conducted. In intact animals compound of formula S II treatment resulted in decreases in the weight of both prostate and seminal vesicles while the levator ani muscle weight was significantly increased. Levator ani muscle weight following compound of formula S II treatment were 100 10 98 7 110 5 110 5 125 10 and 129 10 of intact controls following doses of 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1 mg day respectively. The prostate weights were 117 20 98 15 82 20 62 5 107 30 and 110 14 of intact controls following doses of 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1 mg day respectively. These results are significant since current androgen therapies are contraindicated in some patient populations due to the proliferative androgenic effects in prostate and breast tissues. However many patients in these populations could benefit from the anabolic actions of androgens in muscle and bone. Since compound of formula S II exhibited tissue selective anabolic effects it may be possible to treat patient groups in which androgens were contraindicated in the past.

In castrated ORX animals prostate weights following compound of formula S II treatment were 10 3 12 3 26 7 39 6 60 14 88 16 and 123 22 of intact controls following doses of 0 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1 mg day respectively . Similarly seminal vesicle weights were 11 1 11 1 11 1 27 14 58 18 86 12 and 100 8 of intact controls following doses of 0 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1 mg day respectively . Significant increases were seen in levator ani muscle weights in all dose groups when compared to intact controls. The levator ani muscle weights were 48 8 50 5 62 6 89 10 118 6 134 8 and 129 14 of intact controls corresponding to 0 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1.0 mg day dose groups respectively .

Testosterone propionate TP and S 3 4 acetylaminophenoxy 2 hydroxy 2 methyl N 4 nitro 3 trifluoromethylphenyl propionamide S 4 maximally stimulated the levator ani muscle weight to 104 and 101 respectively. These data show that compound of formula S II exhibited significantly greater efficacy and potency than either TP or S 4. As a whole these data show that compound of formula S II is able to stimulate muscle growth in the presence or absence of testosterone while exerting anti proliferative effects on the prostate. These data show that that compound of formula S II restores lost muscle mass in patients with sarcopenia or cachexia. Additionally the antiproliferative effects of compound of formula S II on the prostate may allow some patient populations in which androgens are currently contraindicated access to anabolic agents.

Compound of formula S II exhibited anabolic muscle prostate ratio in castrated rats of 4.10 2.39 2.28 1.97 1.53 1.05 following doses of 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1 mg day respectively.

Pharmacology results following 1 mg day of compound of formula S II exhibited that prostate weight was 110 14 of intact control and levator ani muscle weight was 129 10 of intact control. Compound of formula S II maintained prostate weight following orchidectomy at 123 22 of intact controls and levator ani muscle weight at 129 14 of intact controls. A range of between 0.1 mg day to 0.3 mg day of compound of formula S II restored 100 of levator ani muscle weight while between 39 to 60 prostate weight was restored.

The in vivo pharmacological activity of each synthetic AR ligand listed in Table 4 below was examined in five male Sprague Dawley rats weighing approximately 200 g. Animals were castrated via a scrotal incision under anesthesia 24 h before drug treatments and received daily sc injections of the compound of interest at a dose rate of 1 mg d for 14 d. All compounds of interest were freshly dissolved in vehicle containing dimethylsulfoxide 5 vol vol in polyethylene glycol 300 before dose administration. An additional two groups of animals with or without castration received vehicle only and served as castrated or intact control groups respectively. Animals were killed at the end of the treatment. Plasma samples were collected and stored at 80 C. for future use. The ventral prostate seminal vesicles and levator ani muscle were removed cleared of extraneous tissue and weighed. All organ weights were normalized to body weight and compared. The weights of prostate and seminal vesicles were used to evaluate androgenic activity whereas the levator ani muscle weight was used as a measure of anabolic activity. Ventral prostate weights in SARM treated castrated rats were all except C 6 statistically lowered than intact control . Whereas levator ani weights in SARM castrated rats treated with C 3 C 6 C 8 C 10 C 11 or C 18 demonstrated support of muscle weight same as or in excess of intact control . Further S 1 C 1 C 4 C 22 and C 23 demonstrated levator ani agonism of 75 of intact control vs. 

The effects of SARM as represented by compound of formula S II on growth performance and carcass composition of finishing pigs was examined. Forty crossbred barrows TR4 C22 with an initial weight of 209.4 lb were used for this 28 d experiment. Pigs were blocked by weight and allotted to one of four treatments with ten replicate pens per treatment. Pigs were housed with one pig per pen in an environmentally controlled finishing barn with 4 ft 4 ft slatted pens.

All animals were fed a corn soybean meal diet with 1 corn oil. For the is treated groups appropriate quantities of a compound of formula S II referred to as SARM in the text and figures tables of this example were dissolved in 100 mL of polysorbate tween 80 and diluted with 20 lbs of corn oil prior to incorporation into the test diet. Final SARM concentrations were 1 3 and 10 ppm. All animals were fed their respective diets for the duration of the study. The test diets contained 1.07 TID lysine. Prior to being placed on study all pigs were fed a common corn soybean meal diet formulated to 0.75 TID lysine.

Pigs were allowed ad libitum access to feed and water. Pigs and feeders were weighed on day 7 14 21 and 28 to calculate average daily gain ADG average daily feed intake ADFI and feed to gain ratio F G or F G . Each pen served as an experimental unit for all statistical analysis.

Pigs were slaughtered at the Kansas State University Meats Laboratory at the end of the study for collection of individual carcass data. At 24 hours postmortem the right side of the carcass was frozen at 40 C. for approximately 1 h. After freezing sides were ground once through a grinder equipped with a 19 mm die then mixed and ground through a second grinder equipped with a 9.5 mm die. A sub sample of ground carcass was then chemically analyzed to determine percentages of crude protein moisture dry matter lipid and ash. Carcass measurements were done on the left side of the carcass and a sample of lean and fat was taken from the longissimus at approximately the 10rib.

The data were analyzed as a randomized complete block design. Analysis of variance was performed by using the MIXED procedure of SAS. Linear and quadratic contrasts were used to evaluate the effects of increasing the level of the SARM on growth and carcass performance.

Although there were few statistical differences observed in the measured parameters due to the small group sizes and individual housing of experimental animals we observed positive trends in several key parameters as shown in . Raw data are also summarized below. SARM increased average daily gain ADG over the course of the study decreased feed to gain ratio F G increased fat free lean gain per day and dramatically increased ADG for days 21 28 .

Further SARM treatment resulted in significantly increased Day 0 7 F G and decreased Day 8 14 average daily feed intake ADFI . Table 5 shows the weekly as well as the overall ADG ADFI and F G data from the study.

At the time of sacrifice a carcass composition analysis was performed. The data from this analysis are presented in Table 6. Trends towards increased lean mass and decreased fat were obeserved. SARM treated pigs showed a 7 to 10 decrease in first rib fat 3 to 8 decrease in last rib fat 2 to 11 decrease in last lumbar fat 6 to 14 decrease in 10rib fat and up to a 4 increase in loin eye area LEA . Treated animals also demonstrated up to a 2 improvement in lean percent and pounds of fat free lean. However due to the variability in this study none of these measurements reached significance.

The potential for using SARM compound of formula S II to improve finishing characteristics in food animals was demonstrated. Feeding the SARM greatly improved ADG and F G while reducing carcass crude fat. Some of the greatest improvements in these parameters were noted as the lowest dose 1 ppm . Lesser effects at high dose have been observed with other SARMs. Taken as a whole these data support that SARM treatment would improve carcass composition and growth performance which are key factors in the economics of swine production.

Further studies with lower doses larger group sizes and a direct comparison to ractopamine are conducted. As a direct competitor to ractopamine the SARM treated animals demonstrate the highest ADGs in the fourth week of treatment. By the fourth week of treatment with ractopamine the animals are desensitized to the beta agonist and the producers are seeing diminished returns in lean mass gain. Therefore longer treatment periods 28 days may be advantageous to the producers when feeding a SARM than when feeding ractopamine.

A series of dose response studies in intact and castrated rats in order to evaluate the potency and efficacy of compound of formula S XXIII in both androgenic prostate and seminal vesicles and anabolic levator ani muscle tissue was conducted. In intact animals compound of formula S XXIII treatment resulted in decreases in the weight of both prostate and seminal vesicles while the levator ani muscle weight was significantly increased. Levator ani muscle weight following compound of formula S XXIII treatment were 116 7 134 8 134 21 134 11 142 10 and 147 10 of intact controls following treatment with 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1.0 mg day dose groups respectively. The prostate weights were 98 21 99 8 85 18 98 22 126 17 and 126 17 of intact controls following treatment with 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1 mg day respectively. Similarly seminal vesicle weight was 115 12 109 17 106 13 121 11 157 5 and 136 3 of intact controls following treatment with 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1 mg day respectively. The results are graphically presented in . These results are significant since current androgen therapies are contraindicated in some patient populations due to the proliferative androgenic effects in prostate and breast tissues. However many patients in these populations could benefit from the anabolic actions of androgens in muscle and bone. Since compound of formula S XXIII exhibited tissue selective anabolic effects it may be possible to treat patient groups in which androgens were contraindicated in the past.

In castrated ORX animals prostate weights following compound of formula S XXIII treatment were 24 4 37 9 50 11 88 16 132 16 and 118 12 of intact controls following doses of 0 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1 mg day respectively. Similarly seminal vesicle weights were 15 2 25 9 67 20 113 6 155 16 and 160 7 of intact controls following doses of 0 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1 mg day respectively. Significant increases were seen in levator ani muscle weights of in all dose groups when compared to intact controls. The levator ani muscle weights were 71 4 101 15 125 20 126 14 151 9 and 143 17 of intact controls corresponding to 0 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1.0 mg day dose groups respectively. The results are graphically presented in .

One unexpected finding was that administration of only 0.03 mg day was able to fully restore levator ani muscle weight.

Comparable administration of testosterone propionate TP and S 3 4 acetylaminophenoxy 2 hydroxy 2 methyl N 4 nitro 3 trifluoromethylphenyl propionamide maximally stimulated the levator ani muscle weight to 104 and 101 respectively indicating the significantly enhanced efficacy and potency of compound of formula S XXIII. Taken together these data show that compound of formula S XXIII restores lost muscle mass which in some embodiments finds valuable application in patients with sarcopenia or cachexia or other wasting diseases or disorders. Additionally the antiproliferative effects of compound of formula S XXIII on the prostate may allow some patient populations in which androgens are currently contraindicated access to anabolic agents. Emax values were obtained and were 147 10 188 135 and 147 10 for prostate seminal vesicles and levator ani respectively. The EDin prostate seminal vesicles and levator ani was 0.21 0.04 0.2 0.04 and 0.03 0.01 mg day respectively. These results are graphically depicted in .

A series of dose response studies in intact and castrated rats in order to evaluate the potency and efficacy of compound of formula S XXIV in both androgenic prostate and seminal vesicles and anabolic levator ani muscle tissue was conducted. In intact animals compound of formula S XXIV treatment resulted in decreases in the weight of both prostate and seminal vesicles while the levator ani muscle weight was significantly increased. Levator ani muscle weight following compound of formula S XXIV treatment were 107 5 103 7 97 7 103 5 118 7 and 118 7 of intact controls following doses of 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1 mg day respectively. The prostate weights were 103 10 99 10 58 10 58 15 65 20 and 77 23 of intact controls following doses of 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1 mg day respectively. These results are significant since current androgen therapies are contraindicated in some patient populations due to the proliferative androgenic effects in prostate and breast tissues. However many patients in these populations could benefit from the anabolic actions of androgens in muscle and bone. Since compound of formula S XXIV exhibited tissue selective anabolic effects it may be possible to treat patient groups in which androgens were contraindicated in the past.

In castrated ORX animals prostate weights following compound of formula S XXIV treatment were 12 2 17 6 31 3 43 15 54 17 58 10 and 73 12 of intact controls following doses of 0 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1 mg day respectively . Similarly seminal vesicle weights were 10 2 10 3 13 4 21 6 43 8 51 9 and 69 14 of intact controls following doses of 0 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1 mg day respectively . Significant increases were seen in levator ani muscle weights of in all dose groups when compared to intact controls. The levator ani muscle weights were 40 5 52 8 67 9 98 10 103 12 105 12 and 110 17 of intact controls corresponding to 0 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1.0 mg day dose groups respectively .

Testosterone propionate TP and S 3 4 acetylaminophenoxy 2 hydroxy 2 methyl N 4 nitro 3 trifluoromethylphenyl propionamide S 4 maximally stimulated the levator ani muscle weight to 104 and 101 respectively. These data show that compound of formula S XXIV exhibited significantly greater efficacy and potency than either TP or S 4. As a whole these data show that compound of formula S XXIV is able to stimulate muscle growth in the presence or absence of testosterone while exerting anti proliferative effects on the prostate. These data show that the compound of formula S XXIV restores lost muscle mass in patients with sarcopenia or cachexia. Additionally the antiproliferative effects of the compound of formula S XXIV on the prostate may allow some patient populations in which androgens are currently contraindicated access to anabolic agents.

Anabolic ratios were derived comparing muscle prostate weight in castrated rats. Values obtained were 3.02 2.13 2.27 1.90 1.83 and 1.51 following doses of 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1 mg day respectively.

Animals receiving 1 mg day of compound of formula S XXIV exhibited a prostate weight of 77 23 and levator ani muscle weight of 118 7 of intact control values respectively. Compound of formula S XXIV maintained prostate weight following orchidectomy at 73 12 of intact controls and levator ani muscle weight at 110 17 of intact controls. A derived dose of 0.1 mg day of compound of formula S XXIV would restore levator ani muscle weight to 100 while such dose would only restore 43 15 prostate weight.

The levator ani muscle weights were 120 12 116 7 128 7 134 7 125 9 and 146 17 of intact controls corresponding to 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1.0 mg day dose groups respectively.

Compound of formula S XXV partially maintained prostate weight following orchidectomy. Prostate weight in vehicle treated ORX controls decreased to 5 1 of intact controls. At doses of 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1.0 mg day compound of formula S XXV maintained prostate weights at 8 2 20 5 51 19 56 9 80 28 and 74 12.5 of intact controls respectively. In castrated controls seminal vesicle weight decreased to 13 2 of intact controls. Compound of formula S XXV partially maintained seminal vesicle weights in ORX animals. Seminal vesicle weights from drug treated animals were 12 4 17 5 35 10 61 15 70 14 and 80 6 of intact controls following doses of 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1.0 mg day respectively. In ORX controls the levator ani muscle weight decreased to 55 7 of intact controls. We observed an anabolic effect in the levator ani muscle of compound of formula S XXV treated animals. Compound of formula S XXV fully maintained levator ani muscle weights at doses 0.1 mg day. Doses 0.1 mg day resulted in significant increases in levator ani weight compared to that observed in intact controls. Levator ani muscle weights as a percentage of intact controls were 59 6 85 9 112 10 122 16 127 12 and 129.66 2 for the 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1.0 mg day dose groups respectively. Eand EDvalues were determined in each tissue by nonlinear regression analysis in WinNonlin and presented in . Evalues were 83 25 85 11 and 131 2 for prostate seminal vesicles and levator ani respectively. The EDin prostate seminal vesicles and levator ani was 0.09 0.07 0.17 0.05 and 0.02 0.01 mg day respectively.
