Governmental Interest The invention described herein may be manufactured to used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government.

Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to methods of self assembly and apparatus for accomplishing the same.

Self assembly is a promising technique to overcome limitations for example with integrating packaging and or handling individual electronic components that have critical dimensions of about 300 microns or below. Methods of self assembly may include gravitational capillary or magnetic forces each of which has limitations related to assembling one or more electronic components on a substrate for example such as aligning one or more electronic components with a binding site on the substrate.

Embodiments of the present invention include methods and apparatus for self assembling a part on a substrate. In some embodiments a method of self assembling a part on a substrate includes placing a substrate into a first fluid the substrate including a first binding site capable of generating a first electromagnetic field and having a first shaped surface with a first droplet conformably disposed on the first shaped surface wherein the first droplet is immiscible in the first fluid placing a part into the first fluid the part having a second binding site capable of generating a second electromagnetic field and having a second shaped surface with a second droplet conformably disposed on the second shaped surface wherein the second droplet is immiscible in the first fluid and attracting the part towards the first binding site using the first and second electromagnetic fields such that the first and second droplets solubilize with each other forming an equilibrium between an attractive force between the first and second electromagnetic fields and a repulsive force between the solubilized first and second droplets and the first fluid such that the part is free to rotate about the first binding site to minimize the repulsive force by minimizing an exposed surface area of the solubilized first and second droplets with respect to the first fluid when the first and second shaped surfaces rotate into an alignment causing the part to aligned with the first binding site.

In some embodiments an apparatus includes a substrate having a first binding site having a first shaped surface and a first electromagnetic field generating element and a part having a second binding opposing the first binding site wherein the second binding site has a second shaped surface and a second electromagnetic field generating element and wherein the first shaped surface is aligned with the second shaped surface.

Embodiments of the present invention comprise methods and apparatus for self assembling a part on a substrate. The inventive methods and apparatus advantageously facilitate the self assembly of the part onto the substrate such that the part and the substrate are aligned during the self assembly process.

The first binding site may include a first electromagnetic field generating element and a first layer . For example the first magnetic field generating element may include one or more of a polarized permanent magnet a hard magnet a polarized permanent electrostatic material an electrode providing an electro static field or an electromagnet. The first magnetic field generating element may be covered by the first layer for example to provide a surface suitable for attachment of a self assembled monolayer as described below. The first layer may be formed of one or more of gold Au copper Cu silicon dioxide SiO or the like. The first layer may include a first shaped surface where the first shaped surface may be utilized to promote alignment of the part with the substrate as discussed below. For example the first shaped surface may include any suitable shape not having the same radial distance in every direction from a central axis passing through the surface . For example as illustrated in one such suitable shape may include a triangle. For example an unsuitable shape may include a circle. The first shaped surface may include a self assembled monolayer or any suitable surface for making the first shaped surface one of hydrophobic or hydrophilic.

The part may comprise one or more of transistors optoelectronic devices sensors or other suitable devices or the like. The part may include a second binding site opposing the first binding site . The second binding site may include a second electromagnetic field generating element and a second layer . The second binding site may be substantially similar to the first binding site as described above. For example the second magnetic field generating element may include one or more of a polarized permanent magnet a hard magnet a polarized permanent electrostatic material or a material which is highly permeable to the electromagnetic field lines emanating from the first electromagnetic field generator such as permalloy nickel iron Ni Fe or the like. The second magnetic field generating element may be covered by the second layer for example to provide a surface suitable for attachment of a self assembled monolayer as described below. The second layer may be formed of one or more of gold Au copper Cu silicon dioxide SiO or the like. The second layer may include a second shaped surface where the second shaped surface may be utilized to promote alignment of the part with the substrate as discussed below. For example as discussed above with respect to the first shaped surface the second shaped surface may include any suitable shape not having the same radial distance in every direction from a central axis passing through the surface . For example as illustrated in one such suitable shape may include a triangle. For example an unsuitable shape may include a circle. The second shaped surface may include a self assembled monolayer or any suitable surface for making the second shaped surface one of hydrophobic or hydrophilic for use in the method as discussed below.

As illustrated in the first shaped surface may be aligned with the second shaped surface . For illustrative purposes the second shaped surface is drawn as slightly larger in area than the first shaped surface . However this is merely illustrative and in practice the first and second shaped surfaces may be the same or substantially the same in size and shape.

The article may include a plurality of electrical connections disposed about the first and second binding sites wherein each electrical connection provides an electrical pathway between the substrate and the part . For example each electrical connection may include a first metal layer contacting the substrate for example via the electrically conductive layer as shown or alternatively directly to the substrate not shown . Each electrical connection may include a second metal layer contacting the part and a solder layer disposed between the first and second metal layers . For example the first and second metal layers may be formed from one or more of gold Au copper Cu nickel Ni or other suitable conducting materials. For example the solder layer may be formed from one or more of tin lead Sn Pb tin bismuth Sn Bi tin Sn or other suitable solder materials.

The method begins at by placing the substrate in a first fluid . For example as illustrated in the substrate may include the electrically conductive layer the first binding site the plurality of first metal layers and the plurality of solder layers disposed thereon when the substrate is placed in the first fluid . For example the first fluid may include one or more of water HO ethylene glycol glycerol or the like. A first droplet of a second fluid may be conformably disposed on the first shaped surface . The second fluid may be immiscible in the first fluid . For example the second fluid may be for example one or more of hexane CH hexadecane CH or any suitable fluid which is immiscible in water. In some embodiments the first droplet may be formed on a self assembled monolayer included on the first shaped surface or on any suitable surface which permits the second fluid to wet the first shaped surface to form the first droplet .

In some embodiments to form the first droplet the substrate may be placed into the second fluid prior to placing the substrate into the first fluid . For example the second fluid may wet the first shaped surface while not wetting other surfaces of the substrate . Alternatively the second fluid may be disposed above the first fluid and the substrate may passed through the second fluid to enter the first fluid as illustrated in . Further an exemplary self assembled monolayer is illustrated in . For example as shown the self assembled monolayer may be disposed on the first shaped surface and may comprise a plurality of molecules each molecule may include a hydrophobic group that contacts the second fluid . Alternatively depending on the identity of the first and second fluids a hydrophilic group may be used.

At the part may be placed into the first fluid as illustrated in . For example the part may include the second binding site and the plurality of second metal layers as illustrated in . The part may include a second droplet conformably disposed on the second shaped surface wherein the second droplet is immiscible in the first fluid . For example the second droplet may be formed from one or more of the second fluids as discussed above with respect to the first droplet . The first droplet and the second droplet may be made from the same fluid or from different fluids. Similar to embodiments discussed above at the part may be placed into the second fluid prior to the placing the part in the first fluid to wet the second shaped surface of the second binding site to form the second droplet on the second shaped surface . Alternatively the second fluid may be disposed above the first fluid and the part may be passed through the second fluid prior to enter the first fluid similar to embodiments discussed above at and illustrated in . Embodiments of a self assembled monolayer discussed above at such as the exemplary self assembled monolayer may be applied to the second shaped surface and used to wet the second shaped surface to form the second droplet .

At the part may be attracted towards the first binding site as illustrated in C D. For example the first and second electromagnetic field generating elements may be used to attract the part to the substrate such that the first and second droplets solubilize with each other as illustrated in . For example as the first and second droplets solubilize an equilibrium may be formed between an attractive force resulting from the first and second electromagnetic field generating elements and a repulsive force between the solubilized first and second droplets and the first fluid such that the part is free to rotate about the first binding site as shown in . For example the solubilized first and second droplets may act as a lubricant to aid rotation and prevent the part from getting stuck in a misaligned orientation. The repulsive force may be minimized by minimizing an exposed surface area of the solubilized first and second droplets with respect to the first fluid . The minimization of the repulsive force may occur when the first and second shaped surfaces rotate into an alignment such as an alignment as illustrated in causing the part to aligned with the first binding site . For example the part may be considered is aligned when the plurality second metal layers disposed on the part are aligned with the corresponding plurality of solder layers disposed on the substrate . Further the shape of the first and second shaped surfaces may be selected such that only by their alignment may the repulsive force be minimized. In some embodiments the first droplet may also preferentially wet the surface resulting in the same combined droplet depicted in and leading to the same functions described above.

Once the part is aligned with the substrate the part may be contacted with the substrate such that the plurality of first metal layers contact the corresponding plurality of solder layers . For example to contact the part with the substrate the solubilized first and second droplets may be removed such that the attractive force between the first and second electromagnetic field generating elements pulls the first metal layers and corresponding solder layers together.

In some embodiments the solubilized first and second droplets may be removed by adding a third fluid not shown to the first fluid where the third fluid may be soluble in both the first and second fluids. Exemplary third fluids may include one or more of ethanol CHCHOH acetone CH CO . methanol CHOH or the like. For example the third fluid may dissolve the solubilized first and second droplets as illustrated in such that the plurality of first metal layers contact the corresponding plurality of solder layers . Once the part is aligned with the substrate and the solubilized first and second droplets have been removed the solder layers may be heated to form the electrical connections . For example the substrate and part may be globally heated or the solder layers may be locally heated. In some embodiments the substrate including the aligned part may be removed from the first fluid . In some embodiments the substrate and part may be removed for example such that higher temperatures than the boiling point of the first fluid may be used to melt the solder layers . The substrate may be heated to melt the solder layers such that the electrical connections are formed. For example the substrate and part may be heated under an inert atmosphere or the like to melt the solder layers . Alternatively the first fluid may be exchanged with a fourth fluid having a higher boiling point than the first fluid . Exemplary fourth fluids may include glycerol ethylene glycol ionic liquids or the like. The substrate may be heated in the fourth fluid to melt the solder layers to form the electrical connections .

While the foregoing is directed to embodiments of the present invention other and further embodiments of the invention may be devised without departing from the basic scope thereof.
