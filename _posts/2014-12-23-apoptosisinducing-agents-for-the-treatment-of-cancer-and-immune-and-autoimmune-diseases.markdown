This invention pertains to compounds which inhibit the activity of Bcl 2 anti apoptotic proteins compositions containing the compounds and methods of treating diseases during which anti apoptotic Bcl 2 proteins are expressed.

Anti apoptotic Bcl 2 proteins are associated with a number of diseases. There is therefore an existing need in the therapeutic arts for compounds which inhibit the activity of anti apoptotic Bcl 2 proteins.

Overexpression of Bcl 2 proteins correlates with resistance to chemotherapy clinical outcome disease progression overall prognosis or a combination thereof in various cancers and disorders of the immune system.

Involvement of Bcl 2 proteins in bladder cancer brain cancer breast cancer bone marrow cancer cervical cancer chronic lymphocytic leukemia colorectal cancer esophageal cancer hepatocellular cancer lymphoblastic leukemia follicular lymphoma lymphoid malignancies of 1 cell or B cell origin melanoma myelogenous leukemia myeloma oral cancer ovarian cancer non small cell lung cancer prostate cancer small cell lung cancer spleen cancer and the like is described in commonly owned PCT US 2004 36770 published as WO 2005 049593 and PCT US 2004 37911 published as WO 2005 024636.

Involvement of Bcl 2 proteins in immune and autoimmune diseases is described in 2003 3 378 3842000 110 3 584 902000 95 4 1283 92 and 2004 351 14 1409 1418. Involvement of Bcl 2 proteins in arthritis is disclosed in commonly owned U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60 988 479. Involvement of Bcl 2 proteins in bone marrow transplant rejection is disclosed in commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 941 196.

Geometric isomers may exist in the present compounds. Compounds of this invention may contain carbon carbon double bonds or carbon nitrogen double bonds in the E or Z configuration wherein the term E represents higher order substituents on opposite sides of the carbon carbon or carbon nitrogen double bond and the term Z represents higher order substituents on the same side of the carbon carbon or carbon nitrogen double bond as determined by the Cahn Ingold Prelog Priority Rules. The compounds of this invention may also exist as a mixture of E and Z isomers. Substituents around a cycloalkyl or heterocycloalkyl are designated as being of cis or trans configuration. Furthermore the invention contemplates the various isomers and mixtures thereof resulting from the disposal of substituents around an adamantane ring system. Two substituents around a single ring within an adamantane ring system are designated as being of Z or E relative configuration. For examples see C. D. Jones M. Kaselj R. N. Salvatore W. J. le Noble 1998 63 2758 2760 and E. L. Eliel and S. H. Wilen. 1994 . New York N.Y. John Wiley Sons Inc.

Compounds of this invention may contain asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms in the R or S configuration in which the terms R and S are as defined by the IUPAC 1974 Recommendations for Section E Fundamental Stereochemistry Pure Appl. Chem. 1976 45 13 10. Compounds having asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms with equal amounts of R and S configurations are racemic at those carbon atoms. Atoms with an excess of one configuration over the other are assigned the configuration present in the higher amount preferably an excess of about 85 90 more preferably an excess of about 95 99 and still more preferably an excess greater than about 99 . Accordingly this invention includes racemic mixtures relative and absolute stereoisomers and mixtures of relative and absolute stereoisomers.

Compounds of this invention containing NH C O OH OH or SH moieties may have attached thereto prodrug forming moieties. The prodrug forming moieties are removed by metabolic processes and release the compounds having the freed hydroxyl amino or carboxylic acid in vivo. Prodrugs are useful for adjusting such pharmacokinetic properties of the compounds as solubility and or hydrophobicity absorption in the gastrointestinal tract bioavailability tissue penetration and rate of clearance. An example of a compound with a prodrug forming moiety is 3 chloro 5 5 4 2 4 chlorophenyl 4 4 dimethylcyclohex 1 en 1 yl methylpiperazin 1 yl 2 3 nitro 4 tetrahydro 2H pyran 4 ylmethyl amino phenylsulfonyl amino carbonylphenoxy 2 iminopyridin 1 2H yl methyl dihydrogen phosphate EXAMPLE 397 which is a prodrug of 2 6 amino 5 chloropyridin 3 yl oxy 4 4 2 4 chlorophenyl 4 4 dimethylcyclohex 1 en 1 yl methylpiperazin 1 yl N 3 nitro 4 tetrahydro 2H pyran 4 ylmethyl amino phenylsulfonyl benzamide EXAMPLE 318 .

Compounds of the invention can exist in isotope labeled or enriched form containing one or more atoms having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number most abundantly found in nature. Isotopes can be radioactive or non radioactive isotopes. Isotopes of atoms such as hydrogen carbon phosphorous sulfur fluorine chlorine and iodine include but are not limited to H H C C N O P S F Cl and I. Compounds that contain other isotopes of these and or other atoms are within the scope of this invention.

In another embodiment the isotope labeled compounds contain deuterium H tritium H or C isotopes. Isotope labeled compounds of this invention can be prepared by the general methods well known to persons having ordinary skill in the art. Such isotope labeled compounds can be conveniently prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Examples disclosed herein and Schemes by substituting a readily available isotope labeled reagent for a non labeled reagent. In some instances compounds may be treated with isotope labeled reagents to exchange a normal atom with its isotope for example hydrogen for deuterium can be exchanged by the action of a deuteric acid such as DSO DO. In addition to the above relevant procedures and intermediates are disclosed for instance in Lizondo J et al. 21 11 1116 1996 Brickner S J et al. 39 3 673 1996 Mallesham B et al. 5 7 963 2003 PCT publications WO1997010223 WO2005099353 WO 1995007271 WO2006008754 U.S. Pat.

The isotope labeled compounds of the invention may be used as standards to determine the effectiveness of Bcl 2 inhibitors in binding assays. Isotope containing compounds have been used in pharmaceutical research to investigate the in vivo metabolic fate of the compounds by evaluation of the mechanism of action and metabolic pathway of the nonisotope labeled parent compound Blake et al. 64 3 367 391 1975 . Such metabolic studies are important in the design of safe effective therapeutic drugs either because the in vivo active compound administered to the patient or because the metabolites produced from the parent compound prove to be toxic or carcinogenic Foster et al. Advances in Drug Research Vol. 14 pp. 2 36 Academic press London 1985 Kato et al. J. 36 10 927 932 1995 Kushner et al. 77 79 88 1999 .

In addition non radio active isotope containing drugs such as deuterated drugs called heavy drugs can be used for the treatment of diseases and conditions related to Bcl 2 activity. Increasing the amount of an isotope present in a compound above its natural abundance is called enrichment. Examples of the amount of enrichment include from about 0.5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 16 21 25 29 33 37 42 46 50 54 58 63 67 71 75 79 84 88 92 96 to about 100 mol . Replacement of up to about 15 of normal atom with a heavy isotope has been effected and maintained for a period of days to weeks in mammals including rodents and dogs with minimal observed adverse effects Czajka D M and Finkel A J Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1960 84 770 Thomson J F Ann. New York Acad. Sci 1960 84 736 Czakja D M et al. Am. J. Physiol. 1961 201 357 . Acute replacement of as high as 15 23 in human fluids with deuterium was found not to cause toxicity Blagojevic N et al. in Dosimetry Treatment Planning for Neutron Capture Therapy Zamenhof R Solares G and Harling O Eds. 1994.

Stable isotope labeling of a drug can alter its physico chemical properties such as pKa and lipid solubility. These effects and alterations can affect the pharmacodynamic response of the drug molecule if the isotopic substitution affects a region involved in a ligand receptor interaction. While some of the physical properties of a stable isotope labeled molecule are different from those of the unlabeled one the chemical and biological properties are the same with one important exception because of the increased mass of the heavy isotope any bond involving the heavy isotope and another atom will be stronger than the same bond between the light isotope and that atom. Accordingly the incorporation of an isotope at a site of metabolism or enzymatic transformation will slow said reactions potentially altering the pharmcokinetic profile or efficacy relative to the non isotopic compound.

Prodrugs are derivatives of an active drug designed to ameliorate some identified undesirable physical or biological property. The physical properties are usually solubility too much or not enough lipid or aqueous solubility or stability related while problematic biological properties include too rapid metabolism or poor bioavailability which itself may be related to a physicochemical property.

Prodrugs are usually prepared by a formation of ester hemi esters carbonate esters nitrate esters amides hydroxamic acids carbamates imines Mannich bases phosphates phosphate esters and enamines of the active drug b functionalizing the drug with azo glycoside peptide and ether functional groups c use of aminals hemi aminals polymers salts complexes phosphoramides acetals hemiacetals and ketal forms of the drug. For example see Andrejus Korolkovas s Essentials of Medicinal Chemistry John Wiley Interscience Publications John Wiley and Sons New York 1988 pp. 97 118 which is incorporated in its entirety by reference herein.

Esters can be prepared from substrates of formula I containing either a hydroxyl group or a carboxy group by general methods known to persons skilled in the art. The typical reactions of these compounds are substitutions replacing one of the heteroatoms by another atom for example 

Amides can be prepared from substrates of formula I containing either an amino group or a carboxy group in similar fashion. Esters can also react with amines or ammonia to form amides.

Another way to make amides from compounds of formula I is to heat carboxylic acids and amines together.

Suitable groups for A B D E Y L Z Z Z Z and Zin compounds of Formula I are independently selected. The described embodiments of the present invention may be combined. Such combination is contemplated and within the scope of the present invention. For example it is contemplated that embodiments for any of A B D E Y L Z Z Z Z and Zcan be combined with embodiments defined for any other of A B D E Y L Z Z Z Z and Z.

One embodiment of this invention therefore pertains to compounds or therapeutically acceptable salts prodrugs or salts of prodrugs thereof which are useful as inhibitors of anti apoptotic Bcl 2 proteins the compounds having Formula I

BiTE antibodies are bi specific antibodies that direct T cells to attack cancer cells by simultaneously binding the two cells. The T cell then attacks the target cancer cell. Examples of BiTE antibodies include adecatumumab Micromet MT201 blinatumomab Micromet MT103 and the like. Without being limited by theory one of the mechanisms by which T cells elicit apoptosis of the target cancer cell is by exocytosis of cytolytic granule components which include perforin and granzyme B. In this regard Bcl 2 has been shown to attenuate the induction of apoptosis by both perforin and granzyme B. These data suggest that inhibition of Bcl 2 could enhance the cytotoxic effects elicited by T cells when targeted to cancer cells V. R. Sutton D. L. Vaux and J. A. Trapani 1997 158 12 5783 .

SiRNAs are molecules having endogenous RNA bases or chemically modified nucleotides.

Examples of chemical modifications include phosphorothioate groups 2 deoxynucleotide 2 OCH containing ribonucleotides 2 F ribonucleotides 2 methoxyethyl ribonucleotides combinations thereof and the like. The siRNA can have varying lengths e.g. 10 200 bps and structures e.g. hairpins single double strands bulges nicks gaps mismatches and are processed in cells to provide active gene silencing. A double stranded siRNA dsRNA can have the same number of nucleotides on each strand blunt ends or asymmetric ends overhangs . The overhang of 1 2 nucleotides can be present on the sense and or the antisense strand as well as present on the 5 and or the 3 ends of a given strand. For example siRNAs targeting Mcl 1 have been shown to enhance the activity of ABT 263 i.e. N 4 4 2 4 chlorophenyl 5 5 dimethyl 1 cyclohex 1 en 1 yl methyl piperazin 1 yl benzoyl 4 1R 3 morpholin 4 yl 1 phenylsulfanyl methyl propyl amino 3 trifluoromethyl sulfonyl benzenesulfonamide or ABT 737 i.e. N 4 4 4 chloro 1 1 biphenyl 2 yl methyl piperazin 1 yl benzoyl 4 1R 3 dimethylamino 1 phenylsulfanyl methyl propyl amino 3 nitrobenzenesulfonamide in multiple tumor cell lines Tse et. al 2008 68 9 3421 and references therein .

Multivalent binding proteins are binding proteins comprising two or more antigen binding sites.

The term multispecific binding protein means a binding protein capable of binding two or more related or unrelated targets. Dual variable domain DVD binding proteins are tetravalent or multivalent binding proteins binding proteins comprising two or more antigen binding sites. Such DVDs may be monospecific i.e. capable of binding one antigen or multispecific i.e. capable of binding two or more antigens . DVD binding proteins comprising two heavy chain DVD polypeptides and two light chain DVD polypeptides are referred to as DVD Ig s. Each half of a DVD Ig comprises a heavy chain DVD polypeptide a light chain DVD polypeptide and two antigen binding sites. Each binding site comprises a heavy chain variable domain and a light chain variable domain with a total of 6 CDRs involved in antigen binding per antigen binding site. Multispecific DVDs include DVD binding proteins that bind DLL4 and VEGF or C met and EFGR or ErbB3 and EGFR.
