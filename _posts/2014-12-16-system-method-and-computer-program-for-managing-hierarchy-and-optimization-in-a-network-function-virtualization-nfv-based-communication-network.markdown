This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 918 597 filed Dec. 19 2013 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 941 380 filed Feb. 18 2014 the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates to telecommunications and or data communications and more particularly to network function virtualization NFV of telecommunications networks.

Network Function Virtualization is a term or a name of a proposed architecture of telecom services as published by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute ETSI in a series of documents available from the ETSI website. NFV uses generic hardware platform and software adapted for the generic hardware platform. Thus NFV creates a network much more flexible and dynamic than a legacy communication network. In NFV based networks a Virtual Network Function VNF decouples the software implementation of the network function from the infrastructure resources it runs on by virtualization. A network service is based on one or more VNFs and or Physical Network Functions PNFs their interconnections and chaining definitions. The VNFs can be executed on almost any generic hardware processing facility. Therefore VNFs may be installed removed and moved between hardware facilities much more easily less costly and thus more frequently. The flexibility of the NFV based network enhances the means available for optimizing the network s capacity and performance.

Very generally speaking optimizing a communication network is based on two main considerations. First the service should be provided closest to the subscriber to reduce long haul traffic. Second processing storage and similar resources should be centralized to enable efficient usage and distribution among subscribers.

These considerations are obviously contradictory and optimization means balancing between them. The balance is based on the cost and the profit associated with each of the considerations. The cost and the profit are varying continuously and may be different for different services and for different customers. It is noted that there are further considerations associated with particular services. This makes the optimization of the NFV based network a complex and perpetual task.

Unlike a legacy network the NFV based network has two topologies the topology of the hardware devices and the topology of the VNFs the distribution of VNFs among the hardware devices . Another benefit of the NFV based network is that modifying the software topology the distribution of VNFs among the hardware devices is much less costly than any modification of the hardware topology. However any modification of the network has its cost including the cost of making such modification possible such as maintaining excess resources of intermediating operations and session continuity . It is also noted that NFV based network enables flexibility of the fail safe network design and reducing the cost of providing redundancy.

In the context of the present description the terms network and communication network refer to the hardware and software connecting one or more communication elements including wireline networks wireless networks and or combinations thereof.

The terms network function virtualization NFV and virtual network function NFV are described in a series of documents published by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute ETSI and available from the ETSI website. The term virtual network function or feature VNF refers to a particular implementation of a function a feature or a service provided by the network internally within the network or externally to a customer subscriber end user a terminal or a server. A VNF may include the software program implementation of the function or feature or service. The term VNF instance VNF I refers to a particular process or task executing the VNF program by a particular virtual machine or processor or computing facility and or used by a particular customer or subscriber end user terminal or server etc. .

The term service refers to any type of use such as a use case that an NFV based communication network may offer or provide to one or more communication elements. A service may include switching data or content between any number of elements providing content from a server to a communication element or between servers securing and protecting communication and content processing content provided by the customer or by a third party providing backup and redundancy etc. A service may be using partial functionality of a VNF or may include one or more VNFs and or one or more VNF instances forming a service sub network or interconnection model . In the context of the present description the term chain may refer to such service sub network such as a particular plurality of VNFs and or VNF instances associated with a particular service type or a service instance.

The term deployment when referring to hardware elements including processing elements memory elements storage elements connectivity communication elements etc. refer to the configuration or topology of these hardware elements creating the NFV based network. The term deployment when referring to software elements such a VNFs and VNF instances refers to the association between such software elements and hardware elements.

The term deployment optimizations refers to association of software and hardware elements in a manner that satisfies a particular set of requirements and or rules such as load related and performance related requirements or a manner that makes a better use of a particular hardware deployment such as by reducing operational cost.

The terms service deployment optimization or service optimization or chain optimization refer to optimizing the deployment of a service chain i.e. optimizing the deployment of one or more VNF instances making a particular service. The terms chain optimization and service optimization may thus be used interchangeably.

The term session refers to a communication connection between two or more entities that persists for a period of time during which data may be exchanged there between. A session may be implemented and managed by a session layer in the corresponding network protocol. The term session may include a network session and a logical session. The network session may be associated with the devices used to communicate while the logical session may be associated with the communicating parties users and may persist regardless of the communication means that the parties are using.

The term service continuity includes and applies to the terms session continuity and streaming continuity . Streaming refers to streaming media session or service such as sound including voice video multimedia animation etc. The term service usually applies to a group of VNFs or the functionality provided by the group of VNFs but may also apply to a single VNF or the functionality provided by the VNF . The term continuity indicates that the session or the service is not interrupted or that an interruption is short enough that a user is not aware of such interruption or that the interruption does not cause any loss of data or that the loss is handled in acceptable manner e.g. a few packets of speech lost but the conversation can continue etc. .

The term availability or service availability refers to a level of the service or a characteristic of the service in which the service provider should provide the service albeit possible hardware or software faults. For example the service provider may obligate to the customer to provide a particular level of processing power communication features such as bandwidth latency and jitter database consistency etc. Such level or characteristic of the service should be available to the customer even when a hardware component or a software component providing the service do not function properly. Providing availability may therefore require additional resources such as backup resources and or mirroring. Hence availability may also refer to the terms fault recovery and redundancy .

The term fault recovery refers to the process of recovering one or more of the network s services functions and features after a fault whether caused by a hardware malfunction a system crash a software bug or a security breech or fault. A hardware malfunction includes but is not limited to any type of inadequate performance associated with for example power supply processing units memory storage transmission line etc. The term fault recovery also applies to recovering the functionality of one or more VNFs or VNF instances with respect to any of the above. The terms security breech or security fault may be used interchangeably.

The term redundancy refers to any type of component of the network that is fully or partly duplicated provided in standby mode or otherwise available to replace another component of the network when that other component stops functioning properly or otherwise indicates some kind of fault. Redundancy may apply but is not limited to hardware software data and or content.

As an option the hardware unit may be implemented in the context of any of the devices of the NFV based network of and or and in any desired communication environment.

Each hardware unit or computing machine computing device computing related unit and or hardware component etc. including each communication link between such hardware units may be associated with one or more performance type and a respective performance rating or value where the hardware unit and or communication link is operative to provide the performance value.

It is appreciated that computer program may include any of the NFV management system the NFV O and or the deployment optimization module of .

In one embodiment the NFV management system may include an NFV O module . The NFV management system may include one or more NFV O modules . In various embodiments each of the NFV O modules may include orchestration and workflow management that is responsible for managing i.e. orchestrating and executing all NFV O processes including inbound and or outbound communication and interfaces.

The NFV management system may include a deployment optimization module that enables a user to devise automatic mechanisms for network optimizations. The deployment optimization module may operate these mechanisms automatically and continuously to optimize the distribution of VNFs and their VNF instances in real time or near real time by migrating VNFs and VNF instances e.g. VNF instances of etc. between hardware units e.g. hardware units of etc. .

The Network Function Virtualization NFV dissociates the network function from the network hardware by using generic processing devices such as hardware units and by implementing the network functions in software such as VNFs and their VNF instances of which can be executed by any generic processing device. Thus while a legacy network is established by placing dedicated hardware elements according to an optimized configuration the NFV based network is optimized by moving VNF instances between hardware units. As moving a piece of software from one processor to another is almost instantaneous optimization is a much more dynamic process in an NFV based network than in a legacy network. It is also noted that in many cases the software that is a VNF is already available in the target device and only needs activation as a VNF instance with the appropriate parameters.

The deployment optimization module is used to plan the deployment of VNFs and their VNF instances within a hardware unit of the NFV based communication network. Furthermore deployment optimization module is used to optimize the deployment of VNFs and their VNF instances. Even further the deployment optimization module is used to plan the hierarchical structure of VNFs and their VNF instances so that on the fly and or real time optimization is possible. The deployment plans and the ongoing optimizations and changes to the deployments plans are typically implemented by the orchestration and workflow management . However optionally the deployment optimization module may manage the deployment and activation of VNFs and VNF instances.

One aspect of the optimization process in an NFV based network is that it is based on real time needs rather than long term statistically anticipated needs. The only limitation on network reconfiguration in NFV based network is that it does not result in a deterioration of any of the current services. However in a situation of shortage in resources the optimization process may prioritize services according to agreed upon QoS quality of service and SLA service level agreement to determine particular limitations on particular services rendered to particular customers to preserve QoS and or SLA for other services or customers.

The deployment optimization module plans migration of services between hardware units VNFs and VNF instances in real time without affecting the availability of a service and while securing service and session continuity.

According to one embodiment optimizing the deployment of an NFV based a communication network is based on three main considerations. First the service should be provided closest to the subscriber to reduce long haul traffic. Second processing storage and similar resources should be centralized to enable efficient usage and distribution among subscribers. Third cost including cost of operation such as the cost of energy if different between sites and the cost of redeployment.

The first two considerations are obviously contradictory and optimization means balancing between them. The balance may be based on the cost and the profit associated with each of the considerations. The cost and the profit are varying continuously and may be different for different services and for different customers. It is noted that there are further considerations associated with particular services. This makes the optimization of the in NFV based network a complex and perpetual task.

Unlike a legacy network the NFV based network has two topologies the topology of the hardware devices and the topology of the VNFs the distribution of VNFs among the hardware devices . The topology of the hardware network is relatively stable while the VNF topology can be optimized in real time. Another benefit of the NFV based network is that modifying the software topology the distribution of VNFs among the hardware devices is much less costly than any modification of the hardware topology. However any modification of the network has its cost including the cost of making such modification possible such as maintaining excess resources of intermediating operations . It is also noted that NFV based network enables flexibility of the fail safe network design and reducing the cost of providing redundancy.

According to one embodiment the method of optimizing the distribution of VNFs comprises moving VNFs up and down the network hierarchy as well as sideways to make more efficient use of the hardware resources and or to reduce long haul traffic while maintaining the quality of the services provided QoS SLA and the network resilience.

The NFV management system may also include a chain optimization module . The chain optimization module may be a part of deployment optimization module and may enable a user to devise automatic mechanisms for optimizing the deployment of chains or groups of VNFs and VNF instances. A service provided by an NFV based network is typically made of a particular chain or group of particular VNFs and their respective VNF instances. The chain optimization module optimizes the deployment of chains or groups of services between hardware units according to the requirements and specifications associated with and or adapted to the particular service or chain or a group.

The chain optimization module may operate these mechanisms automatically and continuously to optimize in real time the operation of chains or groups of the VNFs and their VNF instances by re planning their distribution among hardware units and optionally also by migrating the VNFs and associated VNF instances between hardware units.

The NFV management system may also include a service fulfillment module that manages service and resource e.g. VNF instance lifecycle activities as part of the process and orchestration activities. This may include on boarding initiation e.g. instantiation installation and configuration scaling termination software update e.g. of a running VNF etc. test environment and or rollback procedure. Additionally the service fulfillment module may also provide decomposition of an order to multiple network services and the activation of such network service as a single VNF instance or as a chain of VNF instances.

Order decomposition includes translating business orders into a network oriented service implementation plan. For example a business order may be decomposed into a plurality of functions some of which may be provided by different software programs or modules e.g. such as various VNFs instantiated as a plurality of VNF instances across one or more data centers. Performing order decomposition the service fulfillment module may consult the deployment optimization module for the best deployment option to customer order in a given network and resource condition. Performing order decomposition the service fulfillment module may then initiate the service including all its components. Order decomposition may be performed in several locations across an NFV O hierarchy. For example initial decomposition may be performed in the root of the NFV O and then further decomposition may be performed in the relevant data centers.

In one embodiment an activation and provisioning module may provide the plan for activation and provisioning of the service to the orchestration and workflow management . The activation and provisioning module may also provide feedback on fulfillment status to an upper layer. This upper layer may include the business support services BSS .

The NFV management system may also include an assurance module and a service management module capable of gathering real time data on network elements status and creating a consolidated view of services and network health. The assurance module includes assurance functionality and may interact with the service management module to perform assurance related lifecycle management procedures. Lifecycle management can be also triggered by other modules policies manual intervention or from the VNFs themselves etc. The assurance module and the service management module may also trigger events associated with lifecycle management and faults. The assurance module and the service management module may monitor the health of the network and may execute fault recovery activities.

The assurance module and the service management module provide the ability to monitor services status and performance according to the required criteria. The assurance module and the service management module may also interact with the network infrastructure e.g. including computing storage and networking etc. to receive the required information analyze the information and act upon each incident according to the defined policy. The assurance module and the service management module are able to interact with analytics to enrich a policy assurance module. Interfaces may also be provided for implementation by an external system.

The NFV management system may also include a policy management module that enables a user to define and configure offline and or real time policy for controlling VNF and service related rules. The policy management module may contain the preconfigured policies and activities as well as selection rules for the NFV O process to determine the preferred policy or activity to be performed for a particular process event. The policy management may be multi layered including vendor policy service policy and operator policy etc. The policy mechanism may trigger the suitable policy layer vendor service operator .

The NFV management system may also include an administration module that provides an overall view of the network manual lifecycle management and intervention and manual system administration and configuration. The administration module may be operable to enable a user such as an administrator e.g. administrator of etc. to manage view and operate the NFV O system. The administration module may also provide a view of the network topology and services the ability to perform specific activities such as manual lifecycle management and changing service and connectivity configuration.

The NFV management system may also include an inventory management module that maintains a distributed view of deployed services and hardware resources. Inventory catalogues may reflect the current instantiation and allocation of the resources and services within the network mapped into products and or customer entities.

The NFV management system may also include a big data analytics module that analyzes network and service data to support network decisions involving services and subscribers to improve network performance based on actual usage patterns. The big data analytics module may also generate what if scenarios to support business oriented planning processes. Additionally the big data analytics module may function to analyze and evaluate the information for various planning aspects e.g. Virtual Network Capacity Planning Data Center Capacity Planning Value based planning Cost analysis for network deployment alternatives etc. deployment and management e.g. Guided Operator Recommendations. What if scenario analysis and simulation application rapid elasticity and resource usage optimization etc. and may support business oriented planning processes.

The NFV management system may also include a catalog module may include records defining various aspects of the network such as products services and resources such as hardware units and VNFs e.g. a VNF directory etc. . The catalog module may include a collection of centralized hierarchical information repositories containing resource service and product definitions with their relationship versioning and or descriptors etc. Such records may include templates enabling a user such as an administrator to define particular network components such as resources products services etc. A resource template may define resources descriptors attributes activities procedures and or connectivity etc. A service template may define a service variation from resource building blocks. A product template may define parameters of a sellable product e.g. prices rating etc. based on service composition e.g. in one embodiment this may be part of a BSS catalogue .

The inventory management module the big data analytics module and or the catalog module may support multiple data centers multiple CMSs and provide a centralized view across the infrastructure. The inventory management module the big data analytics module and or the catalog module may also support hybrid networks and services maintaining both physical and virtual resources.

The NFV management system may also include an accounting and licensing module that may be operable to record and manage network software usage data for commercial purposes including licensing accounting billing and reconciliation of services with subscribers and providers. The accounting and licensing module may manage licensing and usage of virtual network applications including the ability to support complex rating schemes based on various parameters such as CPU memory data etc. The accounting and licensing module may enable users to define the pricing of particular VNF modules and provide settlement with vendors. The accounting and licensing module may also enable the evaluation of internal costs of services provided within the network for calculating return on investment ROI .

The NFV management system may also include a fault recovery module otherwise named disaster recovery planning module or DRP etc. that enables a user to plan and manage disaster recovery procedures for the NFV O and or the entire network.

The NFV management system may also include a security management module that provides the authentication authorization and accounting services of application security across the network. The security management module may include for example an authentication module and function. In one embodiment the authentication module and function e.g. including identity management etc. may authenticate the identity of each user defined in the system. Each user may have a unique user identity and password. The system may support password based authentication with flexible password policy. Integration with external authentication providers may be done via additional system enhancements. The authorization module and function may support a role based access control RBAC mechanism where each user is assigned with one or more roles according to the business needs based on the least privileges concept e.g. standard or administrator roles . In one embodiment the accounting and licensing module may provide an audit of security events such as authentication or login events.

As an option the security management module may use rules to protect sensitive information. For example such rules may be used to ensure the data accessed is used for the specific purposes for which it was collected sensitive information is encrypted when in storage transit and masked truncated on display and logs and that the entire security system is deployed in the customer s intranet network i.e. behind network infrastructure measures in an independent domain etc.

In one embodiment the NFV management system may further include a Secure Development Life Cycle SDLC module that ensures that security aspects are handled during a project s life cycle such as security design security testing etc.

As shown further in the NFV management system may include a service planning module . The service planning module may be used by a communication service provider CSP sales representative enterprise and or technician as part of selling engagement process with enterprise SMB customers.

The service planning module may also provide the ability to interact with catalogues customer data network and ordering systems to provide online network service proposals for the enterprise customers with ability to quote update the proposal validate the serviceability and network inventory and once done provide the service order for activation using the northbound interface.

The NFV management system may also include east west APIs that include various domains activities interfaces including an information source to a big data repository and interaction capability with a physical network system OSS .

Northbound APIs provides application programming interfaces APIs to various external software packages such as business support system BSS for service order fulfillment cancel and update activities status notification resource inventory view monitoring system assurance system service planning tool administration tool for system view and configuration and big data repository etc.

Further the southbound APIs may provide APIs for external software packages such as CMS including service and VNFs lifecycle activities receiving from the infrastructure status and monitoring information for upstream system and activities e.g. assurance an SDN Controller or other connectivity system to configure inter and intra data center connectivity an EMS to configure the VNF and a VNF for a direct configuration.

As shown in the NFV based network may include hardware units connected via transmission lines and VNFs implemented as software programs installed in hardware units . Some of the hardware units may be directly connected to a customer. The customer may be a subscriber an end user or an organization represented herein as a terminal or a server or a plurality of terminals and or servers . The NFV based network may also include an NFV management system an NFV orchestration NFV O and a deployment optimization module which may all represent elements described in the context of the previous figures etc. .

As shown further in several typically different VNFs may be installed in the same hardware unit . Additionally the same VNF may be installed in different hardware units .

A VNF may be executed by a processor of the hardware unit in the form of a VNF instance . Therefore a particular VNF installed in a particular hardware unit may be incarnated in e.g. initiated executed as etc. any number of VNF instances . The VNF instances may be independent of each other. Additionally each VNF instance may serve different terminals and or servers . The NFV based network connects to and between communication terminal devices that may be operated by one or more customers subscribers and or end users.

It is appreciated that a network operator may manage one or more services deployed in the customer s premises. Therefore some of the hardware units may reside within the premises of the network operator while other hardware units may reside in the customer s premises. Similarly a server such as server computer of may reside in the premises of the network operator or in the customer s premises. Consequently when the network operator provides and or manages one or more services for a customer s terminal devices such as a server computer the NFV based network of the network operator may directly manage the VNFs providing the services and their VNF instances .

In such situation the NFV based network may manage the services irrespectively of the location of the terminal devices e.g. the server computer etc. whether in the premises of the network operator or in the customer s premises. In other words the NFV based network may be managing the VNFs and the VNF instances providing the services as well as the terminal devices e.g. the server computer etc. being co located within the same computing device e.g. the hardware unit etc. whether in the premises of the network operator or in the customer s premises or in a commercial cloud or any other place.

A service provided by the communication network may be implemented using one or more VNFs. For example the service may be a group or a chain of interconnected VNFs. The VNFs making the group or the service may be installed and executed by a single processor by several processors on the same rack within several racks in the same data center or by processors distributed within two or more data centers. In some cases chain optimization may be employed by optimizing the deployment of a service in a communication network using network function virtualization and to optimizing the deployment of a group or a chain of virtual network functions in the NFV based network . Therefore the term chain optimization refers to the planning and or managing of the deployment of VNFs making a chain or a group of VNFs providing a particular service.

For example shows a first service including the VNFs and their respective VNF instances and and a thick line. In this example the group or chain of the VNFs making first service are connected as a chain of VNFs . However the VNFs making a service may be connected in any conceivable form such as a star tree root tree branch mesh etc. including combinations thereof. It is noted that the VNFs may be executed by two or more VNF instances such as VNF .

The deployment of the group or chain of the VNFs making the first service is therefore limited by constraints such as the capacity of the communication link bandwidth and or latency delay .

A VNF may have a list of requirements or specifications such as processing power cash memory capacity regular memory capacity e.g. RAM dynamic or volatile memory etc. non volatile memory e.g. such as flash memory etc. capacity storage capacity power requirements cooling requirements etc. A particular VNF instance providing a particular function e.g. to a particular customer entity etc. may have further requirements or modified requirements for example associated with a particular quality of service QoS or service level agreement SLA . Such requirements may include maximum latency or delay average latency and maximum variance latency jitter maximal allowed packet loss etc. Other requirements may include service availability redundancy backup provisions for roll back and or recovery fault tolerance and or fail safe operation etc.

A service made of a chain or a group of VNFs and their VNF instances may have a similar list of requirements or specifications covering the service as a whole. Therefore such requirements or specifications may imply affect or include requirements or specifications regarding communication links between the VNFs and or the VNF instances . Such requirements or specifications may include bandwidth latency bit error rate and or packet loss etc. Such communication requirements or specifications may further impose deployment limitations or constraints requiring particular VNFs and or VNF instances to reside in the same data center or within the same rack or even in the same computing device for example sharing memory or being executed by the same processor. Security measures may add further requirements or specifications such as co location of some of the VNFs and or the VNF instances .

In the context of the NFV based network has a hierarchical structure. There may be at least four aspects of the hierarchical structure of the NFV based network . The networking or traffic aspect refers to the arrangement of the transmission lines between the hardware units . The processing aspect refers to the arrangement of the hardware units . The software aspect refers to the arrangement of the VNFs . The operational aspect refers to the arrangement of the VNF instances .

One aspect of the optimization process in an NFV based network is that it may be based on real time needs rather than long term statistically anticipated needs. One potential limitation on network reconfiguration in NFV based networks is that network configuration does not result in a deterioration beyond acceptable level of any of the current services. The NFV deployment module e.g. module of etc. may function to enable and manage migration of services between the hardware units the VNFs and the VNF instances in real time without affecting or with a minimal effect on the availability of a service and while securing service and session continuity.

In the context of the current description the term continuous means that the deployment optimization module and or a chain optimization module e.g. the chain optimization module of etc. performs the relevant optimization task or process in run time or real time or online or on the fly or repetitively and without adversely affecting the network s functionality and its services.

Unlike a legacy network the NFV based network may have two topologies the topology of the hardware devices and the topology of the VNFs the distribution of VNFs among the hardware devices . The topology of the hardware network is relatively stable while the VNF topology can be optimized in real time. Another benefit of the NFV based network is that modifying the software topology e.g. the distribution of VNFs among the hardware devices is much less costly than any modification of the hardware topology. However any modification of the network has its cost including the cost of making such modification possible. Added cost may result from the need to process the modification of the topology and the re distribution of VNF instances and to maintain excess resources for such purpose.

Thus in some cases it may be desired to localize the NFV O and particularly the deployment optimization processes associated with the deployment optimization module and the chain optimization module to reduce the cost and simultaneously to secure the possibility to expand the scope of the network managed by these processes if needed.

The distributed architecture of an NFV O enables faster response to local events on one hand and improved scalability on the other hand. In a distributed NFV O architecture decision processes are performed in self contained and local decision points closer to the customer and closer to the events e.g. such as network or security faults etc. .

The hierarchy of a distributed NFV O can be viewed as a tree of two component types a core component and a leaf component . The NFV O core component can be a child of another core component and or a parent of one or more core components or leaf components . A leaf component cannot be a parent of a core component or a leaf component .

Orchestration parameters managed by a particular leaf component or core component may be reported in real time to the supervising parent core component . In addition to the supervision this continuous updating process enables the supervising component to provide backup and or support recovery processes associated with hardware and or software faults as well as security faults and or breeches.

To provide redundancy a leaf component may be supervised by two or more core components and child core components may be supervised by two or more parent core components . The orchestration parameters managed by a particular core component or leaf component may also be mirrored to the backup core components . Optionally the NFV O core components may have the same fully functional orchestration capabilities while leaf components may be limited to simple well defined and localized sub orchestration tasks and thus may provide a faster response to demands and changing load.

A cloud management system CMS is a software package managing one or more hardware units operating one or more VNFs and executing one or more VNF instances. A CMS can be managed by one or more leaf components or core components or combinations thereof. A CMS can be located in the operator s premises or in the customer s premises or partly in both.

An NFV O component such as a core components or a leaf component typically orchestrates a particular predefined territory. The territory may be one or more cloud management systems one or more services one or more customers etc. Therefore there can be an overlap between territories of different NFV O components. For example one NFV O component may orchestrate a CMS another NFV O component may orchestrate a service that is at least partly provided by the same CMS and additionally a third NFV O component may orchestrate services for a particular customer connected to that same CMS .

If for any reason the first responder NFV O component cannot resolve the problem for example for lack of adequate or sufficient resources within the territory of the particular NFV O component the problem may be escalated above to the supervising or parent NFV O component.

The NFV O is a central component of the network as a system and thus may present a risk from a security perspective. For example an attack against the NFV O may result in a total network outage. Securing the NFV O is therefore a goal and a challenge. A distributed NFV O architecture enhances the network resilience endurance. When an attack on a particular instance of the NFV O is detected the NFV O instance may be isolated and its functionality may be transferred to one or more other NFV O instances.

Another aspect of the NFV O hierarchy is stratified granularity or resolution of the orchestration process. An NFV based network may include a very large number of hardware elements e.g. processors memory units storage units communication links etc. and an even larger number of VNFs and VNF instances. Each of the VNF instances may have a number of requirements e.g. such as processing power memory size storage size communication bandwidth latency and jitter etc. . Each of these hardware elements and software modules may produce a number of load values e.g. corresponding to their respective requirements .

All of this creates a large amount of data that should be processed continuously or repeatedly to determine possible adverse conditions e.g. a particular overload or a potential cost saving situation. Such situation may require deployment optimization e.g. the planning of a newly optimized deployment of VNF instances and redeployment e.g. implementing the optimized deployment . The NFV O hierarchy enables scalability of the redeployment optimization process by distributing the process in a hierarchical manner.

One optional aspect of hierarchical deployment optimization is that higher levels in the NFV O hierarchy processes deployment optimization in a coarser granularity or resolution while lower levels in the NFV O hierarchy processes deployment optimization in a finer granularity or resolution .

For example while a leaf component manages its part territory of the NFV based network in terms of particular hardware elements e.g. processors memory units storage units communication links etc. and software elements e.g. VNFs and VNF instances a core component may manage its part territory of the NFV based network in terms of whole subordinate child core components or leaf components it supervises. Thus such parent core component may perform deployment optimization in terms of requirements and load values applied to whole subordinate child core components or leaf components .

A customer may use the services of several telecom operators. For example the customer may be an international company operating in several countries. Such a customer usually establishes a virtual private network VPN across this plurality of telecom operators. Considering that these operators now operate NFV based networks the customer may establish a service including a plurality of VNFs where different VNFs are part of different networks. Managing such inter operator VNF chains or services requires tight coordination across different NFV based networks.

Such coordination can be implemented using various techniques. For example the coordination may be implemented by enabling tight coordination between NFV Os of the different NFV based networks. As another example the coordination may be implemented by establishing an inter network NFV O module that manages one or more inter network VNF chains or services of a particular customer.

Optionally such inter network NFV O may supervise two or more child or leaf NFV O modules each within a particular NFV based network incorporating an NFV participating in the particular VNF chain or service. It is appreciated that NFV Os of different operators may be provided by different NFV O vendors.

In a first network configuration a single NFV O module may manage the deployment of VNFs and VNF instances throughout the entire NFV based network. A deployment optimization module e.g. and a chain optimization module of the NFV O module may continuously investigate the development of loads and provide alternative deployment plans. Consequently the NFV O module may redeploy VNFs and VNF instances and reallocate network resources accordingly.

Deployment optimization is indicated when one part of the NFV based network is over loaded or approaches an overload situation while another part of NFV based network is relatively idle. The redeployment migrates some of the network entities e.g. VNFs and VNF instances from the overloaded part of NFV based network to the relatively idle part of the NFV based network to free resources where needed mostly. Therefore the deployment optimization and redeployment activities may follow the changes of load distribution.

According to the embodiment shown in process starts in step by loading operational parameters such as SLA QoS and QoE quality of experience and collecting load data. Operational parameters are updated frequently and load data is changing continuously therefore step is executed continuously or repeatedly to maintain updated parameters and data.

Load data is collected for each of hardware unit and each software unit. According to one embodiment load data may include computing load data transmission load data energy load data etc. Computing load data may include but is not limited to processing load memory usage storage consumption etc. Transmission load data may include but is not limited to traffic load latency data lost packet rate bit error rate etc. as well as other parameters representing the quality of the services rendered. Energy load data may include but is not limited to electricity consumption heat dissipation temperature data cooling and ventilation load etc.

Load data is collected according to rules stored in and loaded from memory or storage . Load collection rules determine for example the rate in which load values are measured and or the conditions by which each load data is reported such as reporting a load upon the load crossing a threshold. Load collection rules may be configured by a user such as a network administrator. According to one embodiment step is processed continuously providing continuously updated load data via memory or storage .

The process proceeds to step to analyze the collected load data. According to one embodiment load analysis is performed according to rules stored in and loaded from memory or storage . Load analysis rules may be configured by a user such as a network administrator.

Rules for analyzing load may include but are not limited to algorithms for calculating change or rate of change of the various types of loads as measured within a predetermined period algorithms for predicting change or rate of change of the various types of load within a predetermined period algorithms for calculating correlations between various types of load within a predetermined period algorithms for calculating cost e.g. cost of energy including alternative costing schemes for various types of load within a predetermined period algorithms for ordering and or sorting hardware units and or processes and according to load values as collected calculated and described above such load values may be but are not limited to absolute values relative values such as a percentage of a maximum permitted load relative to a predetermined threshold value etc. and algorithms for calculating and determining the priority by which optimization processes should be implemented regarding various hardware units and software processes.

Assessing load conditions including load peaks and threats and their respective priorities may also involve their respective services. Some services may have a higher or a lower priority. Such services may include but are not limited to streaming voice video and non streaming call messaging store and forward simplex e.g. surveillance duplex e.g. telephone call multiplex e.g. conference call broadcast multicast unicast e.g. video on demand VoD download upload landline cellular satellite communication cable television voice video multimedia image data compression conversion and security issues firewall and encryption.

Assessing load conditions and their priority may also involve their respective service level agreements SLA and similar commitments.

The process proceeds to step to determine one or more optimization goals and to select an optimization method.

An optimization goal may be for example reducing a particular load such as processing load or latency of a particular hardware unit or transmission line below a particular value such as a predefined threshold. The optimization may have a group of goals involving a plurality of load types and or hardware units and or transmission lines. Furthermore the optimization may have goals set as limitations. For example moving processing load or storage from one hardware unit to another may increase traffic or latency and the optimization goal limits such increase.

Another type of optimization goal is associated with cost reduction such as by saving energy. For example by shutting down one or more hardware units and or associated support facilities such as cooling and ventilation. Alternatively cost reduction may be achieved by moving the consumption to a location where for example energy is less costly. For example moving VNF instances to hardware units located in a region where the cost of electricity is lower such as night saving electricity price plan. Similarly cost reduction can be achieved by migrating the processing to a site using natural cooling e.g. naturally cold water . The process particularly in step may set a cost saving goal in which available transmission capacity is used to utilize as much of the processing capacity of hardware units located where the cost of electricity is lowest for the period considered.

It is noted that optimization may involve redistribution or redeployment of VNF instances so that particular VNF instances are grouped on a particular hardware unit because for example these VNF instances have the same or different or complementary load requirements. For example a VNF instance having high processing requirement and a low storage requirement is grouped with a VNF instance having the opposite requirements e.g. low processing and high storage . Similarly VNF instances having instantaneous peak load are grouped with VNF instances having complementary load behavior.

An optimization method typically involves redistribution of the VNF instances among the hardware units. Optimization methods may be for example moving a VNF instance from one hardware unit to another up or down the network hierarchy and or moving a VNF instance from one hardware unit to another at the same hierarchy level. According to one embodiment moving a VNF instance at the same hierarchy level may be implemented by joining the load or service provided by two or more VNF instances executed by a different hardware unit at the same level for example to enable shutdown of one or more hardware units. According to another embodiment moving a VNF instance at the same hierarchy level may be implemented by splitting the load or service provided by a VNF instance between two or more hardware units. According to one embodiment if step sets a plurality of optimization goals the optimization goals are ordered and or prioritized.

When determining the optimization goals and method the process particularly in step may use rules to evaluate and determine resource conversion. Resource conversion applies to the trading of the availability of one type of resource to replace a shortage of another type of resource. For example suppose that the processing load in a first hardware unit is nearing the maximum capacity and that there is available transmission capacity between the first hardware unit and a second hardware unit. Thus migrating a VNF instance from the first hardware unit to the second hardware unit converts the available transmission capacity into an available processing capacity in the first hardware unit.

Similarly if the traffic load between the first hardware unit and the second hardware unit nears the maximum transmission capacity a VNF instance may be migrated from the second hardware unit to the first hardware unit thus converting the processing power available in the first hardware unit into transmission capacity to the second hardware unit.

Resource conversion may be applied to or between any two or more resources including processing power memory storage and transmission as well as energy electricity cooling etc.

When determining the optimization goals and method the process particularly in step may use rules to evaluate and determine between various optimization options. For example considering the cost of migrating VNF instance between hardware units. It is appreciated that a migrating activity typically requires an additional processing activity an additional transmission activity an additional memory and storage load etc. Therefore the migration activity involves some cost in increased processing load increased traffic load etc. Such added load may also affect energy consumption electricity and cooling. Such added loads may also have monetary values. The process particularly in step may use rules to evaluate and determine the worthiness and or the profitability of a particular migration activity and method with respect to the anticipated gains and savings.

Eventually step provides one or more optimization goals one or more optimization methods and one or more VNF instances to be redistributed e.g. migrated to other hardware units . Typically the VNF instances are ordered for example by priority or by their expected influence on the results of the optimization process.

The process proceeds to step to select and execute migration of VNF instances to accomplish the optimization goals as set in step . It is appreciated that executing or implementing the optimized deployment or changes to the deployment plan are typically performed by the orchestration and workflow management. However for simplicity of the description the execution is presented here as part of the process .

In step process selects a VNF instance from the list provided by step selects a migration method for that VNF instance which is compatible with the optimization method as determined by process and executes the selected migration method. Selecting a migration method may include for example selecting the hardware unit to which the VNF instance should be migrated. Step repeats for all the VNF instances listed by step .

The process then proceeds to step to complete the optimization process. Steps and are repeated until achieving the goals set by step . However step may change the goals according to the results of the optimization process or because of external developments as load data is collected by step and analyzed by step . Step may end for example by an instruction to shut down a particular computing facility and or associated support facilities such as cooling and ventilation .

It is noted that therefore the optimization process is an ongoing continuous or repetitive process enabling continuous or frequent optimization in real time.

The process starts with step which is a more detailed implementation of step of . Step includes step that loads operational parameters and loads collection rules. Load collection rules indicates how and when to collect load data from hardware units and software modules of the NFV based network. Using these collection rules steps and collect load hardware and software values respectively. Steps and collect load values continuously or repetitively providing updated load values. It is appreciated that the operational parameters and load collection rules may be updated too continuously and or repetitively automatically and or manually.

The process proceeds with step which is a more detailed implementation of step of . Step includes step in which load analysis rules are loaded. Using these analysis rules steps and analyze the load values collected by step . Step computes and compares absolute or relative percentage load values and orders their respective hardware and or software VNF instances according to these values. Step computes and compares the changes in the absolute or relative percentage load values per a unit of time and orders their respective hardware and or software VNF instances according to these values. Step anticipates and computes changes in the absolute or relative percentage load values for a predetermined point in time in the future and orders their respective hardware and or software VNF instances according to these values. Step computes any of the values computed by steps and or with respective predefined thresholds and orders their respective hardware and or software VNF instances according to these comparisons. Steps and are executed continuously or repetitively providing updated load analysis values.

The process proceeds to step which is a more detailed implementation of step of . Step includes various steps. In step the process determines and prioritizes optimization goals. For example step may elect to balance traffic loads according to current relative load values percentage of local maxima or to balance processing loads according to anticipated load values or to balance memory loads according to their respective thresholds or to save energy by turning off least active computing facilities.

In step the process selects one or more optimization methods such as moving load up the hierarchy or down the hierarchy to a less loaded computing facility or splitting a load between two or more processing facilities or evacuating load from a particular computing facility to enable shutdown.

In steps and the process selects a first computing facility and within that first computing facility e.g. a hardware unit a particular first software unit e.g. VNF instance .

The process proceeds to step which is a more detailed implementation of step of . Step performs various steps. In step the process selects a traffic route or link from the first computing facility e.g. a hardware unit selected in step along which an alternative computing facility e.g. a hardware unit is sought.

A traffic route may include one or more hardware units and or transmission links via which a VNF instance provides a service. For example hardware units and or transmission link located between a VNF instance and a terminal device user terminal or a server the VNF instance services. A traffic route may include one or more hardware units and or transmission links located away from the terminal device. In this case the current VNF instance is located between the traffic route and the terminal device. For example a traffic route may include hardware units and or transmission link located between a VNF instances forming a service chain e.g. a chain of VNF instances .

In step the process selects a second computing facility e.g. a hardware unit along the traffic route selected in step the selected computing facility being compatible with the needs of the VNF instance selected in step and with the optimization goals and methods selected in steps and .

The process then proceeds to step to migrate the VNF instance selected by step in whole or in part e.g. load splitting from the first computing facility e.g. a hardware unit selected in step to the second computing facility selected in step .

The process proceeds to step which is a more detailed implementation of step of . In step the process verifies that the optimization goals as determined in step are met. If the optimization goals are not met then the process continues with another software module VNF instance . If the optimization goals are accomplished then the process continues to steps and or to discontinue the VNF instance in the first computing facility and or shut down the first computing facility in accordance with the optimization method as determined in step .

The process performs steps and or continuously or repeatedly according to the load analysis continuously or repeatedly provided by steps and .

The VNF migrating routine of flow chart starts with step to determine if the required VNF code exists in the target hardware unit the second computing facility of step of . If the required VNF does not exist in the target hardware unit the VNF migrating routine of flow chart proceeds to step to install the required VNF in the target hardware unit. The VNF migrating routine of flow chart then proceeds to step to initiate in the target hardware unit a VNF instance and configure it according to the parameters of the VNF instance of the first hardware unit. The VNF migrating routine of flow chart then proceeds to step to divert all or part of the communication incoming to the VNF instance of the first hardware unit to the VNF instance of the target second hardware unit.

More information regarding possible processes for migrating one or more VNF instance may be found in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 918 597 titled System Method And Computer Program For Preserving Service Continuity In A Network Function Virtualization NFV Based Communication Network and U.S. patent application Ser.

It is appreciated that the contents of these two U.S. patent applications may form at least a part of a possible embodiment of step of process as described with reference to . It is appreciated that FIGS. 11 and 12 of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 572 716 titled System Method And Computer Program For Preserving Service Continuity In A Network Function Virtualization NFV Based Communication Network as well as their respective description may be used instead of or in addition to herein.

It is appreciated that the fundamental optimizing process may include selecting a first VNF instance from a first hardware having a highest load of a particular load type identifying at least one traffic route in which the VNF instance participates in a service provided to a user selecting a second hardware unit into which the VNF instance would be migrated this second hardware unit being located along one of the traffic route identified in the previous step provided that the second hardware unit has a load lower than the first hardware unit and initiating a second VNF instance compatible with the first VNF instance in the second hardware unit and migrating the service from the first VNF instance to the second VNF instance preferably without disrupting the service.

In optimizing an NFV based network the deployment optimization module may use the following types of rules rules for collecting load parameters rules for analyzing load parameters migration rules migration prioritizing rules rules for selecting a migration process rules for selecting hardware for evacuation and shut down rules for deploying stand by VNFs rules for determining which VNF instances should be moved from the processing device or network transmission link approaching overload rules for determining where to move the VNF instances based on their availability and the anticipated growth of loads processing memory storage and traffic in these devices and their associated network links including cost considerations rules for determining priorities of migration processes rules for selecting a migration process if more than one process is available rules for deploying VNF modules to processors ahead of their activation to save the need to download the module before migrating a VNF instance to the target processor and rules for evacuating one or more processors to enable their shut down to save electric power consumption wear maintenance etc.

Load parameters may include but are not limited to processing loads memory loads storage consumption and traffic loads. Analyzing load parameters may include detecting predicting and or analyzing load parameters. Load parameters may also include load values load growth anticipated load and or anticipated load growth. Analyzing load behavior may include but is not limited to comparing any of the load parameters or combinations thereof with predefined thresholds.

It is appreciated that dynamic real time optimization of an NFV based network includes cost considerations. For a regular network operator the costing of operating the network is based on the configuration topology deployment of the hardware elements whether used or not . The optimal configuration simply uses less hardware or less expensive hardware elements . A virtual network operators VNO may pay for hardware used rather than hardware deployed . The cost consideration of a virtual network operators may therefore be different from the cost consideration of a regular network operator.
