This application is a continuation under 35 U.S.C. 120 of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 354 804 filed 20 Jan. 2012.

This disclosure generally relates to continuously tracking the locations of mobile devices as they are carried by their users. It further relates to analyzing and mining the collected location information to extract statistics that represent user behavioral patterns.

Mobile devices such as mobile telephones tablet computers netbook computers personal digital assistants and portable game consoles have become prevalent in this digital age. Each new generation of mobile devices is more powerful more sophisticated more user friendly and even more fashionable. People increasingly rely on these mobile devices so much so that they have become an integral part of people s daily lives.

In particular embodiments a mobile device includes a location sensor and an acceleration sensor. The location and acceleration or speed of the mobile device are continuously tracked as it is carried by its user based on the location and acceleration sensor readings. Consequently the location and acceleration or speed of the mobile device user may be inferred from the location and acceleration or speed information of the mobile device itself. Such information may be analyzed to extract statistical information that reflects the behavioral patterns of the mobile device user. In particular embodiments the location and acceleration or speed information of multiple mobile devices belonging to multiple users may be continuously tracked and collected. The information once collected may be aggregated and analyzed to extract statistical information that reflects the behavioral patterns of a group of mobile device users.

Mobile devices are becoming increasingly sophisticated. They are more powerful and support more functionalities. For example a smart mobile telephone is no longer limited to enabling its user to make telephone calls and text messages. Instead the user can use the mobile telephone to for example take photographs upload files check stock prices conduct banking transactions surf the web get driving directions read electronic books draft documents and so on. Often mobile devices include hardware and software components that help implement these functionalities.

In particular embodiments a mobile device e.g. a mobile telephone includes a location sensor that is capable of determining its current location at a given time. In some implementations the location sensor may be a Global Positioning System GPS sensor which is capable of providing the GPS coordinates of its current location at a given time. In particular embodiments the mobile device further includes an acceleration sensor that is capable of determining its current acceleration at a given time. In some implementations the acceleration sensor may be an accelerometer which is capable of measuring its current acceleration at a given time. The location sensor may be employed to determine the current location of the mobile device at a given time while the acceleration sensor may be employed to determine the current acceleration of the mobile device at a given time. In addition the current speed of the mobile device at a given time may be inferred based on the location or acceleration sensor readings. As an example the locations of the mobile device may be tracked over a period of time based on the GPS coordinates provided by the location sensor. This information together with other optional sensor readings may be used to infer the speed of the mobile device moving around these locations during the period of time. As another example the accelerations of the mobile device may be tracked over a period of time based on the acceleration sensor readings. The acceleration data may be numerically integrated over time i.e. adding them up over time to infer the speed of the mobile device over the period of time.

As the mobile device is carried by its user and thus moves with its user over time the location of the mobile device may be continuously tracked based on the location sensor readings. Optionally the acceleration of the mobile device may be continuously tracked as well based on the acceleration sensor readings. In addition the speed of the mobile device over time may be inferred from location or acceleration sensor readings. In particular embodiments the location and acceleration or speed information of the mobile device may be continuously collected. Since the mobile device is carried by and moves with its user the location and acceleration or speed information of the mobile device user may be inferred from the location and acceleration or speed information of the mobile device itself. For example as a user performs his daily activities e.g. exercise work leisure etc. while carrying his mobile telephone with him the location and acceleration sensors on the mobile telephone may take readings periodically e.g. once every few seconds or once every minute . These sensor readings reflect the mobile telephone s and thus the user s location and acceleration or speed over time.

In particular embodiments mobile device includes a location sensor. Mobile device continuously determines its current location as time passes as illustrated in STEP . In some implementations there is a software application residing on mobile device . While this software application is running it directs the location sensor to take readings periodically e.g. once every few seconds or once every few minutes . Alternatively in some implementations there may be a software module included in the operating system of mobile device which directs the location sensor to take readings periodically. For example each specific location may be represented as a set of GPS coordinates or a pair of latitude and longitude. Each location is also associated with a timestamp which indicates when the location sensor reading is taken. Thus the readings show where mobile device is at what time.

In particular embodiments mobile device further includes an acceleration sensor. Mobile device may continuously determine its current acceleration as time passes as well. Again the software application or the software module in the operating system of mobile device may direct the acceleration sensor to take readings periodically. For example each specific acceleration reading may be represented as an acceleration value. Each acceleration is also associated with a timestamp which indicates when the acceleration sensor reading is taken. Thus the readings show how fast mobile device moves at what time. In some implementations the acceleration sensor and the location sensor are directed to take their respective readings at about the same time so that at a given time the collected sensor data show where mobile device is as well as how fast mobile device moves. The speed of the mobile device over time may be inferred from the location or sensor readings.

In some implementations the software application or module automatically begins executing upon mobile device being turned on and continues executing while mobile device remains on. Thus as long as mobile device is turned on it continuously collects its location and acceleration information. However to protect user privacy in some implementations user is given the option of shutting down the software application or module whenever he desires or preventing the software application or module from starting automatically. User nevertheless has the option of starting the software application or module manually whenever he prefers. This allows user to control when his mobile device should collect the information and for how long.

In particular embodiments the collected location and optionally acceleration information is temporarily stored on mobile device and uploaded to a server for further processing and analysis as appropriate as illustrated in STEP . In some implementations the location and acceleration information is uploaded as soon as it becomes available e.g. as soon as the sensors take their respective readings . However since in practice the sensors may take their readings very frequently e.g. once every few seconds or minutes this may result in high communication traffic and negatively affect mobile device s performance. In addition mobile device may not be connected to a network at all times. Thus in some implementations the information upload may be performed at appropriate intervals. For example the upload may be performed once an hour or a upload is performed when a certain amount of data e.g. 1 MB has been accumulated. If mobile device is disconnected from all networks for some period of time a special upload may be performed when mobile device is reconnected to a network to upload the data accumulated during that time period.

In particular embodiments server may be associated with a social networking system . A social network in general is a social structure made up of entities such as individuals or organizations that are connected by one or more types of interdependency or relationships such as friendship kinship common interest financial exchange dislike or relationships of beliefs knowledge or prestige. In more recent years social networks have taken advantage of the Internet. There are social networking systems existing on the Internet in the form of social networking websites. Such social networking websites enable their members who are commonly referred to as website users to perform various social activities. For example the social networking website operated by Facebook Inc. at www.facebook.com enables its users to communicate with their friends via emails instant messages or blog postings organize social events share photos receive news of their friends or interesting events play games etc.

In particular embodiments user may be a member of social networking system and thus has a user account with social networking system . User may link mobile device to his account with social networking system so that server is aware that mobile device is associated with user . In addition in particular embodiments mobile device may be supplied or sponsored by social networking system and may include software applications specifically designed to work with servers e.g. server associated with social networking system . For example mobile device may send its location and acceleration information as communication packets that each have a predetermined format so that server can interpret the data in the packets. In addition mobile device may have been given the network destination of server so that it knows where to send its location and acceleration information. In particular embodiments each packet may also include a device identifier ID of mobile device e.g. its serial number so that server is able to determine which mobile device has sent a specific packet. From this information server is able to determine to which user the location and acceleration information in the packet relates e.g. based on the information provided in the user accounts . Alternatively in particular embodiments each packet may include the user ID of user with social networking system so that server is able to determine to which user the location and acceleration information in the packet relates.

In particular embodiments upon receiving the location and acceleration information from mobile device server stores the information such as in a datastore as illustrated in STEP . In some implementations the information is stored in its raw form such that there is an entry corresponding to each set of location and acceleration readings collected and sent by mobile device . In other words the information received from mobile device is not aggregated. The following is an example of storing location and acceleration information in its raw form 

In some implementations upon receiving the location and acceleration information from mobile device server may infer the speed information of mobile device from the received location or acceleration information. In some cases instead of storing the acceleration readings received from mobile device the inferred speed information about mobile device is stored in addition to the location readings. In other cases both the acceleration readings and the inferred speed information about mobile device are stored again in addition to the location readings.

In particular embodiments server may process and analyze the location and speed information collected and inferred over time to extract statistics that suggest behavioral patters of user as illustrated in STEP . Different types of statistics may be extracted and this disclosure contemplates any application type of statistics. Social networking system may then use these statistics to serve its users such as making recommendations. In particular embodiments the statistics may be cached so that the information is more readily available.

As an example based on the location entries and their associated timestamps server may determine how much time user spends at work each day. Over time the statistics may show how much time user spends at work either on average or in total during a day a week a month or a year. Similarly if user frequents a local restaurant those location entries showing user at the restaurant and their associated timestamps may show how much time user spends at the restaurant during a specific week month or year. Thus the statistics may show how much time user spends at a specific place e.g. work home restaurant shop etc. either on average or in total during a day week month or year.

As another example the acceleration or speed entries and their associated timestamps may suggest how much time user walks or runs each day. A person usually walks at a speed between 3 to 4 miles per hour. Thus those speed entries showing mobile device moving at approximately such speed range may suggest that user had been walking during the associated time periods. Similarly a person usually runs at a speed between 5 to 7 miles per hour. Again those speed entries showing mobile device moving at approximately such speed range may suggest that user had been running during the associated time periods. Over time the statistics may show how much time user spends exercising e.g. walking or running either on average or in total during a day a week a month or a year. Thus the statistics may show how much time user spends doing an activity either on average or in total during a day week month or year. For example if the statistics indicate that user exercises less than 4 hours per week social networking system may notify user and recommend that user should spend more time exercising. Similarly when mobile device is stationary e.g. the speed is 0 and the associated timestamps indicate that it is at night it may be inferred that user is asleep. Over time the statistics may show how long on average user sleeps each night. For example if the statistics indicate that user usually sleeps less than 5 hours each night social networking system may notify user and recommend that user should sleep more.

As a third example if someone else is looking for user she may query server for user s last known location. Server may look up the last location entry received from mobile device and its associated timestamp to determine the last known location for user and how recently user had been at that location. This may be useful when a parent wishes to know the last known location of her minor child e.g. user . In addition the parent may track her minor child s movements or whereabouts over time through location information received from a mobile device e.g. mobile device carried by her minor child. This may be very valuable information to the parent especially during an emergency.

As a fourth example suppose that user lives and works in San Francisco. However during a two week period the location entries show that mobile device is in New York City. These entries may suggest that user is traveling during those two weeks. Again over time the statistics may show how much time user spends traveling and where user travels to.

Social networking system may have many users each having at least one mobile device. In particular embodiments each mobile device may continuously collect its own location and acceleration information and upload the information to server . The speed information of the mobile device may then be inferred from the location or acceleration information. Over time server may correlate the information about multiple users to exact statistics relating groups of users.

In some implementations for each user his locations collected over time through an associated mobile device may be plotted against time. illustrates an example of plotting locations against time for two users X and Y . Each point along a curve is a specific location and its associated timestamp as tracked by a corresponding mobile device associated with a corresponding user. According to the two curves corresponding to users X and Y respectively coincide at point . This indicates that users X and Y had been at the same location at the same time corresponding to point . Such curves may help track the movements or whereabouts of individual users over time and determine statistics for groups of users.

As an example if the location entries of multiple users indicate that many users spend time at a specific sports bar this may suggest that this sports bar is popular among this group of users. By examining the information provided in these users accounts with social networking system it may be determined that for example the sports bar is especially popular among those users between the ages of 25 and 30. If there is another user who is 28 years old and lives nearby but who has never visited the sports bar social networking system may suggest the sports bar to that user. Similarly the location entries of multiple users may help infer facts such as popular vacation destinations that many users have visited or popular activities that many users have participated. Social networking system may suggest such information to other users.

In particular embodiments social networking system may categorize its users based on common user characteristics such as age e.g. users between the ages of 20 and 30 genders e.g. male users vs. female users family status e.g. single users married users divorced users users with children profession e.g. engineers accountants doctors geographical location e.g. northern California central California southern California and so on. Statistics may be determined for a particular category of users. For example for a group of female users between the ages of 30 and 40 who live in the San Francisco Bay Area their corresponding location and acceleration or speed information may indicate which locations e.g. restaurants shops clubs parks or which activities e.g. hiking cycling shopping are popular among this particular group of users. These may be locations that a majority e.g. more than 50 or 75 of the users in the group have been to or activities that a majority of the users in the group have participated in. Social networking system may make recommendations to other users sharing similar characteristics.

As another example suppose that given three users X Y and Z their respective location entries have many matching points e.g. they are often at the same location at the same time . This may suggest that users X Y and Z know each other well and often spend time together. Moreover if within social networking system users X Y and Z also have established friend connections with each other it is a further indication that users X Y and Z probably are good friends. Based on such information server may determine that for example user X often socializes e.g. hang out with users Y and Z . Suppose that on a particular Saturday afternoon users Y and Z are at a club frequented by users X Y and Z social networking system may send to a notification to user X in case he wishes to join his friends at the club.

As a third example suppose that users X and Y have established friend connections with each other within social networking system . On a particular Saturday afternoon users X and Y are at two different locations that are near each other e.g. within a few miles . Social networking system may send notifications to users X and Y to let them know that their friend is nearby in case they wish to meet up e.g. for coffee .

In particular embodiments the location and acceleration or speed entries of the users together may provide certain statistics as well. As an example the speed entries of a user may suggest that the user is running at certain times while the corresponding location entries of the user may indicate where the user is running Based on such entries of a group of users living in the same area e.g. the San Francisco Bay Area server may determine where people living in that area like to go running e.g. the popular running places in the San Francisco Bay Area . Suppose that a user has recently moved to the area and the user has indicated to social networking system that one of his hobbies is running social networking system may recommend the popular running places in the area to the user.

As described above server stores the location and acceleration or speed information received from mobile devices associated with users in its raw form. Since there may be millions of users each having hundreds of entries per day the amount of data can grow rapidly over time. In addition there is the concern with user privacy protection. In particular embodiments older data are transferred to another server to be stored in aggregated form. In some implementations after the data have been stored with server in raw form for a time period e.g. 3 to 5 years the data are transferred to server which may also be associated with social networking system . Server aggregates the data and stores them in the aggregated form as illustrated in STEP . Server may filter the data as well so that only the more interesting data are stored. Typically people are more interested in and concerned with what they do or where they are in recent times instead of what had taken place several years ago. In particular embodiments server may extract features that describe users behavioral patterns from the raw data and store these features as illustrated in STEP .

As an example suppose that a user typically spends 9 hours per day and 5 days per week at work. While the user is in his office working his mobile device mostly remains at the same location e.g. also in the user s office with the user such as sitting on top of the user s desk . Nevertheless the mobile device continuously takes location and acceleration sensor readings e.g. once every 5 minutes and sends the location and acceleration data to server . During each 9 hour period that the user spends at work the sensor readings are approximately the same e.g. approximately the same location and same acceleration and yet there may be 108 sets of data e.g. timestamp location acceleration collected and stored in raw form which are repetitive and do not provide additional information about the user. Thus server may aggregate such data. Instead of storing sets of raw data for each 9 hour period server may store data describing the actual time the user spends at work each day. In this case server extracts the relevant features e.g. the time the user spends at work each day from the raw data and stores the features instead e.g. storing the data in feature form . Similarly sever may determine how much time the user spends sleeping exercising and at leisure each day how often the user visits a particular restaurant how much time the user spends with his friends and so on and store these features that describe the user s behavioral patterns instead of the raw data themselves. Suppose that a user wishes to know whether he has improved his lifestyle and health by exercising more. The user may query sever for the amount of time he had spent exercising each week 3 years ago and compare it to the amount of time he spends exercising each week now.
