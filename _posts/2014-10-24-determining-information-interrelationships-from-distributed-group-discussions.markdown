title: Determining information inter-relationships from distributed group discussions
abstract: Techniques are described for analyzing user-supplied information and/or predicting future aspects of additional information that will be supplied by users. The analyzed information may include distributed group discussions involving numerous users, occurring via user comments and other content items supplied to social networking site(s) and/or other sources. Analysis of user-supplied information may, for example, include determining particular topics and/or categories of interest during one or more time periods and quantifying corresponding amounts of user interest; determining trends for, relevant terms and attributes for, and inter-relationships between the topics and categories; predicting future amounts of user interest in the topics and categories; tracking user interactions with information about the topics and/or categories; and taking further actions based on the analyzed and/or predicted information.
