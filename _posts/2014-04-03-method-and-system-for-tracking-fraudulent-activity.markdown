This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 10 923 064 filed Aug. 20 2004 which application is incorporated in their entirety herein by reference.

Exemplary embodiments of present invention relate generally to the field of fraud prevention and in one exemplary embodiment to methods and systems for tracking fraudulent activities related to spoof sites in a network based commerce system.

The number of people purchasing products goods and or services and executing financial transactions via the Internet has increased significantly over the course of the last several years. Many online enterprises have managed to attract and retain large customer bases resulting in significant growth and financial success. However many successful online enterprises have not only drawn the attention of new customers but they have also attracted unscrupulous persons seeking to defraud others.

One of the more common scams practiced by fraud perpetrators is referred to as phishing. Phishing involves sending an email to the users of a legitimate online enterprise and directing the users to visit a web site where they are asked to update personal information such as passwords and or credit card numbers social security numbers and bank account numbers or any other number that may or may not already be on record with the legitimate enterprise. Both the email and the web site to which the user is directed are spoofed. That is the email and the web site commonly referred to as a spoof site are purposefully designed to look as if they are from or associated with the legitimate online enterprise. However in reality the purpose of the phishing email is to direct the user to the spoof site which exists for the sole purpose of stealing the user s personal information.

In a typical phishing scam the perpetrator will target a large number of users of a large and well established online enterprise knowing that only a small percentage of the targeted users will actually provide the requested personal information. Once the perpetrator has stolen a user s personal information the perpetrator can use that information fraudulently to the perpetrator s benefit. For example the perpetrator may access the user s account at the online enterprise and enter into fraudulent transactions. For example the fraudulent transaction may be for goods and or services in an online commerce system e.g. in a fixed price or an auction environment . Alternatively the perpetrator may attempt to transfer money from one of the user s accounts to another account held by the perpetrator e.g. in an online banking environment . When the user finally realizes his mistake in furnishing his her personal information typically it is too late as the negative consequences have already occurred.

Fraudulent activities and phishing scams in particular are a problem for online enterprises for a variety of reasons. One obvious problem related to these scams is the effect they have on consumer trust. Because online transactions are entirely automated and generally lack any person to person interaction consumer trust is particularly important to online enterprises.

In addition a large online enterprise frequently targeted by phishing scams must dedicate significant resources to dealing with the problems that arise as the result of such scams. For example an online enterprise may employ several people to answer customer calls and investigate customer complaints resulting from phishing scams.

A method and system for tracking fraudulent activity are provided. According to one embodiment of the present invention a fraud tracking database is connected to a fraud tracking server. The fraud tracking server includes a communications module to receive data identifying a potential spoof site. For example the communications module may receive an email containing the URL of a document associated with a suspected spoof site. The fraud tracking server also includes control logic to generate a spoof site tracking record in the fraud tracking database. The spoof site tracking record may for example include data that identifies the potential spoof site such as a URL received via email. Finally after generating the spoof site tracking record the communications module of the fraud tracking server may notify an administrator of the potential spoof site for example by communicating the data identifying the potential spoof site to an administrator for review.

Other aspects of the present invention will be apparent from the accompanying figures and from the detailed description that follows.

A method and system for tracking fraudulent activity are described. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be evident however to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details.

One exemplary embodiment of the present invention provides a method and system for tracking fraudulent activities including fraudulent activities associated with spoof web sites. In particular one embodiment of the invention automates many of the tasks associated with identifying analyzing monitoring and reporting fraudulent activities associated with one or more web sites e.g. spoof sites . Because it automates many of the tasks involved in the day to day operations of an online enterprise the present invention may free up resources that can be directed to other important tasks.

As illustrated in the eCommerce enterprise system may include the fraud tracking system as well as several exemplary eCommerce servers interconnected with an administrative computer by a local area network LAN . The eCommerce servers may include any one or more servers that are used in a backend server environment of an online enterprise including but not limited to email servers database servers application servers application programming interface servers and web document servers. In one exemplary embodiment the fraud tracking system includes a fraud tracking server connected to a fraud tracking database . In one embodiment of the invention the administrative computer may be used to administer one or more of the servers that make up the eCommerce enterprise system including one of the eCommerce servers or the fraud tracking server .

The Internet servers may include Internet server and and each of the individual Internet servers and illustrated in may be connected to the network e.g. the Internet via an Internet Service Provider ISP server . Consequently each of the individual Internet servers and may be assigned an Internet Protocol IP address that is within a particular range of addresses that the ISP server is authorized and configured to assign. For example ISP server may represent one of many AOL servers used by AOL customers to connect to the Internet. As such ISP server may be configured to dynamically or statically assign IP addresses to Internet servers and from a pre set range of IP addresses. It will be appreciated that the Internet servers illustrated in represent only one exemplary configuration of Internet servers and that many variations to the configuration shown are possible.

Each of the client devices illustrated in may be capable of executing a client application that facilitates the browsing of documents hosted and served by one of the Internet servers or one of the eCommerce servers of the eCommerce enterprise system . For example the client application may be a standard web browser application such as Microsoft Internet Explorer . By entering a Universal Resource Locator URL into the address bar of the web browser application a user is able to download and view documents that are served by one of the individual Internet servers and or one of the eCommerce servers In addition each client device may be capable of executing a client application that facilitates the sending and receiving of email.

In one embodiment of the invention the fraud tracking server receives data that identifies a potential spoof site and generates a record or spoof site tracking record in the fraud tracking database before notifying an administrator of the potential spoof site. For example using a web browsing application on one of the client devices a user may download and view a document from one of the Internet servers or that looks suspicious e.g. that at least appears to be fraudulent . For example the web document may look as if it is mimicking a document or web page that is hosted by one of the eCommerce servers of the eCommerce enterprise system . The user may report the suspicious looking web document to the fraud tracking system of the eCommerce enterprise by sending an email including the URL of the suspicious looking web document to the eCommerce enterprise system . Accordingly in one exemplary embodiment of the invention the fraud tracking server may receive email identifying a potentially fraudulent web document automatically extract the URL from the email and generate a spoof site tracking record in the fraud tracking database . It will however be appreciated that the record generated and stored in the fraud tracking database may vary from one embodiment of the invention to another.

In the fraud tracking database is illustrated as a single component separate from the fraud tracking server . However it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the fraud tracking database may be implemented in a variety of configurations. For example the fraud tracking database may be part of a separate computing device or alternatively the fraud tracking database may be a subcomponent of the fraud tracking server .

The fraud tracking server may include two primary components a communications module and control logic . The control logic as the name suggests may control the various functions of the fraud tracking server . In one embodiment of the invention the control logic includes a database management module a URL analyzer module a spoof site monitor module and a spoof page fingerprint analyzer .

The communications module may facilitate the exchange e.g. transmitting and receiving of data between the fraud tracking server and the various components that are external to the fraud tracking system including but not limited to the client devices the Internet servers the administrative computer the eCommerce servers email servers not shown and various other components. The communications module may include a web server module a URL extraction module an intelligent email and report generating module and an administrative module .

In one embodiment of the invention the URL extraction module of the communications module extracts URLs from data messages received by the communications module . For example the URL extraction module may receive data in the form of email messages. The email messages may be in a standardized or uniform and structured format or alternatively the email messages may be in a non standardized format. In either case the URL extraction module may extract a URL from the email message by analyzing the contents of the email message and performing a search for text representing a URL.

In addition to receiving data identifying a potential spoof site from an email one exemplary embodiment of the invention may include the web server module to receive data identifying a potential spoof site. For example in one embodiment of the invention the web server module may facilitate the exchange of data with users and administrators. Accordingly a user may submit suspicious URLs directly to the fraud tracking server by for example filling in one or more fields or forms of a web document. The web document may be hosted and served by the web server module of the fraud tracking server .

In one embodiment of the invention after a URL associated with a potential spoof site has been received the database management module of the control logic may generate a record such as a spoof site tracking record for the suspicious URL and add the spoof site tracking record to the fraud tracking database . Each spoof site tracking record an exemplary embodiment of which is described in greater detail below may have various data fields including a field to identify the suspicious URL.

In one embodiment of the invention the control logic may include the URL analyzer module . Accordingly the URL analyzer module may analyze each URL received by the communications module to determine whether or not the URL is associated with a spoof site for which a spoof site tracking record already exists in the fraud tracking database . Accordingly in one embodiment instead of generating a spoof site tracking record every time a potential spoof site is reported the URL analyzer module may analyze the reported URL to determine whether it is associated with a known spoof site for which a record already exists. For example a spoof site for the popular auction site eBay.com may have several documents with different URLs such as http www.ibay.com index.html and http www.ibay.com login.html. In one embodiment of the invention if a spoof site tracking record already exists for the first URL i.e. http www.ibay.com index.html the URL analyzer module may prevent a second spoof site tracking record from being generated for the second URL i.e. http www.ibay.com login.html . For example in one embodiment of the invention a spoof site tracking record may be created only for unique sites and not for each document that is part of the site. In one embodiment of the invention the uniqueness of a site may be determined by the domain name of the server that is hosting or serving the documents. Alternatively the uniqueness of a site may be determined by the IP address of the server hosting the site.

In one exemplary embodiment of the invention the URL analyzer module may go through a series of operations to iteratively manipulate or process the URL associated with the potential spoof site and then compare the URL with URLs that have already been reported and for which spoof site tracking records already exist. For example the URL analyzer module may discard a portion of the URL such as the protocol e.g. http https or ftp before making a comparison with URLs that are from known spoof sites. Next the URL analyzer module might discard the pathname of the file and so on until all that is left is the domain name from the URL. If the URL is associated with a spoof site for which no spoof site tracking record exists then the control logic may generate a new spoof site tracking record and add it to the fraud tracking database .

In one embodiment of the invention either before or during the generation of the spoof site tracking record the control logic of the fraud tracking server may automatically retrieve the document e.g. the source code such as the HTML code of a web page associated with the URL and add it to the spoof site tracking record. In addition the control logic may automatically download and store a screenshot of the document. Alternatively the control logic may automatically download the source code and screenshot after the spoof site tracking record has been generated and then update the spoof site tracking record with the downloaded source code and screenshot. In an alternative embodiment an administrator may manually update the spoof site tracking record by downloading the source code and screenshot of the document and storing them as part of the spoof site tracking record.

After generating a spoof site tracking record associated with the URL of the potential spoof site the control logic may cause the communications module to communicate the URL associated with the potential spoof site to an administrator for review and verification. Accordingly the communications module includes an administrative module that may facilitate the administration functions of the fraud tracking server including the reporting of URLs associated with potential spoof sites to an administrator. In addition the administrative module may operate in conjunction with the web server module to allow an administrator to access and administer the fraud tracking server remotely via a web browser application. For example the administrative module may include several administrative web documents that facilitate a web interface to the fraud tracking server . By downloading and interacting with the web documents via a web browser application an administrator can perform administrative tasks such as but not limited to retrieving information about potential spoof sites managing e.g. adding updating and or deleting spoof site tracking records configuring the fraud tracking server and various other administrative tasks.

In one embodiment of the invention the exemplary email sent by the fraud tracking server to the administrator to notify the administrator of a potential spoof site may include a hypertext link to a document hosted by the fraud tracking server that includes data from the spoof site tracking record. By selecting the hypertext link the administrator can download and view information about the URL that has been reported. In addition the email sent from the administrative module of the fraud tracking server to the administrator may include the actual URL that was reported as suspicious. Accordingly the administrator may download and view the document associated with the URL to verify whether the potential spoof site is an actual spoof site. After the administrator has determined that the potential spoof site is an actual spoof site the administrator may interact with the administrative module to update the spoof site tracking record to indicate that the URL is associated with an actual spoof site. Alternatively if the administrator determines that the document associated with the suspicious URL is in fact a legitimate document from a legitimate site operated by the online enterprise then the administrator may update the spoof site tracking record to indicate that the URL is associated with a legitimate document by updating a status field of the tracking record to cancelled or suspended. 

The communications module may also include the intelligent email and reporting module . The intelligent email and reporting module may automatically generate emails and reports for various purposes. For example after the fraud tracking server has received verification from the administrator that the potential spoof site is an actual spoof site the intelligent email and reporting module may automatically generate an email or letter to the ISP associated with the IP address of the server that is hosting the actual spoof site. In one embodiment of the invention the intelligent email and reporting module automatically analyzes the IP address of the server that is hosting the actual spoof site to determine the ISP associated with the IP address. Once the ISP has been determined the reporting module may automatically generate an email letter or any other communication properly addressed to the corresponding ISP. In one embodiment the intelligent email and reporting module automatically tailors the contents of the email or letter by selecting the language of the email or letter based on the location of the ISP and changing the contents of the letter based on whether or not a previous letter has already been sent. Thus the intelligent email and reporting module may include a plurality of different reporting documents providing predetermined content in many different languages.

In one exemplary embodiment of the present invention the intelligent email and reporting module includes a report generation feature. For example an administrator may use the intelligent email and report generating module to generate reports including data from one or more spoof site tracking records. For example the reports may be used to assist law enforcement officials in their data and evidence gathering tasks.

In one embodiment of the invention the control logic includes the spoof site monitor module to monitor intermittently or continuously whether a spoof site is still active after it has been reported and verified. For example the spoof site monitor module may periodically attempt to download the document associated with the URL in the spoof site tracking record. If the spoof site monitor module successfully downloads the document then the spoof site monitor module may update the spoof site tracking record to indicate the date and time at which the document was last downloaded successfully. If however the spoof site monitoring fails to download the document associated with a URL in a spoof site tracking record then the spoof site monitor module may update the spoof site tracking record accordingly and trigger a notice to an administrator to verify that the spoof site has been removed. In one embodiment in addition to determining whether the document associated with the URL is still available the spoof site monitor may compare an available document to a copy of the document stored in the spoof site tracking record to determine whether the document has been modified. In one embodiment even after the ISP has removed a spoof site the spoof site monitor module may periodically check e.g. on a monthly basis for a number of months after the spoof site is removed to check if the spoof site has reappeared.

In one embodiment of the invention the control logic also may include a spoof page fingerprint analyzer module . The analyzer module may analyze an Internet document e.g. an HTML document to determine unique characteristics of the document. Based on the characteristics of the document the analyzer module may assign the document a unique identifier. For example the analyzer module may assign an identifier to a document based on an analysis of its source code e.g. HTML code . Then when a new Internet document is analyzed the identifier of previously identified documents may be compared to the identifier assigned to the new document. If the identifiers match then there is a high probability that the source of the documents for example the author is the same. In this way the online enterprise can attempt to identify the source e.g. the author of new spoof sites based on an analysis of previously identified spoof pages.

In one embodiment of the invention the fraud tracking server may also include a toolbar application server . The toolbar application server may work in conjunction with various client security applications that execute for example on the client devices . For example in one embodiment of the invention a client security application in the form of a toolbar may operate in conjunction with a web browser application on one of the client devices . When a user browses Internet documents provided by the Internet servers if the user views a suspicious document the toolbar provides various security features to the user. If the user suspects the document e.g. web page as being a spoofed or fraudulent page the user may report this to the fraud tracking system using the toolbar e.g. clicking on a link or icon . In one embodiment the client security application may include an indicator that notifies the user whether the URL of the document that is being viewed is trusted or not. In one embodiment of the invention a trusted URL may be placed on a white list while URLs associated with known spoof sites are placed on a black list. The black list may be stored as a record in the fraud tracking database and automatically updated by the fraud tracking system .

In one embodiment of the invention the toolbar application server may include a black list updater module . The black list updater module may automatically update a black list by adding or deleting from the black list URLs that an administrator has verified as either being associated with known spoof sites or as legitimate. Consequently the client security application s black list may be updated automatically and immediately after an administrator has verified that a reported URL is associated with an actual spoof site or alternatively after an administrator has verified that the reported URL is legitimate.

Another feature of the toolbar application server is a query tool. For one embodiment of the invention a client security application allows a user of a client device or an administrator to perform a quick query of the fraud tracking database . For example a client security application in the form of a toolbar may allow a user to simply select a button or link on the toolbar to query the fraud tracking database to determine whether the URL of a document that is currently loaded in the user s browser has a corresponding spoof site tracking record in the fraud tracking database . If for example an administrator loads a document in a web browser application and the administrator believes the document to be associated with a spoof site the administrator can use the client security application to quickly query the fraud tracking database for information related to the URL of the document the administrator is viewing. If a spoof site tracking record exists for the URL then the administrator can update or edit the record. However if no spoof site tracking record exists the administrator can quickly add a spoof site tracking record to the fraud tracking database for the URL.

It will be appreciated that the various functional modules shown in may vary from one embodiment to the next. For example some embodiments may omit one or more of the modules while other embodiments may include additional modules. Furthermore the various functional components modules may be arranged in various different groups or not grouped at all. For example the URL extraction module need not be part of the communications module but may be provided elsewhere for example on a different server.

At operation the source code of the document associated with the URL is automatically downloaded and the spoof site tracking record is updated to include the source code. In one embodiment of the invention in addition to downloading the source code a screen shot of the actual document or web page is captured and stored with the spoof site tracking record . Furthermore in one exemplary embodiment of the invention the downloading operation occurs automatically in response to receiving verification from the administrator that the URL is associated with an actual spoof site. In an alternative embodiment of the invention the downloading operation may be performed manually by the administrator for example at the time the administrator views the document to verify that the potential spoof site is in fact an actual spoof site.

At operation the fraud tracking server notifies an administrator that a potential spoof site has been reported and that a spoof site tracking record has been generated. In one embodiment of the invention the notification is an email sent to the administrator. In an alternative embodiment the notification may simply be a visual indicator on an administrative interface of the fraud tracking server . It will be appreciated that potential spoof sites may be displayed as lists be tabulated or displayed and communicated to an administrator in any convenient fashion. In any case at operation the administrator may review the document associated with the reported URL to determine whether the document is associated with an actual spoof site. If the administrator determines that the potential spoof site is not an actual spoof site then the administrator may at operation update the spoof site tracking record to indicate the case is closed or resolved. It will however be appreciated that the administrator need not be notified and that the fraud tracking server may in one embodiment operate in a totally automated fashion without human intervention. For example communications may be sent automatically to an ISP or any other party facilitating the existence of the spoof site.

However if at operation the administrator determines that the potential spoof site is an actual spoof site then at operation the fraud tracking server automatically generates a communication such as an email addressed to a hosting party such as the ISP associated with the IP address of the server that served the document. For example in one embodiment of the invention the email may request that the ISP take action to remove the spoof site. In one embodiment of the invention the fraud tracking server can customize the email message by for example selecting a language that corresponds to the location e.g. country where the ISP is located. In addition the content of the email may be customized to properly address the problem based on the legal requirements of the particular jurisdiction in which the ISP falls. In an alternative embodiment of the invention rather than generating an email the fraud tracking server generates a letter.

After the ISP has been notified of the spoof site at operation the fraud tracking server may begin monitoring the spoof site to determine whether it remains active. For example in one embodiment of the invention the fraud tracking server will periodically attempt to download the document identified by the URL in the spoof site tracking record and compare it to the downloaded source code that is stored in the spoof site tracking record. If the document is successfully downloaded and matches the stored document then the fraud tracking server may update the spoof site tracking record to indicate that the spoof site is still active. If the spoof site continues to remain active then the fraud tracking system may continue to monitor the site at selected time intervals.

If however the document does not successfully download and or is not the same as the document on record in the spoof site tracking record then the fraud tracking server may update the spoof site tracking record accordingly and notify an administrator that the document needs to be reviewed. If after reviewing the document at operation the administrator determines that the spoof site has been removed the administrator may update the spoof site tracking record at operation to indicate that the case has been resolved. In one embodiment of the invention even after a case has been resolved the spoof site monitoring module may periodically revisit the URL to determine whether the site is once again active and if so notify an administrator. Furthermore in one embodiment of the invention during the automatic monitoring the spoof site monitor may automatically resolve some cases. For example in some cases e.g. when a 404 document not found error occurs the spoof site monitoring module may automatically update the spoof site tracking record accordingly.

The exemplary computer system includes a processor e.g. a central processing unit CPU a graphics processing unit GPU or both a main memory and a static memory which communicate with each other via a bus . The computer system may further include a video display unit e.g. a liquid crystal display LCD or a cathode ray tube CRT . The computer system also includes an alphanumeric input device e.g. a keyboard a cursor control device e.g. a mouse a disk drive unit a signal generation device e.g. a speaker and a network interface device .

The disk drive unit includes a machine readable medium on which is stored one or more sets of instructions e.g. software embodying any one or more of the methodologies or functions described herein. The software may also reside completely or at least partially within the main memory and or within the processor during execution thereof by the computer system the main memory and the processor also constituting machine readable media.

The software may further be transmitted or received over a network via the network interface device .

While the machine readable medium is shown in an exemplary embodiment to be a single medium the term machine readable medium should be taken to include a single medium or multiple media e.g. a centralized or distributed database and or associated caches and servers that store the one or more sets of instructions. The term machine readable medium shall also be taken to include any medium that is capable of storing encoding or carrying a set of instructions for execution by the machine and that cause the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies of the present invention. The term machine readable medium shall accordingly be taken to include but not be limited to solid state memories optical and magnetic media and carrier wave signals.

Although the present invention has been described in the context of tracking spoof sites it will be appreciated that the present invention may have many other practical applications. For example the present invention may be utilized to track and monitor web sites that fall within any predefined category including web sites that are generally associated with other illegal activities. For example law enforcement officials might utilize an embodiment of the present invention to track web sites utilized for illegal drug trafficking terrorist activities and or child pornography.

Thus a method and system for tracking fraudulent activities have been described. Although the present invention has been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments it will be evident that various modifications and changes may be made to these embodiments without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly the specification and drawings are to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense.
