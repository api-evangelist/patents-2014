title: Data routing in a content distribution network for mobility delivery
abstract: System(s) and method(s) are provided to route data within a network of content with specific service constraints to mobile devices. A mobile network management component receives an identifier (ID) of a base station that serves a mobile device that originates a request for data, and relays the ID to a network platform that administers content. A mapping that associates one or more base stations with a deployed content node and the received ID are utilized to identify a content node to serve the request for data via the base station. The received request for data is directed to the identified content node. A service constraint configuration can be allocated for exchange of payload data between the mobile device and the network platform. For a request to consume data and a request to supply data, identified content node delivers data and receives data, respectively, in accordance with the service constraint allocation.

This application claims priority to and is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 637 939 filed on Dec. 15 2009 and entitled DATA ROUTING IN A CONTENT DISTRIBUTION NETWORK FOR MOBILITY DELIVERY. The entirety of the above noted application is incorporated herein by reference.

The subject disclosure relates generally to communication networks and more specifically to networked distribution of content or data with specific service constraints to mobile devices.

A Content Distribution Network CDN deploys a large number of servers in geographically distributed areas content e.g. web pages files email messages media . . . from a content provider can be cached in the deployed servers so that the content can be delivered efficiently and quickly to end users in response to a request for data therefrom. Delivery of cached content generally can avoid delays due to slow transport or congested backhaul links at the time of the request and can prevent overload of the content provider s servers if the number of requests for data is substantive. In a conventional CDN content is made available to end users according to the end users location within a space of logical addresses such as internet protocol IP addresses for the mobile device as well as other factors such as network load e.g. cache server s load or other parameters relevant to the content provider s preferences. The conventional CDN utilizes information on the IP address of a device associated with the end user as well as the other parameters to determine a cache server or CDN node from which a request for data from an end user is to be served.

When the device from which an end user requests for data e.g. content from the conventional CDN is a mobile device such as a phone the request for content is delivered from the mobile phone to a nearby base station of a mobile service provider in the geographical area in which the mobile device operates. From the base station the request is sent over the service provider s core network to an access network such as the Internet through which the request for data is delivered to the conventional CDN. As indicated supra the CDN determines to which CDN node to send the request for data based primarily on the IP address of the end user s device namely the IP address of the mobile phone. Since such IP address is assigned dynamically when the mobile device initiates a data session e.g. connects to the internet substantial signaling is incurred as a result of routing data from the CDN to the mobile device with the ensuing increase in control traffic and processing at the CDN servers which thus renders conventional data routing in CDN largely inefficient.

The following presents a simplified summary of the subject disclosure in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects thereof. This summary is not an extensive overview of the subject disclosure. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements nor delineate any scope. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the various embodiments of the subject disclosure in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.

One or more embodiments provide data routing or organization of data exchange in a network of content for mobility delivery. The one or more embodiments can allow optimization of performance of data exchange amongst a mobile device and the network of content e.g. content distribution network. In the alternative such data exchange can be conducted within a satisfactory level of performance. In an aspect the network of content is embodied in a content distribution network CDN which comprises a CDN platform and a set of remotely deployed CDN nodes one or more CDN nodes in the set are operationally linked to one or more base stations. To route or organize data exchange a mobile network management component which can reside within a core network of a cellular wireless network or a service network external to the wireless network receives an identifier ID of a base station that serves a mobile device that originates a request for data. The request for data can be a request to consume content or to supply content. The mobile network management component relays the ID to a network platform that administers content e.g. the CDN platform. A routing component within the network platform identifies a content node e.g. a CDN node through a mapping that associates one or more base stations with a deployed content node and the received ID the identified content node serves the request for data. In addition the routing component can allocate a service constraint or quality of service QoS configuration for exchange e.g. transmission or reception of payload data between the mobile device and the network platform. To serve data or content to the mobile device the identified CDN node receives the request for data and the service constraint configuration. For a request to consume data and a request to supply data identified content node delivers data and receives data respectively in accordance with the service constraint allocation.

As described in greater detail below one or more embodiment of the subject disclosure can enable data routing within a network of content with specific service constraints to mobile devices. The one or more embodiments can allow optimization of performance of data exchange amongst a mobile device and the network of content e.g. content distribution network. In the alternative such data exchange can be conducted within a satisfactory level of performance. A mobile network management component receives an identifier ID of a base station that serves a mobile device that originates a request for data and relays the ID to a network platform that administers content. A mapping that associates one or more base stations with a deployed content node and the received ID are utilized to identify a content node to serve the request for data via the base station. The received request for data is directed to the identified content node. A service constraint configuration can be allocated for exchange of payload data between the mobile device and the network platform. For a request to consume data and a request to supply data identified content node delivers data and receives data respectively in accordance with the service constraint allocation.

To route data and regulate e.g. increase service constraints or quality of service QoS the one or more embodiments described herein advantageously exploit aspects or features that are intrinsic to yet not limited to interaction amongst a content distribution network CDN and a mobile network. In particular though not exclusively aspects or features include the following. 1 End user data e.g. traffic and control data e.g. signaling in mobile communications are transmitted or received through a base station administered by a telecommunication carrier or mobile service provider wherein the location of the base station which is fixed in geographical location. 2 CDN nodes also are in fixed or substantially static in geographical locations and deployment density of CDN nodes number of commissioned CDN nodes per unit area is generally lower than deployment density of base stations e.g. number of provisioned and active base stations per unit area .

With reference to the drawings is a block diagram of an example system that enables routing of content in a content distribution network CDN based in part on base station deployment information. In the subject example system a mobility management MM component is functionally connected through link s to base station s which comprises a set of one or more base stations deployed in a macrocellular coverage area. In an aspect mobility management component can be embodied in a gateway node e.g. Gateway GPRS Support Node GGSN a Serving GPRS Support Node SGSN Mobility Management Entity MME a Session Border Control SBC node an application server or the like. Accordingly in one or more embodiments MM management component can include a processor that executes code instructions to provide at least in part the functionality described herein. One or more base stations within base station s can receive a request for data from a device mobile or otherwise which can communicate wirelessly through wireless link s with the one or more base stations the request for data can be at least one of a request to consume e.g. download data or a request to supply e.g. upload data. At least the one or more base stations that receive the request for data can serve it e.g. deliver or receive content e.g. payload data in response to the request for data. To receive or deliver data e.g. traffic signaling in an aspect the one or more base stations which are part of base station s can include a communication platform and associated circuitry and antenna s a processor and a memory wherein the processor can execute code instructions retained in the memory in order to provide the functionality of the base station as described herein. In addition the circuitry associated with the communication platform via at least in part the processor can process e.g. modulate demodulate multiplex demultiplex . . . signal s received or to be conveyed through the antenna s in the communication platform. Processing of the signal s can proceed in accordance with one or more telecommunication protocols associated with one or more radio technologies such as those indicated supra.

A content distribution network CDN provides the served content or payload data. In an aspect of the subject disclosure the content distribution network comprises a CDN platform functionally connected to MM component through an interface and CDN node s which comprises a set of CDN nodes deployed in one or more geographical areas. Interface can include at least one of a conventional wired link a wireless link or a reference link and associated component s . In one or more embodiments interface that can include at least one of a conventional wired link a wireless link or a reference link and associated component s . Link s functionally connect CDN platform to CDN node s . In addition CDN node s are functionally connected to base station s through one or more interfaces which can include at least one of a conventional wired link a wireless link or a reference link and associated component s .

To deliver content to or receive content from device the CDN utilizes information on deployment of base station s and relationship s between the deployment of the base station s and CDN nodes . The relationship s can allow optimization of communication amongst device and the CDN through optimization of selection of a CDN node to serve a request for data. In an aspect CDN platform exploits at least in part content server s in addition to routing component and mapping component . While in example system content server s are illustrated as external to routing component and mapping component in one or more embodiments one or more of routing component and mapping component can be included within one or more content server s . Routing component receives a request for data from mobility management component and exploits a mapping that associates a set of base stations e.g. base station s in a wireless macrocellular network with deployed CDN node s to identify or to select a CDN node that can serve at least in part the request for data. As an example routing component can inspect a look up table that embodies the mapping and is retained in memory within mapping s to inspect such look up table routing component can execute at least in part code instructions not shown retained in memory . In one or more additional or alternative embodiments mapping component can be configured to identify or select or can identify or select the CDN node that can serve at least in part the request for data. In such one or more embodiments the mapping component can supply an identification of the identified or selected CDN node to routing component . The identification can be supplied in response to a request from routing component to identify or select a suitable CDN node to serve a request for data.

After a suitable CDN node has been selected or identified routing component directs the request for data to the selected or identified CDN node. When device is a mobile device it should be appreciated that the subject routing effected by routing component transforms the problem of dealing with a logical address e.g. internet protocol IP address allocated to device and that changes due to mobility thereof to dealing with a fixed or substantially fixed logical address e.g. IP address of the base station that serves the device wherein the logical address of the base station and a serving CDN node linked thereto can be readily extracted from the aforementioned mapping e.g. a look up table.

The request for data received by routing component can be a request to supply data or to consume data and can include an identifier ID for the base station within base station s that receives the request for data from device . In one or more scenarios a base station ID can be a composite entity that includes an internet protocol IP address of the base station in addition to a wireless network ID e.g. cell identity for the base station. In the mapping a single logical address e.g. internet protocol IP address of a CDN node can be linked to one or more base station IDs. To identify or select a suitable CDN node routing component can access the mapping directly or via mapping component the mapping can be retained in memory within mapping s storage also referred to herein and in annexed drawings are mapping s . To access the mapping via mapping component routing component can deliver a directive to provide data and receive the requested data from mapping component in response to the directive. Routing component can access the mapping when it executes at least in part routing algorithms or implements at least in part routing methods which can include one or more of the example methods described herein. Routing algorithms or routing methods can be retained in algorithm store .

In another aspect of the subject disclosure since the request for data conveys a base station ID and such conveyance indicates that a mobile device originates the request for data routing component via e.g. a service configuration component not shown can configure a service constraint for exchange e.g. delivery or reception of payload data solicited in the request for data. The service constraint or service constraint indication can include a quality of service QoS class or a predetermined bit rate or upper or lower bound thereof. In an illustrative scenario to configure or generate a service constraint routing component through the service configuration component not shown for example can i assess at least one of volume of data requested to be delivered e.g. downloaded or received e.g. uploaded subscriber class e.g. business or personal of device e.g. that originates the request for data or network conditions e.g. load channel quality conditions and ii determined a QoS class or bit rate to serve the request for data. To conduct such assessment routing component via service configuration component not shown can exchange data with MM component which can access database s to supply requested information such as wireless network conditions or subscriber class. Routing component e.g. via the service configuration component not shown can supply an indication of the service constraint or QoS class to at least one of a CDN node identified or selected as part of routing data in response to the request for data. The CDN node can relay the service constraint or service constraint indication to the base station that is associated with the CDN node in accordance with a mapping employed to route data in response to the request for data. Accordingly routing component can provide QoS to a mobile device e.g. that submits a request for data to a CDN. Providing QoS class or service constraint s also can optimize data exchange e.g. transmission of data amongst the mobile device e.g. that submits the request for data and the CDN node that serves at least in part the request for data.

If a request for data is a request to consume e.g. download data a CDN node within CDN node s that is identified by routing component based at least in part on a base station ID and a mapping can receive the request for data and a QoS configuration and can transmit data solicited in the request for data wherein the transmission is performed in accordance with the QoS configuration. The CDN node transmits the data to an associated base station within base station s that serves telecommunication with device the base station relays the data received from the CDN node to the device which originated the request for data.

In the alternative if the request for data is a request to supply data e.g. upload data a CDN node within CDN node s that is identified by routing component based at least in part on a base station ID and a mapping can receive the request for data and a QoS configuration and can deliver an indication to serve the request for data in accordance with the QoS configuration. Such indication is delivered to a base station that is associated with the CDN node via the mapping and serves telecommunication with device which originated the request for data. The base station delivers a request for payload data consistent with the request for data e.g. the request to upload data and in response the device provides the payload data. The base station receives the payload data and relays such data to the CDN node associated with the base station the CDN node forwards the payload data to the routing component which retains the data in a memory functionally coupled with a CDN platform e.g. or a content server e.g. that includes the routing component .

As indicated supra the mapping characterizes the relationship s between the deployment of the base station s and CDN nodes and can provide identification or allow selection of a CDN node that is geographically closest or sufficiently geographically close e.g. based in part on predetermined operation criteria to a specific base station. A mapping is established before a request for data is served and can optimize performance or accomplish a satisfactory level of performance of service of the request for data via selection of CDN node associated with a base station that receives the request for data from device . In an aspect performance optimization or performance within a satisfactory level can be measured against objective metrics such as a communication costs. Apart from temporary distribution network congestion or special service requests from an administration of the content or the content owner lowest communications costs for content to be delivered to a mobile device connected to a base station can be obtained if the CDN node closest to the base station is utilized to serve a request for data.

A mapping associates a base station s to CDN node s in a one to one relationship or a many to one relationship. In an aspect many to one relationships within a mapping can be common because density of CDN node deployment can be typically lower than density of base station deployment. The mapping can be configured and upgraded as base station deployment or wireless network plan s are modified however in common scenarios base station location and location of a related CDN node remains largely unchanged because a provisioned base station and a CDN node remains in substantially unchanged locations or geographical loci. To generate a mapping mapping component can receive deployment information e.g. information retained in network plan in database s from mobility management component and associate such deployment information with knowledge of CDN node deployment or configuration within the CDN in order to form a mapping that associates one or more base stations with a geographically closest or sufficiently close CDN node. The deployment information can include base station identifiers IDs such as cell identities which are generated at a time a base station is provisioned and activated in a macrocellular network. Mapping component can commit a mapping to memory . In an aspect database s can be embodied in one or more of a Home Subscriber Server HSS a Home Location Register HLR a Visitor Location Register VLR a backend service database or the like. Database s can be functionally connected mobility management component through an interface that can include at least one of a conventional wired link a wireless link or a reference link and associated component s . In another aspect network plan can be updated at predetermined intervals or based on events such as updates to a wireless network that includes and administers MM component .

Features or aspects of the subject disclosure and one or more embodiments thereof have at least the following advantages with respect to conventional data routing in content distribution networks. i When compared to selection of a CDN node through calculation of location of a mobile device that originates a request for data based on the mobile device s allocated IP address utilization of knowledge of deployment e.g. location of base stations in a macrocellular network reduces the time necessary to select a CDN node to serve a request for data. As indicated supra deployment information can be largely static or it can be changed in time scales much larger than time scales in which IP address es of a mobile device is updated due to mobility. ii Optimization of selection of a CDN node to serve a request for data e.g. deliver content requested by a mobile end user results in shorter fulfillment time e.g. delivery time to the end user and therefore it can lead to improved end user experience. iii Allocation e.g. configuration and provisioning of service constraint s or QoS for a device that communicates wirelessly and originates a request for data can result in shorter fulfillment time e.g. delivery time from CDN to the end user or upload time to CDN from end user device and therefore improved end user experience. In general at least the subject advantages can result in improved end user experience which can translate in increased end user perceived quality of service with respect to the CDN service provider e.g. an administrator of CDN platform or CDN node s and can generate a potential business differentiator.

Content server includes processor s which can be configured to provide or can provide at least in part the described functionality of the various components or interface s within content service . In an aspect I O interface s can enable at least networked connectivity as an example I O interface s can receive data or request s for data from MM management component not shown in through interface . Moreover in an aspect I O interface s can be part of interface . To provide such functionality processor s can exploit bus to exchange data or any other information amongst components within content server and memory or elements therein such as data store . Bus can be embodied in at least one of a memory bus a system bus an address bus a message bus or any other conduit protocol or mechanism for data or information exchange among components that execute a process or are part of execution of a process. The exchanged information can include at least one of code instructions code structure s data structures or the like. Processor s also can execute code instructions not shown stored in memory to implement or provide at least part of the described functionality of content server and routing component and mapping component .

In one or more alternative or additional embodiment s processor s can be distributed amongst components of content server . In further one or more alternative or additional embodiments one or more components of content server can be implemented as a software application or a firmware application and can reside within memory as one or more sets of code instructions that when executed by processor s implement the one or more components and described functionality thereof.

In addition CDN nodes include respectively processor s which can be configured to execute or can execute code instructions not shown retained within respective memories in order to provide the functionality of a CDN node as described herein.

Moreover I O interfaces can include at least part of interfaces . In an aspect in addition to content such data can include request s for data service constraint indication s and other information described herein. In addition for a CDN node bus can enable information exchange amongst processor I O interface and memory with 1 2 . . . M. Each bus can be embodied in substantially the same manner as bus .

In a second example scenario device uploads content to CDN platform . Communication path for content upload is illustrated with arrow . As described supra device can submit a request for data through base station to which device is attached the request for data is a request to supply data. In response to the request for data and after an identity e.g. cell identity for base station has been received via at least in part mobility management component CDN platform or one or more components therein can identify CDN node through a mapping e.g. mapping that logically links such CDN node to base station . The mapping can be the same mapping exploited by CDN platform or a component therein e.g. routing component to identify CDN node with one or more base stations or . Further in response requested data is delivered by CDN through base station as described supra.

In order to provide additional context for the various embodiments of the subject disclosure presents a high level block diagram of an example network environment in which aspects described herein can be implemented or exploited. Generally network platform can include one or more components e.g. node s gateway node s interface s server s or platform s that enable both packet switched PS e.g. internet protocol IP frame relay asynchronous transfer mode ATM and circuit switched CS traffic e.g. voice and data and control generation for networked communication wireless or otherwise. In an aspect of the subject disclosure a functional element within a PS domain of network platform can embody MM component as described herein PS gateway node s can embody at least part the PS domain. In an example scenario the functional element within the PS domain can enable exchange of MS communications in one or more of the following transport protocols MMS protocol SIMPLE XMPP or IMPS protocol. With respect to CS communication network platform includes CS gateway node s which can interface CS traffic received from legacy networks like telephony network s e.g. public switched telephone network PSTN or public land mobile network PLMN or a SS7 network . CS gateway node s also can enable exchange of MS communications in SMS protocol. In addition CS gateway node s can authorize and authenticate traffic e.g. voice arising from such networks. Moreover CS gateway node s can access mobility or roaming data generated through SS7 network for instance mobility data stored in a VLR which can reside in memory . Furthermore CS gateway node s can interface CS based traffic or signaling with PS gateway node s . As an example in a 3GPP UMTS network CS gateway node s can be embodied at least in part in gateway GPRS support node s GGSN .

In the subject disclosure in addition to receiving and processing CS switched traffic and signaling PS gateway node s can authorize and authenticate PS based data sessions with device s mobile or otherwise served through access network s via link s wireless or wired e.g. reference links or wireless link s . Access network s can include base station s not shown to which CDN platform which can be part of service network s can connect via interface s . Data sessions can include traffic exchange with networks external to network platform such as wide area network s WAN s or service network s local area network s LAN s also can be interfaced with network platform through PS gateway node s . In an aspect such data sessions can include sessions that include requests for data and data delivery as described herein. Network interface s enable the traffic exchange such interface s can include conventional wired or wireless links or reference links specific to each of the external network s that interface with the PS domain e.g. PS gateway node s of network platform. In an aspect packet switched gateway node s can generate packet data protocol PDP contexts when a data session is established. To at least that end in an aspect PS gateway node s can include a tunnel interface e.g. tunnel termination gateway TTG in 3GPP UMTS network s not shown which can facilitate packetized communication with disparate wireless network s which can be part of access network s and can include Wi Fi networks femtocell network s macrocellular network s and associated radio access network s RAN s based on various radio technology generations etc. It should be further appreciated that packetized communication can include multiple flows that can be generated through server s such as management server s e.g. a provisioning server or application server s . It is to be noted that in 3GPP UMTS network s PS gateway node s e.g. GGSN and tunnel interface e.g. TTG comprise a packet data gateway PDG .

In network environment network platform also includes serving node s that conveys the various packetized flows of data streams that can be directed to device s and that are received through PS gateway node s from server s . In turn server s can receive the communication s such as request for data intended to service network s or CDN platform therein from various device s not shown . As an example in a 3GPP UMTS network serving node s can be embodied in serving GPRS support node s SGSN .

At act a request for data that includes an identity or identifier of a base station is received. In an aspect receiving the request for data includes receiving the request for data indirectly from a mobile device see e.g. that originates the request for data and communicates wirelessly with the base station. In another aspect in one or more additional or alternative embodiments the request for data may be received directly from the mobile device for instance depending on the architecture of a CDN platform e.g. the mobile device can wirelessly deliver the request for data to the CDN platform. As described supra the identity or identifier can be at least one of a cell identification a sector identification or a logical address e.g. IP address for the base station. The request for data can be a request to consume e.g. receive or download content e.g. web based content . At act a content node associated with the base station is identified the content node is part of a set of nodes deployed within a content distribution network CDN . In an aspect the content node is identified through a predetermined mapping. The predetermined mapping establishes a relationship amongst the content node with one or more base stations provisioned and active to provide service to a mobile device the relationship amongst the content node and the one or more base stations can be a one to one relationship or a one to many relationship. In another aspect the content node identified through the mapping is located within a predetermined geographical distance from the base station thus identifying the content node includes selecting the content node in a content distribution network that is located within a predetermined geographical distance form the base station. At act in response to the request for data such request for data is directed or routed to the content node. In addition a service constraint indication to serve the request for data is supplied. In a scenario if the request for data is a request to consume data e.g. content the service constraint indication can be a QoS configuration e.g. a QoS class or a predetermined bit rate or upper bound or lower bound thereof to deliver payload data solicited in the request for data. In an alternative scenario if the request for data is a request to supply data e.g. content the service constraint indication can be a QoS configuration to receive payload data e.g. content associated with the request for data.
