This application is a Non Provisional Application that claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 777 923 filed Mar. 12 2013 the entire specification of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The present disclosure relates to methods systems and computer readable medium for managing voicemail systems.

Entities such as a company and or an organization can have a voicemail system for customers and or other users to leave a voicemail message. For instance a voicemail system can include a computer based system comprised of a plurality of voicemail boxes. A voicemail box can include a greeting and an operating space to store voicemail messages. Each voicemail box can be associated with a particular representative e.g. an employee from the entity can be associated with a sub portion of the entity e.g. business unit and or can be a general voicemail box e.g. associated with the entity as a whole .

The present disclosure provides method system and computer readable medium embodiments for managing voicemail system.

Customers business associates and or other users associated with an entity may call the entity to reach a particular representative of the entity to perform a transaction and or conduct business and or to resolve an issue among other reasons. The entity can use a call center e.g. a general number comprising a number of representatives to handle the volume of calls individual representatives may each have a unique phone number to be reached at and or a combination thereof. However in some instances the entity may not have enough human resources to answer each call as they are received and or a particular representative may be unavailable. In such instances the entity may use a voicemail system to allow the user to leave a voice message.

A voicemail system as used herein can include a computer based system that allows users e.g. customers and subscribers e.g. representatives of the entity to exchange personal voice messages to select and deliver voice information and to process transactions relating to the entity using an ordinary telephone. A user may leave a voicemail message using the voicemail system and or may end the call prior to leaving a voicemail message for instance. A subscriber upon receiving one or more voicemail messages can listen and or respond to the one or more voicemail messages in the order received and or based on a priority.

However in various instances an entity may have a volume of voicemail messages in their voicemail system that cannot be answered within a reasonable amount of time. For example an entity may determine and or set a goal to listen and or respond to voicemail messages within one day. A particular subscriber and or unit may have a volume of voicemail messages that represent more time than one day and thereby may be unable to listen and or respond to all voicemail messages within the day goal. As a result the entity may lose users e.g. customers may miss a business opportunity and or may tarnish their image.

Managing a voicemail system for an entity can assist an entity in retaining users and or business opportunities increasing revenue increasing employee productivity and or increasing the entities reputations as compared to using a voicemail system and or call center individually. Managing a voicemail system in accordance with various embodiments can include using a voicemail management system to manage the voicemail system. A voicemail management system as used herein can include hardware components and or computer readable instruction components designated and or designed to track trends of the voicemail system to identify high volume voicemail times trends of individual subscriber response times to voicemail messages and a total time needed to listen to all active voicemail messages e.g. queued voice messages . The voicemail management system can increase employee productivity by enabling management to proactively allocate human resources based on high voicemail message volume areas and or times. Further the voicemail management system can enhance user experience through reduced callback time as compare to an unmanaged voicemail system.

The arrows illustrated in the embodiment of represent communication between hardware and or computer readable instruction components. The communication can be performed for instance using application programming interfaces APIs . An API as used herein can include a specification that can be used as an interface by computer readable instruction components e.g. software to communicate.
