title: Drive performance measurement
abstract: A motor drive is provided with integrated frequency response analysis tools for generating drive performance metrics that are independent of motion profile and tuning. The metrics are broadly applicable to a wide range of applications, tunings, and load types, and can be used to fairly compare performance across different drives models and assist in drive selection. The frequency analysis tools include a transformation algorithm that reduces or eliminates spectral leakages, a signal generation component that scales the test input signal as a function of frequency avoid saturation based on defined limits of the controlled system, and a phase unwrapping algorithm that correctly unwraps the phase of open-loop and closed-loop response curves. The frequency response analysis tools yield an open-loop response, a closed-loop response, a tracking error response, and a disturbance rejection response, which are used to derive performance metrics for the drive.

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends certain illustrative aspects are described herein in connection with the following description and the annexed drawings. These aspects are indicative of various ways which can be practiced all of which are intended to be covered herein. Other advantages and novel features may become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the drawings.

The subject disclosure is now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout.

It may be evident however that the subject disclosure can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate a description thereof.

As used in this application the terms component system platform layer controller terminal station node interface are intended to refer to a computer related entity or an entity related to or that is part of an operational apparatus with one or more specific functionalities wherein such entities can be either hardware a combination of hardware and software software or software in execution.

As used herein the terms to infer and inference refer generally to the process of reasoning about or inferring states of the system environment and or user from a set of observations as captured via events and or data. Inference can be employed to identify a specific context or action or can generate a probability distribution over states for example. The inference can be probabilistic that is the computation of a probability distribution over states of interest based on a consideration of data and events. Inference can also refer to techniques employed for composing higher level events from a set of events and or data. Such inference results in the construction of new events or actions from a set of observed events and or stored event data whether or not the events are correlated in close temporal proximity and whether the events and data come from one or several event and data sources.

In addition the term or is intended to mean an inclusive or rather than an exclusive or. That is unless specified otherwise or clear from the context the phrase X employs A or B is intended to mean any of the natural inclusive permutations. That is the phrase X employs A or B is satisfied by any of the following instances X employs A X employs B or X employs both A and B. In addition the articles a and an as used in this application and the appended claims should generally be construed to mean one or more unless specified otherwise or clear from the context to be directed to a singular form.

Furthermore the term set as employed herein excludes the empty set e.g. the set with no elements therein. Thus a set in the subject disclosure includes one or more elements or entities. As an illustration a set of controllers includes one or more controllers a set of data resources includes one or more data resources etc. Likewise the term group as utilized herein refers to a collection of one or more entities e.g. a group of nodes refers to one or more nodes.

Various aspects or features will be presented in terms of systems that may include a number of devices components modules and the like. It is to be understood and appreciated that the various systems may include additional devices components modules etc. and or may not include all of the devices components modules etc. discussed in connection with the figures. A combination of these approaches also can be used.

Motion control systems are integral to many industrial automation applications. These systems generally comprise an electric motor or servo connected to a mechanical load and a motor drive that controls the motor to facilitate moving or actuating the mechanical load according to a predefined control routine. The motor drive may be a stand alone drive that controls the motor according to a control routine stored locally on the drive or alternatively may operate under supervision of a control program executed by a separate industrial controller e.g. a programmable logic controller or the like which communicates with the motor drive over a plant network or via discrete hardwired I O.

When designing a motion control system or upgrading an existing system system designers endeavor to select a motor drive having operational and performance specifications that best suit the mechanical load to be controlled. Selection of a suitable motor drive can depend on such factors as the horsepower of the motor mechanical characteristics of the mechanical load driven by the motor speed and or precision of movement required by the industrial application and other such factors. In general a key criterion in selecting a suitable motor drive for a new or existing industrial application is the drive performance in terms of how precisely the drive can move a given mechanical load.

However it is often difficult to identify the best drive for a given customer application since motor drives are not typically classified by performance. This is due in part to the fact that there are no standards or metrics to characterize drive performance which depends in part on customer specific or application specific factors such as the drive s parameters control loop tuning the motor being controlled the mechanical characteristics of the load being driven by the motor etc. Consequently the drive selection process generally considers the drive s specifications features and cost but does not account for performance. On the drive manufacturer side the drive development process also fails to account for performance instead market research is conducted to determine the desired product specifications and the drive is designed to ensure that the specification is met.

Moreover there are currently no tools or guidelines that provide a fair drive performance comparison across different motor drive types models or families Although some initial insight regarding performance differences among various motor drive platforms can be obtained based on system designers experience technical drive specifications and experimental tests these approaches to predicting and comparing drive performance levels becomes less reliable as the differences in drive specifications from different drive platform become less distinct.

Some insight into drive performance can also be obtained from control loop update time modeling analysis or proof of concepts. However control loop update time represents only one of many factors that dictate drive performance. Since modeling analysis requires a case by case analysis of the particular system to be controlled such analysis does not enable easy drive performance comparison between different drive platforms.

As a new generation of motor drives is being developed to replace older drives system designers must be assured that the performance of the new drives will meet or exceed the performance of the older drives. Since there are no tools or metrics to identify and quantify drive performance the existing design process does not guarantee an increase in performance from the older drives to the new generation of motor drives.

Conventional frequency response methods can generally be used to identify performance of a motion system. However such approaches which are based on textbook formulas and assumptions often fail to obtain accurate frequency response results in industrial applications due to high computation time lack of guidelines for dealing with resonance frequencies computation errors e.g. spectral leakage due to the dependency on the number of data samples and linear spacing between measured frequencies and characterization errors caused by small signal analysis or saturation.

Dyne testing is sometimes used to characterize a drive performance. However this time domain test provides performance data for a single operating condition in terms of motion profile tuning gains frame size motor and load. These results are not easily translated to customer scenarios or across different drive platforms. In general time domain tests are dependent on motion profile tuning and load. Consequently such tests capture the system performance for a particular operating condition and do not provide enough information about the system to generalize the results for deriving the system performance at other operating conditions.

Control loop update time may also be indicative of drive performance. However control loop update time is only one of many factors that affect the drive s performance. Other factors affecting drive performance include but are not limited to compliance backlash the motor drive load combination position velocity and current loop bandwidth control loop and power converter architecture filter types and discretization methods hardware and software limits tuning motion profile coarse update rate etc. Since the impact of each of these factors on the drive performance is unknown the use of a single factor such as control loop update time to describe or compare drive performance is unreliable.

Accordingly one or more embodiments of the present disclosure relate to techniques for generating drive performance metrics based on the frequency response of a drive motor and load system. Four performance metrics are derived using the techniques described herein open loop response closed loop response tracking error response and disturbance rejection response. The techniques for deriving these performance metrics yield results that are drive platform independent and which are applicable over a broad range of industrial applications and operating scenarios. Once obtained these performance metrics can be applied in a number of ways. For example the performance metrics can be used to fairly compare drive performance across a variety of motor drives and to classify the drives by performance level. The performance metrics can also be used to tune the drives for high performance identify system bandwidth estimate compliance and measure resonance frequencies.

In some scenarios the performance metrics can also be used in a simulation environment to predict machine performance. Simulations that leverage the performance metrics can also be used to tune the system and to predict position following error and torque requirements for a given motion profile.

In some embodiments the computational tools e.g. frequency response algorithms signal generators Bode tools etc. for determining the drive performance metrics can be embedded on the drive itself e.g. as embedded firmware features.

To provide a general context for the systems and methods for deriving drive performance metrics described herein illustrates a simplified closed loop motor control system. Mechanical load represents a motor driven movable component of an industrial automation system e.g. a positioning system a conveyor a single axis or multi axis robot a pump a centrifuge etc. . Motor is mechanically coupled to mechanical load and drives the motion of mechanical load in response to a control signal provided by motor drive . Motor drive may be for example a variable frequency drive VFD a servo drive or other type of drive. VFDs control the speed position and or torque of alternating current AC motors by controlling the frequency and voltage of three phase power delivered to the motor . Servo drives control the speed position or torque of servo motors by controlling the duty cycle of pulse outputs to the motor .

Motor drive may be a stand alone drive that controls motor according to a control routine stored locally on the drive. For configurations using stand alone motor drives the control signal to the motor is determined based on a position speed or torque reference value generated by the local control routine on the motor drive. This reference value represents the desired position speed or torque of the mechanical load at a given time. Alternatively motor drive may be configured to operate under supervision of a control program execute by a separate industrial controller e.g. a programmable logic controller a safety controller or the like which communicates with motor drive over a plant network or via discrete hardwired I O. In such configurations industrial controller runs a control program comprising code used to process input signals read into the controller where the code can comprise for example ladder logic sequential function charts function block diagrams or structured text. Industrial controller will then generate instruction outputs e.g. reference signals indicating a desired position speed and or torque for mechanical load in accordance with the control program.

In closed loop configurations the motor drive also reads a feedback signal from the motor indicating a present state e.g. position velocity etc. of the motor and or mechanical load . The feedback signal may be generated for example by a resolver or encoder that tracks an absolute or relative position of the motor or by a speed or position estimator. When the motor drive commands the motor to move the mechanical load to a new position or to transition to a new speed the motor drive and or industrial controller monitors the feedback signal to ensure that the mechanical load has accurately transitioned to the desired position or speed. The motor drive or industrial controller compares the actual position speed of the mechanical load as indicated by the feedback signal with the target position speed and adjusts the control signal as needed to reduce or eliminate error between the actual and target positions speeds. It is to be appreciated that the systems and methods described herein for estimating drive performance metrics are not limited to use with the exemplary types of motion control systems described above but rather are applicable for substantially any type of drive based motion control system.

Motor drive can include a control component a user interface component a signal generator component a performance metric component a controller interface component one or more processors and memory . In various embodiments one or more of the control component user interface component signal generator component performance metric component controller interface component the one or more processors and memory can be electrically and or communicatively coupled to one another to perform one or more of the functions of the motor drive . In some embodiments components and can comprise software instructions stored on memory and executed by processor s . Motor drive may also interact with other hardware and or software components not depicted in . For example processor s may interact with one or more external user interface devices such as a keyboard a mouse a display monitor a touchscreen or other such interface devices.

Control component can be configured to control the motor drive s outputs e.g. three phase voltage outputs pulse output frequency or other type of control signaling to an associated motor based on either a local control configuration in the case of stand alone drives or in response to commands issued by industrial controller communicatively coupled to the motor drive . User interface component can be configured to receive user input and to render output to the user in any suitable format e.g. visual audio tactile etc. . In some embodiments user interface component can be configured to communicate with a graphical user interface e.g. a programming or development platform that executes on a separate hardware device e.g. a laptop computer tablet computer smart phone etc. communicatively connected to motor drive . In such configurations user interface component can receive input parameter data entered by the user via the graphical user interface and deliver output data e.g. drive performance metric data to the interface. As will be described in more detail below input parameter data can include for example a selected performance metric of interest a signal generator frequency range dynamic test limits or other such parameters. Output data can comprise for example performance metric information frequency response results machine signature data or other such information.

Signal generator component can be configured to generate the input signal to be delivered to the motor mechanical load during performance metric testing. Signal generator component can generate the input signal in accordance with the input parameters provided by the user as well as internal signal generating algorithms that scale the sine wave amplitude as a function of test frequency in order to mitigate noise issues and maintain a signal strength to avoid saturation and small signal analysis as will be described in more detail below. Performance metric component can be configured to generate a set of frequency responses for the four performance metrics based on the input signal used to control the mechanical system and the corresponding measured output signal. Performance metric component can also calculate associated metrics corresponding to the frequency response results e.g. zero crossing bandwidth gain margins phase margins position and velocity errors etc. .

Controller interface component can be configured to exchange data with an industrial controller either over a hardwired or a networked connection. For networked connections controller interface component can be configured to communicate with the controller over substantially any type of network including but not limited to control and information protocol CIP networks e.g. DeviceNet ControlNet Ethernet IP etc. Ethernet DH DH Remote I O Fieldbus Modbus Profibus CAN wireless networks serial protocols or other such networks.

The one or more processors can perform one or more of the functions described herein with reference to the systems and or methods disclosed. Memory can be a computer readable storage medium storing computer executable instructions and or information for performing the functions described herein with reference to the systems and or methods disclosed.

During the test sequence the signal generator component sends a sine wave input signal to the control loop of measured system based on the input parameters provided by the user and by drive limitations e.g. encoder resolution and system inertia . The sine wave input signal can be a position velocity or current command signal for position velocity and current loop tests respectively . The signal generator component produces the sine wave input signal such that the amplitude and frequency of the signal keeps the drive within the limits of the drive and motor.

During the test sequence performance metric component captures system data over a range of frequencies and builds a metric based on both the input signal generated by signal generator component and the output signal from the measured system which represents the response of the measured system to the input signal. Performance metric component then delivers the resulting performance metrics to the user interface for viewing and storage or for importing into other diagnostic or design systems.

Metrics algorithms that execute as part of the performance metric component determine the magnitudes and phases of the input signal and output signal across the frequency range. Based on these results additional algorithms determine a set of four frequency responses which can be used to generate performance metrics for the drive. These frequency responses comprise an open loop frequency response a closed loop frequency response a tracking error frequency response and a disturbance rejection frequency response . Together these four performance metrics characterize performance of a drive motor and load system with the drive in either velocity or position mode.

Before discussing the input signal generation techniques and metrics algorithms used to derive these results the frequency responses and associated drive performance metrics yielded by the performance metric component are discussed in turn. illustrates a Bode plot of an example open loop frequency response. The open loop frequency response can be used to calculate stability gain and phase margins which are used to guide the user toward an optimal drive tuning and which can create a fair comparison in terms of tuning for the other three metrics and between different drives. The stability margins represent how close the system is to instability and how aggressively the drive is tuned. The open loop frequency response can also be used to identify mechanical resonances in the mechanical system being controlled. The open loop frequency response can also be used to identify the zero crossing bandwidth also known as the open loop bandwidth which together with the stability margins can be used to determine tuning stiffness. Once the drive is tuned the closed loop frequency response tracking error frequency response and disturbance rejection can be used to produce performance curves independent of motion profile and network performance.

As noted above the open loop frequency response can be used to perform a fair comparison of performance metrics across different drives. This is achieved by tuning the drives that are to be compared such that the drives all produce a specified common stability margin as identified by the open loop frequency response and then deriving the other metrics in order to measure performance of the drives. This drive tuning can be performed for example by the drive manufacturer so that their available drives are tuned to this common stability margin allowing a fair comparison of the performance metrics across all the manufacturer drives.

The open loop frequency response depicted in is an example open loop position curve derived with the drive in position mode whereby the input signal is a position command and disconnected from the output signal position feedback from the measured system during measurement. The open loop frequency response can also be derived for velocity or current. illustrates a block diagram of a generalized open loop configuration for generating an open loop frequency response Bode plot. In this figure H and C are the control loops in the motor drive and P is the plant consisting of the power converter in the motor drive the motor electrical and mechanical and the mechanical load. H P and C are part of the measured system depending on what metric is calculated. As illustrated in FIG. reference signal generator generates an input signal for controlling the position velocity torque or other controlled aspect of plant P e.g. a motor drive power converter a motor and its associated mechanical load . The input signal represents the target value for the controlled aspect which is provided to the controller C via a pre filter H which can be set to 1 to simplify derivation of the open loop frequency response. To generate the open loop Bode plot the reference signal generator formats the input signal i.e. command signal as a sinusoidal signal that varies in frequency. The pre filtered input signal is provided to controller C e.g. a motor drive or a controller that controls operation of the drive which controls plant P in accordance with the input signal. The measured output signal representing the measured position or velocity or other controlled aspect of the plant P in response to the input signal is analyzed together with the original input signal to yield Bode plots for the magnitude and phase of the open loop frequency response such as the example Bode plots depicted in . As shown in the output signal is not fed back to the controller for open loop analysis and the controller C does not adjust the control output to the plant for error correction based on measured feedback. In general the open loop frequency response characterizes the loop gain L CP which expresses the effect of controller C when applied to the plant and is the stack up of gain and phase around the feedback loop. In terms of metrics the open loop frequency response measures key qualities of a closed loop system that otherwise cannot be directly measured with a closed loop Bode plot.

The example closed loop frequency response depicted in is an example closed loop position generated with the drive in position mode whereby the input signal is a position command and the output signal is position feedback from the measured system . Closed loop frequency response can also be identified for velocity or current.

where L is the open loop gain. The tracking error frequency response represents the transfer function between the command input signal and the position or velocity error and measures position and velocity tracking error as a function of input frequencies where lower amplitudes in the error signal indicate better performance. Since position and velocity errors are primary design constraints for customers the tracking error frequency response can provide valuable information about the capability of a drive platform to meet the position and velocity following error requirements specified in the performance requirements for a given industrial application or machine. In certain types of industrial applications e.g. paper cutting applications the tracking error frequency response can be an indicator of the amount of production waste that is generated during operation.

As with the other example responses described above the example plot illustrated in represents the tracking error frequency response for position. However the tracking error frequency response can also be derived for velocity current or other controlled aspect.

and represents the transfer function between a torque disturbance and the position or velocity error. In terms of performance metrics the disturbance rejection frequency response identifies the closed loop tracking error as a function of disturbance frequency. In other words the disturbance rejection frequency response is an indicator of how sensitive a system is to external disturbances and plant perturbations which is a measure of how much a drive or other controller with a given set of gains can force a mechanical load to behave consistently under adverse conditions. The more consistent a controlled plant behaves the less variation is added to the command response and tracking error. Lower amplitudes for the position or velocity errors in the disturbance rejection frequency response metric indicate better performance.

The disturbance rejection frequency response Bode plot illustrated in was derived for position with the drive in position mode and the position command set to zero during measurement. This allows the position loop stiffness and robustness of the system to be determined Similar techniques can be used to derive disturbance rejection frequency response Bode plots for velocity or other controlled aspects.

Table 1 below summarizes the four frequency responses described above in terms of their associated drive performance metrics and usability 

One or more embodiments of the present disclosure provide techniques for deriving accurate results for the four response metrics described above in order to obtain a broadly applicable generalized performance signature for a given motor drive. Among other benefits the disclosed techniques yield performance metrics that are broadly applicable over a wide range of industrial applications and mechanical loads and facilitate a fair comparison of drive performance across different motor drives. In some scenarios drive manufacturers can leverage the disclosed techniques during in house testing of their drive products to obtain generalized performance metrics that can be published with the drive specifications to assist end users with making an informed selection of a suitable motor drive for their unique industrial applications. For example drive manufacturers can derive text book performance results for inclusion in the drive s documentation by performing the disclosed frequency response testing on a range of rigid systems and curve fitting the results. Since the frequency response analysis tools and test routines for deriving the performance metrics can be implemented in the drive itself e.g. embodied in the drive s firmware end users can also run their own performance tests to generate customized performance metrics that are specific to the end user s particular industrial application. Certain key aspects of the frequency response analysis tools are described in more detail below.

In one or more embodiments the frequency response analysis tools can include an Exact Discrete Fourier Transform and Exact Fast Fourier Transform Exact DFT FFT that reduces or eliminate spectral leakages and reduces computation time required to generate the frequency responses of the system. illustrates the problem of spectral leakage associated with conventional DFT. Standard DFT algorithms transform an N point discrete time signal x n into a complex vector X k a frequency domain signal containing magnitude and phase information for k evenly spaced frequency bins between 0 Hz and the sampling frequency. The frequency domain signal can be characterized as 

Since aliasing occurs above half the sampling frequency X k typically contains k N 2 evenly spaced frequencies between 0 Hz and the Nyquist frequency. For the sake of clarity T is the sampling period n 1 2 . . . N is the time index of the input time steps n nT and k 1 2 . . . N 2 is the frequency index of the frequency bins f k k 1 NT in Hz.

When transforming a time domain signal to a frequency domain signal using conventional DFT the number of frequency bins and their linear spacing are functions of the number of time samples N. However since the N time samples and their associated frequency bins are evenly spaced between zero and the Nyquist frequency a given frequency component of a signal may not perfectly align with any of the evenly spaced frequency bins resulting in measurement errors known as spectral leakage. This is illustrated in in which a 50 Hz sinusoidal time domain signal is sampled at a defined sampling period to yield a number of evenly spaced frequency bins . If the 50 Hz frequency of the sinusoidal signal does not perfectly align with a DFT frequency sample the frequency domain signal will include a number of inaccurate non zero values at frequencies near the 50 Hz frequency. These extra frequency components represent undesirable spectral leakage.

One approach to mitigating spectral leakage is to increase the number of data samples N to get a better resolution with the frequency bins k. However this solution increases the computational intensity because the DFT is evaluated N 2 times to sum N samples for N 2 frequencies. Another alternative is to use a more complex Fast Fourier Transform FFT . The FFT reduces the computational complexity but is still computationally intensive as the number of samples increases.

These drawbacks of conventional DFT FFT approaches are avoided using the Exact DFT described herein which reduces computation time reduces or eliminates spectral leakages obviates the need to increase the number of data samples and eliminates the need for FFT approaches. These benefits are achieved by decoupling the analyzed frequency from the number of time samples using an arbitrary non uniform spacing between the frequency bins.

By eliminating spectral leakages and reducing computational time the Exact DFT can be a key component of the frequency response analysis tools used to derive the drive performance metrics described above. To this end the Exact DFT can be implemented in the drive s firmware as part of the performance metric component to facilitate generation of the frequency response curves for open loop closed loop error tracking and disturbance rejection.

An example implementation for the Exact DFT is now described. It is to be appreciated that the particular techniques described below for implementing the Exact DFT are not intended to be exclusive and that any suitable technique for generating a specified number of unevenly spaced frequency bins between defined start and stop frequencies is within one or more embodiments of this disclosure.

In one or more embodiments an Exact DFT suitable for use in determining performance metrics for a drive can be obtained by replacing k 1 N in equation 4 above with an equivalent fT in the exponent. This substitution allows the DFT to be evaluated precisely at any one input frequency f 

This allows an arbitrary number of frequency bins to be defined with arbitrary non uniform spacing i.e. band limited and logarithmic scales . This eliminates spectral leakage the need to increase the number of time samples N and consequently the need for an FFT. By decoupling N and k the magnitude phase and frequency measured are no longer functions of k. Instead the magnitude and phase are direct functions of the frequency measured f k where k is an index to loop through the algorithm for k frequencies 

With a user defined start frequency stop frequency and number of frequencies k a band limited set of linear frequency bins is defined with f 1 f 

The linear spacing works well for identifying resonances and anti resonances which could be located anywhere along the frequency range.

Depending on the user selection of the type of frequency bin spacing equations 6 7 and 8 above can be used to generate the frequency bins for a linear scaling while equations 6 9 and 10 can be used to generate the frequency bins for a logarithmic scaling. These example formulas for an Exact DFT analysis can therefore be implemented in the drive firmware e.g. as part of the performance metric component in one or more embodiments.

Nominal values xare computed by subtracting the average value xfrom time samples x n and then applying a window function W n . This results in a more precise computation of X k 11 

Subtracting the signal average e.g. the DC value also works well and yields high accuracy. In this scenario there is no need for fto go to zero since the DC value is subtracted out.

In one or more embodiments the Exact DFT techniques described above can be implemented in motor drive firmware e.g. as part of performance metric component as illustrated in to allow the drive to generate accurate frequency response curves without spectral leakage and with reduced computational overhead. In addition to its utility in generating drive performance metrics these Exact DFT techniques can be useful in a wide range of other applications. For example in condition monitoring applications such as preventative maintenance of a drive motor peak detection code of specified frequencies can be applied to the resulting frequency response to identify the location of relative peaks which may dictate when maintenance should be performed. In another example the Exact DFT can be used in applications to identify resonances by applying frequency detection code of peaks to the frequency response.

It is to be appreciated that the particular equations discussed above for implementing the Exact DFT are intended to be exemplary and that any suitable technique for generating unevenly spaced frequency bins for a frequency response curve based on a user specified start frequency stop frequency desired number of frequency bins and spacing type is within the scope of one or more embodiments of this disclosure.

An extension of the Exact DFT is an Exact FFT which recursively breaks down the DFT into smaller more computationally efficient components.

As noted above motor drive in includes a signal generator component that generates the input signal delivered to the motor mechanical load during performance metric testing. According to another aspect that facilitates generation of drive performance metrics within a motor drive signal generator component can be configured to generate the input signal in accordance with the input parameters provided by the user as well as internal signal generating algorithms that scale the input signal s amplitude as a function of test frequency in order to mitigate noise issues and avoid saturation. In particular signal generator component can scale the amplitude of the generated sine wave signal for each test frequency as a function of the limits of the drive as well as user defined system limits. This scaling enables large signal analysis to mitigate noise issues and avoids saturation by keeping the drive and motor within position velocity and acceleration limits as the excitation frequency increases as explained further below.

Typically to produce a Bode plot an input signal is generated and applied to the input U to excite the mechanical system e.g. motor plus load . When the signal is a sine wave the input and output are measured precisely at the sine wave s frequency. This process is then repeated at multiple frequencies. If the sine wave is generated to maintain a constant amplitude A as the frequency is increased the amplitude of its derivative velocity will increase as a function of and the amplitude of its double derivative acceleration and torque will increase as a function of as illustrated by the position velocity and acceleration equations below Position sin 13 Velocity cos 14 Acceleration sin 15 

These increasing amplitudes can quickly exceed the limits of the drive as the input signal frequency is increased causing saturation and consequently invalid frequency response results. To mitigate these issues some conventional solutions generate a sine wave signal having a constant amplitude that is low enough to ensure that the amplitudes of the signal s derivative and double derivative do not saturate the system e.g. the noise floor . However this may result in a sine wave signal having an amplitude that is much lower than necessary at lower frequencies which could compromise the results of the analysis.

Therefore to avoid saturation issues without sacrificing the integrity of the analysis one or more embodiments of the signal generator component can be configured to scale the frequency components of the input signal to ensure that their magnitudes to not excite the system beyond its position velocity and acceleration limits as the excitation signal frequency increases. These limits can be defined by the user and provided to the drive via user interface in order to allow for adjustment in operating point. In general when a sine wave input signal is to be applied to a controlled mechanical system in order to determine the frequency responses and performance metrics described above the signal generator component determines a maximum signal amplitude for each frequency that will ensure that the system is not saturated and appropriately scale the input signal as a function of frequency based on these determinations. Additionally the signal generation component can adjust frequency components in close proximity to the Nyquist frequency to avoid aliasing errors. Thus rather than using a low amplitude sine wave for all frequencies the signal generation component computes for each frequency being analyzed the highest magnitude for the sine wave excitation signal that will not saturate the system given the motor drive limits and user defined limits.

Based on these user defined limits and the drive dependent parameters the signal generator component can determine the input signal limits as follows. The maximum position maxPos e.g. in motor revolutions corresponds to the user input velocity limit maxPos Travel Limit revs 16 

The maximum velocity maxVel in revolutions second is a function of user input velocity limit in of maximum and drive parameter motor speed in RPM . The motor speed RPM may be a nameplate speed parameter.

The maximum acceleration maxAcc in rev sec is a function of user input torque limit in of maximum rated torque N m and system inertia kg m 

Bias direction is a user input that defines either positive or negative direction and may comprise a binary value that is equal to 0 for positive direction or 1 for negative direction. The bias amplitude is a user input of maximum that must be limited between 0 and 150 . When bias amplitude 0 no bias is applied to the sinusoidal command. Increasing the bias amplitude between 0 and 150 will increase the bias placed on the sinusoidal input command while decreasing the sine wave amplitude in order to keep the input from exceeding the maximum travel velocity and torque limits. When bias amplitude is equal to 100 the peak to peak sine wave velocity signal operates between zero and the maximum velocity limit maxVel ensuring that the command does not reverse direction. When the bias amplitude is equal to 150 the peak to peak sine wave operates between half the maximum velocity limit and the maximum velocity limit.

With these user defined and drive dependent parameters established the manner in which the signal generator component scales the sinusoidal input signal may depend on the type of analysis desired that is which of the four frequency responses described above open loop closed loop tracking error or disturbance rejection the user wishes to generate and whether the selected frequency response should be performed for position velocity or current.

In some embodiments the user may also elect to perform a plant identification analysis which produces a frequency response that characterizes the plant transfer function P. In motion systems the plant consists of the power converter motor mechanical load and non ideal feedback device. In general the mechanics dictate the dynamic behavior of the system. In terms of metrics the Bode plot P can be used to initially tune the controller or to design better mechanics. The plant identification Bode plot identifies the location and spacing of resonances and anti resonances in the mechanics. This information can be used to determine torque scaling system inertia load ratio whether the load is rigid or compliant or how difficult the system is to tune. Yet another analysis type torque reference filters may also be performed in some embodiments. A torque reference filters Bode can be used to test firmware code across the torque reference filters i.e. low pass and notch filters since these Bode responses are well known

Table 2 below summarizes the analysis types that can be performed by the performance metrics component 

For open loop velocity closed loop velocity and tracking error velocity analysis where the signal generator component applies a velocity command a constant bias biasVel can be applied to the sinusoidal velocity command.

For open loop position closed loop position and tracking error position analysis types where the signal generator component applies a position command a ramp bias biasVel time can be applied to the sinusoidal position command.

For plant identification closed loop current disturbance rejection position disturbance rejection velocity and torque reference filters analysis types where the signal generator component is applied as a current or torque command no velocity bias is applied and bias amplitude must be set to zero internally so that the sine wave amplitude is not decreased.

Equivalence is formulated between maximum amplitudes in position velocity and acceleration according to equation 19 below maxAcc maxVel maxPos 19 

There are two possible situations for limiting the position velocity and acceleration based on the results for F F and F.

 1 When F F position amplitude must be limited below F velocity amplitude must be limited between Fand F and acceleration amplitude must be limited above F.

The following logic can be used by the signal generator component to calculate the amplitude A of the sine wave in revolutions if Then maxPos Direction 1 BiasAmplitude 200 Else if Then maxVel Direction 1 BiasAmplitude 200 Else maxAcc Direction

The sine wave magnitude calculated by the signal generator component based on these relationships may depend on the type of drive that is performing the test. In general the signal generator component will generate the input signal to have a magnitude equal to magPos when the sine wave is applied to a position loop signal such as a position command. The sine wave magnitude will be equal to magVel when the sine wave is applied to a velocity loop signal and will be equal to magTrq when the sine wave is applied to a torque loop signal. The signal generator component calculates magPos magVel and magTrq as follows magPos rev 23 magVel rev sec 24 magTrq System Inertia Nm 25 

Signal generator component calculates the velocity bias biasVel to counteract viscous friction and backlash 

With the drive in Position mode a ramp bias biasVel time can be applied to the sinusoidal position command Position Signal magPos SIN biasVel 27 

When the drive is in Velocity mode a constant biasVel is applied to the sinusoidal command Velocity Signal magVel SIN biasVel 28 

When the drive is in Torque mode no bias is applied to the sinusoidal velocity command Torque Signal magTrq SIN c 29 

The formulas above for Position Signal Velocity Signal and Torque Signal as well as appropriate maximum magnitude formulas for magPos magVel and magTrq can be implemented by signal generator component within the drive to facilitate appropriate scaling of the input signal as a function of frequency during frequency response testing to avoid saturation of the system based on the drive dependent parameters and user provided system limits.

According to another aspect that facilitates accurate measurement of phase during frequency response testing one or more embodiments of the frequency response analysis tools described herein can facilitate phase unwrapping to mitigate inaccurate phase measurements particularly at high phases. Using conventional frequency response generating methods the resultant frequency response plot may include incorrect phase jumps at points that are not resonance points due to mathematical anomalies. Some phase unwrapping solutions can only unwrap the phase up to 90 degrees. The phase unwrapping methods described herein can correctly unwrap the phase of the open loop and closed loop frequency responses for positive and negative phases up to well over 1000 degrees by analyzing the phase of the previous excitation signal frequency and the current phase.

To perform the phase unwrapping the Bode magnitude and phase is calculated through Y F U at one frequency f with additional phase unwrapping using a previous frequency s phase where U is a discrete input signal array in signal units and Y is a discrete output signal array also in signal units . For example once the Bode magnitude and phase are determined the phase difference between the output phase Yand the input phase Uis determined phaseTemp 30 

Then the phase is unwrapped by determining the difference between the current phase difference phaseTemp for the current frequency f and the previous phase difference phasePrevious of the previous frequency and determining a phase factor phaseFactor based on this result according to the following routine phaseDelta phaseTemp phasePrevious 31 phaseFactor round abs phaseDelta 270 1 32 if phaseFactor

The phase is unwrapped by setting the current frequency s phase to the value of phaseTemp equation 36 which itself depends on the calculated phase factor and which is a function of the difference between the current frequency s phase and the previous frequency s phase. This method can be implemented in the drive e.g. as part of performance metric component to facilitate accurate phase measurement during the frequency response analysis. This phase unwrapping method can be enhanced with an 8 quadrant phase unwrapping that allows correct unwrapping of the phase for resonant and anti resonant frequencies by analyzing magnitude and phase concurrently.

According to yet another aspect of the drive based frequency response analysis tools described herein some embodiments of the performance metric component can be configured to estimate the four metrics described above open loop frequency response closed loop frequency response tracking error frequency response and disturbance rejection frequency response using the measured plant identification response. As noted above the plant identification response characterizes the plant transfer function P and is independent of tuning gains. illustrates a block diagram of a generalized configuration for generating a plant identification Bode plot. As illustrated in this figure the plant P is isolated from the control system so that the dynamics of the mechanical system e.g. the power converter motor mechanical load non ideal feedback device etc. can be identified and characterized by the resulting plant identification response. The output signal from the plant P represents position feedback and the input signal to the plant represents a torque command with no disturbances present. The measured signals are then used to compute the plant identification Bode plot. illustrates an example plant identification Bode plot.

According to one or more embodiments described herein the performance metric component can estimate the open loop frequency response closed loop frequency response tracking error frequency response and disturbance rejection frequency response from the plant identification response by creating a mathematical model of the controller and convoluting the model with the plant identification response to estimate the metrics. Using this technique the time to measure all four metrics is reduced since only a single frequency response test is required.

The measured plant identification response convoluted with the control system can also be used in a simulation environment to derive system performance metrics such as position following error and toque profile required for a given motion profile. Moreover deriving the four metrics from a single frequency response test e.g. the plant identification allows the results to be scaled for different gain sets without re running the frequency response tests.

It is to be appreciated that derivation of the four metrics described above is not limited to estimation based on the plant identification response and that some embodiments of the performance metric component may derive each of the four metrics using individual frequency response testing using one or more of the frequency response tools and techniques described herein.

In some embodiments the frequency response tools described herein can also be used to derive internal system signals such as position following error actual position and torque from the frequency response. To this end the frequency response of the motion profile is combined with the system frequency response and the inverse DFT is used to derive parameters and metrics. This method can be used to generate metrics on customer machines identify best case performance for a motor and drive combination and generate metrics for laboratory setups which allow users to scale results for drive frame size motor and load use in specification of drives.

According to another frequency response derivation technique some embodiments of the performance metric component can derive the open loop frequency response from a closed loop test. As described above in connection with the open loop frequency response is typically derived with the feedback signaling to the controller disconnected as illustrated in . However this open loop control configuration is less safe than closed loop control when performed on a machine. This is because the load is always more accurately controlled during closed loop testing and measurement relative to open loop control which performs no error correction based on measured feedback. Therefore one or more embodiments of the performance metric component can be configured to calculate the open loop frequency response from a closed loop frequency response using the following relationship 

where L is the loop gain characterized by the open loop frequency response T is the closed loop transfer function and H is the pre filter see e.g. . If closed loop transfer function T is generated with velocity feed forward and acceleration feed forward set to zero to make H 1 the open loop Bode calculation is simplified otherwise H can be difficult to calculate depending on the controller configuration . Making H 1 yields the following 

By implementing this relationship in the drive s firmware and performing the closed loop frequency response test with velocity feed forward and acceleration feed forward set to zero the performance metric component can perform all frequency response tests including derivation of the open loop frequency response with the load maintained under closed loop control allowing the performance metrics to be derived more safely under controlled conditions.

Once the drive has obtained the frequency responses for open loop closed loop tracking error and disturbance rejection for an existing system these metrics can be used to analyze performance. The frequency response of an existing machine can be imported into application simulation software to define tuning gains including notch filter and low pass filter verify stability and robustness and derive internal parameter such as position following error actual position and torque requirements. The frequency response of an existing system is a richer dataset than conventional torque and speed curves that are sometimes used for sizing. In this regard torque and speed curves do not allow a user to correctly tune the system check for stability and estimate position error which is possible using the frequency response of the system.

If the machine is still in the design stage the information obtained from this simulation software can be used to obtain the frequency response of the system. The algorithms and frequency response analysis tools for generating the four performance metrics and plant identification can be implemented in the simulation software to derive the performance metrics from existing mechanism templates templates of the controlled mechanical system and also future new mechanisms. By combining the frequency response of the system with the frequency response of the motion profile position following error actual position and torque requirement can be derived. The tuning gains stability verification and robustness to load disturbance can also be estimated from this simulation. The performance metrics obtained from the simulation software can be compared to the same metrics measured from the machine once the machine is build to validate the correct modeling of the system.

The techniques described herein allow a user to determine four performance metrics for a drive open loop frequency response closed loop frequency response tracking error frequency response and disturbance rejection frequency response using frequency response analysis tools. These performance metrics can then be used to fairly compare drive performance across various drive models and families. Since the performance metrics are independent of tuning the metrics allow a best case fair comparison to be performed across multiple drives. The metrics are a function of input frequency and are independent of motion profile. The frequency response data derived using the techniques described herein also provide best case information for rigid loads thereby generalizing performance for a wide range of load types.

For drive manufacturers the integrated frequency response analysis tools can be used to perform in house frequency response testing on a range of test loads and the resulting frequency response data can be used to specify design validate and document drive performance as new drives are developed. Since the resulting frequency response data is independent of motion profile the corresponding performance metric data generalizes drive performance for a wide range of loads and can therefore be published with the drive specifications to assist end users in selecting a suitable drive for their particular industrial applications.

Additionally end users can use the drive s integrated analysis tools to perform frequency response analysis for their particular industrial applications after the drive is installed yielding application specific frequency response results and performance metrics for the user s unique control system. These performance metrics can be used for example to identify whether the drive or the mechanical system is a limiting factor to machine performance assisting the user in identifying where to invest resources to improve system performance.

The signal generator component used to generate the command signal for each performance metric is designed to modulate the amplitude of the signal according to limits of the drive user limits and test frequency. This mitigates the problem of saturation during the tests which can invalidate the results. This also allows the signal generator component to generate larger signals without saturating the system mitigating noise issues. This is in contrast to conventional signal generation methods which apply a constant low amplitude signal to the drive for all frequencies in the frequency response plot to avoid saturation at higher frequencies which can cause noise to interfere with the results.

The Exact DFT FET described herein implemented as part of the performance metric component decouples the frequency bins from the number of samples to compute the frequency response of a signal. This eliminates computational issues e.g. spectral leakage and excessive computation time that render it difficult to implement a conventional DFT in industrial drives. Using conventional DFT the number of frequency bins and their linear spacing are functions of the number of the time samples. As a result measurement errors spectral leakage occur. These issues are mitigated using the Exact DFT FFT of the present disclosure.

The techniques described herein for deriving drive performance metrics have a number of advantages over standard approaches that obtain performance data of a motor drive and load for only a single operating condition including a single motion profile set of tuning gains drive frame size motor and load . Such standard approaches do not easily translate to customer scenarios and across product platforms. By contrast the performance metrics derived using the techniques and tools herein are independent of motion profile since the metrics are a function of input frequency. Moreover the metrics derived herein are independent of tuning thereby allowing a fair system comparison across different drives independent of the particular tunings of the drives. The performance metrics derived using these methods are generalized for a wide range of industrial systems and can be scaled to translate to customer scenarios and across product platforms.

As an internal tool for drive manufacturers the performance metrics derived using the methods described herein can be used to address the internal need to include drive performance in the initial product specification. Since the performance metrics are independent of tuning and motion profile the metrics can be used to specify design validate and document drive performance. These performance metrics are particularly important when a new generation of drives is developed to replace older legacy drives since the end users need to be assured that the performance of the new drive will meet or exceed the performance of the older drives.

As both an internal and external tool for drive manufacturers and end users alike the methods described herein can address the internal and external needs to use drive performance as a differentiator during the motor drive selection and sales process since customers are technically focused and can use the performance metrics to select an appropriate drive for their industrial application. The frequency response results derived using the integrated analysis tools on the drive can be used to identify the drive or the mechanical system as the limiting factor in machine performance and can also be used to monitor machine degradation over time by observing changes to the frequency response curves over time.

When provided to a simulation software tool the performance metrics can be used to validate motor drive sizing and to analyze and tune existing systems. The systems described herein can also be used as a tool to define performance metrics of systems still in the design stage to ensure that machine specifications are met.

The frequency response curves for open loop closed loop tracking error and disturbance rejection represent a signature of the controlled machine. As such the frequency response data can be imported into a simulation software tool and used in place of a physical model of a system to be controlled. Accordingly in some embodiments a user interface e.g. interface of can be connected to the drive and used to extract the frequency response and performance metric data generated by the performance metric component . The data can then be imported into a simulation software tool to facilitate accurate simulation of the system. Such simulations can be used to predict machine performance and compliance system bandwidth and to tune the system as well as to predict position following error and torque requirements for a given motion profile. In another example simulation the frequency response curves for a given system can be used to test different operating scenarios for the system e.g. faster operating speeds to reduce cycle times or increase output in order to predict unexpected resonances or other possible concerns that may arise during operation at these different scenarios.

At an output signal representing the response of the mechanical system to the applied input signal is measured. At a set of four frequency response are generated using by the drive based on analysis of the input signal and the output signal including the open loop frequency response the closed loop frequency response the tracking error frequency response and the disturbance rejection frequency response. At performance metrics for the drive are determined based on the frequency responses generated at step . Example performance metrics can include but are not limited to zero crossing bandwidth gain margin phase margin system bandwidth position and velocity error as a function of frequency and position and velocity error as a function of load disturbance on the mechanical system.

At frequency analysis is performed on the time domain signal based on the input parameters received at step using an algorithm that executes on the motor drive. The algorithm may comprise an Exact DFT algorithm that yields even or uneven spacing of frequency bins between the start and stop frequency based on the indicated desired number of frequency bins and the type of frequency bin spacing specified at step . At a frequency domain signal is generated based on results of the analysis. By allowing the user to define the frequency range for the test narrowly around the desired frequency range for the Exact DFT analysis and by allowing uneven spacing of frequency bins a desired frequency component of the time domain signal can be made to align with one of the resulting frequency bins resulting in a frequency domain signal that accurately conveys the frequency component of the time domain signal without spectral leakage.

At frequency response testing of the mechanical system is initiated via the motor drive. In some embodiments the test can be initiated by pressing a button on the motor drive or by initiating the test via the user interface. At a signal generator component of the motor drive determines respective amplitudes for each test frequency of an input signal to be generated based on the input parameters received at step as well as internal parameters of the drive itself which may be a function of the drive type model and specifications. Example internal drive parameters can include but are not limited to a rotary rated speed a feedback resolution a system inertia and or a maximum speed. Based on the received and internal parameters the signal generator component determines a maximum amplitude for each frequency of the input signal that can be applied to the system without causing the drive and motor of the mechanical system to exceed the defined position velocity and acceleration limits as the input signal frequency increases.

At the input signal is generated in accordance with the amplitudes determined at step . In this regard the signal generator component scales the input signal as the frequency increases to avoid saturation of the system and reduce or eliminate noise.

At the mechanical model of the controller created at step is convoluted with the plant identification response determined at step . At estimates of the open loop frequency response closed loop frequency response tracking error frequency response and disturbance rejection frequency response for the drive motor load system based on a result of the convolution performed at step . Using this technique the four performance metric responses can be derived by performing only a single frequency response test.

At a first difference between the phase of the output signal and the phase of the input signal is determined for a first frequency. At a second difference between the phase of the output signal and the phase of the input signal is determined for a second frequency that is previous to the first frequency.

At a difference between the first difference determined at step and the second difference determined at step is calculated to yield a phase delta. At the phase delta is divided by 270 and one is subtracted from the result of the division to yield a phase factor.

The methodology continues on . At a determination is made regarding whether the phase factor is less than one. If the phase factor is less than one the phase factor is set to one at step and the methodology moves to step . If the phase factor is not less than one the methodology moves to step without modifying the phase factor.

At a determination is made regarding whether the phase delta determined at step is less than or equal to the phase factor multiplied by 270. If so the phase for the first frequency is set to be equal to the first phase difference determined at step plus 360 times the phase factor and the methodology ends.

If the phase delta is not less than or equal to the phase factor multiplied by 270 the methodology moves to step where a determination is made regarding whether the phase delta is greater than or equal to the phase factor multiplied by 270. If so the phase for the first frequency is set to be equal to the first phase difference determined at step minus 360 times the phase factor and the methodology ends. If the phase delta is not greater than or equal to the phase factor multiplied by 270 the methodology ends without modifying the phase for the first frequency.

In some embodiments methodology can be implemented in a motor drive as part of performance metric component to facilitate accurate phase unwrapping of frequency response data generated using the frequency response analysis tools described herein. Alternatively methodology may be implemented in a user interface e.g. user interface to facilitate rendering accurate frequency response curves with suitable phase unwrapping.
