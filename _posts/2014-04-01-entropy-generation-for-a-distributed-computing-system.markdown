title: Entropy generation for a distributed computing system
abstract: In one embodiment, a method generates first entropy using a true random number generator in a management computer configured to manage a main computer in a computing device. The main computer controls a set of physical nodes including a set of services running in a set of virtual machines. The method then provides the first entropy to the main computer and the first entropy is combined with second entropy generated by the main computer to generate third entropy. The third entropy is provided to the set of physical nodes where the set of virtual machines access the third entropy via a hypervisor.
