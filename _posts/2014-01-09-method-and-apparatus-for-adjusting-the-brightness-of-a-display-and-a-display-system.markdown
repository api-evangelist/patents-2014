The present application is a non provisional of 61 760 926 and claims priority to Chinese Application 201310013710.3 filed on Jan. 15 2013. The entire contents of each of these applications is hereby incorporated by reference.

The present application relates to display technologies particularly a method and apparatus for adjusting the brightness of a display and a display system.

With the rapid development of computer and electronic technologies displays have been disposed on many portable electronic devices to show various forms of information such as texts pictures or video information. Some displays such as LCD displays use an LED array or a fluorescent lamp as a backlight module and use a liquid crystal tunable filter to control the contrast of the light emitted from the backlight module to display graphics thereon. The luminous intensity of the light emitted from the backlight module i.e. a backlight luminous intensity can be controlled by an operating system of the electronic device. Thus the electronic device may control the brightness of the display by controlling the luminous intensity of the light thereby meeting the requirements of different applications.

In conventional technologies the system platform of many portable electronic devices may provide a specific application programming interface API . Applications may use the API to set or adjust the backlight luminous intensity of the display. However the backlight luminous intensity can only be reduced to a finite non zero minimum value. Therefore when the backlight luminous intensity is at the minimum value the brightness of the display may still be maintained at a relatively low brightness level. Under many circumstances especially when an environmental luminous intensity is extremely low the relatively low brightness level of the display is still too high relative to the environment which may cause discomfort to a user.

Therefore there is a need of a method and apparatus for adjusting the brightness of a display which is capable of providing a broader brightness configuration of the display especially with a much lower limit of the brightness.

An objective of the present application is to provide a method and apparatus for adjusting the brightness of a display which is capable of providing a broader brightness configuration of the display especially with a much lower limit of the brightness.

In an aspect the present application provides a method for adjusting the brightness of a display comprising acquiring a brightness adjusting signal wherein the brightness adjusting signal includes a position value indicative of a desired brightness of the display comparing the position value with a first threshold wherein an adjusting scale is defined according to a variable range of transparency of an object displayed on the display if the position value is smaller than the first threshold generating a brightness value of the object according to the position of the position value in the adjusting scale and applying the brightness value to the object displayed on the display.

When the backlight luminous intensity is low for example the backlight luminous intensity is at the minimum value that an application programming interface is capable of configuring the method of the present application can use a graphical system of an electronic device to change the transparency of the displayed object. Therefore the brightness of the display is further lowered by reducing the transparency of the displayed object.

In certain embodiments the comparing step further comprises the adjusting scale is defined according to a variable range of backlight luminous intensity of the display if the position value is equal to or greater than the first threshold.

In certain embodiments the brightness value changes linearly with the position value if the position value is equal to or greater than the first threshold.

In certain embodiments the brightness value changes nonlinearly with the position value if the position value is smaller than the first threshold.

In certain embodiments the brightness value changes in a logarithmic function of the position value if the position value is smaller than a second threshold wherein the second threshold is smaller than the first threshold.

In certain embodiments the brightness adjusting signal is generated in response to a sliding action on the display by a user.

In certain embodiments the first threshold corresponds to a minimum brightness that a platform application programming interface coupled to the display can configure.

In another aspect the present application further provides an apparatus for adjusting the brightness of a display which comprises an acquiring module configured to acquire a brightness adjusting signal wherein the brightness adjusting signal includes a position value indicative of a desired brightness of the display a comparing module configured to compare the position value with a first threshold wherein an adjusting scale is defined according to a variable range of transparency of an object displayed on the display if the position value is smaller than the first threshold a generating module configured to generate a brightness value of the object according to the position of the position value in the adjusting scale and an applying module configured to apply the brightness value to the object displayed on the display.

In a further aspect the present application further provides a display system which comprises a display an input module and the apparatus for adjusting the brightness of the display in the previous aspect wherein the input module is configured to generate the brightness adjusting signal in response to an input of a user and the display is configured to display the object in response to the application of the brightness value.

As shown in the electronic device has a display which may be a displaying module with backlight displaying. For example the display may be an LCD display having a backlight module whose light luminous intensity is controllable. The brightness of the display can be at least partially adjusted by controlling the luminous intensity of the light emitted from the backlight module. In other words the brightness of the display is adjusted by controlling the backlight luminous intensity. In certain embodiments the display may be a touch sensing display i.e. the display integrates an input module thereon. For example the input module may be a touch sensing module. The touch sensing module generally overlaps with a displaying zone of the display . In a practical application the touch sensing module may generate an input signal in response to a touch action on the display by a user. For example the touch sensing module may generate the input signal in response to a pressing action or sliding action of a finger of the user or a touch pen or other tools used by the user. With such input module the user may input a control instruction to control the operation of the electronic device . It will be readily appreciated that the electronic device may have or alternatively use other types of input module such as a keyboard a mouse a track ball a sound control input module or the like.

The electronic device further includes a control module coupled to the display and the input module . The control module receives an input signal or a control instruction from the input module processes such input signal or control instruction and controls the brightness of the display .

Step comparing the position value with a first threshold wherein an adjusting scale is defined according to a variable range of transparency of an object displayed on the display if the position value is smaller than the first threshold

In certain embodiments the method for adjusting the brightness of a display includes acquiring a brightness adjusting signal including a desired brightness of the display comparing the position value with a first threshold defining the adjusting scale according to a variable range of backlight luminous intensity of the display if the position value is equal to or greater than the first threshold generating a brightness value of the object according to the position of the position value in the adjusting scale and applying the brightness value to the object displayed on the display.

In certain embodiments the method for adjusting the brightness of a display specifically includes acquiring a brightness adjusting signal including a desired brightness of the display comparing the position value with a first threshold defining the adjusting scale according to a variable range of transparency of an object displayed on the display if the position value is smaller than the first threshold generating a brightness value of the object according to the position of the position value in the adjusting scale and applying the brightness value to the object displayed on the display.

Firstly when a user of the electronic device wants to adjust the brightness of the display he or she can input a brightness adjusting instruction via the input module . The brightness adjusting instruction may contain information regarding a desired brightness of the display . For example the user may input a specific value of the desired brightness via the input module which is a ratio relative to a maximum value of the brightness that the display is capable to display. Alternatively the user may input a variation of the desired brightness to a current brightness of the display such as a desired increase or decrease of the brightness of the display . Furthermore the control module can determine the desired brightness according to the variation and the current brightness of the display . In certain embodiments the input module is a touch sensing input module such as a touch sensing screen which may generate an instruction indicative of the brightness adjustment according to a sliding action of the user. For example a rightward or upward sliding action of the user may generate a brightness adjusting instruction indicating that the brightness will increase and the length of the sliding action indicates the variation of the brightness. Correspondingly a leftward or downward sliding action of the user may generate a brightness adjusting instruction indicating that the brightness will decrease and the length of the sliding action indicates the variation of the brightness.

In certain embodiments the display does not display a symbol or a number indicative of the current brightness the user may determine the current brightness of the display according to his or her visual perceptions thereby determining whether or not to adjust the brightness of the display . In certain embodiments an image or interface indicative of the current brightness may be displayed on the display such as a slider component. shows an electronic device on which the slider component is disposed according to an embodiment of the present application. As shown in the slider component has a slider and a position bar or a position frame . The slider may slide in the position bar in response to an input of the user and the position of the slider in the position bar indicates the current brightness of the display .

As described above the brightness adjusting instruction of the user may include information relating to the desired brightness of the display. In Step after receiving the brightness adjusting instruction the control module of the electronic device can further convert the instruction to a brightness adjusting signal that can be recognized by the software or operating system run on the electronic device . Accordingly the information relating to the desired brightness of the display can be converted into a position value indicative of the desired brightness of the display and then the brightness adjusting signal includes the position value. For example the position value may be a ratio of a position where the slider will be moved relative to the length of the position bar .

It should be noted that the brightness adjusting signal may be automatically generated by the electronic device according to an instruction of a predefined condition in practical application. For example the electronic device may include a light sensing module for sensing the environmental luminous intensity. When the environmental luminous intensity is at different scopes the electronic device can compare the environmental luminous intensity with some predefined position values to automatically generate brightness adjusting signal including different position values according to the comparison. Therefore the electronic device can automatically adjust the brightness of the display suitable for the environmental luminous intensity according to the change of the environmental luminous intensity.

Afterwards in Step the control module processes the brightness adjusting signal and compares the position value included in the brightness adjusting signal with the first threshold. The first threshold may be preset in the control module or pre stored in an internal or external memory module of the electronic device and then be called by the control module according to application requirements. In practical applications the first threshold is configured to separate different way to adjust the brightness. The control module can determine the adjusting scale by comparing the position value with the first threshold. The adjusting scale is used for converting the position value to the brightness value of the object displayed on the display . For example when the position value is equal to or greater than the first threshold the control module can adjust the brightness of the display by changing the backlight luminous intensity of the display . Otherwise the control module may adjust the brightness of the display by changing the transparency of the object displayed on the display instead of changing the backlight luminous intensity of the display. In certain embodiments the object is a user interface or graphical user interface displayed by the display . In certain embodiments the object may be a part of the user interface displayed on the display such as a background image of the interface. Apparently the brightness of the display changes with the transparency of the object. The lower the transparency is the lower the brightness of the display is and the greater the transparency is the higher the brightness of the display is. For embodiments where the brightness of the display is indicated with numbers the first threshold corresponds to a specific value between a value indicating the lowest brightness of the display and another value indicating the highest brightness of the display. For embodiments where the brightness of the display is indicated with the slider component the first threshold corresponds to a specific position in the position bar. Correspondingly when the slider slides between the specific position and a position indicative of the lowest brightness of the display the brightness of the display is adjusted by changing the backlight luminous intensity of the display . When the slider slides between the specific position and a position indicative of the highest brightness of the display the backlight luminous intensity is fixed and the transparency of the object displayed on the display changes. When the slider slides to the low brightness direction the luminous intensity emitted out of the display may be reduced to lower the brightness of the display . Therefore when the backlight luminous intensity is at the minimum value that an application programming interface can configure i.e. the lowest backlight luminous intensity the brightness of the display can be further lowered by reducing the transparency of the object. This configuration can meet the requirement for low display brightness. Apparently the first threshold may be set to a value higher than the lowest backlight luminous intensity that the API can configure. In certain embodiments the first threshold may be set to a value corresponding to a brightness value of the display when the backlight luminous intensity is at the minimum value. In certain embodiments the first threshold corresponds to a value wherein the backlight luminous intensity is 50 of the maximum backlight luminous intensity.

Specifically in the electronic device the brightness of the display may be adjusted via the software platform or the operating system. The brightness value may include a first portion indicative of the backlight luminous intensity of the display and a second portion indicative of the transparency of the object display on the display . The first position of the brightness value i.e. the backlight luminous intensity can be set or adjusted via accessing to the API by applications. The second portion of the brightness value i.e. the transparency of the object may be further set by a graphical system provided in the software platform or the operating system. For example full screen size paint nodes may be overlapped with root base nodes of a primitive figure when the system is initialized. The root base nodes could make sure the overlapped paint nodes can be painted at last. The data indicative of the transparency of the object can then be set on the paint nodes. When the object displayed on the display is updated i.e. the paint nodes are painted the transparency can be applied to the displayed object in full screen. Apparently the implementation for setting or displaying the transparency may change with different embodiments. However it will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art that the present application is not limited to the above embodiments other transparency adjusting ways are also within the scope of the present application.

In practical applications the transparency is usually represented by a data of specific size such as an 8 bit data i.e. the transparency can be set at a level between 0 and 255 256 levels in total . Similarly the backlight luminous intensity of the display can also be represented by a data of specific size such as a 4 bit data i.e. the backlight luminous intensity can be set at a level between 0 and 15 16 levels in total . It should be noted that the backlight luminous intensity may change continuously or semi continuously. Thus the term level in the present application refers to a unit variation in the backlight luminous intensity or a multiple of the unit variation. As stated above the position of the position value included in the brightness adjusting signal relative to the first threshold can be used to indicate different brightness adjusting ways. However the level of the transparency is different from the level of the backlight luminous intensity and the effect of each level of the transparency on the brightness of the display is different from the effect of each level of the backlight luminous intensity on the brightness of the display . Therefore the effect of variation of the position value on the actual brightness of the display may be different in different adjusting ways. As a result the brightness adjusting scale may be separately defined for different brightness adjusting ways. The brightness adjusting scale includes a variable range of the brightness and the respective ratios of the brightness of the display changing with each level of the backlight luminous intensity or transparency of the object. In certain embodiments a range between a position value corresponding to the highest brightness of the display and the first threshold includes the variable range of the backlight luminous intensity of the display i.e. one or more levels of the position value in this range corresponds to a level of the backlight luminous intensity. Furthermore a range between a position value corresponding to the lowest brightness of the display and the first threshold includes the variable range of the transparency of the object i.e. one or more levels of the position value in this range corresponds to a level of transparency of the object. Alternatively one or more levels of the position value in this range corresponds to one or more levels of transparency of the object.

After the adjusting scale is determined in Step the brightness value of the object displayed on the display is generated according to the position of the position value in the adjusting scale. As stated above the brightness value may include the first portion indicative of the backlight luminous intensity of the display and the second portion indicative of the transparency of the object displayed on the display . For example the brightness value B may be expressed as BL TS wherein the first portion BL ranges within 0 15 and the second portion TS ranges within 0 255 .

For example assuming the position value corresponding to the highest brightness is 100 the position value corresponding to the lowest brightness is 0 and the first threshold is 40 . The range of the position value ranging from 0 to 40 corresponds to the variable range of the transparency such as 0 255 levels of the transparency. In particular when the position value corresponding to the desired brightness is 30 which is smaller than the first threshold the adjusting scale may be defined according to the variable range of the transparency. The brightness value B may be expressed as 0 191 . In other words the first portion BL of the brightness value is the minimum value 0 within the variable range of the backlight luminous intensity and the second portion TS of the brightness value is at of the variable range of transparency i.e. 191. For another example when the position value corresponding to the desired brightness is 70 which is greater than the first threshold the brightness of the display may not be lowered by reducing the transparency of the object. Thus the transparency is maintained in a default value 255 i.e. the maximum value of the transparency and the function of transparency adjustment is turned off. The first portion BL of the brightness B can be determined according to the adjusting scale defined by the variable range of backlight luminous intensity. Then the first portion BL is at of the variable range of the backlight luminous intensity i.e. 127.

It should be noted that the above examples of the brightness value are determined assuming the brightness value changes linearly with the position value. In certain embodiments when the position value is smaller than the first threshold the second portion of the brightness value changes linearly with the position value. When the position value is greater than the first threshold the first portion of the brightness value changes linearly with the position value.

In certain embodiments the brightness value does not change linearly with the position value and it may change nonlinearly with the position value or at least change nonlinearly with the position value in a portion of the position value range. shows an embodiment where the change of a position value causes nonlinear change of a brightness value.

As shown in each scale in the axis x indicates a level of brightness value. On the right of the first threshold T the brightness value specifically the backlight luminous intensity changes linearly with the position value. When the position value is smaller than the first threshold T i.e. on the left of the first threshold T the brightness value specifically the transparency changes nonlinearly with the position value. Optionally if the position value is smaller than a second threshold T the brightness value specifically the transparency changes in a logarithmic function of the position value. The second threshold is smaller than the first threshold. For example the second threshold is 50 to 90 of the first threshold optionally 75 to 85 of the first threshold. When the position value is between the first threshold and the second threshold the brightness value specifically the transparency changes linearly with the position value.

Still referring to after generating the brightness value of the display in Step the brightness value including the backlight luminous intensity and the transparency is applied to the object. Specifically the first portion of the brightness value is applied to the system via the API to change the backlight luminous intensity of the backlight module of the display . The second portion of the brightness value is applied to the object through the graphical system to change the transparency of the object.

When the above steps are completed the brightness of the display can be set to a brightness desired by the user thereby implementing the brightness adjustment of the display .

As shown in in block an electronic device acquires a brightness adjusting signal which includes a position value representing a desired brightness value of the display. The brightness adjusting signal may be manually inputted by a user or automatically generated by the electronic device according to other instructions or conditions provided by the control system of the electronic device. For example the brightness adjusting signal may be generated according to change in environmental luminous intensity. Afterwards in block the electronic device determines whether or not to activate the brightness adjusting function. For example the user may pre set whether to turn on or turn off the brightness adjusting function. If the brightness adjusting function is turned off the respective brightness adjusting functions using the transparency and the backlight luminous intensity are both turned off as shown in block and .

If the brightness adjusting function is activated the position value is compared with a first threshold in block . If the position value is equal to or greater than the first threshold the brightness adjusting function using the transparency is turned off in block . Afterwards an adjusting scale is defined according to a variable range of the backlight luminous intensity in block and a brightness value of the display is generated according to the position of the position value in the adjusting scale in block .

Otherwise if the position value is smaller than the first threshold the adjusting scale is defined according to a variable range of the transparency of the object in block and the position value is compared with a second threshold which is smaller than the first threshold in block . If the position value is smaller than the second threshold the position value is converted to a corresponding transparency value based on a nonlinear function such as a logarithm function in block . If the position value is equal to or greater than the second threshold the position value is converted to a corresponding transparency value based on a linear function in block . Then the transparency value is obtained in block . Furthermore the brightness value including the transparency value and the backlight luminous intensity value is applied to the object to obtain a suitable brightness of the display in block .
