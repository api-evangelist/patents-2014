title: Methods and a computing device for configuring a waterfall chart
abstract: A computing device (e.g., a processor executing instructions on the computing device) receives an input (e.g., from a user or from a data stream) into a cell of a table (e.g., a cell of a spreadsheet, worksheet, or workbook). If the input is a sum (e.g., a formula whose result is the sum of previous cells), then the computing device renders a total column representing the sum on a waterfall chart (e.g., on a user interface rendered on an electronic display). Otherwise, if the input is a static value (e.g., an integer or decimal number), then the computing device renders a change column representing the static value.

The present disclosure is related generally to graphics presentation techniques and more particularly to methods and a computing device for configuring a waterfall chart.

Waterfall charts are often used by business professionals to show the cumulative effects of changes to an initial value. Typically a waterfall chart is made up of multiple columns appears somewhat like a bar graph. Generally the first column is an initial value the last column is a cumulative total and the intermediate columns are change columns. Each change column can be either positive or negative and is dimensioned such that one edge is at the same vertical height as the current cumulative total and another opposite edge is above for positive change columns or below for negative change columns the first edge by a vertical dimension that is proportional to the degree of change that has occurred. The visual effect of change columns is that they appear to float relative to the first column and final column. Change columns are generally color coded to indicate whether the change is positive or negative.

Typically to create a waterfall chart professionals start with a regular spreadsheet program and use a series of complicated formulas. Furthermore such professionals often find themselves creating the floating change columns by stacking visible columns on top of invisible columns.

This disclosure is generally directed to methods and a computing device for configuring a waterfall chart. In various embodiments the computing device e.g. a processor executing instructions on the computing device receives an input e.g. from a user or from a data stream into a cell of a table e.g. a cell of a spreadsheet worksheet or workbook . If the input is a sum e.g. a formula whose result is the sum of previous cells then the computing device renders a total column representing the sum on a waterfall chart e.g. on a user interface rendered on an electronic display . Otherwise if the input is a static value e.g. an integer or decimal number then the computing device renders a change column representing the static value. In some embodiments the computing device renders the column based on its position in the waterfall chart. For example the computing device may by default render the first column as a total column and render the last as a total column regardless of whether inputs into the cells corresponding to the first column and the last column are static values or sums. The computing device can override this default behavior in response to an appropriate user manipulation of an on screen control.

In some embodiments the computing device presents on a user interface multiple color options for positive change columns and multiple color options for negative change columns. The computing device receives via the user interface a selection of a color option for one or both of the positive change columns and the negative change columns. In response to the selection the computing device changes the color of all of the positive change columns or all of the negative change columns or both to the selected color option or options . Additionally the computing device may offer the same color options for total columns.

According to various embodiments the computing device receives a selection of a column of the waterfall chart and receives an input via an on screen control indicating that the column should be converted from a total column to a change column or from a change column to a total column. In response to the input the computing device converts the column from a total column to a change column or from a change column to a total column as indicated by the input .

Various parts of this disclosure refer to a user taking an action with respect to the computing device and the computing device responding in different ways. It should be noted however that the various methods described herein need not involve a user. For example the computing device described herein may receive input from another computing device through an application programming interface and react in the same manner as it would have reacted had the input been received from the user via a user interface.

Turning to in an embodiment the various methods described herein are carried out on a computing device generally labeled . The computing device device may be implemented as any type of computing device including a desktop computer a notebook computer and a smartphone. In one implementation the device includes processor a primary memory e.g. volatile memory random access memory that contains a waterfall chart application application a secondary memory e.g. non volatile memory a user input device e.g. a keyboard mouse or touchscreen a display e.g. an organic light emitting diode display and a network interface which may be wired or wireless . The memories and store instructions and data. The processor executes the instructions such as those of the application and uses the data to carry out various procedures including in some embodiments the methods described herein. The device in general and the processor in particular are able to communicate with other computing devices via the network interface over a network e.g. the Internet .

To create and configure a waterfall chart in an embodiment a user interacts with the device to execute the application . The application presents a user interface to the user on the display . The contents of the user interface may be locally generated by the application . Additionally or alternatively the device may receive the contents of the user interface and from a remotely located computing device e.g. a server .

When the device executes the application the device displays a user interface UI on the display . An embodiment of such a UI is shown in . The UI includes a display area in which the device displays a waterfall chart and a chart control area . The chart control area has various controls for configuring the waterfall chart including a first tab a second tab and a third tab . The waterfall chart in this example has multiple columns including a first total column a first change column a second change column a third change column and a second total column . The first change column and the second change column are each positive change columns and are of a first color to indicate this fact. The third change column is of a second color to indicate that it is a negative change column. The first and second total columns and are of a third color to indicate that they are total columns. The waterfall chart is merely one example of what the device is capable of displaying. The waterfall chart may in fact have any number of change columns positive and negative and total columns but will generally have a start total column the first column on the left and an end total column the last column on the right .

Just above the display area is a chart tab and a data tab . When the chart tab gets activated e.g. clicked on by a user the device displays the waterfall chart in the display area . When the data tab gets activated the device displays a table that contains the data used by the device to render the waterfall chart. For example assuming that the waterfall chart of is being displayed when a user activates the data tab the device displays the table shown in . When a user hovers a pointer over one of the columns of the waterfall chart the device displays the value represented by the column in a balloon .

Turning to the first tab includes a chart type pull down menu a title entry field a title show hide control a chart height entry field a chart width entry field a chart border thickness field a label show hide control a legend show hide control a legend location pull down menu a legend border thickness entry field a column width percentage field and a series data horizontal vertical control .

According to an embodiment a user can change the type of the chart by selecting the desired type e.g. graph line waterfall etc. from the chart type pull down menu . If for example the user selects a line graph then the device replaces the waterfall chart with a line graph as shown in . The user can also enter a title for the waterfall chart in the title entry field . If the title show hide control is set to Shown as depicted in then the device displays the title text at the top of the waterfall chart .

According to various embodiments the device sets the height of the waterfall chart in accordance with the value entered in the chart height entry field sets the width of the waterfall chart in accordance with the value entered in the chart width entry field and sets the thickness of the border of the waterfall chart in accordance with the value entered in the border thickness field . If the label show hide control is set to Shown as depicted in then the device displays a label just above each column to indicate the underlying value represented by the column. Similarly if the legend show hide control is set to Shown as depicted in then the device displays a legend at a location that is configurable via the legend location pull down menu and with a border that is configurable via the legend border entry field . Finally the device sets the width of the columns of the waterfall chart according to the value entered in the column width percentage field and sets the waterfall chart as either vertical or horizontal based on the state of the series data horizontal vertical control .

Turning to the second tab includes an axis selection pull down menu through which to select an axis bottom or left to be configured an axis title show hide control an axis title entry field a label frequency field a label angle field several checkbox controls a column select pull down menu and a column type control . When the device receives a selection of an axis from the pull down menu an entry of a title in the title entry field and the show hide control is toggled to Shown the device inserts and displays one or both of a vertical axis title and a horizontal axis title . Furthermore the device sets the label frequency of the selected axis according to the entry in the label frequency field sets the label angle according to the entry in the label angle field and determines whether or not to show axis values lines and gridlines based on the state of the checkboxes . The column select pull down menu and column type control will be described below in further detail.

Turning to in an embodiment the third tab includes a title pull down control an axis pull down control a label show hide control and set of column color controls including a first color control for total columns a second color control for positive change columns and a third color control for negative change columns. The third tab also includes a column select pull down control a show label checkbox control and a position pull down control . Using the title pull down control a user may select an axis of the waterfall chart . The user may then select a position for the selected axis using the axis pull down control . In response to receiving these selections the device moves the selected axis to the selected location on the waterfall chart . The user may also use the column color controls and to change the color of the corresponding columns. For example assume that the first change column and the second change column are currently green. If the user manipulates the second color control which would initially be set to green so as to select yellow e.g. from a pop up color palette menu then the device reacts by automatically re rendering the first change column and the second change column as yellow columns.

Turning to in an embodiment the device creates the waterfall chart shown in previous paragraphs from data contained in a table . The table includes a first row containing textual names of the columns of the waterfall chart . For example cell B1 contains the name of the first total column cell C1 contains the name of the first change column cell D1 contains the name of the second change column cell E1 contains the name of the third change column and cell F1 contains the name of the second total column .

The table also include a second row containing the text of a legend label for the waterfall chart as well as static values e.g. integers or decimal values or formulas e.g. sums of previous cells that the device uses to determine the dimensions of the columns of the waterfall chart . For example cell A2 contains the text used for the legend cell B2 contains the static value of the first total column i.e. the initial value for the waterfall chart cell C2 contains the static value of the first change column i.e. the amount of change from the previous column or the change value cell D2 contains the static value of the second change column cell E2 contains the static value of the third change column and cell F2 contains a formula SUM B2 E2 that sums up the prior columns. The device calculates the result of the formula in the cell F2 and uses the result to establish the vertical dimension of the second total column i.e. the final total column . All or some of the entries in the table may be entered by a user or generated e.g. as part of a template by the application .

In an embodiment when a new value is entered into one or more of the cells of the table e.g. by a user the device automatically updates the waterfall chart in a corresponding manner. For example the device renders the waterfall chart so that it includes the initial value from cell B2 as a total column the change values from cells C2 D2 and E2 as change columns that float with respect to the zero of the vertical axis and a final total column whose height is proportional to the sum of the initial value and the change values.

Turning to for example when the user changes the value in cell B2 from 50 to 100 the device changes increases the dimensions of the first total column . When the user changes the value in cell D2 from 10 to negative the device converts the third change column from a positive change column into a negative change column as shown in by changing the dimensions position and color of the third change column . Furthermore the device updates the position of the first change column and the second change column in relationship to the change in the first total column . Also since the result in cell F2 in the table has changed from 60 to 110 the device will change the vertical dimension of the second total column accordingly.

In an embodiment the device renders columns on a waterfall chart as change columns or total columns based on whether the input into the corresponding cell of the table is a static value or a sum and possibly whether the column is the first column of the waterfall chart the last column of the waterfall chart or an intermediate column. For example if a user enters a static value into a cell and the cell is not associated with the first or last column of the waterfall chart then the device assumes that the user wishes to create a change column. If a user enters a sum i.e. a formula that sums one or more preceding cells the device assumes that the user wishes to create a total column. In some embodiments the default behavior of the device can be overridden by the user. For example by interacting with the UI the user could make one or both the first column and the last column a change column.

Turning to assume that the user right clicks on column D and selects from a menu the option to insert a column to the left. The device reacts by shifting all of the columns from D through F to the right. The user then names the column Midpoint by entering Midpoint in cell D1 and enters the formula SUM B2 C2 in cell D2 as shown in . The device reacts by rendering a third total column which is shown in . The device also moves the second change column the third change column and the second total column to the right. In some embodiments the formula in cell G2 of the table is automatically updated so as to exclude the third total column . For example the device may update the formula to SUM B2 C2 E2 F2 . If on the other hand the user enters a static value in cell D2 e.g. 120 then the device reacts by rendering a fourth change column shown in having the appropriate color for a positive change column in this case and the appropriate configuration e.g. correct dimensions and floating .

Referring still to and in an embodiment the device receives e.g. from a user a selection of a particular column on the waterfall chart via the column select pull down menu . The device also receives an input via the column type control indicating that the column should be switched from a total column to a change column or vice versa. In response the device switches the selected column from a change column to a total column or vice versa. For example if the user selects the third total column and toggles the column type control from total to change then the device reacts by replacing the third total column with the fourth change column shown in .

According to an embodiment the device adjusts the vertical axis of the waterfall chart based on changes in the values in the cells of the underlying table. For example assume that the user changes the value in cell E2 in the table from negative to negative . The device reacts by re rendering the third change column so that it is now a larger negative change column and re rendering the vertical axis so that it now accommodates the larger resulting negative value. The resulting change in the waterfall chart is shown in .

Turning to a procedure carried out by the device e.g. by the processor in an embodiment is described. At block the device receives an input into a cell of a table. If at block the input is a sum then the process continues to block at which the device renders on the waterfall chart a total column representing the sum. If at block the input is a static value then process continues to block . If at block the column associated with the cell is the first column or the last column of the waterfall chart then at block the device renders a total column representing the static value on the waterfall chart. If at block the column associated with the cell is not the first column or the last block column then the process continues to block at which the device renders on the waterfall chart a change column representing the static value.

Turning to a procedure carried out by the device e.g. by the processor in another embodiment is described. At block the device receives a selection of a column of the waterfall chart. At block the device receives an input via an on screen control indicating that the column should be converted from a total column to a change column or from a change column to a total column. At block the device converts the column from a total column to a change column or from a change column to a total column as indicated by the input.
