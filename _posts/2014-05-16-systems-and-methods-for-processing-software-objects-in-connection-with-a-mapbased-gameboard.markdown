No. 8 167 701 issued May 1 2012 also entitled Systems and Methods for Lottery Style Games. These applications are incorporated by reference in their entireties.

Embodiments of the present invention relate generally to games of chance. More specifically the present invention relates to systems and methods for processing software applications and or objects in connection with games of chance based on a map based gameboard.

In various embodiments of the previously disclosed GeoSweep Treasure Hunt and Free2Play game the prizes that players may win e.g. by owning one or more selected grid units are limited to real world prizes or in game bonuses. Even in the Treasure Hunt embodiments the players winnings for digging a particular grid unit are restricted to similar types of prizes. Furthermore the manner in which these prizes or in game bonuses may be won is fairly limited e.g. by selecting one particular grid unit over another. As a result players may get bored with the game over time or may not be sufficiently motivated by the game or the potential prizes to continue to play the game.

Accordingly there is a need to provide the players with a more dynamic gaming environment and user experience by offering additional ways to play games such as the map based GeoSweep Treasure Hunt or Free2Play. Players in return may be more satisfied by finding the game more engaging and appealing even after multiple rounds. As an additional benefit these new gaming features may interest players unfamiliar with the game further increasing the fan base.

Additionally there is a need to offer additional types of prizes beyond those currently available and to allow other interactions between users and the map based gameboard. This would not only provide players with a greater incentive to play but it may also provide the players with additional motivation to return to the game after each iteration of GeoSweep Treasure Hunt or other map based games.

Systems and methods for processing software objects in connection with a map based gameboard are disclosed. Embodiments of the presently disclosed invention provide players with the ability to participate in a map based game that offers prizes or discovery or surprise in the form of software applications hereinafter generally referred to as Apps upon his or her selection of one or more units in a gameboard of the map based game. For example in a GeoSweep Treasure Hunt or other map based games as played on a mobile device or other computing platforms containing a graphical user interface one or more of the grid units may have embedded therein one or more Apps that when selected by the player cause an App to be executed and displayed to the player. There may be any number or type of Apps on the map based gameboard effectively giving players access to a marketplace of applications with endless potential. The Apps may enhance the underlying GeoSweep Treasure Hunt or other map based games or may serve informational recreational promotional entertainment or commercial purposes as well. These Apps may but need not be related to the map based game at all.

One aspect of the present invention includes computer implemented methods for facilitating a map based game. In one embodiment the computer implemented method begins by establishing by at least one processor a map based game that contains a plurality of selectable units in a game board. During play player selections are received which includes the selection of at least one unit and each player is associated with his or her selected unit. It is then determined whether the player wins a prize based on the player s selections of the unit s and the player is provided with access to an application which is executable by a processor. In one preferred embodiment the application is downloaded to the computer of the player and executed causing the application s user interface to be displayed to the player for interaction. The applications that are accessible may provide players with entertainment advertisements promotional information education social networking games media utility functions or even unlock aspects or features of the map based game.

In another embodiment a computer implemented method for facilitating a map based game includes establishing by at least one processor at a gaming server system a map based game containing a plurality of selectable units in a gameboard and receiving a player selection of a unit in the gameboard. The selected unit is associated with the player and it is determined whether the player receives software object based on the unit selected. In response to this determination the software object is caused to be automatically downloaded and processed at a computer of the player to display a user interface of the application in response.

In yet another embodiment of the present invention a computer implemented method for facilitating a map based game includes the step of establishing a map based game containing a plurality of selectable units in a gameboard. A plurality of executable applications is associated with one or more predetermined units in the gameboard effectively distributing applications throughout the gameboard for discovery. Furthermore player selections of one or more grid units may be received with one or more credits for play. The selected unit may then be associated with the first player. In addition the first player is provided with access to at least one executable application in response to the step of associating.

The attached Figures depict exemplary embodiments and are meant to be understood in view of the details disclosed herein.

The following describes in detail various embodiments of the present invention. One of ordinary skill in the art would understand that standard programming and engineering techniques may be used to produce such embodiments including software firmware hardware or any combination thereof to implement the disclosed subject matter.

At a player selection is received containing a selection of one or more grid units on the map based gameboard. In the Treasure Hunt game for example a user may select a grid unit by choosing a particular grid unit for digging. As a result the player s selection may be associated with the player s account.

At it is determined whether the player wins. In the case of where the selected grid unit is associated with an App the player may be awarded the App. The Apps that may be awarded may be a utility App promotional or advertisement App an educational App a game App a social networking App entertainment App news App a media App or any other type or categories of software applications or objects. For instance players may be rewarded an App that allows them to watch videos music podcasts audiobooks. Another App may provide players with access to the latest news from around the world and to access their friends social network status and profiles. As discussed in other portions of this specification the Apps include computer executable lines of codes executable by the computer systems of the map based game of players and of other parties. The Apps may be developed in accordance with the software platform associated with the map based game and in some embodiments may also be developed for execution on the iOS Android Windows Mobile Windows Mac OS Linux Unix and or other software platforms. In at least one embodiment the Apps that are provided to players of the map based game may include Apps from various application stores from other platforms such as the Apple App Store the Android Market the Windows MarketPlace the Windows Store the BlackBerry App World and others.

At the player is provided with access to an App. In the preferred embodiment at least a portion of the computer executable lines of App code is automatically downloaded and executed by the processor of a computer platform resulting in the display of the App s user interface to the user. For instance depicts a user interface that is displayed to the player after the he or she selects the grid unit and the executable code of the App is executed. In this example a user interface of a game Clue Hunter is provided to the player and includes various menu options and interactive visualization that allows the player to interact with an environment search for clues watch a video about the mystery and find clues in nearby real world locations. The map based game s user interface may be entirely replaced on the display of the computing platform by the user interface of the App thereby allowing the player s attention to focus fully on the App. depicts another embodiment of the user interface in which only a portion of the interface displays the App is executed. In this example the user interface of the App Virtual Bingo takes up only a portion of the user interface shown viewable by the player. Players may interact with the map based game such as making additional grid unit selections while still accessing the App and playing the game. In one embodiment upon the selection of the grid unit by the user the map interface may zoom into the chosen grid unit and the App displayed may be wholly contained within the grid unit. The player may save the App that the player has won for later access. In some embodiments this step occurs automatically upon the determination that the player should be awarded an App.

After the player may select additional grid units if the player still has remaining grid unit selections at whereupon the method traverses again to steps to determine whether the player should be awarded an App and so on. Else the round or game ends at .

In addition to map based games that are similar to Treasure Hunt embodiments of the present invention also provide for map based lottery games that are similar to that of GeoSweep or Free2Play. A player may enroll in the game by taking virtual land ownership of one or more grid units and becoming committed to participate in a series of scheduled lottery drawings. The player may participate in a lottery drawing by contributing tokens of value on behalf of at least one grid unit the player owns. During any of those drawings if a grid unit owned by the player is selected as a first prize winner that player may receive a prize in this case an App. In certain embodiments second or third or further prize winners are awarded Apps as consolation prizes. Other embodiments of GeoSweep Free2Play or similar games may also be played.

At a player selection may be received containing information of a player s selected grid unit and the number of tokens that is wagered for that particular grid unit. In one embodiment the more tokens the player bets the greater the prize may be. For example players may only win high valued Apps if the player had placed more than a predetermined of tokens in association with the selected grid unit. After the player s tokens and selections are received the player at is associated with the grid unit that he or she has selected with a requisite contribution of tokens.

Once it is time to conduct the drawing which may take place on a regular or scheduled basis one or more grid units are randomly selected at to win the jackpot. At the jackpot which may include an App is provided to the player that is associated with the winning grid unit. In addition secondary winners or losing players may be provided with demo versions of the same App or may be provided with other Apps of lesser value. In embodiments in which both Apps and prizes are offered Apps or in App games could be offered to players who have failed to win any significant prize or a physical prize in a lottery drawing as a second chance to win prizes. The winning player may receive notification that the player is a winner and now has access to the App e.g. by accessing his App library . As discussed in other portions of this specification the App may be automatically downloaded to the player s computing device upon the determination that the player has won the App. When the player ultimately accesses his prize he may be shown the user interface of the App e.g. automatically allowing the player to interact with the App. At the method ends.

At the drawing is conducted and one or more grid units from the gameboard that are at play may be selected as a winner s . Accordingly at the player associated with the winning grid unit s may be awarded the jackpot which may be a monetary award merchandise tokens or any other types of prizes. Indeed the jackpot may also be or at least include one or more Apps. Where an awarded prize contains an App the player at may automatically download the App to his or her computing device for execution. Thus as demonstrated in this and other embodiments discussed herein Apps may be awarded in various stages in a map based game thereby increasing excitement and interests from players by providing additional manners in which prizes may be won and providing additional types of prizes that may be won.

In embodiments of map based games a player may be required to find and select a predetermined number of grid units associated with a particular App before the player is be able to access and or download the App. For instance players may receive a Pirate game App by discovering at least half of the grid units that are associated with the App. The player may be provided with notice of his progress in this search. The player may also be incentivize to continue the search for the remaining associated grid units while also rewarding players for their progress such as by offering players discounts to purchase the App with each instances of discovery as the player works toward reaching the discovery goal. For example where the winning of the Pirate game App requires the discovery of five grid units a player may receive a 20 percent discount on purchasing the App after having discovered one grid unit associated with the App. After discovering a second grid unit associated with the App the player may receive a 40 percent discount off of the price of the Pirate game App and so on. Other variations of discount and incentive methods may be used to incentivize the players to find the grid units associated with a particular App and to maintain player interests.

In one embodiment the player may gain access to an App associated with a grid unit only upon his or her digging of all of the grid units that surround one or more grid units containing an App. Thus by successfully digging all of the grid units surrounding an area containing one or more grid units the player may gain access to all Apps associated with the grid units that are contained within that area. This feature may offer players a larger set of prizes in return for the greater risks he or she takes in attempting to dig an entire group of grid units that surround an entire area since at any time another player may disrupt the player s chances of winning by digging within the area or within the circumference that the player is attempting to complete. Alternatively the player may be given a randomly chosen App that is embedded in a grid unit within the contained area.

Furthermore players may receive prizes additional Apps or advantageous information by interacting with the Apps themselves. For example by successful solving of puzzles questions or tasks in the App may result in additional prizes or in game bonuses for the players. Players may be offered in game bonuses or prizes simply for downloading and trying a particular App. In another embodiment the discovery of one App could provide clues for another one or more Apps hidden in the map based gameboard. Further the discovery and activation of an App could expand the gameboard at the edge or consolidate one s unoccupied neighboring grid units. Similarly the game may be further enhanced when combined with Apps that only allow players to successfully dig the associated grid unit upon his or her successful completion of a task within the App. As a result the possibility of receiving the prize App may not be automatic introducing yet another dynamic to the map based game as players compete against one another to receive the prize Apps. Other types of prize awarding rules may be utilized to determine players are eligible to receive certain Apps including those prize awarding rules disclosed in related applications. For example an App may be awarded once all of treasures associated with an App spread across multiple layers of grid units are found or once all of the pieces of a puzzle are found e.g. all of the bones of a dinosaur has been discovered .

Players may be required to visit real world locations e.g. a kiosk associated with the map based game to gain access to particular grid units that are required for access to an App. The player may have to perform certain tasks at the real world locations. For instance a bank sponsoring a banking App may require players to visit a branch location of the bank and connect the player s mobile phone to the bank s ATM machine or wireless network and check the player s balance or perform other banking functions in order to receive the banking App to receive a discount to purchase the banking App or others or receive tokens grid units and other bonuses.

In addition to Apps map based games may also provide prizes as well as Apps. In addition additional prizes may also be awarded upon the discovery of a top ranked or designated Apps. For example players may be awarded a gift card for finding all of the Apps associated with a company within a particular region of the gameboard.

In embodiments of the present invention players may have to pay for each grid unit selection. In these cases the developers of the App may determine the price of each grid unit associated with the App. A grid unit for example may be priced according to the value of the App or may be randomly selected which may offer players the chance to receive Apps at a steep discount . In certain embodiments Apps associated with each grid unit may be visible to the player when he or she is selecting the grid units. The apps may be represented by an icon within each grid unit. In one embodiment the icon and screenshots of the App may be hidden until a player selects the grid unit whereupon the relevant information is displayed to the user.

Apps may be placed in the map of the map based game in similar fashion to the prize placement algorithm of GeoSweep or Treasure Hunt games. For instance the association of one or more Apps with one or grid units may be predetermined prior to the start of a game in a static manner i.e. predetermined play . The placement of the Apps prior to each round may be random or may be based on any number of factors including the number of players the players grid selection history players winning grid selection history players map scrolling or grid viewing history. For example a grid unit may be associated with a high value App if the grid unit is rarely chosen viewed or otherwise rarely receives the players interests. Furthermore the placement of Apps may be chosen based on the players participating in the game including information concerning their play and user interests and the information contained within player preferences and profile information.

The placement of the Apps prior to each round may also be based on sponsorship or based on the location of the grid unit with respect to real world locations. Indeed the placement of Apps may be based upon the geographical location associated with a particular grid unit. For instance in a game in which the grid units each represents a particular area of a real world map such as a city or even the entire country an App may be associated with the grid unit that corresponds to a physical location of choice. In addition a merchant may permanently associate an App with one or more grid unit. For instance a grid unit corresponding to the location of the App creator s headquarter may be associated with the App. Furthermore upon the player s selection of the grid unit the App may cause the display of the merchant s website blogs twits fan pages or affiliates Apps. In various other embodiments the association of one or more Apps with one or more grid units may also depend on the real time location of the computing platform the location history of the computing platform the user interests preferences and play history and other information. For example the type and number of Apps embedded in each grid unit may depend on the real time current location of the mobile devices of players and the location history of these mobile devices. Indeed the association of the Apps with respect to grid units may be customized in any number of manners as an effort to increase user interests and play.

Furthermore the availability of the GeoSweep platform may allow App developers to offer their App by scattering copies of the Apps in one or more grid units to be discovered. Therefore during a promotional period such as when the App is just released a developer may scatter a number of a new App throughout a geographic area to promote the App. This may cause additional participation by players. Developers for example may target particular regions of the country by embedding Apps in the same region on the game map. Furthermore Developers may also embed Apps based on attributes of players known to be interested in the grid unit and its location. For instance where a grid unit is often selected by players in the age range of 16 to 24 an App developer may embed its game App in the particular grid unit and surrounding areas. The Apps scattered may be trial based discounted or full versions of the Apps.

In one embodiment players may receive or initiate Hot periods in which grid unit selections may be discounted for the player and the player may have a greater chance of winning high valued Apps. Furthermore these Hot periods may provide players with access to coupons free tokens to purchase grids and other benefits.

In at least one embodiment of the present invention players may earn prizes by allowing Apps to be embedded into his or her grid unit. For example in games of GeoSweep where players own particular grid units players may receive the App for free prizes tokens or additional grid units by allowing developers to embed their Apps in the grid unit. On the map other players may see that an App is available to download at the grid unit and may download the App for free or at cost. In one embodiment a grid owner may allow developers to embed an App in the grid unit and return the grid unit for play by all other players for one or more rounds in return for free access to the App prizes or tokens. In effect players may lease out their reserved grid unit for one or more rounds. In one embodiment players may receive additional prizes or tokens based on the number of download of the App by other players.

The Apps may also be dynamically embedded with one or more grid units similar to the dynamic placement of prizes in a Treasure Hunt game i.e. dynamic play . Thus whether a grid unit is associated with a particular App may be determined by the computing platform when the player selects the particular grid unit. depicts a flowchart illustrating a method of facilitating a dynamic play of a map based game containing Apps. Similar to the previously described embodiments an online game containing a map that includes a plurality of grid units is established at . Next enrollment of a plurality of players is accepted at . Unlike a static play of a map based game the embodiments of the dynamic play game of do not determine the placement of an App on the map prior to a player s interaction i.e. prior to the start of a round . After the plurality of players is enrolled the game begins by allowing players to select grid units. At a grid unit selection may be received. Once the grid unit has been selected the player is associated with the grid units according to .

After the player is associated with each of selected grid units it is determined at whether the player wins by executing a probability algorithm. Thus in the dynamic play of the game it is unknown whether the player would win a prize even at the moment the player chooses a particular grid unit. It is not until the probability algorithm is executed that the results of the player s selections are known. In other words at the start of each dynamic play game each grid unit has a chance of containing the prize. In contrast in the predetermined game each tile either has a winning prize or it does not i.e. each grid unit either has a 0 or 100 chance of containing a prize. In one basic probability algorithm the number of not yet won Apps P the number of grid units not yet selected U and a randomly generated number R are considered. The random generated number R when generated will be in the range 0

The above described basic algorithm may be used in a fair game where each grid unit has the same chance of winning. In certain embodiments the chances of winning an App may vary from grid unit to grid unit. In these games each grid unit may be associated with predetermined winning factor F. The value of Fmay be any number greater than 0. The closer the value of Fto 1 the closer the algorithm is equivalent to the algorithm in a fair game. Further when the value of Fis greater than 1 it is easier to win the prize. Once the value of R has been randomly generated the determination of whether the player wins the prize may be The player receives the App if The player loses and does not receive the App if

For example where the value of Fis 2 the player has twice the probability of winning the App. When used in the map based game the value of Fmay be known for each grid units or it may be hidden. Further the value of Fmay be represented by the size of the grid unit relative to the other grid units. A player s an association with an App may be dependent on inter alia player selection history player winning loss ratio player type player s logged app activation or play or player profile parameters or other game variables.

In various embodiments of the GeoSweep Treasure Hunt game Apps may categorized by a plurality of tiers. Valuable Apps may be considered to be in the highest tier while Apps of less value may be considered in the lowest tier. Accordingly Apps of the higher tiers may be more difficult to win than Apps at the lower tiers. Thus where a high tiered App is embedded within a grid unit a player who selects that grid unit for play may have a lower chance of winning the App e.g. 1 in 100 chance of winning than if the player had selected another grid unit that contains a low tiered App e.g. 1 in 5 chance of winning . Thus in an embodiment of the dynamic play of the map based game a probability algorithm may take into consideration the multiple tiers of Apps with each tier having differing probability of winning a prize. Where multiple Apps are embedded in a grid unit each App may have a unique prize tier. In addition in embodiments of the map based game in which both prizes and Apps are offered prizes may be considered to be higher in tier than Apps. In another embodiment the tiers of Apps may be based upon the value of the App and may vary from prize to App to App. For example Apps that may be offered for free in an App marketplace may be considered a bottom tier while Apps that may be purchased for 5 in the App marketplace may be in the same tier as a 5 gift card prize. Other probability algorithms may be used in various embodiments of the present invention including utilizing tier adjustment factors and or other bases. Indeed probability algorithms disclosed in related application incorporated herein as well as other probability algorithms may be utilized. At the player is awarded an App. Additional player selections may be received at which point the method returns to . Else the method ends at .

In another embodiment of the invention some or all Apps available to be awarded to players may also be downloaded in trial mode or may be purchased in full without playing the map based game e.g. without the need for player s selection and or purchasing of the grid unit as part of gameplay in hopes of winning an App . This may not only allow the player to test the App to his or her liking but also allow players to outright buy Apps without wagering money through gameplay in hopes of winning a particularly desired App. The use of trials may also allow the player to receive additional prizes or in game bonuses. Thus in one embodiment in addition to Apps hidden in grid units throughout a gameboard there may also be various Apps spread throughout the gameboard for trial and or purchase. Players may navigate the gameboard to browse through the Apps that are available for download in addition to navigating the map to play the map based game.

In one further embodiment regions of the Map may contain Apps of particular categories. Further subregions within each region may contain sub categories of Apps and so on. Thus the gameboard may contain an easily navigable App marketplace that provides players with a wide variety of Apps from which to try and buy. After selection of a particular grid unit players may be asked whether the player would like to 1 download a trial version of an App 2 buy the full version of the App or 3 select the App for play e.g. digging or wagering for a lottery drawing .

In one embodiment Apps may be downloaded in trial mode and only activated upon proof of the player s grid unit ownership proof of grid unit purchases e.g. of a certain number or type or proof of participation in certain number of GeoSweep or related games. Various other tasks may be required to gain access to a full version of a game. Thus in additional to the chance of trying out the App players may convert trial version of an App to a full version upon completion of various tasks as may be defined by developers.

As discussed briefly above the selecting or purchasing of a grid unit may allow access to additional feature unlocking Apps. One feature that may be unlocked is a Global Positioning System GPS feature that allows players to use the map based game application with GPS information. Thus players may receive hints or directions to treasures nearby friends or participating stores or merchants and may receive notification in real time. This feature may also offer players the ability to gain access to additional prizes or in game bonuses based on the player s real time position. As discussed with respect to the Treasure Hunt embodiment of the map based game the use of GPS information may allow players to visit real world locations corresponding to grid units and receive hints of nearby hidden prizes. Similarly players having access to this feature may be notified of nearby grid units containing hidden Apps or may receive directions to the nearest kiosk where an App may be downloaded as a prize. In addition to GPS capabilities Apps may also grant players with access to Near Field Communications Radio Frequency Identifications and or Quick Response bar code features to be used in conjunction with the map based game application.

In one embodiment where the map based game application is executed on a mobile phone with a built in camera and GPS system the feature may allow the player to visualize prizes that are available at a particular real world location as it relates to its corresponding grid unit and may offer hints as to the locations of prizes or other Apps. Finally another feature unlocking App may facilitate the physical connection with Treasure Hunt or GeoSweep kiosks and or devices at participating merchants providing the player with a plurality of advantages or in game bonuses.

In yet another embodiment an App may provide players with access to a sharing or teaming feature that allows players of Treasure Hunt or other games to form a team and hunt for treasures in that manner. Thus in these cases prizes may be shared amongst the team members. An App may also grant users access to an augmented reality feature of the map based game application.

Developer systems and may be computer systems operated by software developers who develop or maintain Apps provided to players of the map based game. The system may connect with developer systems and to retrieve and or provide access to Apps for players.

At the start of an instance of the game players may select one or more grid units on the map based gameboard associated with one or more Apps at by using the computer and player mobile device to make their selections of one or more grid units. At the system may determine whether any selected grid units contains an embedded App. At the App may be downloaded to the player s computing device. For example system may communicate the address location of the App to the player computer . The player computer receiving the address location may connect directly to developer systems or developer system to download the App code. In at least one embodiment system includes one or more databases containing information of every App available in the map based game including the network locations from which the App may be retrieved.

In one embodiment player computer may download the App code from an App repository at system and may provide players with the App. Indeed in one embodiment system retrieves Apps from sources such as developer system other systems connected to network or from local sources and stores the App in an App repository managed by the system. In one further embodiment popular Apps may be stored at the App repository as a cache mechanism while less frequently accessed Apps may be retrieved from the App source upon need. Alternatively in response to a request for a less frequently utilized App addresses of the external App source may be provided instead.

In response the player computer may automatically download the App code and store the App s code locally at computer and at the App is executed. Each of the grid units of the map based game may be associated with the computer executable lines of code of one or more Apps.

The App may be made of one or more lines of codes that may be executable by a processor at a computing platform. Any suitable programming language may be used in accordance with the various embodiments of the invention. Illustratively the programming language used may include assembly language ActionScript Ada APL BASIC C C C COBOL dBase Forth FORTRAN Java Modula 2 Pascal PHP Prolog REXX Scala and or JavaScript for example. Further it is not necessary that a single type of instruction or programming language be utilized in conjunction with the operation of the systems and methods of the invention. Rather any number of different programming languages may be utilized as is necessary or desirable. Further as discussed below an App may make use of functions defined by an application programming interface API of the map based game application. In one embodiment these applications are Adobe Flash based applications while in another embodiment they may be extensions to the map based game application.

App may be downloaded prior to the user s selection of the grid unit. For example the App may be downloaded when the map based game was downloaded to the computing platform while the player is actively playing the game while the computing device is idle when the player selects a grid unit that is proximately located to the grid unit containing the App or when the player clicks on one of a group of tiles that together make the App. Parts or the entire App may in certain embodiments be wholly embedded into the map based game application. Other possible manners to download the Apps so as to facilitate the retrieval and execution of the App by the processor are well within the scope of the present invention. Once the computing platform has downloaded an App it may store the App in memory for later retrieval and cached in manners well known in the art for rapid retrieval and execution of the App upon the players selections.

In at least one embodiment each grid unit is associated with at least one or more links scripts and or pointers associated with a particular App as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. When the user selects the grid unit containing the link s script s or pointer s the computing platform may process and or execute underlying codes causing the loading of the App that is previously stored in memory to be executed by the processor. In other embodiments the execution of the link s script s or pointer s may cause the computing platform to connect to one or more servers on a network such as the Internet in order to download or retrieve at least a portion of a code module of the App. Upon retrieval of the code module of the App the code module may be automatically executed by the processor. Thus in these embodiments the Apps may not be downloaded to the computing platform until the grid unit is selected by the player.

The system may further receive additional grid unit selections from the players whereupon it once again determines whether there is an App embedded in the grid unit and provides the grid unit with the link accordingly and so on. At the game ends.

In addition rather than downloading or executing an App the activation of the link s script s or pointer s of one or more grid units may cause the unlocking of a feature or portion of the GeoSweep game that was previously inaccessible to the player. These features of the game may have been concurrently downloaded to the computing platform with the map based game application as an inaccessible i.e. locked feature. The selection of a particular grid unit associated with these features may allow the user to gain access to the Global Positioning System GPS feature Near Field Communication NFC feature and other features of the map based game application discussed previously.

In one embodiment of the present invention the Apps of the presently disclosed invention are executed and their user interface displayed entirely within the GeoSweep software on the computing platform. In particular the Apps are downloaded executed and processed entirely by the GeoSweep application and may take place entirely at system or entirely at player computer or device . For example the Apps may be Adobe Flash based or may be application extensions that may be properly retrieved processed and executed by the map based game application. The Apps may be developed by any software developer according to a software developer kit SDK for example provided by owner of the map based gameboard platform that contains therein application programming interfaces APIs that may be called upon by the Apps to access functions available in connection with the map based game application. The SDK may further include software rules and coding conventions. Together the SDK API and programming conventions may allow developers to create Apps that gather information about the player the current game or the currently selected grid unit and manipulate the information in various manners. As discussed in more detail below an App for example may gather the player information to configure an in app game. According to the performance of the player within the game the App may then cause GeoSweep based prizes or bonuses to be awarded to the player after the player returns to the GeoSweep game. Thus the use of standard SDK API and programming conventions allow for limitless numbers and types of Apps allowing the user to access any number of games media information features and functions. The Apps may be pre approved by the owner of the map based game platform before being allowed to be associated with one or more grid units in order to maintain a proper level of quality and security within the application marketplace and the game environment.

In another embodiment of the present invention the Apps may be software applications that are entirely separate from that of the map based game hereinafter referred generally as external Apps . Thus in these cases the selection of a grid unit which may contain link s script s or pointer s may cause the retrieval download and or execution of the external App. In such cases the map based game application may be closed and the external App may be initiated on the player computer as a response to a player selection. Information similar to that described above may be transmitted from the GeoSweep software to the App. Once the player has used the App and has accumulated prizes the original GeoSweep software may be called by the computing platform and information may be passed back to the game for processing. These external Apps may be executed as a standalone application as well without the need to initially access the map based game application in order to select the App.

In one embodiment the present invention is implemented as part of a web browser based version of GeoSweep which may be used on any and all computing platforms. The browser may access a web page of the GeoSweep game thereby allowing the player to directly play the game and interact with the grid units. In these embodiments each grid unit may be associated with one or more Apps similar to other implementations of the present invention. However in these embodiments each grid unit may contain link s script s or pointer s that when activated cause the retrieval of at least a portion of the App and the depiction of the App s user interface within the browser. The App may be embedded seamlessly into the user interface of the map based game as shown in the web browser. In one embodiment the link s script s or pointer s directs the player to a webpage containing the App. In similar fashion the player may interact with the App contained in the webpage and information concerning the game players grid units prizes in App results may be passed between the GeoSweep webpage and the App webpage.

In one aspect of the Apps the Apps may connect to third party servers in order to download additional content including in app content games advertisements media or additional in app functions. This may take place prior to the users selection of the grid unit associated with the App during the user s interaction with the App or after the user returns to the GeoSweep game from the App.

In another embodiment of the present invention software developers may connect to the system to configure the delivery of Apps within any number of map based games provided by the system. Developers may use an API to access the system and configure the Apps that are to be provided the App distribution algorithm the probability algorithms the Apps targeting settings and other settings which may allow the developer to customize the play of the game and the distribution of Apps. Developers may also use the API to set App price trial or promotional periods and other business related actions.
