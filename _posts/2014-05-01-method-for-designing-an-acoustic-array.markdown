The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The present invention is directed to a method for designing an acoustic array and more particularly to a method for designing an acoustic array with simplified wiring and processing.

Beamforming is used in active and passive sonar to increase the efficiency or gain from an array of transducers. In such an array each transducer is separately wired to acoustic processing equipment. The acoustic processing equipment adjusts the power and time delay associated with the joined transducer. This requires separately controlling the signal associated with each array element.

Conventional arrays modify beam patterns to lower sidelobes by electrically shading the outputs of a number of elements or less effectively by using multiple elements in a series parallel connection. It is known that types of hydrophones such as PVDF hydrophones can be shaped so as to achieve the same reduced sidelobe levels as a number of electrically shaded elements thereby eliminating the electronics and saving space. It has been shown that a single element can be shaped as a linear tapered element or an element shaped to an approximation of a 40 dB Chebyshev shading function can be used to reduce the sidelobes from that which would be expected with a rectangular element. These single elements are mounted to a cylindrical surface before use. These methods teach suppression of sidelobes by area shading but they don t teach a method for designing an acoustic transducer or sensor to a preferred beam pattern.

Curved and doubly curved geometries are known for active and passive sonar arrays however in the prior art the array shape is dictated by the underlying object not the beam pattern. Electronic shading is typically used for giving a preferred beam pattern. One such array is given by U.S. Pat. No. 6 711 096 to Kim C. Benjamin. Also known are methods for making arrays having conforming shapes such as that given in U.S. Pat. No. 6 255 761 to Benjamin.

It is a first object of the present invention to provide a method for designing acoustic arrays in accordance with a preferred beam pattern 

Another object is to design acoustic arrays that minimize the use of processing and electronics to achieve the desired beam pattern and

Yet another object is to provide an acoustic array having a beam pattern that conserves power by avoiding projection of acoustic energy in undesired directions.

Accordingly there is provided a method for designing an acoustic array that includes establishing a desired beam pattern acoustic wavelength and beamwidth for the array. Geometric parameters are calculated from these constraints. The array is modeled as a plurality of elements positioned in accordance with the geometric parameters. An amplitude shading function is calculated. An array of acoustic elements is constructed having an area calculated from the calculated amplitude shading function. An acoustic array designed by this process is further provided.

In order to form a beam pattern of a desired shape amplitude shading is applied to the point source model given in . As an example one desired beam pattern is provided in . Beam pattern is obtained by applying logarithmic shading to each point source element . Utilizing this shading the amplitude level provided to the element drops 1 dB for each degree from 40 to 0 as shown in . In the range of 55 to 40 the amplitude is 0 dB or value of unity in order to maintain the 45 beam in without any attenuation. This results in the beam pattern shown in .

In the prior art element amplitude shading was used to obtain the desired beam pattern. Typically an uncurved linear array of transmitters is used. Beamforming is performed by providing amplitude weighted and timed signals to each element of the array. This results in complex wiring and electronics because it requires that each element be separately addressable.

The current method utilizes active area shading instead of amplitude shading. In this method the active radiating surface area of the array element is designed to have an area in accordance with that of the amplitude coefficients chosen to generate a particular beam pattern shape. Signal delays are given by the element s relative positioning along the curved array. This positioning gives constructive or destructive interference among the elements of the array.

Utilizing the beam pattern of the case of the logarithmic amplitude shading values in gives an array as shown in . This array has the appearance of a curved bowtie or an hourglass. End portions of array have a larger area as required by the beam shading function given in . Center portion of array has a much smaller area to give the attenuation desired at the center of the array. A sectional view along line is given in . Array includes transduction material sandwiched between electrodes and . Transduction material can be a continuous type of transducer material such as piezoelectric polymers. These include PVDF 0 3 piezo rubber and 1 3 piezo composites which are semi flexible continuous sheets. As can be seen in the sectional view foil electrodes and are deposited or etched right on the surface of the transducer material. is not to scale and electrodes and are much thinner than shown. The use of area shading allows the same electrical drive voltage to be applied to all of the elements in this array eliminating complex wiring and sonar beamformer electronics.

For modeling and fabrication this array could be made more practical by discretizing the continuous array of into a more practical array having discrete sub arrays and of transducer elements as shown in . The areas of the sub arrays determine the sound pressure level SPL that is produced within the coverage angle of the sub array. Array in includes nine sub arrays that are positioned to direct the energy into a fixed coverage angle. As an example in sub array with area Awill radiate full sound pressure level Pin the 55 to 36 angle coverage in order to maintain the 45 beam without attenuation. Sub array with area Awill radiate a 10 dB reduction in sound pressure level Pfor the 35 to 26 angle coverage thus A 0.316 A . Sub array area Awill radiate a reduced 20 dB in SPL in 25 to 16 angle coverage by area A 0.1 A . Sub array area Awill radiate a reduced 30 dB in SPL in 15 to 6 angle coverage by area A 0.0316 A . Sub array area Awill radiate a reduced 40 dB in SPL in 5 to 0 angle coverage by area A 0.01 A which is repeated as subarray having angular coverage of 0 to 5 on the right side of the array .

The acoustic output power for an electro acoustic transducer is the acoustic intensity multiplied by its radiating surface area W I A . Its electrical input power W and acoustic output power W are related by the electro acoustic efficiency of the transducer by W W. For a transducer that is 50 efficient its acoustic output power is one half of the electrical input power. For a 100 efficient transducer input and output power are equal. Sonar transducer efficiencies typically range between 50 and 90 depending on the design type. Array shown in has nine sub arrays each with its own surface area. Total area is A 2 A 2 A 2 A 2 A A. If all of the sub arrays were of the same length and width as A the array would produce a fan shaped beam pattern similar to that of . The total surface area would be A 9 A with the acoustic output power being nine times that of A. The total electrical input power would also be nine times greater than Abecause W W. Comparing this with the area shaded design in where A 1 A A 0.316 A A 0.1 A A 0.0316 and A A 0.01 the total area for the shaded design is 2.9 A . The area of the shaded design is approximately one third less than the area of the equal area sub arrays array and will require approximately one third less electrical input power.

This concept can be expanded further into arrays having sub arrays oriented at any angle that evenly divide 360 . Ultimately this leads to the embodiment shown in . Array is composed of four conical sections assembled from truncated cones of various base diameters stacked on one another. The conical sections gradually decrease in size from bottom to top with an active disc on top. The outer surface of each cone is slanted to a particular angular direction.

Array produces a conical beam pattern that is depressed in the middle in accordance with the surface areas and slant angles chosen. Rectangular piston functions cannot be used to model array as in array and arrays and . Instead each of the conical sections has been modeled as a discrete baffled piston. Each of the piston functions is tilted and twisted to form the conic sections.

As briefly described above these arrays could be fabricated from many different transduction technologies PVDF piezoelectric polymer sheets 0 3 piezo rubber sheet 1 3 piezo composite n m matrix or Tonpilz transducer n m elements. PVDF or co polymers polyvinylidene fluoride trifluoroethylene P VDF TrFE are piezoelectric polymers available in thin sheets up to 0.50 mm and are more suited to hydrophone material than to projectors. These materials are available in continuous sheet forms and are semi flexible and their surfaces are coated with copper or silver that act as the electrode. Piezo rubber materials have particles of piezoceramics suspended in a rubber like matrix available in thicker sheets 3.30 mm . These are also more suited to hydrophone material than to projectors. These materials are available in continuous sheet forms are semi flexible and their surfaces are coated with copper or silver that act as the electrode. The 1 3 piezo composite material consists of thin piezoceramic rods aligned parallel to the poling direction and imbedded in a polymer filler epoxies and polyurethanes . Their surfaces are coated with copper or silver that act as the electrode. These are also available in sheet form are semi flexible and are suited to both hydrophone and projector material. Each piezoelectric rod forms an n m matrix that could be used to fabricate a sub array. Bending or forming 1 3 piezo composite into a curved surface over solid ceramic material is one of its major advantages though induced stresses and geometric distortion can be a challenge. The Tonpilz or Langevin type transducer designs are layered structures of metal piston piezoceramic and metal tail mass which lowers the resonance frequency significantly compared to the 1 3 piezo composite rod. These transducer elements have a lower mechanical Q more surface area are more efficient and transmit more acoustic energy than a piezoceramic rod. A sub array could be made up of n m elements of these Tonpilz or Langevin type transducer elements.
