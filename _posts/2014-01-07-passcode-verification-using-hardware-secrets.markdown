title: Passcode verification using hardware secrets
abstract: A hardware secret is securely maintained in a computing device. The hardware secret is used to generate a hash of a passcode that is persistently stored for later use in verification. When a passcode is received as part of an authentication attempt, the hardware secret is used to generate a reference hash of the received passcode that is then compared with the persistently stored hash to determine whether there is a match.

This application incorporates by reference for all purposes the full disclosure of co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 149 710 filed concurrently herewith entitled HARDWARE SECRET USAGE LIMITS and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 149 721 filed concurrently herewith entitled DISTRIBUTED PASSCODE VERIFICATION SYSTEM .

The security of resources is of importance in many contexts. Unauthorized access to various types of data for example can have numerous adverse consequences such as unrealized revenue data loss a loss of customer goodwill damage to reputation and or even civil or criminal penalties. Likewise unauthorized access to property whether physical property or intellectual property can result in similar adverse consequences including the loss of the property itself. As a result many systems have developed over the years for controlling access to resources. An automated teller machine for example often requires simultaneous possession of a bank card and a personal identification number PIN . Various websites and other services provided over the Internet and other networks often require users to enter passwords before certain types of access are granted. Even access to real property often requires proof of possession of some type of credential e.g. PIN password and or possession of an access card before access is granted.

In many contexts it is difficult to find a balance between security and usability. In the case of passwords for example users often select passwords to be easy to remember. Typically this means that passwords contain some type of semantic meaning to their holders. Similarly PINs often are of a small number of digits e.g. 4 and also often picked to have some sort of semantic meaning. Therefore the size of a password space and or the number of passwords that users actually use is relatively small making certain types of security attacks e.g. automated password guessing more likely to succeed.

In the following description various embodiments will be described. For purposes of explanation specific configurations and details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments. However it will also be apparent to one skilled in the art that the embodiments may be practiced without the specific details. Furthermore well known features may be omitted or simplified in order not to obscure the embodiment being described.

Techniques described and suggested herein relate to the use of securely maintained secret information in various authentication methods. The methods may be used as a mechanism to control access to various resources such as data physical items real property currency and others. In an embodiment a passcode e.g. password hash value which may be referred to simply as a hash is calculated using a hardware secret that as discussed in more detail below may be information to which access outside of a module configured to perform calculations with the information is extraordinarily difficult or even effectively impossible. The calculated hash may be used to populate an entry in a database of passcode hashes that associates hashes of passcodes with corresponding identities. When a passcode of an identity e.g. user is provided for verification a reference hash generally reference value of the passcode may be calculated based at least in part on the passcode and the hardware secret. The calculated reference hash may be compared to a stored passcode hash in the database. If the calculated reference hash matches the stored passcode hash the received passcode may be considered to be verified and a system relying on such verification may operate accordingly.

The hardware secret as noted may be secret information that is securely maintained and used for calculating password hashes. The hardware secret may be configured such that the hardware secret has a value from a set of values that has a specified size. For example the size of the set may be configured such that the cardinality of the set is larger than the cardinality of a set of possible passcode values. Generally the size of the set may be selected to prevent cryptographic attacks. As an example the size of the set may be selected so that assumed amounts of processing resources which may be based at least in part on estimates of current or future capabilities collectively working to determine a passcode from a given hash of a passcode would probabilistically speaking be extremely unlikely to determine the passcode in a specified reasonable amount of time where the probability may be a specified value set at some acceptable threshold. As an illustrative example the size of the set may be such that all processing capacity on Earth if collectively working to determine a passcode from a hash value would have a probability of less than a 0.0000000001 of determining the passcode in one hundred years. Of course the particular example values given are for illustration and generally any size set may be used. In some embodiments for example the set of possible hardware secrets is chosen to have at least 2members. In this manner mere access to the information stored in a database of passcode hashes does not provide opportunity to determine passcodes from hashes thereby enabling unauthorized presentation of a passcode for the purpose of illegitimately gaining access to a resource. On the contrary such a cryptographic attack is infeasible even if parallelization techniques are utilized.

Various embodiments of the present disclosure also provide for additional security of passcodes. For example as implied above in embodiments where the size of the set of possible hardware secrets is sufficiently large cryptographic attacks are more likely to succeed by guessing the passcodes themselves since passcodes relatively speaking are from a much smaller space of possible values especially when considering that users often select passcodes with semantic meaning and generally passcodes that are easy to remember. To prevent such attacks even when an attacker has gained access to and control over the device having the hardware secret the device may be configured with particular performance characteristics that render such attacks infeasible. As one example a hardware secret may be used to ensure that a work factor e.g. amount of time or number of operations needed to determine guess a passcode is statistically large. For example the hash of a passcode may require iterative use of the hardware secret possibly for thousands or millions of operations. In this manner each guess at a password may require a number of operations and a corresponding amount of time . The work factor may be configured such that the computational work required to calculate a password hash is insignificant for authorized uses of a system e.g. a user providing a password to gain access to a resource but significant for unauthorized uses e.g. repeatedly guessing different passwords . For example calculations that take several milliseconds may be insignificant to a human user but may cause significant delay for cryptographic attacks requiring numerous password guesses.

As another example a device using a hardware secret to calculate passcode hashes may be configured to perform only a limited number of operations. In some embodiments the number is deterministically determined e.g. set in programming logic . A device may for instance be configured to perform self destructive actions after performing a programmed number of operations. The limit may be probabilistically determined in some embodiments. For example certain computing resources e.g. computer memory wears out and fails after a number of operations e.g. write operations where the number may not be consistent across devices. Algorithms for calculating passcode hashes may be configured to cause a device to statistically speaking wear out after a certain number of operations. The number of operations whether deterministically or probabilistically set may be configured such that the device is able to perform a specified sufficient number of operations e.g. a number of passcode verifications the device is expected to legitimately perform during its lifetime or during a specified amount of time . Cryptographic attacks involving password guessing however may require many more password verification attempts than the device is expected to legitimately perform in a lifetime. Accordingly the number of operations may also be set to cause a device to fail before a cryptographic attack involving password guessing has more than some specified probability of succeeding by guessing a correct passcode for a given hash.

Other mechanisms may also be used to prevent successful cryptographic attacks even with control over a device having a hardware secret used to calculate password hashes. For example processors may be deliberately configured and or selected to be relatively speaking slow. Slow processing capability may be insignificant to a human user but slower speeds correlate with attacks that proceed slower and therefore require more time on average before successfully determining a passcode from a hash. Other techniques and combinations of techniques may also be used.

Generally other variations are considered as being within the scope of the present disclosure. For example in some embodiments hardware secrets are used in one time passcode password OTP schemes. A security token may be a device or programming module configured to deterministically generate passcodes based at least in part on a seed value which may be referred to as a seed and a time which may be a time of passage since some reference time e.g. token creation or Unix time . At predefined times or otherwise for multiple times during a duration of time the token may generate a new passcode based at least in part on the seed and the time. A passcode provisioning system may be configured to likewise deterministically calculate the same codes e.g. a finite number of codes that the token will produce although in advance. The codes may be provided to an OTP verification system which may then use a hardware secret to calculate for the calculated codes passcode hashes. The passcode hashes may be stored in a database used to verify passcodes provided using the token. In this manner instead of the OTP verification system generating the codes itself for verification the seed may be securely kept from the OTP verification system thereby reducing the likelihood that the seed may be accessed without authorization and that as a result the token can be cloned. In other words the OTP verification system does not need the seed because it already has hash values of the codes it will need to verify. As a result a system employing the techniques of the present disclosure is more secure than systems employing many conventional techniques.

The user may communicate with the passcode verification system for any purpose involving the use of passcodes. A passcode may be information usable to access one or more resources. An example passcode is a password which comprises a string of one or more alphanumeric characters which may be chosen by a user perhaps in accordance with one or more rules regarding length complexity and the like. Another example passcode is a PIN. While passwords and PINs are used extensively throughout the present disclosure for the purpose of illustration the term passcode is intended to be interpreted broadly to cover other types of information usable to access a resource which may or may not be information that a user may know. Example information includes biometric information demographic information and or generally any information which may correspond to a user possibly uniquely. Example uses for passcodes include but are not limited to access control to data causing the performance of one or more operations and or generally access to any resource including physical resources such as money in embodiments where the passcode verification system is part of a money dispensing system such as an ATM.

As illustrated in in an embodiment the passcode verification system utilizes a hardware secret . A hardware secret may be secret information maintained by a device such that there is no legitimate way to access the hardware secret. For example the hardware secret may be encoded in hardware of a hardware device that employs various security measures. The hardware device for example may be tamper resistant tamper evident and or generally may employ mechanisms that prevent physical intrusion into the device to obtain the hardware secret. In other words the hardware secret may be maintained such so as to be obtainable without physical intrusion into a device that has access to the hardware secret if such physical intrusion is even possible. Further the hardware secret may be maintained such that there is no request mechanism e.g. application programming interface API for causing hardware storing the hardware secret to reveal the hardware secret. As an example a device storing the hardware secret e.g. cryptographic module may be configured to lack an ability to provide a copy of some or all of its memory such that the copy includes the hardware secret. It should be noted however that while hardware secrets for which there is no legitimate way of obtaining the hardware secret are used throughout the disclosure for the purpose of illustration some hardware secrets may be maintained such that the hardware secret is obtainable through a limited number of authorized uses which may require various security protocols to be employed and able to prevent unauthorized access to the hardware secret. Generally a hardware secret is information for which extraordinary measures must be taken to obtain the hardware secret if it is possible at all to obtain the hardware secret.

As illustrated in the environment includes a passcode database or generally persistent data storage for information based at least in part on passcodes. The passcode database may be a data storage system with which the passcode verification system communicates for the purpose of storing hash values of passcodes. The passcode database for example may store hash values of passcodes for multiple users in association with identifiers for the users thereby allowing for passcodes submitted by users to be verified. The passcode database may be implemented in various ways. For example the passcode database and passcode verification system may be different computer systems that communicate with one another over a network. In other embodiments the passcode database is a local storage devise of passcode verification system . Numerous variations are also considered as being within the scope of the present disclosure such as variations where the passcode verification system includes both a separate passcode database and a local cache of passcode hashes.

As illustrated in hashes in the passcode database are generated based at least in part on a passcode and the hardware secret . The passcode verification system may for example upon receipt of a new passcode from a user or generation of a new passcode for the user calculate a hash of the passcode based at least in part on the passcode and the hardware secret. The hash of the passcode may be computed in various ways in accordance with various embodiments. Generally the hash of the passcode may be calculated based at least in part on output of one or more one way functions. Example one way functions include but are not limited to secure hash functions such as MD5 as those classified as secure hash algorithm two SHA 2 such as SHA 224 SHA 256 SHA 384 and SHA 512. For example the hash of the passcodes may be or otherwise may be based at least in part on a keyed hashed message authentication code HMAC such as HMAC MD5 HMAC SHA 2 where HMAC SHA 2 denotes HMAC using a SHA 2 function . Other example password hashes include password based key derivation functions PBKDFs such as PBKDF2 and Bcrypt. It should be noted that the term one way is used in the practical sense and is not necessarily limited to functions within the strict mathematical definition of one way functions. Generally as used herein one way functions are functions satisfying one or more conditions on invertability. For example the one or more conditions may be that the probability of a random input generating a given output is within some bound specified as acceptable or generally is believed to be e.g. as a result of experimentation within some bound specified as acceptable. In some instances a function may be considered one way if there is no known formula or algorithm or for the calculating the inverse.

Other functions and values based at least in part on the output of the functions are considered as being within the scope of the present disclosure. Generally a hash of a passcode is intended to cover the output of any function that takes as input at least a passcode and another value e.g. hardware secret and provides output that is a transformation of the passcode to another value. Further the function may be configured to have an effect on the number of computations required to calculate the function. For example in some instances the function is configured as a composite function where computation of the function requires the output of one function to be used as the input to another function possibly iteratively. The number of iterations of a sub process involved in calculating the value of a function may be a tunable parameter. In this manner the amount of computational resources may be configured to avoid the speed at which brute force and other attacks are able to verify password guesses.

The passcode verification system may provide the passcode or information based thereupon to a cryptographic module of the passcode verification system that stores the hardware secret . The cryptographic module may be a system configured to securely store and perform operations using one or more hardware secrets. The cryptographic module may be a locally attached device of a computing device used to implement the verification system or a redundant node thereof or may be a device accessible to the verification system over a network. When implemented as a hardware device either locally attached or remotely accessible the cryptographic module may also be referred to as a cryptographic hardware module. Example cryptographic modules are discussed in more detail below. Upon receipt of the password or information based at least in part thereon the cryptographic module may calculate the hash based at least in part on the hardware secret and information provided from the passcode verification system. The cryptographic module may provide the calculated hash to the passcode verification system which may then transmit the hash to the passcode database for persistent storage.

As discussed in more detail below when the user provides a passcode such as to authenticate or otherwise access one or more services the user may provide the passcode to the passcode verification system over the network . Various secure protocols such as transport layer security TSL and or socket layer security SSL may be used to transfer the passcode from the user to the passcode verification system to avoid sending the passcode over the network in cleartext plaintext form. Further while the user providing a passcode is used throughout for the purpose of illustration the scope of the present disclosure is intended to cover additional embodiments where the information the user provides for authentication authentication information is the passcode or is otherwise based at least in part on the passcode. Example embodiments include those where a passcode input by a user is transformed before providing to a verification system and similarly before the verification system generates a hash for persistent storage. Further human operator users are depicted in the drawings for illustration passcodes may be provided by automated systems whether or not the passcodes were provided concurrently by the users themselves.

The passcode verification system may receive the passcode from the user decrypt if necessary and provide the passcode to a module having the hardware secret to cause the cryptographic module to calculate a hash of the passcode using the hardware secret . A result provided from the cryptographic module may be compared by the passcode verification system with a stored hash of the passcode in the passcode database . If the calculated hash value and the stored hash value match it may be considered that the user has successfully validated the passcode e.g. provided a correct passcode . One or more actions corresponding to successful validation may be performed such as by providing access to one or more resources.

As noted in an embodiment the system includes an interface and the interface may vary as the system varies in accordance with the various embodiments. In some examples the interface is a web interface and the user communicates with the interface over a network such as the internet. Communication with the web interface may occur for example via a web browser or other application. In some embodiments the user interacts with the system while in geographic proximity with the system . For example the system may be an ATM and the interface may be a combination of input devices e.g. keypad near screen buttons touchscreen card reader and the like and or display devices that enable the user to provide input to the system . Similarly the system may be a mobile device such as a tablet computing device and or cellular telephone smart phone having a touchscreen keyboard and or other input device usable by the user for providing input. Generally the interface may be any collection of computing resources which may include input devices display devices and or generally devices that are able to receive remotely and or locally generated data into the system for processing.

In an embodiment the interface enables communication with various components with system to provide the user access to a resource . The resource may be any resource by which correct presentation of a passcode is a prerequisite for access. Examples as noted above include money data physical items services real property and other resources. Other examples include functions on a computing device e.g. mobile device tablet device or personal computer . For instance a user may use an interface to enter a passcode to unlock a mobile device to access applications of the device operating system functions and the like. Until a passcode is entered the device may offer a more limited functionality. Of course the various embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited to the specific resources explicitly described herein but extend to other types of resources as well.

As noted above the user interacts with the interface for the purpose of accessing the resource . As illustrated by the lock symbol on the resource the resource may be protected by the system from unauthorized access through one or more access control mechanisms. In order to do this the interface may be configured to require that the user provide a passcode. The interface may receive the passcode from the user and provide the passcode to a passcode verification system . The passcode verification system may be a component of the system such as described above in connection with . The passcode verification system for example may be implemented as a separate computing device a programming module on a computing device a hardware module on a computing device and or on other ways. The passcode verification system may have access to a passcode database which may store hashes of passcodes. As discussed above in connection with the passcodes may be generated based at least in part on a hardware secret where the hardware secret may be maintained by the passcode verification system or by another entity with which the passcode verification system is able to communicate.

As noted above when the user presents a passcode through the interface the passcode verification system may generate or cause to have generated a hash of the passcode based at least in part on the passcode and a hardware secret and then compare the generated hash with a hash stored in the passcode database . If the generated hash and the stored hash match the user may be provided access to the resource . If however the generated hash and the stored hash do not match the user may be denied access to the resource at least until the user is able to provide a correct passcode or otherwise authenticate.

In an embodiment the process includes calculating a hash of the passcode. Calculating the hash of the passcode may be performed by inputting the passcode and a hardware secret and in some embodiments other information such as a salt into a hash or other function such as described above. Generally the hash of the passcode may be calculated in any way. Further while various embodiments of the present disclosure use hashes and hash function for the purpose of illustration other functions not necessarily commonly categorized as hash functions may be used. For example as noted generally any type of one way function may be used to generate a value based at least in part on the passcode and a hardware secret.

In an embodiment the process includes looking up a stored hash of the passcode. The stored hash of the passcode may be stored in memory of a computer system such as in volatile or nonvolatile memory of a data storage device locally attached to the system performing the process or remotely accessible to the system performing the process . Looking up the stored hash may also include querying a local or remote database. It should be noted that while illustrates calculating the hash of the passcode and looking the stored hash in a particular order as other operations described herein various embodiments of the present disclosure are not necessarily limited to the order in which the operations are illustrated. For example in some embodiments the stored hash may be looked up before the hash of the passcode is calculated or the look up and the calculation may be performed in parallel. Generally the order of operations discussed herein are not necessarily performed in the order illustrated unless explicitly stated otherwise or otherwise clear from context. Further while particular operations on specific data e.g. passcodes hardware secrets salts and the like are used for the purpose of illustration such operations may more generally be based in part on such data. The performance of additional operations not described explicitly herein is also considered as being within the scope of the present disclosure.

In an embodiment the process includes determining whether the calculated hash matches the stored hash. For example by determining whether the calculated hash and stored hash are equal or otherwise match. If it is determined that the calculated hash matches the stored hash the process may include enabling access to a resource. As noted above the resource may vary widely in accordance with various embodiments and enabling access may accordingly vary. For example enabling access may include the transmission of one or more signals e.g. messages that indicate to another component of a system e.g. server operating system automated mechanical device e.g. lock application and or other possible components to allow access. As an example enabling access to the resource may include transmitting one or more signals that enables an application on an ATM to allow a user to obtain money from the ATM when the process is performed as part of an access control mechanism for money stored in the ATM. As yet another example enabling access to the resource may include transmitting one or more signals that when received by an operating system process of a device cause the operating system to provide additional functionality. Other examples are also considered as being within the scope of the present disclosure.

Referring back to if it is determined that the calculated hash does not match the stored hash the process may include taking one or more actions corresponding to failed passcode verification. The one or more actions may include for example transmitting one or more signals causing access to the resource to be denied or simply not transmitting signals that if transmitted would enable access. Other operations such as providing a message indicating that the passcode is incorrect may also be performed. In addition various embodiments of the present disclosure may be used in conjunction with other access control mechanisms and the one or more actions corresponding to the failed passcode verification may also involve other access control mechanisms. For instance in some embodiments a limited number of failed passcode attempts are allowed before an adverse event occurs. The adverse event may include for example a lockout e.g. inability to try another passcode for a predetermined amount of time destruction of data e.g. by erasing and or generally some type of adverse consequence which either renders the resource inaccessible temporarily or permanently or which makes the resource more difficult to access by the user such as by requirements for additional authentication operations. In some embodiments accordingly the one or more actions corresponding to a failed passcode verification may include for instance updating a counter of failed passcode attempts. If the counter has already reached a threshold the one or more actions may include causing one or more adverse events to occur. Other actions considered as being within the scope of disclosure include but are not limited to recording a failed passcode attempt providing notification of a failed passcode attempt causing a delay before another passcode attempt is permitted and or other actions.

While shows an illustrative example of a process for verifying a passcode other processes are considered as being within the scope of the present disclosure. For example processes in accordance with the secure remote passcode protocol SRP and variations thereof are considered as being within the scope of the present disclosure. Generally various techniques described herein may be adapted to various ways of performing passcode verification.

In an embodiment the process includes providing the obtained passcode to a cryptographic module having a hardware secret where the hardware secret may be described as above. Providing the obtained passcode may be performed in various ways depending on the relationship between the cryptographic module and the system performing the process . For example if the cryptographic module is an internal hardware module of the system performing the process providing the passcode may be performed by making a local device level call to the cryptographic module. As another example if the cryptographic module is remotely accessible over a network to the system performing the process appropriately formatted network communications may be used to provide the passcode to the cryptographic module. In some embodiments the cryptographic module is operated by a cryptography service with a web service interface and providing the passcode may be performed via an appropriately configured web service API call. Other variations are also considered as being within the scope of the present disclosure.

A result may be obtained from the cryptographic module. The result may be one or more values generated by the cryptographic module based at least in part on the information provided to the cryptographic module and the hardware secret. A determination may be made whether there are enough iterations i.e. if enough iterations of an iteratively performed calculation involving the passcode and hardware secret have been performed . For example the cryptographic module may be configured to input information e.g. passcode or results from a previous result received from the cryptographic module from the system performing the process into a function which may itself be iterative within the cryptographic module such as described above. For a performance of the process each time the system performing the process provides information involving the obtained passcode to the cryptographic module for input with the hardware secret into the function may be considered an iteration for the purpose of the process although other definitions of iteration may be used. Whether enough iterations have been performed may be determined by comparing a count of iterations against a preprogrammed parameter corresponding to a number of iterations. The parameter may in some embodiments be configurable e.g. by a human operator having administrative or other access sufficient for setting the parameter. The number of iterations to be performed may be set based at least in part on physical capabilities of the cryptographic module and or the system performing the process . For example higher numbers may be set to cause the time to verify a password to exceed a specified minimum time thereby impeding the speed at which unauthorized attempts at password verification are able to be performed.

If it is determined that a sufficient number of iterations have been performed the result from the cryptographic module or information based at least upon the result from the cryptographic module may be provided . The manner in which the result is provided may vary in accordance with the various contexts in which the process is performed. For instance providing the result may involve internal device communications encoding the result network communications encoding the result and or other operations.

If however it is determined that an insufficient number of iterations have been performed then a result from the cryptographic module may be provided to the cryptographic module with the hardware secret. As noted the result may be used by the cryptographic module as input into a one way function in order to iterate the process and generate another value. This process of providing the cryptographic module a result obtained from the cryptographic module or information based at least upon a result received from the cryptographic module may be repeated until it is determined that a sufficient number of iterations have been performed. Once determined that there are enough iterations as noted above the result may be provided such as described above.

In this manner calculating a hash of a passcode may require numerous calls to a module with a hardware secret and generally may require numerous operations thereby making the calculation relatively slow. In this manner unauthorized attempts to guess the passcode may require computer resource usage which in the context of normal passcode verification operations such as when a user supplies a passcode to obtain access to a system is insignificant but for which cryptographic attacks which involve multiple guesses of the passcode is significant.

It should be noted that variations of the process are considered as being within the scope of the present disclosure. For example the process as illustrated is configured to require multiple calls to a cryptographic module in order to ultimately determine the hash of a passcode based at least in part on the passcode and a hardware secret. Other variations include those where the passcode is provided to the cryptographic module and the cryptographic module performs a specified number of iterations before providing a result back. Other variations including those where the cryptographic module performs several iterations to provide a result which is then provided back to the cryptographic module for more iterations are considered as being within the scope of the present disclosure. In addition while illustrates certain operations as with all processes described herein additional operations may also be performed. For instance as noted a result from a cryptographic module may be transformed e.g. through a one way function before being provided back to the cryptographic module. Generally the particular algorithm illustrated in is illustrative in nature and a large number of variations that employ the same principles are considered as being within the scope of the present disclosure.

Various embodiments of the present disclosure may also be used in connection within one time passcode passcode OTP verifications systems. accordingly shows an illustrative example of an environment in which various embodiments may be practiced. As illustrated in a user may interact with an interface in order to access a resource such as described above. As part of the interaction with the interface the user may provide a one time passcode which may be a passcode that is valid for only one session transaction period of time or otherwise. The user may have access to a security token that may be a hardware device hard token or programming module soft token on a computer system configured to generate at various time intervals a new one time passcode based at least in part on a seed which may be for example a random value input into a one time passcode generation algorithm. SecurID tokens produced by RSA Security LLC are illustrative examples of such tokens although embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited to such tokens.

The user may obtain a one time passcode provided to the interface for access to the resource . In order to control access to the resource interface it may communicate with a one time passcode OTP verification system which may operate to verify a passcode such as described above. In particular a passcode provided by the user through the interface may be provided to the OTP verification system . The OTP verification system may then obtain a hash of the received passcode and compare the calculated hash with a stored hash of the passcode to determine whether or not the passcode is valid. As illustrated in some embodiments the OTP verification system has access to a passcode database which stores a set of passcode hashes such as described above that correspond to passcodes that have been and or will be generated by the security token of the user .

For example the security token may generate one time passcodes in accordance with a deterministic algorithm. Information stored in the passcode database may include a hash of every passcode that will be generated by the security token over a period of time. For the user for example the passcode database may store a hash of specified number of passcodes that will be generated by the security token upon the security tokens initialization. As another example the passcode database may store a hash of each passcode that the security token will generate over a specified amount of time such as a month a year several years a predetermined life of the token or the like.

In order to store hashes of multiple passcodes that will be generated by a security token of the user the passcode database may receive the passcodes from a passcode provisioning system . The passcode provisioning system may be a system e.g. computing device or programming module operating on a computing device that is configured to deterministically generate the codes that the token will generate over a time period. For example the passcode provisioning system may have access to a seed shared by the token that is used by the token in generating passcodes and may use the seed to generate a set of passcodes that will be generated by the token over time. In an embodiment the passcode provisioning system generates the codes and provides the generated codes e.g. over a network or via a physical provisioning device such as a universal serial bus USB dongle to the OTP verification system . The OTP verification may receive the passcodes use a hardware secret such as described above to generate hash values of the passcodes and store the passcodes. The plaintext passcodes may then be deleted. In this manner as described in more detail below the OTP verification system is able to verify passcodes without the seed used by the token thereby reducing the chance that unauthorized access to the seed will occur thereby causing a security breach.

The passcodes may be encoded in various data structures such as lists Bloom filters tables that associate codes with timestamps and or otherwise. In some embodiments the passcode provisioning system provides the passcodes in the data structure and the OTP verification system modifies the values in the data structure using the hardware secret e.g. by calculating the hash values of the OTP codes in the provided data structure . In other embodiments the passcode provisioning system provides the passcodes e.g. in a list or table and the OTP verification system generates the data structure that it will use to verify passcodes. Other variations are considered as being within the scope of the present disclosure. For example the OTP verification system and passcode provisioning system may share the same hardware secret thereby enabling the passcode provisioning system to provide the passcode hashes to the OTP verification system without requiring the OTP verification system to calculate the hashes itself for populating the passcode database .

The OTP verification system may utilize whatever data structure the passcodes are encoded in to determine whether a passcode is valid. For example upon receipt of a passcode from the user e.g. pursuant to user input of the user or input from the token itself the OTP verification system may use it s hardware secret to calculate a hash of the received passcode and check whether the calculated hash matches a stored hash in the passcode database such as described above.

Because the passcode database may store multiple passcode hashes for a single identity e.g. the user which may be one of many users for whom sets of passcodes are stored in the passcode database the way in which passcodes are verified may vary among the various embodiments. For example in some embodiments a bloom filter may be used to make a determination whether a passcode is correct by using a calculated hash of a received passcode to determine whether the calculated hash appears in the passcode database . As another example a table may associate hashes of passcodes with corresponding time intervals each of which may be marked by a single time stamp. When a passcode is received for verification at a particular time the OTP verification system may check whether a calculated hash of the received passcode matches that which is stored for a corresponding time interval. As yet another example passcode hashes for a user stored in the passcode database may be enumerated. When a passcode is received for verification the OTP verification system may use the hardware secret to calculate a hash of the received passcode and query the passcode database to determine if the calculated hash is in the database . If found in addition to causing one or more operations to be performed corresponding to the passcode being verified hashes lower in the enumeration may be electronically marked e.g. stored in association with an indication of invalidity as invalid if not electronically marked as such already. In this manner passcodes that the token would have calculated in the past are no longer usable. Other variations and combinations of techniques are considered as being within the scope of the present disclosure.

A hardware secret may then be used to generate a first OTP code. Generating an OTP code may be performed in various ways in accordance with various embodiments. For example the hardware secret the seed and a time may be input into a function e.g. hash function whose algorithm for calculation which may be iterative is programmed into the system performing the process . Once the hardware secret has been used to generate the first OTP code the generated first OTP code may be stored . For example the generated OTP code may be stored in a file database or otherwise in volatile memory and or nonvolatile memory.

A determination may be made whether enough OTP codes have been generated where the number considered enough may be preprogrammed and or configurable. If determined that an insufficient number of OTP codes have been generated the process may include using the hardware secret to generate and store the next OTP code. The next OTP code in some embodiments is based at least in part on a previously generated OTP code e.g. the immediately preceding generated OTP code although in other embodiments each OTP code may be independently generated. Generation and storage of OTP codes may repeat until it is determined that a sufficient number of OTP codes have been generated. Once determined that a sufficient number of OTP codes have been generated the process may include generating a data structure encoding the stored OTP codes. The data structure may be configured in various ways in accordance with various embodiments such as described above. The data structure may be provided to one or more OTP verifications where if multiple OTP verifications each OTP verification system may be a member of a redundant fleet each with a different hardware secret. An OTP verification may reconfigure and use the provided passcodes such as described above.

The bus subsystem may provide a mechanism for enabling the various components and subsystems of device system to communicate with each other as intended. Although the bus subsystem is shown schematically as a single bus alternative embodiments of the bus subsystem may utilize multiple busses.

The network interface subsystem may provide an interface to other device systems and networks. The network interface subsystem may serve as an interface for receiving data from and transmitting data to other systems from the device system . For example the network interface subsystem may enable receipt of passcodes and provide information indicating whether received passcodes are authentic e.g. correct . For example a verification request may be provided to the device and the network interface may enable both the received and a response to be provided. The network interface subsystem may also facilitate the receipt and or transmission of data on other networks such as an organizations intranet and or other networks described below.

The user interface input devices may include one or more buttons a keyboard keypad pointing devices such as an integrated mouse trackball touchpad or graphics tablet a scanner a barcode scanner a fingerprint scanner a retinal scanner a touchscreen incorporated into a display audio input devices such as voice recognition systems microphones and other types of input devices. Further in some embodiments input devices may include devices usable to obtain information from other devices. Input devices may include for instance magnetic or other card readers one or more USB interfaces near field communications devices and other devices usable to obtain data from other devices. In general use of the term input device is intended to include all possible types of devices and mechanisms for inputting information to the device system .

User interface output devices if any may include a display subsystem a printer or non visual displays such as audio output devices etc. The display subsystem may be a cathode ray tube CRT a flat panel device such as a liquid crystal display LCD light emitting diode LED display or a projection or other display device. In general use of the term output device is intended to include all possible types of devices and mechanisms for outputting information from the device system . The output device s may be used for example to present user interfaces to facilitate user interaction with applications performing processes described herein and variations therein when such interaction may be appropriate. While a device with user interface output devices is used for the purpose of illustration it should be noted that the device may operate without an output device such as when the device is operated in a server rack and during typical operation an output device is not needed.

The storage subsystem may provide a computer readable storage medium for storing the basic programming and data constructs that may provide the functionality of at least one embodiment of the present disclosure. The applications programs code modules i.e. programming modules instructions that when executed by one or more processors may provide the functionality of one or more embodiments of the present disclosure may be stored in the storage subsystem . These application modules or instructions may be executed by the one or more processors . The storage subsystem may additionally provide a repository for storing data used in accordance with the present disclosure. The storage subsystem may comprise a memory subsystem and a file disk storage subsystem .

The cryptographic module which may be a trusted platform module includes a memory subsystem including a main random access memory RAM for storage of instructions and data during program execution and a read only memory ROM in which fixed cryptographic information may be stored such as a hardware secret. The device may also store keys in RAM and or processor registers for temporary cryptographic processing. The cryptographic information stored in memory may be used in combination with cryptographic information e.g. passcode and or information based at least in part thereon obtained via the network interface and or one or more of the user interface input devices . The one or more cryptographic processors may be used to perform cryptographic operations in the device and may include a random number generator SHA 2 or other hash generator and an encryption decryption signature engine. Generally one or more components of the cryptographic module may be configured to collectively perform various operations used in calculating hashes of passcodes such as described above.

As noted above in various embodiments of the present disclosure hardware secrets are securely stored within the cryptographic module . In some embodiments the cryptographic module is implemented as or may contain a physically unclonable function PUF which is a function implemented in physical hardware to use one or more hardware secrets that are based at least in part on physical characteristics of the PUF. As a result any attempt to obtain a hardware secret may require physical intrusion into the PUF and physical intrusion may alter the physical characteristics of the PUF thereby destroying the hardware secret. Example PUFs that may be used include PUFs using explicitly introduced randomness optical PUFs coating PUFs PUFs using intrinsic randomness delay PUFs static random access memory SRAM PUFs butterfly PUFs bistable ring PUFs magnetic PUFs metal resistance PUFs and or other devices whose physical characteristics encode information usable as or for a hardware secret.

In addition the cryptographic module may be configured to have certain speed and or degradation characteristics. For example the processing capabilities of the cryptographic module may be configured to be slow relative to other processing capabilities such as those available in commodity processing devices. In some embodiments for instance it may be desirable to limit the speed at which the device is able to calculate hashes since in authorized uses e.g. password verification slow processing e.g. a delay of milliseconds relative to other processors available may be insignificant to a typical authorized user who submits a password relatively infrequently e.g. once per session but very significant to an unauthorized user such as someone who has stolen the device and information in a passcode database and is using the device to try to determine passwords from stored hash values.

Degradation characteristics may be used to limit the number of operations that the device is physically able to perform. For instance writing to certain types of memory e.g. flash memory can cause the memory to become unusable over time. The probability that a portion memory will become unusable after a number of write operations may follow a probability distribution which may be determined through experimentation. Accordingly the device may be configured to perform a specified number of writes to memory for each passcode verification. Calculation of a hash of a passcode may be programmed to require writes to the memory. The specified number may be selected such that according to the probability distribution the probability of the memory becoming unusable exceeds some threshold e.g. 0.99 after a specified number of verifications e.g. the expected number of verifications to be requested over an expected lifetime of the device or a multiple thereof greater than one . Similarly the specified number of writes may be configured such that the probability of the device ceasing to function at some desired number of passcode verification remains within an acceptable bound e.g. 0.01 . In this manner the device can be configured to as a matter of probability function properly over some expected number of verifications and or time period when used in an authorized manner e.g. passcode verification using authorized channels yet cease to function when used in an unauthorized manner e.g. by attempting to determine a passcode from a hash of a passcode which probabilistically will require more verifications than the device is able to perform .

Other variations are also considered as being within the scope of the present disclosure. For example in the above illustrative examples stored passcode hashes are generated and verified symmetrically using the same hardware secret . In some embodiments however a persistently stored passcode hash may be generated using one secret and verified using another secret. In some examples for instance the hardware secret may be a private key of a public private key pair for an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm. A hash value may be calculated and persistently stored based at least in part on a public key of the public private key pair where the public key is not maintained as a hardware secret. Further while hash values are used throughout for the purpose of illustration other values that are not necessarily classified as hash values may be used. For example general output of one way functions may be used whether or not the functions are classified as hash functions. As another example output of invertible functions may be used. In some examples for instance a hardware secret may be used to generate an encrypted passcode or encrypted data based at least in part on the passcode . When a passcode is received the hardware secret may be encrypted to determine whether the encrypted passcode matches a stored encrypted passcode. Alternatively a stored encrypted passcode may be decrypted using the hardware secret to determine whether the decrypted passcode matches a received passcode.

The illustrative environment includes at least one application server and a data store . It should be understood that there can be several application servers layers or other elements processes or components which may be chained or otherwise configured which can interact to perform tasks such as obtaining data from an appropriate data store. Servers as used herein may be implemented in various ways such as hardware devices or virtual computer systems. In some contexts servers may refer to a programming module being executed on a computer system. As used herein the term data store refers to any device or combination of devices capable of storing accessing and retrieving data which may include any combination and number of data servers databases data storage devices and data storage media in any standard distributed or clustered environment. The application server can include any appropriate hardware and software for integrating with the data store as needed to execute aspects of one or more applications for the client device handling some even a majority of the data access and business logic for an application. The application server may provide access control services in cooperation with the data store and is able to generate content such as text graphics audio and or video to be transferred to the user which may be served to the user by the web server in the form of HyperText Markup Language HTML Extensible Markup Language XML or another appropriate structured language in this example. The handling of all requests and responses as well as the delivery of content between the client device and the application server can be handled by the web server. It should be understood that the web and application servers are not required and are merely example components as structured code discussed herein can be executed on any appropriate device or host machine as discussed elsewhere herein. Further operations described herein as being performed by a single device may unless otherwise clear from context be performed collectively by multiple devices which may form a distributed system.

The data store can include several separate data tables databases or other data storage mechanisms and media for storing data relating to a particular aspect of the present disclosure. For example the data store illustrated may include mechanisms for storing production data and user information which can be used to serve content for the production side. The data store also is shown to include a mechanism for storing log data which can be used for reporting analysis or other such purposes. It should be understood that there can be many other aspects that may need to be stored in the data store such as page image information and access rights information which can be stored in any of the above listed mechanisms as appropriate or in additional mechanisms in the data store . The data store is operable through logic associated therewith to receive instructions from the application server and obtain update or otherwise process data in response thereto. In one example a user through a device operated by the user might submit a search request for a certain type of item. In this case the data store might access the user information to verify the identity of the user and can access the catalog detail information to obtain information about items of that type. The information then can be returned to the user such as in a results listing on a web page that the user is able to view via a browser on the user device . Information for a particular item of interest can be viewed in a dedicated page or window of the browser. It should be noted however that embodiments of the present disclosure are not necessarily limited to the context of web pages but may be more generally applicable to processing requests in general where the requests are not necessarily requests for content.

Each server typically will include an operating system that provides executable program instructions for the general administration and operation of that server and typically will include a computer readable storage medium e.g. a hard disk random access memory read only memory etc. storing instructions that when executed by a processor of the server allow the server to perform its intended functions.
