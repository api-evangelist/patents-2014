The present invention is generally related to systems and methods of managing mobile assets in the field such as personnel equipment and inventory via communications with handheld data management devices e.g. personal digital assistants handheld computers two way pagers Web WAP enabled telephony etc. located in the field. More particularly the present invention is related to systems and methods in the management of mobile field assets via wireless handheld devices.

Limitations that have been experienced with the growth of services in many of the professions trades and industries can be attributed to the expansion of remote or distributed field activities such as situation location assessments estimates or appraisals. New technology and less experienced personnel may be undertaking the initial tasks of customer interaction sales data collection and or the analysis and troubleshooting of problems in the field. Personnel in field are usually required to collect data regarding a field situation that is generally be used later by more senior experienced and or responsible personnel to make decisions business technical administrative and or political . Even the most experienced professionals may find themselves lacking access to critical information or support that would be helpful in undertaking field operations. Efficiency in the remote dispatching of personnel given personnel vs. customer or field locations as well as asset and inventory control can also be improved.

As an example of a field situation individuals in the construction industry are often responsible for carrying out field assessments and providing estimates. The consequences of under bidding a project in the construction field can be very costly and or can affect performance and quality of services activities related to the underbid project. In cases where a project cost estimate or bid must be provided for a construction project a business owner or senior journeymen can oftentimes be compelled to personally go to the field and collect information regarding a project in order to render a realistic and profitable bid because an inexperienced estimator might render an inaccurate appraisal. Construction project estimates require an accurate assessment and analysis of a job site projects in order to develop the data facts necessary for an estimate to be rendered regarding use of labor materials and completion time for a project.

If an operator in the field was provided with guidance access to supplemental information and or years of experience e.g. lessons learned by senior personnel field operations might proceed more accurately and professionally. Field operators however are unlikely to have reasonable means to efficiently access the information or the information can not be updated. Materials typically used in the field can include reference materials such as codes regulations inventory and price lists.

Personal digital assistant PDA is a generic name used for a device belonging to a family of portable handheld data managing devices well known in the art. Another word used to refer to such devices is the word Smartphone. Currently handheld data management devices such as PDAs or Palm PCs can have as much computing power as desktop personal computers and can be used in a wide variety of applications including wireless communication infrared and radio frequency GPS global positioning system mapping Internet access and database storage. Web phones are also being introduced into the wireless marketplaces that have PDA like capabilities.

Handheld data management devices are generally enabled with wireless connectivity to data sources over for example the connection oriented Transmission Control Protocol Internet Protocol TCP IP or message oriented TME X protocol. Cellular Digital Packet Data CDPD is a TCP IP based technology that supports Point to Point Protocol PPP or Serial Line Internet Protocol SLIP wireless connections to mobile devices. Cellular service is generally available throughout the world from major service providers. With CDPD data can be transferred over switched Public Switched telephone Network PSTN circuits or packet switched networks. Global System for Mobile Communication GSM and Personal Communications Systems PCS networks operate in the 800 MHz 900 MHz and 1900 MHz range. PCS provides narrowband digital communications in the 900 MHz range for paging and broadband digital communications in the 1900 MHz band for cellular telephone service. In the U.S. as of the priority date for the present embodiments PCS is identical to GSM . GSM operates in the 900 MHz 1800 1900 MHz frequency bands. GSM is widely used throughout Europe and throughout many parts of the world. In the U.S. GSM is the same as PCS thus these two technologies are compatible.

The Code Division Multiple Access CDMA network is a digital wireless network that defines how a single channel can be segmented into multiple channels using a pseudo random signal or code to identify each user s information. Because CDMA spreads each call over more than 4.4 trillion channels across the entire frequency band it is more immune to interference than TDMA or other current wireless networks and can support more users per channel in some situations. Time Division Multiple Access TDMA cellular wireless systems are currently deployed throughout the wireless communication markets. Wideband CDMA W CDMA which is called CDMA 2000 in North America will be implemented in the U.S.A. in the near future. W CDMA is a true 3G wireless technology. W CDMA increases transfer rates by using multiple 1.25 MHz cellular channels compared to the single channel currently used by CDMA 1.

The General Packet Radio Service GPRS network is a 2.5G technology that bridges the gap between the current wireless technologies and the next generation of wireless technologies known as 3G wireless technologies. GPRS is a packet data transmission technology. GPRS will work with CDMA and TDMA and it supports X.25 and IP communications protocols. It will also enable features like Voice over IP VOIP and multimedia services. Bluetooth is a Personal Area Network PAN technology. Adopted by a consortium of wireless equipment manufacturers called the Bluetooth Special Interest Group BSIG it is emerging as a global standard for low cost wireless data and voice communication. The current specification for this standard is the 2.4 GHz ISM frequency band.

Bluetooth technology is based on a short range radio transmitter receiver built into small application specific circuits ASICs and embedded into support devices. Initially Bluetooth enabled devices will have 1 mw of transmitter power and will be capable of asymmetrical data transfers of up to 721 Mbps over distances of 10 M. The Bluetooth specification permits up to 100 mw of power which will increase the range to 100 M. In addition it can support up to three voice channels. Using short data packets and frequency hopping of up to 1600 hops per second it is a true 3G wireless technology that will enable a host of new applications and possibilities for wireless data communication. Wireless application protocol WAP and Extensible Markup Language XML are examples of current technology being used in wireless devices and system to provide Web based Internet content on wireless devices.

The foregoing has outlined some of the more pertinent features of the present invention. These features should be construed to be merely illustrative of some of the more prominent features and applications of the invention. Many other beneficial results can be attained by applying the disclosed invention in a different manner or modifying the invention as will be described. Accordingly other aspects and a fuller understanding of the invention can be had by referring to the following Detailed Description of the preferred embodiment.

The present invention now is described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout. This invention can however be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein rather these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art.

Aspects of the present invention are directed to assisting people in the field with operating in the field and for example rendering accurate assessments of a field situation job environment customer contact project etc. Reference to a particular field environment e.g. projects within the construction industry made throughout the description are provided for exemplary purposes only and should not be taken as a limitation of the present invention. The present invention provides portable handheld data management devices e.g. handheld or palm computer PC PDA smart phone mobile telephony devices with access to industry profession specific processes and applications that can enable users to be more productive while operating in the field.

A handheld data management device in accordance with the present invention can be in the form of any one of a number of commercially available hand held devices such as personal digital assistants PDAs two way pagers and Web WAP enabled mobile phones. Referring to a device exemplary of a prior art PDA that could implement software and or communication methods in accordance with carrying out methods of the invention is illustrated. The device includes an outer housing sufficiently small to be easily portable such that it substantially fit within the palm of a users hand a display that can also preferably include touch screen technology to operate in combination with control buttons to provide a User Interface UI for operating controlling and or otherwise interacting with the device . Not shown on the device but well known in the art to be incorporated in such devices are communication ports wired and wireless .

One of the preferred implementations of the invention is as a set of instructions in a code module resident in the RAM of the device. The set of instructions can however be stored in some other computer memory such as a hard disk drive of a personal computer PC or even downloaded from a server via the Internet until required by the device . As shown in the device can also include an integrated communication module to facilitate wired and wireless communication. Communication can be had with remote resources e.g. servers through network and to enable monitoring and feedback of field assessment operations. Wireless communication module can include digital communication technology and or wireless modem for facilitating local area communication. The module can also use cellular wireless technology such as Cellular Digital Packet Data CDPD . CDPD is a method of transmitting data in small packets of information over existing cellular phone networks. CDPD is a fully digital network overlay providing all the benefits of digital service including lower error rates and lower costs. Communications module provides wireless real time access to servers and personnel in support of assessments and can also provide more traditional information available over networks e.g. e mail chat Intranet and Internet information .

As shown in the device can also communicate with a PC through an infrared communications link to exchange and update information both ways. This feature makes it particularly easy to update and change personal schedules as needed. The device can include an integrated modem to provide data transfer functions and for remote connectivity. This feature allows a person such as a supervisor counselor or service representative remote from the user to provide tasks answers to queries notes and other information for use and display on the users device using standard telecommunications technology e.g. wired and wireless GSM CDMA CDPD and paging networks .

Referring to the handheld device can also be equipped within a position module to enable the handheld device to utilize positioning systems or methods known in the art such as satellite position e.g. Global Positioning System GPS or signal triangulation techniques. A GPS compatible system for example can be used to determine device location information and can also provide navigational assistance to users e.g. to find a field problem job when used in combination with navigation software or resources such as Internet mapping resources available from the World Wide Web. A navigation module can include positioning and navigational capabilities. Commercially available navigation technology will allow users to download a door to door route from any two locations in the U.S. The device can constantly update the user s current position and provide updated directions. This feature allows point to point navigational instructions to be provided to users in the field.

In accordance with the present invention a handheld device can be interactive with the field operator when programs operated by the microprocessor ask questions or provide guidance related to a particular field problem. An interactive question and answer session can also include the provision of checklists and relevant data in support of a user dialogue with the device. Interactivity can also be provided to remote resources when two way data communication is provided between the device and a remote server and or support representative. As mentioned above the present invention can be effectively practiced together with a client server programming environment. As is known by those skilled in this art client server is a model for a relationship between two computer programs in which one program the client makes a service request from another program the server which fulfills the request. Although the client server model can be used by programs within a single computer it is more commonly used in a network where computing functions and data can more efficiently be distributed among many client and server programs at different network locations.

With a client server relationship multiple client programs can share the services of a common server. Client programs and Server programs are often part of a larger program or application. Relative to the Internet a Web browser is a client program that requests services the sending of Web pages or files from a Web server which technically is called a Hypertext Transport Protocol or HTTP server in another computer somewhere on the Internet. Similarly a computer with TCP IP installed allows client requests for files from File Transfer Protocol FTP servers in other computers on the Internet.

Referring to an environment for extended operation communication between a handheld device client and remote management system e.g. server desktop PC is illustrated. At least one device can be remotely linked to a management system that can provide instructions e.g. templates task punch lists and or programs to a group of users. Instruction can be stored on a program locally on a user s personal digital assistant PDA . Job templates and or programs can also be centrally stored within one or more databases accessible to the management system or directly by the handheld device . Accordingly users can access a central template through a private or public computer network in a conventional manner via wireline or wireless communications. By maintaining a template in a central location such as a management system updates can be made to the template as procedures best practices and or laws are added amended or deleted. Accordingly users can be provided with up to date information on assessment activities.

A user operating in the field can utilize a handheld device for the assessment of a field problem. The user can execute an industry specific program e.g. field data management program on the handheld device related to the problem being addressed. The user interacts with the handheld executed program to obtain an initial field assessment. The program would prompt the user for input of data related to the problem. During program execution the user can access remote resources e.g. information data and expert assistance via wireless communication systems and networks . Information can be obtained from a server located at the user s enterprise or from other network resources available to the user e.g. Web pages provided obtained over the Internet . Real time analysis of data obtained can also be undertaken by remote processor e.g. server desktop PC . At completion of data processing by a handheld device remote processor a final output such as a report bid recommendation or the like can be provided to the user. The user can use the information to interact with a third party render a final output for the third party or to troubleshoot equipment. The remote processor e.g. can also be used as a collection point for data provided from multiple users e.g. . The data would then be analyzed by the remote processor and a comprehensive report can result and be provided to the remote user device location and data can also be provided via satellite . Location is determinable using for example GPS. A handheld device user can be provided with directions to a requested location based on the user s position either textually or through known mapping programs e.g. mapping programs available over the Internet .

It should be appreciated that data collected with the device can be processed without the assistance of remote resources and can be directly utilized to render output to the user via the device user interface printed using data rendering devices or can be stored in local memory for subsequent use e.g. synchronization with a desktop rendering remote computation compilation for use with input from other sources .

Data provided to remote systems can generally undergo computing operations beyond the resident capabilities of the handheld device. A limited software program can be used for gathering of data during a field assessment where after a larger software application and computing resources may be necessary to render a comprehensive analysis relating to the particular field problem. A smaller handheld executed program for example may only provide a device user with a more abbreviated list of questions needed to address a field problem. For example a larger computing capability can utilize data collected by several handheld devices deployed to assess field problems.

Methods of the present invention are now described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. Methods of the invention can however be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments e.g. method step sequences set forth herein rather these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. It will be understood after the teachings herein provided that each block of the flowchart illustrations and combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustrations can be implemented by computer program instructions. These computer program instructions can be provided to a processor of a handheld device e.g. PDA pager WAP phone Smartphone general purpose computer e.g. desktop special purpose computer e.g. server or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine such that the instructions which execute via the processor of the handheld device remote computer server or other programmable data processing apparatus create means for implementing the functions specified in the flowchart block or blocks. It is generally known that servers or desktop computers have more processing capability than handheld devices. Furthermore a server or desktop can be used as a centralized data collection and analysis facility for input received from more than one handheld device user and as the manager of assets in the field.

Referring to a flow chart related to a construction industry application will now be described. Again the construction industry application is only exemplary of one type of field operation that can be facilitated with the present invention and should not be taken as a limitation of the scope of the appended claims. A user can initially be directed to the prospective job site through GPS navigation means on the handheld device relevant to a particular field problem. Once at the job site the operator would start for example an appraisal program . The program can start by asking for the identification of a client or matter e.g. customer or job site . The program can next ask the representative to identify the problem or type of operation or assessment e.g. service call sales call HVAC plumbing electrical landscaping etc. . This should enable only the most relevant questions and or interaction to be invoked by the program. The program would then start asking the user specific questions or provide initial information related to the identified subject matter . The user would respond to program questions by providing specific answers data which would generally be provided in a format understandable by the program. It is assumed that operators users would have the requisite training to utilize field data management programs. Interaction however would preferably be kept to a level that is reasonably intuitive to any reasonably experienced computer and handheld device user. At completion of the series of questions the handheld device can automatically compile collected data provided by user. The data can then be analyzed by the handheld device or provide the data to a remote processor via a network where the data will be analyzed. Data can be provided to the remote resource within a template recognizable by the remote processor program. After the data is analyzed the handheld device can provide output to the operator which may have been received from the remote processor that can be in the form of an estimate or analysis and can be provided to the client or utilized by the operator to provide additional services.

In an industry specific application a field operator in the construction industry can be required to provide job cost estimates status reports and or complete a punch list of items. Programs for estimating a job and rendering bids can be more detailed and interactive than the mere provision of task punch lists. For example a job estimation program tailored for the heating and air conditioning industry can determine cooling load requirements based on data collected regarding a floor plan square footage duct work number of vents position of vents currently used equipment furnace air compressor valves coil tubing etc. condition of equipment and insulation. Load calculations can also be rendered on site based on available building plans where input to program questions is based on data written on a set of architectural plans. In the heating and air conditioning HVAC industry for example an inexperienced technician would greatly benefit from the provision of guidelines for troubleshooting HVAC equipment such as a series of questions related to identified failure symptoms or the identified problem. The handheld device can also provide a technician with an outline of known systematic procedures.

In the case where an inexperienced operator such as the inexperienced HVAC technician described above is unable to properly assess a field problem a transcript of the operator s interaction with the handheld e.g. questions and responses can be transmitted to remote resources for further analysis. The user can be provided at the handheld device with additional assessment guidelines e.g. another program suggestions advice or targeted questions not asked by the handheld device program from a remote processor or source. The operator can also be provided with for example a link to third party information relevant to the problem available on the Internet e.g. information from an equipment manufacturer s site regarding the equipment being assessed by the technician .

Referring to a detailed flow chart illustrating a more specific assessment relating to the HVAC industry is described. The flow chart is directed to information useful in obtaining data needed to render an estimate for a HVAC project. Once a program is opened on the handheld device the operator can be asked e.g. prompted to identify the job e.g. location customer name date type of job . The current date may already be available from the handheld device but in this case the projected start date can be provided for project scheduling conflict checking purposes. The operator can then select the type of program to be utilized e.g. HVAC sales estimating problem trouble shooting and efficiency determination . The operator can next be asked for the approximate size of the building being assessed generally based on heated cooled square footage for HVAC applications . A operator can then be asked to provide structural characteristics of the building e.g. glass type and location the direction a building faces for determining solar exposure ceiling height and ceiling type . Other categories not shown but which may be relevant to assessing a building are wall type insulation type rating duct work type insulation pre existing equipment type rating. Use of the building can also be determined by the operator e.g. how the building occupied and typical traffic patterns . The type of business if applicable can have an impact on the assessment regarding accessibility for equipment and commercial operation patterns. Finally location e.g. Dallas Fort Worth factor can have an impact on the market price for an estimate. It may make a difference whether a job is being performed in a particular part of town or what the immediate surroundings of the property are like.

Project location information can be provided by the hand held device automatically via a resident GPS module as described in and throughout the disclosure however location based marketing information e.g. street access landscaping that may be disturbed new construction issues can also impact the project and overall assessment. Payment information can also be obtained to complete information needed to render for example a job estimate. Compilation analysis and useful output aspects of the method are carried out and rendered after all data is collected by the operator. Other construction related fields that would benefit from a series of questions similar to the last example include remodeling plumbing inspections surveying landscaping windows sales and installation floor covering contractors etc. It should be appreciated that estimates can also be provided in non construction sales using the present method.

Referring to a flow chart of a method relating to project management is described. Oftentimes large projects in for example a manufacturing or design environment can have job aspects that are shared by members belonging to different work shifts. In accordance with the present invention a program managed by a central computer server can track every aspect of a project and provide worker with tasks via a template. A worker s handheld device or device assigned to the worker for the shift can be synchronized with a server to receive an updated template containing tasks for the worker at the beginning of every work shift. A project member beginning a workday at a job site or on a shared project would generally be expected to ascertain the status of the project and attempt to complete tasks embodied within a template. The projects tasks and template or program instructions are generally expected to be completed by the worker during and before the end of a shift. The worker reports on the status of tasks at the end of the workday via synchronization with a server through wired and or wireless means as described at the beginning of the disclosure. An updated template is created by the server for a subsequent worker based on the project s updated status needs and prior worker input. Unfinished business recorded by a prior worker and new tasks can be prepared within a template for provision to the subsequent device worker. The process is repeated for the duration of assigned projects and for subsequent new projects. It is an advantage of the present invention to provide for project tracking updated progress and focused task lists to projects members. Project efficiency would increase with the present method. Workers utilizing a synchronized project task list to carry out their daily input into a project can insure that tasks completed task are not repeated wasting time and that unfinished tasks are addressed by a subsequent project member possibly avoiding project delays and or damages e.g. monetary loss based on inefficiency .

Referring to a flow chart outlining a method relating to equipment readiness is described. An example relating to equipment readiness in the airline industry will be used but is not meant to be limiting. Airline pilots generally work through a manual checklist prior to the operation of aircraft. In accordance with the present invention a pilot can utilize a program executed on a handheld device to be guided through an equipment readiness checklist. The operator pilot selects the operational readiness program associated with the equipment being checked . The program provides the operator with step by step instructions for checking the status of the equipment . The checklist can be provided in the form of questions or statement e.g. provide X gauge reading . Upon completion of the checklist the user can run a report or synchronized with a remote server for use by the system or monitors describing the readiness pass fail of the equipment. The report can include recommendations e.g. troubleshooting criteria . Trouble shooting information together with a template of field test procedures can be provided to equipment technicians for repairing disorders. The report can be transmitted to a remote server for reporting analysis. For example the report which preferably contains quantitative readings can be synchronized with a black box located on an airplane. If there would ever be an issue as to whether equipment was properly checked out or if certain readings are indicative of causing equipment failures the recorded information of the checklist would be useful in analyzing such issues.

Referring to a flow chart outlining a method relating to inventory tracking ordering is described. Field technicians can utilize a handheld device to ensure that the proper inventory will be provided prior to embarking on a daily service schedule. The operator can start an inventory program identify a service schedule and synchronize the schedule with an inventory manager. The inventory manager assesses the schedule requirements and provides the technician with an inventory availability status . The technician can coordinate inventory needs with the company automatically using this method so that no more inventory than is needed is taken to the field.

Referring to a flow chart illustrating an assessment relating to criminal investigation is described. Once the program opened on the handheld device it can ask the operator to identify legal issues e.g. crime . The operator can then select the type of investigation being undertaken e.g. crime scene witness interviews forensics etc. . Instructions can be provided regarding the legal elements of a specific crime and exemplary evidence needed to prove the elements. The checklist and legal elements can be tailored to a particular legal jurisdiction. The investigator can complete instructions by entering data relating to the investigation . The checklist and or data can be stored at the handheld for future reference can be transmitted to a server for analysis verification and or synchronized with computer for use in furtherance of an investigation. The ability to manage data from several investigators on large scaled cases can be enhanced through the present invention wherein comprehensive data from different sources can be analyzed updated and reformatted for representation and distribution to plural case workers. Updated templates associated to a particular type of case can identify information shortfalls in a case.

Referring to a flow chart directed to multi user functions in accordance with the teaching of the present invention is provided. As an example to describe a multi user field assessment assume several field operators investigators are deployed to investigate and collect data over a broad area of land affected by an environmental catastrophe. Operators equipped with handheld devices are assigned deployed to specific positions of the affected environment. An operator can first be provided initial instruction from a remote server . Initial instructions can include summary information regarding the problem required equipment and Pinpoint directions to the assigned positions which can be provided to operators utilizing GPS. In cases where an operator may already be deployed the operator may only be provided with initial information instructions. At their respective positions remote operators are provided instruction from a portable device . Communication is established between device and remote resource comprising unique updated instructions for their respective assessment of the position e.g. data collection instructions . The template instructions can operate in combination with programs resident in the handheld computer or can be accompanied by a computer program transmitted from the server e.g. in the form of a JAVA applet .

During data collection the operator can gain support via communicates with remote resource e.g. server exert personnel . With a live expert communication can be via chat or voice. Procedural guidance can be provided through two way communication with remote representatives. After the data has been collected in accordance with the template programs the data can be transmitted to the resource wherein the data can be quickly and more accurately analyzed together with input from other personnel e.g. experts other field users . In the case where initial GPS information was not provided to or obtained from the operator GPS coordinates associated with the collected data can also be transmitted to the server with the collected data. The collected data and GPS coordinate associated with the collection of data would generally be the two most important attributes for the given scenario.

As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art the present invention can be embodied as methods data processing system or computer program product. Accordingly the present invention can take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment an entirely software embodiment or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects. Furthermore the present invention can take the form of a computer program product on a computer usable storage medium having computer usable program code means embodied in the medium. Any suitable computer readable medium can be utilized including hard disks CD ROMs optical storage devices or magnetic storage devices.

Computer program code for carrying out operations of the present invention can be written in an object oriented programming language such as Java Smalltalk or C . The computer program code for carrying out operations of the present invention however can also be written in conventional procedural programming languages such as the C programming language. The program code can be executed entirely on the user s computer as a standalone software package or it can execute partly on the user s computer and partly on a remote computer. In the latter scenario the remote computer can be connected to the user s computer through a LAN or a WAN or the connection can be made to an external computer for example through the Internet using an Internet Service Provider .
