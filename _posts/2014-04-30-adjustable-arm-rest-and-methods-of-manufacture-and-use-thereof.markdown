title: Adjustable arm rest and methods of manufacture and use thereof
abstract: Some embodiments are directed to an adjustable arm rest attachment mechanism that includes an outer bearing non-rotatably fixed to a seat and defining a first guide groove. An inner bearing is non-rotatably fixed to an arm rest, and defines a second guide groove. The inner bearing is rotatable relative to the outer bearing, and is disposed over the outer bearing. A pin extends through the second guide groove and into the first guide groove. The pin and the first and second guide grooves are configured such that, if the arm rest is rotated downward within an adjustment zone, then wall surfaces of the first guide groove selectively engage and disengage the pin, and simultaneously, wall surfaces of the second guide groove selectively engage and disengage the pin, thereby creating a varying frictional force capable of impeding further rotation of the arm rest.

The disclosed subject matter relates to adjustable arm rests and methods of manufacture and use thereof including but not limited to arm rests for use with seats. More particularly the disclosed subject matter relates to arm rests that are adjustable in terms of orientation relative to an occupant of the seat.

Some related art seats include arm rests that are movable between a deployed state that can support a user s arm and a stowed position that does not enable support of the user s arm. Some of these and other related art seats allow a user to manually adjust a lowest position of the arm rest in the deployed state which is referred to herein as the maximum deployment position or full down position. This adjustment of the maximum deployment position can be performed by a related art rotatable knob wherein rotation of the knob adjusts the maximum deployment position or alternatively by a related art tightening coil that provides one way locking or ratcheting of the arm rest.

However the related art adjustment mechanisms are subject to various disadvantages. For example some of the related art adjustment mechanisms include a relatively large number of separate parts are relatively complicated are relatively large in size are difficult to use are relatively ineffective and or are subject to other disadvantages. Some of the related art adjustment mechanisms are particularly disadvantageous based on their inclusion of springs and or other flexible parts which may be expensive to control during manufacturing.

It may therefore be beneficial to provide an adjustable arm rest and methods of manufacture and use thereof that address at least one of the above and or other disadvantages of the related art. In particular it may be beneficial to utilize static friction to impede or prevent reorientation of the arm rest and to thereby lock the arm rest at a desired position. For example it may be beneficial to perform such locking as the arm rest is being moved within an adjustment region which includes positions that enable support of the user s arm toward the full down position. It may also be beneficial to perform this locking by using parts including moving parts that are solid and or rigid which enhances ease of manufacture and control.

Some embodiments are directed to an adjustable arm rest attachment mechanism for use with a seat and an arm rest that is configured to support an arm of an occupant of the seat in a position within an adjustment zone. The seat can include a seat frame and the arm rest can include an arm rest support member. The adjustable arm rest attachment mechanism can include an outer bearing that is non rotatably fixed to the seat frame and that defines a first guide groove. An inner bearing can be non rotatably fixed to the arm rest support member and define a second guide groove. The inner bearing can be rotatable relative to the outer bearing and disposed over the outer bearing such that at least a portion of the second guide groove overlaps at least a portion of the first guide groove. A pin can extend through the second guide groove and into the first guide groove. The pin and the first and second guide grooves can be configured such that if the arm rest is rotated downward in the adjustment zone then wall surfaces of the first guide groove selectively engage and disengage the pin and simultaneously wall surfaces of the second guide groove selectively engage and disengage the pin thereby creating a varying frictional force capable of impeding further rotation of the arm rest.

Some other embodiments are directed to a seat for use with a vehicle and a seat occupant that includes a seat frame and an arm rest that is configured to support an arm of the seat occupant in a position within an adjustment zone. The arm rest includes an arm rest support member. The seat can also include an adjustable arm rest attachment mechanism. The adjustable arm rest attachment mechanism can include an outer bearing that is non rotatably fixed to the seat frame and that defines a first guide groove an inner bearing that is non rotatably fixed to the arm rest support member and that defines a second guide groove the inner bearing being rotatable relative to the outer bearing and being disposed over the outer bearing such that at least a portion of the second groove overlaps at least a portion of the first groove and a pin that extends through the second guide groove and into the first guide groove. The pin and the first and second guide grooves can be configured such that if the arm rest is rotated downward in the adjustment zone then wall surfaces of the first guide groove selectively engage and disengage the pin and wall surfaces of the second guide groove simultaneously and selectively engage and disengage the pin thereby creating a varying frictional force capable of impeding further rotation of the arm rest.

A few inventive aspects of the disclosed embodiments are explained in detail below with reference to the various figures. Exemplary embodiments are described to illustrate the disclosed subject matter not to limit its scope which is defined by the claims. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize a number of equivalent variations of the various features provided in the description that follows.

In the exemplary embodiment shown in the vehicle seat includes a seat back a seat bottom a head rest and at least one arm rest . Each of these elements can include various sub elements. For example the seat back can include a frame padding and a cover. The padding and the cover can be attached the frame to constitute the completed seat back shown in the exemplary embodiment of .

However embodiments are intended to include any type of seat and thus some other embodiments are directed to seats that include only one or any combination of these elements and or alternative elements. In fact some embodiments only include an arm rest such as an arm rest connected to a static object and disposed appropriately to support a user s arm in a deployed state while the user is in a seated position. Still further some embodiments include such an adjustable arm rest that is disposed to support a user s arm in a deployed state while the user is not in a seated position such as in the case of a user standing up lying down etc.

As explained in greater detail below the adjustable arm rest mechanism permits a seat occupant to adjust the orientation of the arm rest relative to certain elements of the seat and or the seat occupant and in particular enables adjustment of the arm rest within an adjustment region of a deployed state. As used in the present disclosure the adjustment region constitutes a region of the deployed state in which the arm rest is able to support the arm of a seat occupant. The adjustment region includes a full down position hereinafter FD which constitutes the lowermost position of the arm rest . The disclosed arm rest mechanism enables adjustment of the arm rest between the full down position FD and at least one other position within the adjustment region.

Some of these embodiments utilize static friction to impede or prevent further reorientation of the arm rest to thereby lock the arm rest upon being moved within the adjustment region toward the full down position FD. Still further some of these embodiments enable this adjustment via a relatively simple mechanism and or by utilizing a relatively small number of separate parts. In many of the disclosed embodiments the arm rest mechanism is manually adjustable such as by the seat occupant however other embodiments include or otherwise cover mechanisms that are partially or completely automated.

The arm rest can include a support member padding and a cover. The padding and the cover can be attached to the support member to provide the completed arm rest shown in the exemplary embodiment of . The support member can be pivotally connected to the frame member of the seat back by the arm rest mechanism .

In some embodiments the adjustable arm rest mechanism can permit the arm rest to pivot through a full range of angular motion extending between the full down position FD within the adjustment zone and a stowed position hereinafter S . In the stowed position S the arm rest does not enable support of the user s arm and instead is disposed relative to other elements of the seat to generally not impede typical movements of the user s arm while seated. In some of these embodiments the direction of elongation of the arm rest in the stowed position S is approximately or very generally perpendicular to various positions of the arm rest within the adjustment zone and thus extends generally parallel to a side surface of the seat back .

The arm rest mechanism can be configured to enable the arm rest to be infinitely variable between various positions within the adjustment zone. The arm rest can be rotatable such that the stowed position S is angularly spaced from the full down position FD by a range of motion or range angle hereinafter ROM . The range angle ROM can be set at any appropriate value in order to meet the performance desired for the particular arm rest .

Embodiments are intended to include or otherwise cover arm rests having a range of motion that includes any number of separately defined zones. In some embodiments the full range of motion includes the adjustment zone and an unrestricted zone. The adjustment zone constitutes multiple arm rest positions in which a seat occupant s arm can be supported by the arm rest and can extend from the full down position FD to an upper position hereinafter U . As discussed in detail below in the context of locking the arm rest the adjustment zone also includes a lower position hereinafter L that is between the upper position U and the full down position FD. The unrestricted zone can extend from the upper position U to a position at or adjacent the stowed position S.

In an exemplary embodiment the adjustable arm rest mechanism can permit the seat occupant to set the arm rest to stop or otherwise be locked at the full down position FD or at any continuously variable position between and including the upper position U and the lower position L as the arm rest moves toward the full down position. In other words in these embodiments the arm rest cannot be stopped or otherwise locked between the lower position L and the full down position FD as the arm rest moves toward the full down position FD and instead this stopping or locking is only provided between the upper position U and the lower position L as the arm rest moves toward the full down position FD. In addition the arm rest cannot be stopped or otherwise locked within the unrestricted zone.

Embodiments are intended to include or otherwise cover arm rests and arm rest mechanisms wherein the lower position L is disposed at any location between the upper position U and the full down position FD. In many embodiments the lower position L is closer to the full down position FD than the upper position U which is beneficial because it provides the user with a relatively large number of arm rest positions in which the arm rest can be locked in place. However the lower position L can be intermediate the full down position FD and the upper position U or even closer to the upper position U than the full down position FD. The lower position L can be spaced from the full down position FD by a first angle A and the upper position U can be spaced from the lower position L by a second angle A. The first angle A and the second angle A can be set at any appropriate value in order to meet the performance desired for the arm rest . In the exemplary embodiment of the first angle A is less than the second angle A to provide a relatively large number of positions in which the arm rest can be held in place.

The shaft and the second coupling structure can rotate relative to the first coupling structure if the arm rest pivots between the full down position FD and the stowed position S. As explained in detail below movement of the second coupling structure relative to the first coupling structure can displace the adjustment structure relative to both of the first and second coupling structures and this displacement permits the seat occupant to adjust the stopping position of the arm rest if the arm rest pivots among certain positions within the adjustment zone i.e. between the upper position U and the lower position L.

The first coupling structure can be characterized as an outer bearing that is rotationally constrained relative to an appropriate internal structure of the seat back e.g. the frame member . In the exemplary embodiment of the first coupling structure can be non movably fixed to or otherwise statically disposed relative to the frame member of the seat back . As shown in the first coupling structure can include a through hole a first guide structure an island structure and an annular rim .

The shaft is non rotatably connected to the arm rest such as at the support member and can include different integrally or unitarily formed elements or alternatively separately formed elements that are connected together. For example the shaft can include a first portion for disposition proximate the first coupling structure and which can include a consistent arcuate outer surface along its perimeter to thereby define a circular cross section. The shaft can also include a second portion adjacent the first portion for disposition proximate the second coupling structure and which defines an irregular outer surface. In the embodiment of the second portion is polygonal in cross section and in particular is hexagonal.

The through hole can be configured to receive the first portion of the shaft such that the shaft can rotate freely within the through hole . In some embodiments the through hole is configured to rotatably support the first portion of the shaft . In an alternate embodiment the shaft can be spaced apart from the inner surface of the through hole such that the first portion does not contact the inner surface of the through hole and can be rotatably supported by the frame member or other appropriate internal structure of the seat back . In fact embodiments are intended to include or otherwise cover any apparatus and method for attaching the shaft to the seat to enable rotation thereof.

The first guide structure can be formed as a groove in a recessed face of the first coupling structure such that the first guide structure is spaced inwardly from the annular rim . In the embodiment shown in a portion of the first guide structure extends across the recessed face between the annular rim and the through hole . The first guide structure can have a contoured shape of any geometry that can provide the performance desired for the arm rest . In the exemplary embodiment of the first guide structure can include a plurality of arcuate paths and linear paths.

The second coupling structure can be characterized as an inner bearing that is rotationally constrained relative to the appropriate internal structure of the arm rest e.g. the support member . The second coupling structure can include a through hole a recessed portion a second guide structure a recessed side wall and an outer surface . The recessed face of the first coupling structure can be configured to receive the second coupling structure so that the second coupling structure is slideable on or over the recessed face . The outer surface of the second coupling structure can be configured to mate or otherwise communicate with the inner wall of the annular rim of the first coupling structure thereby enabling the annular rim to guide the second coupling structure to slide in a rotational manner on or over the recessed face . In other words the recessed face and annular rim define a space that receives the second coupling structure to enable the second coupling structure to be rotatable relative to the first coupling structure .

The shaft can be non rotatably fixed to each of the second coupling structure and the support member of the arm rest in any appropriate manner. As a result the second coupling structure and the shaft can rotate about the axis of the shaft as the arm rest pivots such as between the full down position FD and the stowed position S. In an exemplary embodiment a through hole in the support member the through hole of the second coupling structure have a polygonal cross section that is complimentary to the polygonal cross section of the second portion of the shaft to achieve this non rotatable connection.

For simplicity and clarity only provides a partial view of the second portion of the shaft . However the second portion of the shaft can be dimensioned to extend through both 1 the entirety of the through hole of the second coupling structure and 2 the through hole of the support member of the arm rest . In fact shows the second portion of the shaft extending through the through hole of the support member of the arm rest . These elements through hole in the support member through hole of the second coupling structure and second portion of the shaft can be formed so as to define any irregular or polygonal cross section or shape such as but not limited to a hexagon pentagon rectangle triangle octagon parallelogram and any irregular polygon that achieves the non rotatable connection disclosed above.

Referring to the second guide structure can be a through hole formed in the recess of the second coupling structure . The second guide structure can have a contoured shape of any geometry that can provide the performance desired for the arm rest . In the exemplary embodiment of the second guide structure can include a first leg a second leg a first end a second end and a common end . The first leg can extend from the first end to the common end . The second leg can extend from the common end to the second end .

In the embodiment shown in the first and second legs form a substantially L shaped groove where the second leg is longer than the first leg. In this embodiment the first and second legs define an acute angle that is slightly less than 90 .

As shown in the adjustment structure can be in the form of a pin or cylindrical member that includes a friction member and a flange . Both the friction member and flange can define circular cross sections and the flange can be configured to be disposed within the recess of the second coupling structure . In fact the recess can be configured such as by a continuous arcuate side wall surface to guide the movement of the flange within the recess .

The friction member can be in the form of a cylindrical projection or pin that extends from the flange such as in a direction perpendicular to front and or back surfaces thereof. The friction member can have a diameter that is smaller than the diameter of the flange enabling it to extend through the second guide structure of the second coupling structure and into the first guide structure of the first coupling structure . The diameter of the friction member can be smaller than the minimum span of the second guide structure enabling the friction member to freely move throughout the second guide structure .

In the exemplary embodiment of the friction member is shown as being a cylindrical pin. However the friction member can have a contoured shape of any geometry that can provide the performance desired for the arm rest . In other words the friction member can have any configuration that enables it to extend into the second guide structure of the second coupling structure and into the first guide structure of the first coupling structure to provide the arm rest movement capabilities disclosed herein.

As explained below with reference to if the second coupling structure rotates relative to the first coupling structure then different portions of the wall surrounding the first guide structure can selectively engage and disengage surfaces of the friction member . Simultaneously different portions of the wall surrounding the second guide structure can selectively engage and disengage surfaces of the friction member . This selective engagement and disengagement of the friction member can vary the frictional force between the wall of the first guide structure and the friction member . If the frictional force is of a sufficient value then this frictional force can oppose further pivoting of the arm rest toward the full down position FD such as between the upper position U and the lower position L thereby impeding further rotation and in effect locking the arm rest in position.

As shown in the first guide structure can be configured as a contoured recess formed in the recessed face of the first coupling structure . The island structure can extend from the contoured recess and can be spaced from the perimeter wall of the contoured recess wherein the peripheral wall defines the boundary of the first guide structure.

The perimeter wall of the island structure can cooperate with the perimeter wall of the first guide structure to define a first path a second path a third path a fourth path and a bypass path . The first guide structure can include a first end and a second end .

The first path can extend from the first end to the second path along an arcuate path. The island structure can extend along at least a portion of the first path . The radius of curvature of the first path can be constant or variable. In the exemplary embodiment of the first path has a constant or substantially constant radius of curvature that is concentric with the annular rim . In an alternate embodiment the first path can have at least one constant radius portion and at least one variable radius portion. The friction member can be disposed on the first path if the arm rest is in the adjustment zone.

The second path can extend from the first path to the third path . The second path can include a substantially linear portion and an arcuate portion. The distance between the second path and the portion of the annular rim nearest the second path can increase as the second path extends toward the third path . The friction member can be disposed on the second path if the arm rest is in the unrestricted zone.

The third path can extend from the second path to the second end of the first coupling structure . The third path can include an arcuate portion configured with a variable radius of curvature. The friction member can be disposed on the third path if the arm rest is adjacent the stowed position S.

The fourth path can extend from an intermediate position of the second path to the first end . The fourth path can be substantially linear. The island structure can extend along at least a portion of the fourth path adjacent the first end of the first guide structure . The friction member can be disposed on the fourth path if the arm rest is in the unrestricted zone or if the arm rest is pivoting from the stowed position S to the full down position FD.

The bypass path can extend from a position of the second path that is adjacent to the first path to an intermediate position of the fourth path . The island structure can extend along at least a portion of the bypass path . The friction member can be disposed on the bypass path if the arm rest is pivoting in the unrestricted zone toward the full down position FD.

The second guide structure is disposed at a bottom left position of if the arm rest is in the adjustment zone. When the second guide structure is at the bottom left position of the first leg of the second guide structure extends on the first path and the second leg of the second guide structure extends on the second path .

The second guide structure is disposed at a middle position of if the arm rest is in the unrestricted zone. When the second guide structure is at a middle position of the first leg of the second guide structure lies beyond the first guide structure and the second leg of the second guide structure extends on the second path and the fourth path .

The second guide structure is disposed at a top right position of if the arm rest is in the stowed position. When the second guide structure is at the top right position of the first leg of the second guide structure lies beyond the first guide structure and the second leg of the second guide structure extends on the third path .

The first leg of the second guide structure can include an axis that extends through the centers of curvature of the first end and the common end . The second leg of the second guide structure can include an axis that extends through the centers of curvature of the second end and the common end . The first leg of the second guide structure can include a first length X measured on the first leg axis from center of curvature to center of curvature. The second leg of the second guide structure can include a second length Y measured on the second leg axis from center of curvature to center of curvature. The first leg axis can intersect the second leg axis at a third angle B. The lengths X Y and the third angle B can be configured to have any value that can provide the performance desired for the arm rest .

A fourth angle A can be defined between the first leg axis of the second guide structure and a line parallel to a tangent line of the perimeter wall of the first guide structure where the friction member engages the perimeter wall of the first guide structure if the arm rest is in the adjustment zone. The fourth angle A can have a value that permits the second guide structure to urge the friction member into engagement with 1 the perimeter wall of the first leg of the second guide structure and 2 the portion of the perimeter wall of the first guide structure that extends along the first path . The fourth angle A can be configured to cause a frictional force between the friction member and the perimeter wall of the first guide structure to resist motion of the arm rest toward the full down position FD if the arm rest is in the adjustment zone. In an exemplary embodiment the fourth angle A can include a value that is less than approximately 10 .

A fifth angle C can be defined between the second leg axis of the second guide structure and the perimeter wall of the first guide structure where the friction member engages the perimeter wall of the first guide structure if the arm rest moves into the adjustment zone from the unrestricted zone. The fifth angle C can have a value that permits the friction member to engage 1 the perimeter wall along the second leg of the second guide structure and 2 a portion of the perimeter wall of the first guide structure that extends along the fourth path . The fifth angle C can be configured to not interfere with the pivoting motion of the arm rest . In an exemplary embodiment the fifth angle C can have a value that is greater than approximately 45 .

A sixth angle D can be defined between the first leg axis of the second guide structure and the perimeter wall of the first guide structure where the friction member disengages the perimeter wall of the first guide structure if the arm rest moves in the unrestricted zone. The sixth angle D can be configured to permit the arm rest to pivot within the unrestricted zone without interference by the adjustable arm rest mechanism . In an exemplary embodiment the sixth angle D can have a value that is greater than approximately 40 .

A seventh angle E can be defined between the second leg axis of the second guide structure and a line parallel to a tangent line of the perimeter wall of the first guide structure where the friction member engages the perimeter wall of the first guide structure if the arm rest is in the stowed position. The seventh angle E can have a value that permits the friction member to engage 1 the perimeter wall along the second leg of the second guide structure and 2 a portion of the perimeter wall of the first guide structure that lies adjacent the second end of the first guide structure . The seventh angle E can be configured to cause a frictional force between the friction member and the perimeter wall of the first guide structure that can permit movement of the arm rest out of the stowed position S while simultaneously providing light resistance to provide the seat occupant with a tactile sensation that the arm rest is being released from the stowed position S. In an exemplary embodiment the seventh angle E can have a value that is greater than approximately 20 .

An eighth angle F can be defined between the second leg axis of the second guide structure and a line parallel to a tangent line of the perimeter wall of the first guide structure where the friction member engages the perimeter wall of the first guide structure if the arm rest is in the stowed position. The eighth angle F can have a value that permits the friction member to engage 1 the perimeter wall along the second leg of the second guide structure and 2 a portion of the perimeter wall of the first guide structure that lies adjacent the second end of the first guide structure . The eighth angle F can be configured to cause a frictional force between the friction member and the perimeter wall of the first guide structure which can secure the arm rest in the stowed position S. In an exemplary embodiment the eighth angle F can have a value that is greater than approximately 20 .

The operation of the arm rest is discussed below in the context of . Certain features of the second coupling structure have been omitted from for clarity.

The friction member can be spaced from the first end of the first guide structure when the arm rest is in the full down position FD. Also at this location a portion of the first leg and a portion of the common end of the second guide structure lie beyond the perimeter wall of the first guide structure . The common end of the second guide structure can provide a hard stop for the arm rest that can limit further motion of the arm rest .

As the arm rest pivots from the full down position FD toward the upper position U the second coupling structure rotates in the first direction R. This rotation can cause the second guide structure to engage the friction member from the left in the context of . As a result the second guide structure can displace the friction member in the second direction T See and out of engagement with the perimeter wall of the first guide structure thereby removing the frictional force between the friction member and the perimeter wall of the first guide structure . After further rotation in the first direction R the common end of the second guide structure is able to receive the friction member .

If the arm rest pivots towards the full down position FD while in the adjustment zone the second coupling structure can rotate in the fifth direction R. This rotation can cause friction member to exit the common end of the second guide structure . Rotation in the fifth direction R can cause the first leg of the second guide structure to engage the friction member at a second position P. Once engaged the first leg of the second guide structure can displace the friction member in the sixth direction T so that the friction member frictionally engages the perimeter wall of the first guide structure as depicted in solid lines. As a result the stop point of the arm rest in the adjustment zone is set.
