This application is a Continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 937 143 filed 19 May 2011 which is the National Phase filing of PCT Application No. IB2009 005217 filed 10 Apr. 2009 which claims priority of European Application No. EP 08290360.0 filed 11 Apr. 2008 the entireties of which applications are incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates to a plastic film which can be used as a dielectric film in capacitors. The invention also relates to the process of manufacturing such plastic film.

A capacitor generally consists of two conducting metal plates separated by an insulating media dielectric film capable of storing electrical energy. The capacitor is formed by sandwiching the dielectric film between the two conducting metal plates. The film serves as an insulant which prevents the electrons from moving from one capacitor plate to the opposite plate. The maximum energy that can be safely stored in a particular capacitor is limited by the maximum electric field that the dielectric can withstand before it breaks.

The energy which can be stored by the film is proportional to the dielectric constant of the film and to the electrical breakdown of the dielectric as shown by the following equation. Energy density 0.5 BDV 

The energy density of a capacitor containing a plastic film can be increased by increase of the relative permittivity. This is obtained by use of a polar polymeric material or by addition of a polar component such as polar polymers or additives such as ceramic particles in the polymeric film.

Capacitors in which a plastic film is used as the dielectric film with high relative permittivity are known in the art. For example EP A 0 039 214 describes capacitors in which the dielectric film comprises a vinylidene fluoride polymer polycarbonate and or a thermoplastic polyester.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 426 861 describes a plastic film having a high energy density. This film is made of a homogeneous mixture comprising at least one non polar homopolymer and at least one polar or non polar homopolymer. Examples of non polar homopolymers are polypropylene PP polyethylene naphthalate PEN polycarbonate PC and polyphenylene sulphide PPS . An example of a polar polymer is polyvinylidene fluoride PVDF . The homopolymers are blended and co extruded with homogenization to form a melt cast hybrid copolymer dielectric film. This document describes polymeric hybrid copolymers of PVDF and PP. It also describes a copolymer comprising PVDF and PP as one component and either PPS or PC or PET or PEN as a second component. The film disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6 426 861 is prepared from homogeneous solid solution mixtures.

The energy density of a capacitor containing a plastic film can be increased by increase of the breakdown voltage of the plastic film.

EP A 1 712 592 discloses a biaxially oriented film suitable as a film capacitor. This biaxially oriented film comprises a aromatic polyester a and a polyolefin b having a melting point of from 230 to 280 C. wherein the ratio of the polyolefin b is from 2 to 60 based on the entire weight of the film. The polyolefin is preferably a styrene polymer having a syndiotactic structure. It is preferred that the film does not have voids. The voids formed at the boundary between the aromatic polyester a forming the matrix phase and the polyolefin b forming the island phase. In case where voids are present the film tends to be cut in the film stretching step. Further as the film thickness is reduced the portions of the voids result in defects which deteriorate the mechanical characteristic or deteriorate the withstand voltage characteristic. The voids can be eliminated by using a compatibilizing agent.

In one embodiment the absolute value of the difference between the relative permittivity of each polymer composing the dispersed phase and the mean relative permittivity of the matrix phase is less than 2 preferably less than 1. The relative permittivity of a matrix phase comprising two or more polymers can be determined by the following formula. This formula defines a mean relative permittivity of the matrix phase 1 

The present invention relates to a stretched film obtained from a polymer mixture which is a dispersion of at least one polymer in a matrix of at least one different polymer. In the most preferred embodiment of the invention the polymer mixture is a dispersion of at least one first polyester and or polycarbonate in a matrix of at least one second polyester and or polycarbonate different from the first polyester and or polycarbonate. However the person of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize how to apply the invention to combinations of polymers other than polyesters and polycarbonates.

The polymer mixture is processed into a primary film which is then subjected to stretching. The resulting film is characterized by a high break down voltage a high energy density and a high service temperature.

The at least one dispersed polymer forms a first phase distinct from the matrix which forms a second phase. The at least one dispersed polymer forms nodules or islands in the polymer matrix. In the present invention the term nodule denotes a body having a substantially round shape and which is characterized by a specific dimension ratio. This dimension ratio is the ratio of the nodule largest dimension to the nodule smallest dimension. It is less than 2 preferably less than 1.5. The smallest and the largest dimensions of the nodules are determined through electronic microscopy by first cutting the primary film across its section not across its plane and then analyzing the picture of the resulting section.

Electron microscopy can be used to show the phase separation and the presence of nodules. represents an electron microscopy photography of a mixture comprising polycarbonate PC as a dispersed phase in a polyethylene naphthalate PEN matrix. represents an electron microscopy photography of an unstretched mixture comprising 20 polycarbonate PC as a dispersed phase in a matrix composed of PEN and PET.

In one preferred embodiment the phase separation is obtained by selecting polymers which are compatible with each other. Two polymers are said to be compatible when 

Compatibility between the polymers means that the dispersed phase adheres to the matrix phase. A high electrical breakdown voltage requires good adhesion between the dispersed phase and the matrix phase as well as no defects. Compatibility between the at least one polymer of the dispersed phase and the at least one polymer of the matrix phase results in a defect free interface. There is no debonding between the dispersed phase and the matrix phase. The interface can be defined as the boundary between the dispersed phase and the matrix phase. The interface width is typically from about 10 nm to 100 nm.

It is emphasized that because the polymers are compatible there is no need to add a compatibilizer to the mixture phase. It is not necessary to stabilize the interface between the dispersed phase and the matrix phase. The mixture which leads to the film of the invention is thus preferably devoid of any compatibilizer.

In one preferred embodiment the mixture comprises 15 to 45 polycarbonate PC as a dispersed phase in a matrix comprising 85 to 55 polyethylene naphthalate PEN.

for the dispersed phase at least two polymers selected from the group consisting of polyesters and polycarbonates

wherein the glass transition temperature of each of the polymers in the dispersion is in the range of Tgm 10 C. to Tgm 40 C. wherein Tgm is the glass transition temperature of the polyester in the matrix.

It is advantageous that the dispersed phase comprises polymers having a glass transition temperature in the range of Tgm 10 C. to Tgm 40 C. wherein Tgm is the glass transition temperature of the polyester in the matrix. This feature provides the following advantage the platelets in the stretched film exhibit an elliptic form which acts as brakes slowing down the electrons motion and so reduce their kinetic energy. A very good miscibility is in particular obtained when the dispersed phase comprises a mixture of a polycarbonate and a polyester and the polyester in the matrix is polyethylene terephthalate PET or a polybutylene terephthalate PBT . The preferred polyester in the dispersed phase is polyethylene terephthalate PET .

In one embodiment the mixture is composed of commercially available blends such as MAKROBLEND from Bayer XENOY from General Electric VANDAR from Ticona and SABRE from Dow and STAPRON E from DSM and ULTRABLEND from BASF. The present list is indicative and not exhaustive.

As a result of the good miscibility and the elliptic form of the platelets a high breakdown voltage is obtained.

In a preferred embodiment the mixture comprises a dispersed phase consisting of polycyclohexane dimethanol terephthalate PCT polymer or copolymer and the matrix consists of polyethylene terephthalate PET .

The mixture may also contain inorganic filler particles to improve the handling and winding of the resulting film. Preferably the mixture contains inorganic filler particles. Preferably the mixture contains filler particles in an amount up to 60000 parts per million ppm . In one preferred embodiment the stretched film contains up to 10000 parts per million of filler particles.

The inorganic filler particles may be without limitation calcium carbonate clays silica zeolites silicone beads functionalized polydimethyl siloxanes dicalcium phosphates DPC tricalcium phosphates TPC cenospheres zeeospheres talc titanium dioxides barium sulfate and barium titanate. Filler particle size distributions can be monomodal bimodal and trimodal. Preferably the mean particle diameter is comprised between 0.1 and 10 micrometers for a monomodal bimodal and trimodal distribution.

The different constituents of the mixture are mixed and the mixture is heated and stirred such as to enable the formation of a dispersed phase in the polymer matrix as explained hereafter. In the most preferred embodiment of the invention the polymer mixture is a dispersion of at least one first polyester and or polycarbonate in a matrix of at least one second polyester and or polycarbonate different from the first polyester and or polycarbonate.

It is important that the at least one polymer of the dispersed phase copolymerizes with the at least one different polymer of the matrix phase only at the interface between the matrix phase and the dispersed phase. The process conditions must be selected such as to achieve a blend of compatible polymers. In the preferred embodiment wherein the polymer mixture comprises at least one polyester and or polycarbonate dispersed in a matrix of at least one different polyester and or polycarbonate it is emphasized that the film is not obtained through process conditions which lead to copolymerization of the polyesters or polycarbonates. Therefore the process conditions such as temperature and mixing time are to be selected such as to minimize the degree of copolymerization either between polyesters or between polycarbonates or between a polyester and a carbonate. It is possible to achieve the following structures 

Compatibility between two polyesters is obtained by miscibility and ester ester exchange at the interface between the polyesters.

Compatibility between two polycarbonates is obtained by miscibility and carbonate carbonate exchange at the interface between the polycarbonates.

Compatibility between a polyester and a polycarbonate is obtained by miscibility and ester carbonate exchange at the interface between the polyester and a polycarbonate.

Compatibility between the dispersed phase and the matrix phase allows biaxial stretching especially at high loads of platelets.

The occurrence of a copolymerization reaction may be detected through Differential Scanning calorimetry DSC measurements.

The mixture initially contains at least two distinct polymers which are each characterized by a glass transition temperature. The presence of the at least two distinct polymers in the mixture can be confirmed through DSC measurements. Indeed the DSC technique detects as many distinct glass transition temperatures as the number of distinct polymers present in the mixture.

During the mixing and heating step the amount of each polymer in the mixture tends to decrease because of the occurrence of a copolymerization reaction between the polymers. If a copolymerization reaction occurs between the polymers then the distinct glass transition temperatures disappear and a unique glass transition occurs describing the formation of the copolymer. So assuming that copolymerization is completed then the mixture contains only one copolymer and the DSC measurements indicate only one glass transition temperature peak corresponding to the copolymer formed.

In order to avoid copolymerization between the polyesters it is desirable to set a short mixing time. The mixing time is typically from about 5 minutes to about 40 minutes.

As an example of suitable temperature conditions the mixture may be heated at a temperature T that is at least 5 C. greater than the highest melting point of each polymer composing the mixture for a time such that the mixture still exhibits separate transition temperatures.

The temperature and the mixing time are preferably selected such that the mixture still exhibits separate glass transition temperatures. In the preferred embodiment wherein the at least two distinct polymers are chosen from the group comprising polyesters and polycarbonates these process conditions lead to a blend of polyesters and or polycarbonates and not to a copolyester.

Melt viscosities of polymers composing the blends are preferably in a range of 50 Pa sec to 5000 Pa sec at a temperature Tm which is the highest melting temperature of the polymers in the mixture.

The polymer mixture is then extruded through an extruder and a melt system. A primary film is formed through a slit die and cooled down on a quenching drum.

The primary film is then processed into a film. The stretching step causes the dispersed phase to change shape. The shape of the polyester nodules or islands changes from an initially substantially round shape to an elliptic shape also called platelet like shape. The term platelet denotes a body having a substantially elliptic shape and which is characterized by a specific dimension ratio. This dimension ratio is the ratio of the platelets largest dimension to the platelets smallest dimension. It is at least 2 preferably at least 3 and most preferably at least 10. The smallest and largest dimensions are determined through electron microscopy by first cutting the film through its section not through its plane and then analyzing the picture of the resulting section. Preferably the largest dimension of the platelets is less than 10 microns preferably less than 5 microns more preferably less than 1 micron.

The platelet like shape of the dispersed phase forms a barrier to the electrons and the presence of a platelet like dispersed polymer phase prevents the electrons from crossing the width of the plastic film. The presence of the platelets also imparts a slower motion to the electrons. Platelets thus act as brakes slowing down the electrons motion and so reduce their kinetic energy. The electrons are forced to move around the platelets by repulsion forces created by the charges located at the interface of the dispersed platelets. The travel length of the electrons increases when the percentage of platelets increases as indicated in . Further the higher the ratio of the platelets largest dimensions to the platelets smallest dimension the higher the breakdown voltage. The present invention is based on the discovery that the breakdown voltage of a plastic film can be increased by slowing down the electron motion across the film through the presence of platelets in the film. The presence of platelets creates a tortuosity which increases the travel length of the electrons. Tortuosity can be defined as the ratio of the travel length of the electrons to the width of the plastic film.

In a preferred embodiment the morphology leading to a higher break down voltage can be achieved with a mixture of compatible polymers such as polyesters and or polycarbonates. The skilled person in the art can produce a similar morphology with a mixture of incompatible polymers by addition of compatibilizers.

The shape of the platelets can be varied according to the glass transition temperature of the polymer constituting the dispersed phase.

The film is preferably bi axially stretched. The primary film called cast film may be bi axially stretched in both directions transverse direction TD and machine direction MD by the mean of a sequential or simultaneous process.

According to a preferred embodiment the stretching ratio in each direction is in the range of 2 to 5 times preferably from 3 to 4.5 times.

When a simultaneous process is carried out the film is stretched at a temperature in the range of Tg 5 C. to Tg 30 C. where Tg corresponds to the highest glass transition temperature of the polymers constituting the mixture. The obtained thickness is typically in the range of 0.5 20 m preferably from 1.4 to 5 m. The stretching temperature can be adapted in the case of a sequential stretch by the person skilled in the art.

The film then undergoes a heat treatment which imparts dimensional stability to the film. The film is heated at a high temperature in the range of Tm 80 C. to Tm 10 C. preferably in the range of Tm 70 C. to Tm 20 C. where Tm is the highest melting temperature of the polymers in the mixture.

The film of the invention has a high service temperature. It can be used between 100 C. and 130 C. It thus finds use in high temperature and high energy storage applications like capacitor films in hybrid cars.

A polyethylene naphthalate PEN polymer of an intrinsic viscosity of 0.63 dl g measured in 50 dichloroethane DCE trifluoroacetic acid solution is extruded in a twin screw extruder. A cast film is obtained by forming the polymer in a slot die system and by cooling on quench drum. The cast film is subject to biaxial simultaneous stretching in laboratory stretcher commercially available from companies Brueckner or T.M Long or Inventure laboratory . In this technology the film is gripped by clips which are simultaneously or sequentially moving in the machine or transverse direction. The stretching is performed in a range of temperature between 145 and 155 C. at a stretching ratio of 3.5 by 3.5.

Both films of Examples 11 and 12 have shown to be particularly well suited for making power capacitors. Known power capacitors generally contain a dielectric film made of polypropylene PP . This type of capacitors cannot be operated at a temperature higher than 105 C. A capacitor comprising the film of Example 11 or Example 12 according to the invention can be operated at a temperature in the range of 105 C. to 125 C. It is thus more stable at high temperature than a capacitor comprising a PP dielectric film. A capacitor comprising the film of Example 11 or Example 12 can thus be used for replacing power capacitors comprising PP films.

A polymer mixture composed of 47.5 wt. of polybutylene terephthalate PBT and 52.5 wt. of an isophthalate copolyester is mixed in a twin screw extruder. The mixture is processed to achieve a copolymerization both in the melt system and in the extruder. The cast film is subject to stretching. The typical stretching temperature is in the range of 70 to 100 C. The cast film and the stretched film show a homogeneous structure. The break down voltage of a 4 micron thick film consisting of the above composition shows a break down voltage of 356 V micron and an energy density of 1.85 J cm. This comparative example clearly shows that a single copolyester shows a low breakdown voltage and a low energy density.

In contrast examples 2 12 which are according to the invention and which exhibit a phase dispersed in a matrix exhibit improved electrical properties.

Table I hereafter summarizes the typical properties of the stretched film prepared according to the above examples.

The films of examples 2 12 all in the thickness range of 4.5 to 8.5 m show more than one glass transition temperature and a structure comprising platelets. These films exhibit a break down voltage of at least 440 V m.

In contrast Comparative Examples 1 13 and 14 show a homogeneous structure and a single glass transition temperature. The films of comparative examples 1 13 and 14 exhibit a break down voltage of only 368 367 and 356 V m respectively thus lower than the breakdown voltages of examples 2 12.

The films of examples 2 12 exhibit an energy density of at least 2.6 J cmwhereas the films of comparative examples 1 13 and 14 exhibit an energy density of only 1.83 1.84 and 1.85 J cmrespectively a typical value for a polyester film.

These examples confirm that the film of the invention can withstand a higher breakdown voltage and has a higher energy density.
