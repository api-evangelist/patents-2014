Data Leak Prevention DLP seeks to detect potential leaks or data breaches. This is where sensitive data e.g. confidential data and or data having a business value is disclosed to unauthorized entities typically outside a company with data leaving the perimeter via a variety of possible ways such as for example through USB keys emailing uploading to an external website etc. For the purposes of description the term perimeter may refer to the external boundary of an organization. In a network context it may refer to where the internal network connects with the external network internet etc . It can also refer to delineation within an organization between divisions or where there are differing security postures.

There are three types of conventional DLP solutions typically available a network DLP that monitors the egress points at the perimeter to detect unauthorized data traversing defined boundaries b endpoint DLP that runs on an end user s device and monitors the end user behaviour and communications blocking attempts to move sensitive data via unauthorized means such as for example USB keys or via instant messaging and c storage based DLP solutions that deal with data residing on a server or device these storage based DLP solutions may for example mitigate against the risk of a person s computer e.g. laptop computer going missing and an unauthorized party being able to retrieve the sensitive data directly off of the storage e.g. hard drive of the computer. For the purposes of description the term defined boundaries may refer to the delineations that can exist within an organization between organizations or between an organization and the outside world. They are essentially enforcement points where the flow of traffic may be controlled due to differences in the sensitivity.

Although conventional enforcement and blocking mechanisms are relatively mature the mechanisms by which these solutions determine what is and what is not sensitive data are relatively immature and are typically based primarily on heuristics such as word scanning data types and pattern matching against a lexicon of sensitive terms or similar . Two specific examples are scanning for credit card numbers in an email or data that resembles patient records in a hospital. The drawbacks of this approach are that a this approach typically requires a human to determine the uniquely identifying characteristics of the data that must be prevented from being leaked and b this approach typically does not evolve or adapt over time without human intervention to update the filters heuristics or similar.

The present disclosure relates generally to the field of automatically learning and automatically adapting to perform classification of protected data. In various examples learning and adapting to perform classification of protected data may be implemented in the form of systems methods and or algorithms.

In one embodiment an automated method for data leak prevention is provided the method comprising obtaining automatically by a processor a plurality of training documents each of the training documents including at least respective content and respective metadata generating a classification model automatically by the processor wherein the classification model is generated based at least in part upon the content and metadata of each of the training documents obtaining automatically by the processor at least one non training document wherein the non training document includes at least respective content applying to the non training document automatically by the processor the classification model in order to classify the non training document into one of at least two categories monitoring automatically by the processor for attempted access to the non training document and taking action automatically by the processor when the monitoring determines the existence of the attempted access to the non training document wherein the action that is taken is based upon the category into which the non training document to which access is attempted has been classified and wherein the action that is taken comprises one of a denying access to the non training document to which access is attempted b logging the attempted access to the non training document to which access is attempted and c a combination thereof.

In another embodiment a computer readable storage medium tangibly embodying a program of instructions executable by the computer for automated data leak prevention is provided the program of instructions when executing performing the following steps obtaining automatically a plurality of training documents each of the training documents including at least respective content and respective metadata generating automatically a classification model wherein the classification model is generated based at least in part upon the content and metadata of each of the training documents obtaining automatically at least one non training document wherein the non training document includes at least respective content applying automatically to the non training document the classification model in order to classify the non training document into one of at least two categories monitoring automatically for attempted access to the non training document and taking action automatically when the monitoring determines the existence of the attempted access to the non training document wherein the action that is taken is based upon the category into which the non training document to which access is attempted has been classified and wherein the action that is taken comprises one of a denying access to the non training document to which access is attempted b logging the attempted access to the non training document to which access is attempted and c a combination thereof.

In another embodiment a computer implemented system for automatic data leak prevention is provided the system comprising a first obtaining element configured to obtain automatically a plurality of training documents each of the training documents including at least respective content and respective metadata a first generating element configured to generate automatically a classification model wherein the classification model is generated based at least in part upon the content and metadata of each of the training documents a second obtaining element configured to obtain automatically at least one non training document wherein the non training document includes at least respective content an applying element configured to apply automatically to the non training document the classification model in order to classify the non training document into one of at least two categories a monitoring element configured to monitor automatically for attempted access to the non training document and a taking action element configured to take action automatically when the monitoring determines the existence of the attempted access to the non training document wherein the action that is taken is based upon the category into which the non training document to which access is attempted has been classified and wherein the action that is taken comprises one of a denying access to the non training document to which access is attempted b logging the attempted access to the non training document to which access is attempted and c a combination thereof.

As described herein various embodiments relate to mechanisms that learn and adapt to automate classification of protected e.g. sensitive data. The disclosed mechanisms may interface with one or more document repositories such as SHAREPOINT or DOCUMENTUM within an organization s environment such as SHAREPOINT or DOCUMENTUM and dynamically build classification models based on the data in these structured filestores. The disclosed mechanisms may then allow administrators to apply sophisticated enforcement policies based on these models and to deploy these policies to the various end point and perimeter DLP devices. For the purposes of description the term end point refers to a device with which end users interact and which sits at the edges of a network for example it could be a laptop a mobile phone or a PC .

In one example the disclosed mechanisms learn what is important to an organization e.g. what constitutes sensitive data and the classification evolves over time based on how the data in the document management system evolves.

In another example the disclosed mechanisms do not necessarily require all data to be in the document management system but rather just a sample sufficiently large to enable the mechanisms to train themselves that is in order to generate a set of models it is necessary to have a training set of data that the model generation algorithms are applied to if the dataset is too small then it will result in overfitting wherein a model is derived that fits the training set perfectly but the training set isn t genuinely representative of reality .

Referring now to an example implementation of system according to an embodiment is shown. As seen in this system includes document management system . In one example this document management system may be a conventional document management system such as DOCUMENTUM or SHAREPOINT. The document management system is used to store documentation manage documentation lifecycle enforce policy and control access. As part of the document metadata a given document s classification in accordance with a data classification policy is stored. For example if a document is Highly Restricted the document will be marked as such in the document management system. In one specific example in order for system to be effective it is not necessary that the associated organization stores all of their data in the document management system but that a sizeable portion of its critical data is stored here e.g. what this essentially means is that there must be a representative sample of data in the repository and that this data is indicative of data found elsewhere .

With reference now to the crawler component it is noted that this crawler may operate by crawling that is accessing the document management system for content in one specific example the crawler may access the document management system via an application programming interface API if such is available . The crawler may regularly poll the document management system for new documents. The identified documents that have been crawled are passed to the classification engine as described below.

The classification engine is passed from the crawler each document and each document s associated metadata that exist in the document management system. One important element amongst this metadata is the security or data classification of the document. The classification engine uses this data to build a classification model for documents similar to a Bayesian filter or the like . In this regard the classification engine identifies the content and metadata attributes that are strong determinants of security classification and builds a model this model is then published to the policy engine as described below . For example if a document contains the words SEISMOLOGY and AFRICA and is in the file format of a geographic information system GIS and was authored by someone from the Exploration Team in a Mining company then the document has a 90 probability of have a classification of Highly Sensitive .

Still referring to it is seen that the policy engine is populated with these models that have been derived by the classification engine. In one specific example an administrator may then assign policies to these models. For example the administrator may assign a policy that the above example data classification seismology reports from Africa etc should be blocked from leaving the company except by people from the Exploration Team but an attempted access event should be logged .

In addition there are various DLP agents deployed throughout the organization on various platforms in various examples DLP agents may be software applications that are installed either onto an endpoint such as a laptop desktop mobile device or other or an appliance in the former case they will enforce policy at the end point whereas in the latter case they will typically enforce traffic at a network level . For example there may be an email DLP component such as an email scanning agent that may comprise an appliance or an agent installed into an existing email server in another example an email scanning agent could be a simple mail transfer protocol SMTP server itself . This email DLP component will have policies pushed to it by the policy engine and will apply these policies to all traffic passing through it. Likewise the other DLP components shown as end user device DLP component web DLP component and Network DLP component may likewise comprise a respective appliance or an agent and may likewise have policies deployed automatically to them that they will then apply. In each case a respective policy may dictate how a breach is handled. For example breaches with a higher confidence level may be actively blocked whereas breaches below a certain threshold may simply have the potential breach logged and an alert raised with the security team for example when an event occurs it is matched against the classification model s and a confidence level if derived mathematically the confidence level denotes the probability that a given event matches the model .

Referring now to an example training process such as may be used in connection with the classification engine and other elements of will be described 1 There exists a document repository which is called the document corpus in this example in one specific example this could be a MICROSOFT SHAREPOINT or other platform . The document corpus is randomly partitioned such that e.g. 10 of the data is set aside for testing and the remainder for training or some other split as determined by the user 2 Data from this document corpus is used for two processes feature extraction and classification label extraction . The classification label is the security classification of each document as listed in the document corpus . This is typically set by a human when they are creating editing the document and may be stored in metadata associated with the said document. Every organization will typically be different based on their own standards but common classifications may be for example PUBLIC SENSITIVE PRIVATE and CONFIDENTIAL. In more simpler systems it may just be PUBLIC and PRIVATE 3 Feature extraction converts the input document into a feature set where pairs of features and classifications are later fed into a classification process. Examples of features may be each word metadata such as business unit author name data type location where it was created etc. Stemming may occur where words are reduced to their stems such as GETTING becomes GET CARS becomes CAR etc 4 The Build Classifier process takes pairs of features and labels and generates a model. There are several algorithms that can be used to build a classifer such as for example a Decision Tree C4.5 C5.0 etc. are common implementations of this technique . 5 The result is a Classification Model that essentially provides rule s that can be used to determine the label that a given data set belongs to. For example in the case of a decision tree it may include rules such as IF DOCUMENT CONTAINS WORD SEISMOLOGY and DATA TYPE IS WORD DOCUMENT and AUTHOR BUSINESS UNIT is MINERAL EXPLORATION then label is HIGHLY SENSITIVE . Each rule model will also have a confidence and support value associated with it. The confidence is the likelihood of the predicted outcome label given the rule model has been satisfied and the support is the number of records in the training set that resulted in this rule model.

Next the classifier may be tested. In this example the test process may be as follows 1 Once the classifier is built the subset of the data that was set aside runs through the classifier and each resulting label is compared with the actual label as sourced from the document management system 2 This is used to validate the accuracy of the classifier 3 An administrator may make adjustments to the features that were selected in the previous phase. They may also apply weightings and or make other modifications to improve the accuracy of the classification model such as manually adding rules models to generated rules models to further enhance it them.

Next usage of rule s model s for data leak prevention may be implemented as follows 1 Once the classification models have been derived they are converted into policies and deployed into various DLP components for enforcement. An administrator may associate each rule model with an action. The action might be to BLOCK ALERT or some other action depending on the confidence level of the rule model associated with the action.

Referring now to an automated method for data leak prevention is shown. As seen in the method of this embodiment comprises at obtaining automatically by a processor a plurality of training documents each of the training documents including at least respective content and respective metadata at generating a classification model automatically by the processor wherein the classification model is generated based at least in part upon the content and metadata of each of the training documents at obtaining automatically by the processor at least one non training document wherein the non training document includes at least respective content at applying to the non training document automatically by the processor the classification model in order to classify the non training document into one of at least two categories at monitoring automatically by the processor for attempted access to the non training document and at taking action automatically by the processor when the monitoring determines the existence of the attempted access to the non training document wherein the action that is taken is based upon the category into which the non training document to which access is attempted has been classified and wherein the action that is taken comprises one of a denying access to the non training document to which access is attempted b logging the attempted access to the non training document to which access is attempted and c a combination thereof.

In one specific example possible categories could be 1 in a simple embodiment the categories would be BLOCK and ALLOW two categories where BLOCK would mean that the device does not allow the traffic data to pass through and ALLOW would mean that the device does allow the traffic data to pass through 2 in more complex embodiments the categories may be aligned with a security classification used within the organization such as for example CONFIDENTIAL PRIVATE SENSITIVE and PUBLIC and there may be different rules behaviors or models associated with each category such as for example that PUBLIC is allowed to flow through SENSITIVE is allowed to flow through but is logged PRIVATE is allowed to flow through if the sending entity is on a white list and CONFIDENTIAL is blocked.

In one specific example the enforcement policy is enforced on at least one of a an email component b an end user device component c a web component d a network component and e a combination thereof.

In another specific example the end user device component comprises at least one of a a desktop computer b a laptop computer c a tablet d a smartphone and e a combination thereof.

In another specific example the web component comprises a proxy that sits between the internet and the internal network. All traffic in out passes through this proxy. For example a user may access a website and upload a file. The file will pass through this proxy and the rules models applied. If the file content is classified with a level that requires action the proxy will act to block the upload.

In another specific example the network component comprises an IPS firewall or other network device that inspects traffic flowing in out. There are some specific network DLP platforms that fall into this category too.

In one specific example the method may further comprise configuring software e.g. a software agent to prevent communication of the non training document from a user device based on the category into which the non training document is classified. In another example any steps may be carried out in the order recited or the steps may be carried out in another order.
