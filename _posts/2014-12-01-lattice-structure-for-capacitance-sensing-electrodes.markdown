This disclosure relates to the field of touch sensors and in particular to trace patterns of elements in capacitive touch sensor arrays.

Computing devices such as notebook computers personal data assistants PDAs kiosks and mobile handsets have user interface devices which are also known as human interface devices HID . One user interface device that has become more common is a touch sensor pad also commonly referred to as a touchpad . A basic notebook computer touch sensor pad emulates the function of a personal computer PC mouse. A touch sensor pad is typically embedded into a PC notebook for built in portability. A touch sensor pad replicates mouse X Y movement by using two defined axes which contain a collection of sensor elements that detect the position of one or more conductive objects such as a finger. Mouse right left button clicks can be replicated by two mechanical buttons located in the vicinity of the touchpad or by tapping commands on the touch sensor pad itself. The touch sensor pad provides a user interface device for performing such functions as positioning a pointer or selecting an item on a display. These touch sensor pads may include multi dimensional sensor arrays for detecting movement in multiple axes. The sensor array may include a one dimensional sensor array detecting movement in one axis. The sensor array may also be two dimensional detecting movements in two axes.

Another user interface device that has become more common is a touch screen. Touch screens also known as touchscreens touch windows touch panels or touchscreen panels are transparent display overlays which are typically either pressure sensitive resistive or piezoelectric electrically sensitive capacitive acoustically sensitive surface acoustic wave SAW or photo sensitive infra red . The effect of such overlays allows a display to be used as an input device removing the keyboard and or the mouse as the primary input device for interacting with the display s content. Such displays can be attached to computers or as terminals to networks. Touch screens have become familiar in retail settings on point of sale systems on ATMs on mobile handsets on kiosks on game consoles and on PDAs where a stylus is sometimes used to manipulate the graphical user interface GUI and to enter data. A user can touch a touch screen or a touch sensor pad to manipulate data. For example a user can apply a single touch by using a finger to touch the surface of a touch screen to select an item from a menu.

The following description sets forth numerous specific details such as examples of specific systems components methods and so forth in order to provide a good understanding of several embodiments of the present invention. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art however that at least some embodiments of the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known components or methods are not described in detail or are presented in a simple block diagram format in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention. Thus the specific details set forth are merely exemplary. Particular implementations may vary from these exemplary details and still be contemplated to be within the spirit and scope of the present invention.

An embodiment of a capacitive sensor array may include sensor elements arranged such that each unit cell corresponding to an intersection between sensor elements may include a main trace and one or more primary subtraces branching away from the main trace. In one embodiment a sensor element may also include one or more secondary subtraces branching from a primary subtrace or one or more tertiary subtraces branching from a secondary subtrace. In one embodiment a sensor array having such a pattern may have decreased signal disparity and reduced manufacturability problems as compared to other patterns such as a diamond pattern. Specifically a capacitive sensor array with sensor elements having main traces and subtraces branching from the main trace such as a totem pole pattern may be manufactured with decreased cost and increased yield rate as well as improved optical quality.

An embodiment of such a capacitive sensor array may include a first and a second plurality of sensor elements each intersecting each of the first plurality of sensor elements. Each intersection between one of the first plurality of sensor elements and one of the second plurality of sensor elements may be associated with a corresponding unit cell. In one embodiment a unit cell corresponding to an intersection may be understood as an area including all locations on the surface of the sensor array that are nearer to the corresponding intersection than to any other intersection between sensor elements.

In one embodiment of a capacitive sensor array each of the second plurality of sensor elements includes a main trace that crosses at least one of the plurality of unit cells and further includes within each unit cell a primary subtrace that branches away from the main trace. In one embodiment the primary subtrace may be one of two or more primary subtraces branching symmetrically from opposite sides of the main trace resembling a totem pole . Alternatively the primary subtraces may branch asymmetrically from the main trace.

In one embodiment the sensor array includes sensor elements N where N is a positive integer that are disposed as a two dimensional matrix also referred to as an XY matrix . The sensor array is coupled to pins N of the processing device via one or more analog buses transporting multiple signals. In this embodiment each sensor element N is represented as a capacitor.

In one embodiment the capacitance sensor may include a relaxation oscillator or other means to convert a capacitance into a measured value. The capacitance sensor may also include a counter or timer to measure the oscillator output. The capacitance sensor may further include software components to convert the count value e.g. capacitance value into a sensor element detection decision also referred to as switch detection decision or relative magnitude. It should be noted that there are various known methods for measuring capacitance such as current versus voltage phase shift measurement resistor capacitor charge timing capacitive bridge divider charge transfer successive approximation sigma delta modulators charge accumulation circuits field effect mutual capacitance frequency shift or other capacitance measurement algorithms. It should be noted however instead of evaluating the raw counts relative to a threshold the capacitance sensor may be evaluating other measurements to determine the user interaction. For example in the capacitance sensor having a sigma delta modulator the capacitance sensor is evaluating the ratio of pulse widths of the output instead of the raw counts being over or under a certain threshold.

In one embodiment the processing device further includes processing logic . Operations of the processing logic may be implemented in firmware alternatively it may be implemented in hardware or software. The processing logic may receive signals from the capacitance sensor and determine the state of the sensor array such as whether an object e.g. a finger is detected on or in proximity to the sensor array e.g. determining the presence of the object where the object is detected on the sensor array e.g. determining the location of the object tracking the motion of the object or other information related to an object detected at the touch sensor.

In another embodiment instead of performing the operations of the processing logic in the processing device the processing device may send the raw data or partially processed data to the host . The host as illustrated in may include decision logic that performs some or all of the operations of the processing logic . Operations of the decision logic may be implemented in firmware hardware software or a combination thereof. The host may include a high level Application Programming Interface API in applications that perform routines on the received data such as compensating for sensitivity differences other compensation algorithms baseline update routines start up and or initialization routines interpolation operations or scaling operations. The operations described with respect to the processing logic may be implemented in the decision logic the applications or in other hardware software and or firmware external to the processing device . In some other embodiments the processing device is the host .

In another embodiment the processing device may also include a non sensing actions block . This block may be used to process and or receive transmit data to and from the host . For example additional components may be implemented to operate with the processing device along with the sensor array e.g. keyboard keypad mouse trackball LEDs displays or other peripheral devices .

The processing device may reside on a common carrier substrate such as for example an integrated circuit IC die substrate or a multi chip module substrate. Alternatively the components of the processing device may be one or more separate integrated circuits and or discrete components. In one embodiment the processing device may be the Programmable System on a Chip PSoC processing device developed by Cypress Semiconductor Corporation San Jose Calif. Alternatively the processing device may be one or more other processing devices known by those of ordinary skill in the art such as a microprocessor or central processing unit a controller special purpose processor digital signal processor DSP an application specific integrated circuit ASIC a field programmable gate array FPGA or other programmable device. In an alternative embodiment for example the processing device may be a network processor having multiple processors including a core unit and multiple micro engines. Additionally the processing device may include any combination of general purpose processing device s and special purpose processing device s .

In one embodiment the electronic system is implemented in a device that includes the touch sensing surface as the user interface such as handheld electronics portable telephones cellular telephones notebook computers personal computers personal data assistants PDAs kiosks keyboards televisions remote controls monitors handheld multi media devices handheld video players gaming devices control panels of a household or industrial appliances or other computer peripheral or input devices. Alternatively the electronic system may be used in other types of devices. It should be noted that the components of electronic system may include all the components described above. Alternatively electronic system may include only some of the components described above or include additional components not listed herein.

Capacitance sensor includes multiplexer control demultiplexer and multiplexer clock generator signal generator demodulation circuit and analog to digital converter ADC . ADC is further coupled with touch coordinate converter . Touch coordinate converter outputs a signal to the processing logic .

The transmit and receive electrodes in the electrode matrix may be arranged so that each of the transmit electrodes overlap and cross each of the receive electrodes such as to form an array of intersections while maintaining galvanic isolation from each other. Thus each transmit electrode may be capacitively coupled with each of the receive electrodes. For example transmit electrode is capacitively coupled with receive electrode at the point where transmit electrode and receive electrode overlap.

Clock generator supplies a clock signal to signal generator which produces a TX signal to be supplied to the transmit electrodes of touch sensor . In one embodiment the signal generator includes a set of switches that operate according to the clock signal from clock generator . The switches may generate a TX signal by periodically connecting the output of signal generator to a first voltage and then to a second voltage wherein said first and second voltages are different.

The output of signal generator is connected with demultiplexer which allows the TX signal to be applied to any of the M transmit electrodes of touch sensor . In one embodiment multiplexer control controls demultiplexer so that the TX signal is applied to each transmit electrode in a controlled sequence. Demultiplexer may also be used to ground float or connect an alternate signal to the other transmit electrodes to which the TX signal is not currently being applied.

Because of the capacitive coupling between the transmit and receive electrodes the TX signal applied to each transmit electrode induces a current within each of the receive electrodes. For instance when the TX signal is applied to transmit electrode through demultiplexer the TX signal induces an RX signal on the receive electrodes in matrix . The RX signal on each of the receive electrodes can then be measured in sequence by using multiplexer to connect each of the N receive electrodes to demodulation circuit in sequence.

The mutual capacitance associated with each intersection between a TX electrode and an RX electrode can be sensed by selecting every available combination of TX electrode and an RX electrode using demultiplexer and multiplexer . To improve performance multiplexer may also be segmented to allow more than one of the receive electrodes in matrix to be routed to additional demodulation circuits . In an optimized configuration wherein there is a 1 to 1 correspondence of instances of demodulation circuit with receive electrodes multiplexer may not be present in the system.

When an object such as a finger approaches the electrode matrix the object causes a decrease in the mutual capacitance between only some of the electrodes. For example if a finger is placed near the intersection of transmit electrode and receive electrode the presence of the finger will decrease the mutual capacitance between electrodes and . Thus the location of the finger on the touchpad can be determined by identifying the one or more receive electrodes having a decreased mutual capacitance in addition to identifying the transmit electrode to which the TX signal was applied at the time the decreased mutual capacitance was measured on the one or more receive electrodes.

By determining the mutual capacitances associated with each intersection of electrodes in the matrix the locations of one or more touch contacts may be determined. The determination may be sequential in parallel or may occur more frequently at commonly used electrodes.

In alternative embodiments other methods for detecting the presence of a finger or conductive object may be used where the finger or conductive object causes an increase in capacitance at one or more electrodes which may be arranged in a grid or other pattern. For example a finger placed near an electrode of a capacitive sensor may introduce an additional capacitance to ground that increases the total capacitance between the electrode and ground. The location of the finger can be determined from the locations of one or more electrodes at which an increased capacitance is detected.

The induced current signal is rectified by demodulation circuit . The rectified current output by demodulation circuit can then be filtered and converted to a digital code by ADC .

The digital code is converted to touch coordinates indicating a position of an input on touch sensor array by touch coordinate converter . The touch coordinates are transmitted as an input signal to the processing logic . In one embodiment the input signal is received at an input to the processing logic . In one embodiment the input may be configured to receive capacitance measurements indicating a plurality of row coordinates and a plurality of column coordinates. Alternatively the input may be configured to receive row coordinates and column coordinates.

In one embodiment the sensor array can be configured to detect multiple touches. One technique for multi touch detection uses a two axis implementation one axis to support rows and another axis to support columns. Additional axes such as a diagonal axis implemented on the surface using additional layers can allow resolution of additional touches.

In one embodiment the processing device is connected to a host which may receive the measured capacitances or calculated centroid locations from the processing device .

The sensor array illustrated in includes sensor elements arranged in a diamond pattern. Specifically the sensor elements of sensor array are arranged in a single solid diamond SSD pattern. illustrates a capacitive sensor array having an alternate embodiment of the diamond pattern which is the dual solid diamond DSD pattern. Each of the sensor elements of capacitive sensor array includes two rows or columns of electrically connected diamond shaped traces. Relative to the SSD pattern the DSD pattern has improved signal disparity characteristics due to an increase in the coupling between TX and RX sensor elements while maintaining the same self capacitance coupling possible between each sensor element and a conductive object near the sensor element. However the DSD pattern also increases the number of bridges used to create the pattern which may result in decreased manufacturing yield. The increased number of bridges may also be visible if metal bridges are used.

In one embodiment a bridge is used to connect portions of the sensor element on opposite sides of the main trace of sensor element . For example the bridge connects the portions of the core trace A and B. In one embodiment the bridge is made from Indium Tin Oxide ITO . Alternatively the bridge may be made from metal or some other conductive material. In one embodiment the bridge may be manufactured in the same layer as the sensor element to which it is connected. For example the bridge may be manufactured as part of the same layer of material as sensor element . This may be the case where sensor elements and are in different layers. Alternatively the sensor elements and may be in the same layer and the bridge may be in a separate layer.

In an alternative embodiment the bridge may be used to connect portions of sensor element rather than sensor element . In one embodiment a metal bridge may be used to connect the portions of sensor element to minimize the resistance of the RX sensor element .

Within the unit cell a primary subtrace branches away from the main trace . In one embodiment only one end of the primary subtrace is connected to the main trace . The sensor element may also include primary subtraces in addition to primary subtrace such as subtrace . These additional primary subtraces may also extend away from the main trace and may be parallel to subtrace . For example subtrace branches away from the same side of main trace as subtrace and is parallel to subtrace . In one embodiment the primary subtraces including subtrace may be symmetrical about an axis extending through main trace . In one embodiment the primary subtraces may be orthogonal to main trace at the junction between the primary subtraces and the main trace .

As compared to the single solid diamond SSD pattern the sensor pattern illustrated in is characterized by a greater boundary length between the sensor elements and . This increased boundary length increases the capacitive coupling between the sensor elements and which results in a decreased signal disparity when compared to the SSD pattern.

As compared to the DSD pattern the sensor pattern of has fewer bridges per unit cell which may result in an increased manufacturing yield rate. Fewer bridges may also be less visible than the greater number of bridges per unit cell of the DSD pattern particularly in applications where the sensor array is used in a clear touch sensing overlay application.

In one embodiment the shape of the sensor element conforms to the negative space around the shape of sensor element . In an alternative embodiment the shape of sensor element may be independent of the shape of sensor element and portions of the different sensor elements may overlap.

In one embodiment the layout of traces of sensor element accommodates a core trace of the sensor element . In embodiments where the sensor element is made up of multiple connected traces the core trace may be the widest trace of each sensor element. For example sensor element includes a core trace that is wider than any of the other traces of which the sensor element is comprised. In one embodiment the width of the core trace maintains a low resistance to facilitate current flow through the sensor element . In one embodiment other characteristics of the core trace such as thickness or material may also be used to maintain the low resistance of the sensor element .

In one embodiment the sensor element may function as a transmit TX sensor element while the sensor element functions as a receive RX sensor element as illustrated in . In an alternative embodiment the sensor elements and may instead function as RX and TX sensor elements respectively.

In contrast with diamond patterns such as SSD and DSD patterns the pattern having a main trace and subtraces allows for more flexible scaling and sizing of the TX and RX sensor elements as well as adjustment of the boundary length between the TX and RX elements. In one embodiment the geometry of the sensor elements may be optimized for a particular application or sensing method. For example the boundary length between the TX and RX sensor elements may be maximized for mutual capacitance sensing which depends on the fringing electric field between the TX and RX sensor elements. For self capacitance sensing the pattern of sensor elements may be designed to maximize the area covered by a given sensor element. In one embodiment the width of the main trace may be increased to decrease the resistance of the sensor element or decreased to increase the resistance.

As illustrated in the sensor element may include twelve primary subtraces branching from the main trace as compared to the eight primary subtraces illustrated in . Thus between various embodiments the number of subtraces per unit cell may be varied to optimize for different sensing methods. In some embodiments the other dimensions of the main trace and subtraces such as the trace length and thickness may also be varied for optimization purposes.

In one embodiment dummy traces may be used to reduce parasitic coupling between adjacent sensor elements. Dummy traces may be made from conductive material such as indium tin oxide ITO that is electrically isolated from the sensor elements.

In one embodiment the dummy traces may be situated between the adjacent sensor elements. For example dummy traces are positioned in between the sensor elements and . In one embodiment the dummy traces may be arranged in two rows between the sensor elements and . Alternatively the dummy traces may be arranged in more or fewer than two rows. For example the sensor elements may be separated by just one row of dummy traces.

In one embodiment dummy traces may also be positioned between portions of the same sensor element to reduce parasitic mutual capacitance between intersecting sensor elements. For example dummy traces are placed between portions of sensor element and to reduce the parasitic mutual capacitance between sensor elements and . In one embodiment the dummy traces may be positioned so that the dummy traces do not obstruct the flow of current through one or more of the sensor elements and the presence of the dummy traces does not significantly increase the resistance of the sensor elements. For example dummy traces may be positioned between two primary subtraces and branching from a main trace of sensor element . Thus the presence of the dummy traces does not significantly obstruct the flow of current through sensor element .

In contrast with capacitive sensor array illustrated in sensor array includes primary subtraces of column sensor element rather than dummy traces in between adjacent row sensor elements. For example primary subtrace may be situated between sensor elements and . In one embodiment primary subtraces may divide the entire boundary between sensor elements and . Alternatively the primary subtraces may divide only a part of the boundary between elements and as illustrated in . In one embodiment the presence of the primary subtrace between the sensor elements and reduces the capacitive coupling between sensor elements and .

In addition to use in a touch sensing application the sensor patterns as illustrated in may be used to create a structure having a desired capacitance density for a specific footprint due to the flexibility in sizing the area of the sensor elements and the boundary length between the sensor elements. For example the sensor pattern may be used as an electrical test module in a silicon process where area intensive and perimeter intensive patterns may be used to extract a sidewall capacitance versus area capacitance of a process stackup.

In one embodiment a capacitive sensor array pattern may include sensor elements having more than one main trace. For example a RX sensor element may include two or more main traces to reduce the RX resistance.
