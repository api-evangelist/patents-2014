title: Service personalization with familiarity sensitivity
abstract: Personalized services often utilize individual profiles, such as social network profiles, product purchase histories, or browsing histories. However, personalization may exhibit or imply a familiarity level between the service and the individual that is beyond the individual's comfort level. Presented herein are techniques for adapting personalized services to request supplemental individual information only within a current familiarity stage that has been established by the individual with the service, and only to provide a requested usage of a service. Such solicitation may inform the individual of the intended usage of the requested information. Usages that may involve more sensitive information may be predicated upon requesting and receiving individual consent from the individual to advance to a higher familiarity stage. The user may be permitted to provide individual consent to advancing to a higher familiarity stage only for a particular service, and/or only temporarily for a particular usage of the service.

Within the field of computing many scenarios involve the provision of one or more personalized services for individuals based on individual profiles of the individuals. As a first example the individual profile may comprise a purchase history of products and services that the individual has researched or purchased and the service may present recommendations to the individual that are based on the previously selected products and services. As a second example the individual profile may comprise a social network profile and the provision of services may be personalized based on the information in the social network profile. As a third example the individual profile may comprise facts about individual interests expressed by and or inferred from the individual s actions such as web browsing and the services may comprise advertisements that are personalized based on the individual interests.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

While the provision of personalized services may present opportunities for more relevant and persuasive services some undesirable scenarios may result from such techniques based on personalization that are beyond a comfort level of the individual. Such scenarios may arise if the receipt usage and or presentation of individual information is not performed in view of the potential sensitivity of the information to the individual and or the level of familiarity with which the individual wishes to engage the services. As a first example a first product may be generally purchased by consumers for a variety of health conditions including a sensitive health condition that is also correlated with a second product. A na ve product recommendation service that is informed by such correlation may recommend the second product to an individual who purchases the first product and may inadvertently imply that the sensitive health condition applies to the individual. As a second example a social network profile may include private information that the individual may not wish to extend beyond the social circle and a service utilizing the social network profile may inadvertently expose the private information of the individual outside of the social network. As a third example an advertising service may inadvertently utilize information based on information that the individual may have regarded as private and that the individual is not comfortable having shared with the advertising service. In these scenarios the uses of the individual s information may inadvertently cause discomfort due to correct inferences that the individual wished to keep private i.e. personalized services exhibiting a level of familiarity beyond the individual s comfort level and or offense due to incorrect inferences of sensitive topics to the individual.

Presented herein are techniques for providing personalized services that are adapted to the familiarity with which the individual is comfortable and to which the individual has consented. In accordance with these techniques an individual profile may contain information about the individual that enables the provision of personalized services within a selected familiarity stage. If a usage of the service involves supplemental individual information that is absent from the individual profile but on a comparable level of familiarity with previously disclosed information the service may freely request receive store and utilize the information. However if the supplemental individual information is beyond a previously established level of familiarity the service may conservatively request only the supplemental individual information that is related to the usage of the service and may also inform the individual of the usage of the supplemental individual information by the service e.g. explaining why the supplemental individual information is being sought . If the individual refuses to provide the supplemental individual information the service may endeavor to fulfill the usage in the absence of the supplemental individual information and in some embodiments may refrain from requesting the supplemental individual information in future usages . However if the individual provides the supplemental individual information the service may endeavor to provide the usage and promptly present results to the individual that demonstrate the value of the supplemental individual information. Additionally such requests and uses may be structured according to a set of familiarity stages e.g. an anonymous familiarity stage involving no personalized individual information an impersonal familiarity stage involving only the information that the individual has disclosed in a current interaction a semi familiar familiarity stage involving non sensitive information such as the individual s basic social network profile and a familiar familiarity stage involving sensitive information such as the individual s health record and may only request information within a selected familiarity stage. Information that is beyond the selected familiarity stage may be contingent upon receiving an individual consent from the individual to advance to a higher familiarity stage e.g. before requesting specific details about an individual s health record a user interface may first request confirmation that the individual is comfortable discussing his or her health record and may present specific questions only upon receiving individual consent to advance the higher familiarity stage. Structuring the collection and use of information about the individual in these and other ways may inform services in a more socially adept manner that reduces discomfort and or offense over the uses of the individual s information in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects advantages and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident however that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.

However within such exemplary scenarios automated use of information in the individual profile of the individual may occasionally result in discomfort or offense of the individual . For example some portions of the individual profile may be sensitive such as the individual s financial status health record relationship history and personal tastes. The individual may wish to have some of this information used only by some services and not shared with others or may wish to have this information used only in particular ways. In some scenarios information in the individual profile may have been identified from activities that the individual believed to be private and wishes not to be shared with any service . As another example some information in the individual profile may be out of date or inaccurate and the personalization of services based on such details may be undesirable to the individual . Additionally some more proactive services may ask information that the individual may not be willing to share possibly not in the current context of the individual such as a public location creating anxiety and possibly prompting the individual to provide incorrect information or may attempt to provide personalization based on inferences about the individual that while statistically likely may not be true for this individual . While these scenarios often arise in human interaction and are often handled through social cues and tact such considerations are not typically utilized in the automated handling of individual profiles by personalized services occasionally creating uncomfortable and offensive interactions with individuals .

Social difficulties arising from the automated compilation and use of an individual profile including those illustrated in the exemplary scenarios of may arise from the personalization of services based on the contents of an individual profile in the absence of evaluation of the nature and sensitivity of the compiled information and the level of familiarity that the individual has provided individual consent to develop with the service . Instead it may be advantageous to configure services to evaluate the level of familiarity in the relationship developed between the individual and the service and to adjust the requesting use and disclosure of individual details based on the familiarity of the relationship. By requesting only information in accordance with the consented familiarity of this relationship and only when applicable to a requested usage of the service by the individual while also explaining how the requested information is to be used the service may build trust with the individual that encourages the advancement of the familiarity of the relationship.

As further illustrated in the exemplary scenario of at a second time point a requested usage of the service by the individual may involve the supplemental individual information . For example the service may determine that at least one apartment arising in the apartment search is only to be displayed to individuals who prequalify based on a sufficiently trustworthy credit score. Recognizing that the supplemental individual information may now be applicable to the provision of the usage of the service a determination may be made whether the supplemental individual information is within a familiarity level established by the individual with the service . If not then the service may be provided to the individual without the supplemental individual information . However if the supplemental individual information may be requested from the individual in order to provide the service for the individual . For example the service may present a notification that the requested usage may be more completely fulfilled if the individual discloses the supplemental individual information . The notification may also include an explanation of the usage of the supplemental individual information for the requested usage of the service e.g. indicating that the service intends to use the credit score of the individual to identify apartments in the apartment search for which the individual is prequalified due to a sufficiently trustworthy credit score . The notification may also include a request for the supplemental individual information and options for disclosing and not disclosing the supplemental individual information .

As further illustrated in the exemplary scenario of if the individual selects the option of disclosing the supplemental individual information the service may at a third time point add the disclosed supplemental individual information to the individual profile of the individual and may utilize the supplemental individual information to fulfill the usage of the service . In some embodiments the service may promptly demonstrate to the individual the value of having disclosed the supplemental individual information such as the presentation of a search result set including a first search result that is not based on the supplemental individual information and also a second search result that is based on the supplemental individual information and denoted as such e.g. Your credit score prequalifies you for this apartment . However if the individual chooses the option of not disclosing the supplemental individual information the service may at a fourth time point endeavor to fulfill the requested usage by maximizing the individual information that is in the individual profile and may therefore present a search result set including a search result based on the individual s student status but omitting any search results based on the absent supplemental individual information . Additionally noting the individual s choice not to disclose the supplemental individual information the service may be configured to refrain from requesting the supplemental individual information of the individual again but may simply maximize the information in the individual profile of the individual in order to provide the service to the individual unless and until the individual indicates a later willingness to disclose the supplemental individual information to the service e.g. after developing a relationship with the service that confers a level of trust within which the individual is comfortable disclosing the supplemental individual information . In this manner the generation and use of the individual profile of the individual may be achieved in view of the familiarity level established by the individual with the service in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

The exemplary system includes a service informant that upon receiving a request for a usage of the service with the individual profile of the individual where the usage involves supplemental individual information that is absent from the individual profile determines whether the supplemental individual information is within the familiarity level established by the individual with the service . If the supplemental individual information is within the familiarity level the service informant requests the supplemental individual information from the individual and upon receiving the supplemental individual information provides the service for the individual using the individual profile and the supplemental individual information . The exemplary system also includes a user interface that informs the individual of the usage of the supplemental individual information by the service . For example the user interface may present to the individual a notification of the usage and a request to provide the supplemental individual information for use in providing the service for the individual . The user interface may also include options allowing the individual to specify whether to permit the usage and provide the supplemental individual information and or to decline the usage in which case the service may be provided for the individual in the absence of the supplemental individual information . In this manner the components of the exemplary system may interoperate to achieve the provision of the services in view of the supplemental individual information of the individual profile in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

The exemplary method of begins at and involves executing the instructions on a processor of the device . Specifically the instructions cause the device to upon receiving a request for a usage of the service that involves supplemental individual information that is absent from the individual profile determine whether the supplemental individual information is within the familiarity level established by the individual with the service. Upon determining that the supplemental individual information is within the familiarity level the instructions further cause the device to request the supplemental individual information from the individual and upon receiving the supplemental individual information store the supplemental individual information in the individual profile and provide the service for the individual using the individual profile and the supplemental individual information. In this manner the exemplary method achieves the configuration of the device to generate and use the individual profile of the individual in order to provide the service for the individual in accordance with the techniques presented herein and so ends at .

The techniques discussed herein may be devised with variations in many aspects and some variations may present additional advantages and or reduce disadvantages with respect to other variations of these and other techniques. Moreover some variations may be implemented in combination and some combinations may feature additional advantages and or reduced disadvantages through synergistic cooperation. The variations may be incorporated in various embodiments e.g. the exemplary system of the exemplary method of and or the exemplary memory device of to confer individual and or synergistic advantages upon such embodiments.

A first aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the scenarios wherein such techniques may be utilized.

As a first variation of this first aspect the techniques presented herein may be utilized to achieve the configuration of a variety of devices such as workstations servers laptops tablets mobile phones game consoles portable gaming devices portable or non portable media players media display devices such as televisions and appliances.

As a second variation of this first aspect many types of services provided by such techniques including commercial services financial services educational services social networks health services and advisory services.

As a third variation of this first aspect many types of individual profiles may be generated comprising many types of individual details including the demographic details of the individual the associations of the individual with various other individuals groups and organizations the financial status and or credit record of the individual the health record of the individual the personal tastes of the individual contact information of the individual a browsing history of the individual a purchase history of the individual and a history of interactions between the individual and other individuals such as a record of messages exchanged between such individuals. Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many such scenarios to which the techniques presented herein may be applicable.

A second aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the requesting and usage of the supplemental individual information .

As a first variation of this second aspect requests for supplemental individual information may be issued to the individual in various ways. As a first example the request may be presented through a natural language notification complete with usage information and a mechanism for asking additional questions. As a second example the individual may have indicated various types of individual consent through an automated interface e.g. a personal information manager and requesting the supplemental individual information may involve presenting the request to the automated interface.

As a second variation of this second aspect if an individual refuses to provide supplemental individual information e.g. refusing to provide individual consent to advance to a higher familiarity stage the individual may be notified that the service is not available e.g. if it is not possible to provide the service to the individual in a meaningful way absent the supplemental individual information . Alternatively the service may endeavor to fulfill the usage using only the currently available individual details in the individual profile . As a second such example the service may be configured to refrain from requesting the supplemental individual information for subsequent usages of the service . As a third such example if supplemental individual information about the individual is received that exceeds the familiarity level established by the individual with the service the supplemental individual information may be discarded and not added to the individual profile and the service may refrain from using any such supplemental individual information exceeding the familiarity level during provision of the service to the individual . As a fourth such example if the individual expressed a reduced familiarity level established with the service e.g. indicating that the individual has become more sensitive to some information in the individual profile and or has lost trust in the service the individual profile may be reexamined in order to discard any individual information that exceeds the reduced familiarity level established by the individual with the service and the service may then be provided to the individual according to the reduced familiarity level .

As a third variation of this second aspect before requesting supplemental individual information a service may endeavor to maximize its utilization in the absence of the supplemental individual information . That is if the individual profile of the individual is sufficient to satisfy a requested usage of a service an embodiment of these techniques may not request the supplemental individual information . For example if an apartment search reveals a search result that is contingent both upon a non student status and a sufficiently trustworthy credit score and the individual profile of the individual includes a student status but does not include a credit score the service may not opt to request the credit score as the current information in the individual profile is sufficient to make this determination.

As a fourth variation of this second aspect upon receiving supplemental individual information that has been requested for a usage a service may endeavor to expedite the fulfillment of the usage relating to the supplemental individual information . For example a service may be configured to present search results contingent upon the supplemental individual information promptly upon receipt and may indicate the relationship between the supplemental individual information and the search results e.g. indicating how a credit score that the individual has disclosed has affected the search results such as prequalifying the individual for one or more apartments . Promptly using the supplemental individual information to personalize the service for the individual may reassure the individual that the disclosure of such supplemental individual information is for the advantage of the individual in providing a higher level of personalization of the service for the individual .

As a fifth variation of this second aspect the familiarity level may be represented as a set of familiarity stages that respectively indicate the sensitivity and or familiarity connoted by the disclosure of the individual detail . Additionally the individual profile may store a selected familiarity stage selected from a familiarity stage set indicating a degree of familiarity of the relationship between the individual profile and the services using it and the individual . Requests for supplemental individual information may be issued in various ways based upon the selected familiarity stage of the individual profile and the familiarity stage of the requested supplemental individual information .

Many additional variations may involve the selection of a familiarity stage. As a sixth variation of this second aspect a device may be configured to prioritize respective usages of the service according to the familiarity stage of the usage . Between a first usage and a second usage involving a higher familiarity stage than that of the first usage the device may be configured to perform the first usage before the second usage e.g. completing the lower sensitivity usages and presenting the results to the individual before requesting supplemental individual information related to the higher familiarity stage of the second usage .

As a seventh variation of this second aspect a device may be configured to upon determining that a usage involves supplemental individual information that is associated with a familiarity stage beyond the selected familiarity stage of the individual profile e.g. a usage that is desirably fulfilled using supplemental individual information that is beyond the highest level of familiarity thus far established between the individual and the service the device may request from the individual an individual consent to advance the selected familiarity stage of the individual profile to the higher familiarity stage pertaining to the usage of the service . For example if the individual requests a usage involving sensitive information such as an evaluation of a health condition but has previously shared only non sensitive information within a personal familiarity stage the service may first verify that the individual has provided individual consent to moving to a familiar familiarity stage . Upon receiving such individual consent the device may advance the selected familiarity stage of the individual profile to the higher familiarity stage. Additionally upon advancing to the higher familiarity stage the device may be less conservative during subsequent requests for supplemental individual information that is within the higher familiarity stage e.g. once receiving individual consent from the individual to receive and utilize some confidential financial information such as a credit score the service may again seek advancement to the higher familiarity stage before requesting even more sensitive financial information such as annual income but may be less hesitant to request other financial information of the same or lower sensitivity such as whether the individual holds a credit card.

As an eighth variation of this second aspect respective services may be associated with an individual profile domain e.g. a particular topic and may utilize the individual details of the user input within the individual profile domain. The individual profile may also identify different selected familiarity stages for different individual profile domains of the individual profile . For example the individual profile may include individual details about the individual s health record the individual s financial status and the individual s personal relationships and the individual may have different selected familiarity stages about each individual profile domain e.g. the individual may be comfortable sharing confidential financial information with services may be comfortable sharing only personal relationship information with the services and may not be comfortable sharing any health record information with the services . Accordingly the device may expose the individual profile to a service by first identifying the selected familiarity stage for the individual profile domain involved in the usage of the service and then requesting from the individual only supplemental individual information that is within the selected familiarity stage of the individual profile domain of the service .

As a ninth variation of this second aspect the individual may be presented with an option to advance from a familiarity stage to a higher familiarity stage only for a particular usage of a particular service . For example the individual may be willing to disclose sensitive information such as a credit score only during a single interaction with a single service . Accordingly an individual consent to advance the selected familiarity stage to a higher familiarity stage may be applied prior to providing the service and upon completing the usage of the service the selected familiarity stage may return from the higher familiarity stage. In this manner the privacy interests of the individual may be safeguarded while temporarily achieving a higher familiarity stage with the individual in a selected manner.

As a tenth variation of this second aspect a device may infer an individual detail about an individual e.g. based on individual behavior expressions purchases or demographics. For example an individual profile generator may included an inferred that upon inferring an individual detail about the individual stores the individual detail in the individual profile of the individual . In accordance with the techniques presented herein such inferences may be collected and stored only in accordance with the familiarity level established by the individual with the service . Upon inferring an individual detail that is within the familiarity level the inferrer may store the individual detail in the individual profile . Conversely upon inferring an individual detail that exceeds the familiarity level the inferrer may discard the individual detail and may refrain from allowing the service to use the individual detail.

Further variations in this second aspect pertain to the manner of inferring such individual details within the familiarity level established by the individual with the service . For example an interaction with the individual may include a recommendation that is associated with an inference of an individual detail that is within a selected familiarity stage of the individual profile . If individual interest by the individual in the recommendation is detected the individual detail may be added to the individual profile in accordance with the selected familiarity stage . For example in a usage of a service comprising a restaurant search a set of search options may be presented that provide various capabilities where a personalized option that is associated with an individual detail that has been inferred about the individual may be included among one or more non personalized options that are not associated with the individual detail. A detection of higher individual interest in the personalized option than in the non personalized options may facilitate an assurance that the inference is correct and the inference may be added to the individual profile of the individual . These and other variations in the development of the individual profile in accordance with the familiarity level established between the individual and the service may be included in various embodiments of the techniques presented herein.
