title: Maintaining a deduplication database
abstract: An information management system can modify working copies of database entries residing in a local database of a secondary storage computing device in response to instructions to modify the database entries residing in a deduplication database. If the working copy does not already reside in the local database, a copy of the database entry, or portion thereof, from the deduplication database can be used to generate the working copy. Based on a desired policy, the working copies in the local database can be merged with the actual database entries in the deduplication database.

U.S. application Ser. No. 14 216 689 filed Mar. 17 2014 entitled MANAGING DELETIONS FROM A DEDUPLICATION DATABASE incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Businesses worldwide recognize the commercial value of their data and seek reliable cost effective ways to protect the information stored on their computer networks while minimizing impact on productivity. Protecting information is often part of a routine process that is performed within an organization.

A company might back up critical computing systems such as databases file servers web servers and so on as part of a daily weekly or monthly maintenance schedule. The company may similarly protect computing systems used by each of its employees such as those used by an accounting department marketing department engineering department and so forth.

Given the rapidly expanding volume of data under management companies also continue to seek innovative techniques for managing data growth in addition to protecting data. For instance companies often implement migration techniques for moving data to lower cost storage over time and data reduction techniques for reducing redundant data pruning lower priority data etc.

Enterprises also increasingly view their stored data as a valuable asset. Along these lines customers are looking for solutions that not only protect and manage but also leverage their data. For instance solutions providing data analysis capabilities improved data presentation and access features and the like are in increasing demand.

In response to these challenges one technique developed by storage system providers is data deduplication. Deduplication typically involves eliminating or reducing the amount of redundant data stored and communicated within a storage system improving storage utilization. For example data can be divided into units of a chosen granularity e.g. files or sub file data blocks . The sizes of the data blocks can be of fixed or variable length. As new data enters the system the data units can be checked to see if they already exist in the storage system. If the data unit already exists instead of storing and or communicating a duplicate copy the storage system stores and or communicates a reference to the existing data unit. Thus deduplication can improve storage utilization system traffic e.g. over a networked storage system or both.

Even in those systems employing deduplication data management operations including backup and restore operations can place heavy demands on available network bandwidth and available system resources. Such operations can also introduce significant delay e.g. due to communication latency between secondary storage e.g. non production backup storage and primary storage e.g. production storage . In addition if a device or script involved in the deduplication process fails or becomes unavailable recovering from such failures to restore the deduplication to the pre failure state can be quite time consuming.

For example in some cases deduplication database pruning operations e.g. data block deletion operations are performed at infrequent intervals and a lengthy log of pending pruning operations is compiled over time. At the next pruning interval the system plays back the log to actually implement the pruning operations in the deduplication database. In such cases playing back the full pruning history in the event of a system crash can take a long time.

In accordance with certain aspects of the disclosure solutions described herein address these and other challenges. Some of these solutions incorporate the use of a locally maintained data structure residing on a secondary storage computing device or other storage controller computer such as in a main memory of the secondary storage computing device. This local data structure can be referred to as an in memory database IMDB for example. The local database can retain working copies of deduplication database entries where a full version of the deduplication database exists external to the secondary storage computing device. For instance the complete version of the deduplication database may be contained in one or more secondary storage devices and can also be referred to as an on disk database ODDB . The deduplication database entries can include certain information related to deduplication data blocks stored in the secondary storage devices. For instance for any given data block the database entries can include a signature corresponding to the data block a pointer to a copy of the data block stored in the secondary storage devices a count value corresponding to a number of references to the data block in a set of deduplicated files maintained in the secondary storage and the like. The working copies in the local database can include some or all of the information included the corresponding database entries.

As storage operations occur in secondary storage the system can modify the working copy of the database entries in the local database e.g. residing in main memory without initially modifying corresponding database entries stored in the full version of the database. The working copies in the local database can be flushed from the local database secondary storage computing device and or merged with the full version of the database. For instance the working copies may be flushed and or merged with the full version of the deduplication database according to a transaction based scheme when the local database reaches a threshold size or upon expiration of a threshold period of time since the last time the local database was flushed. The working copies can be set to read only or otherwise set to prevent write access during the transaction to preserve the integrity of the transaction. The threshold size or time period can be selected such that transactions e.g. additions and modifications to entries are flushed from the local database to the deduplication database with sufficient regularity to keep the deduplication database relatively current e.g. at no more than 1 2 or 5 minute intervals . This can reduce the time required for rebuilding and bringing the deduplication database back online in the event of certain failures such as hardware or software crashes associated with the secondary storage computing device.

According to additional aspects the local database can be used in conjunction with pruning certain deduplication information from the information management system in a manner that improves crash recovery. For instance the system can query the merged database entries to identify any entries indicating that a pruning event e.g. a deletion of a data block and or corresponding deduplication signature etc. should occur such as where an entry for a particular data block indicates that there are no longer any deduplicated files that reference an instance of that data block. If the local database is flushed and merged with the full deduplication database at a sufficient frequency pruning operations will be written out to and reflected in the deduplication database relatively promptly e.g. without the need to build and play back a lengthy pruning log in the event of a crash. In some embodiments some scheduled pruning events may be missed in the event of a crash such as if the local database is lost prior to a merge with the complete deduplication database. However because of the transaction based scheme the database is updated relatively frequently only a relatively small number of pruning events will be lost for any given crash. In such cases this small number of pruning events can be re issued by the system.

Systems and methods are described herein for implementing a transaction based deduplication database management scheme incorporating the use of deduplication information local to a secondary storage computing device. Some such systems and methods involve the use of working copies of deduplication database entries or other appropriate deduplication information maintained in main memory of the secondary storage computing device. The working copies can be merged with a deduplication database residing in one or more secondary storage devices on a relatively frequent basis such as upon satisfaction of a size threshold of a data structure containing the working copies or upon expiration of a threshold period of time following the last merge operation. Such techniques can reduce the time required for rebuilding and bringing a deduplication data store back online in the event of certain failures such as hardware or software crashes associated with the secondary storage computing device. Examples of such systems and methods are discussed in further detail herein e.g. in reference to . Moreover it will be appreciated that such components and functionality may be configured for use with and or incorporated into information management systems such as those that will now be described with respect to .

With the increasing importance of protecting and leveraging data organizations simply cannot afford to take the risk of losing critical data. Moreover runaway data growth and other modern realities make protecting and managing data an increasingly difficult task. There is therefore a need for efficient powerful and user friendly solutions for protecting and managing data.

Depending on the size of the organization there are typically many data production sources which are under the purview of tens hundreds or even thousands of employees or other individuals. In the past individual employees were sometimes responsible for managing and protecting their data. A patchwork of hardware and software point solutions has been applied in other cases. These solutions were often provided by different vendors and had limited or no interoperability.

Certain embodiments described herein provide systems and methods capable of addressing these and other shortcomings of prior approaches by implementing unified organization wide information management. shows one such information management system which generally includes combinations of hardware and software configured to protect and manage data and metadata which is generated and used by the various computing devices in information management system . The organization that employs the information management system may be a corporation or other business entity non profit organization educational institution household governmental agency or the like.

Generally the systems and associated components described herein may be compatible with and or provide some or all of the functionality of the systems and corresponding components described in one or more of the following U.S. patents and patent application publications assigned to CommVault Systems Inc. each of which is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference herein 

The information management system can include a variety of different computing devices. For instance as will be described in greater detail herein the information management system can include one or more client computing devices and secondary storage computing devices .

Computing devices can include without limitation one or more workstations personal computers desktop computers or other types of generally fixed computing systems such as mainframe computers and minicomputers. Other computing devices can include mobile or portable computing devices such as one or more laptops tablet computers personal data assistants mobile phones such as smartphones and other mobile or portable computing devices such as embedded computers set top boxes vehicle mounted devices wearable computers etc. Computing devices can include servers such as mail servers file servers database servers and web servers.

In some cases a computing device includes virtualized and or cloud computing resources. For instance one or more virtual machines may be provided to the organization by a third party cloud service vendor. Or in some embodiments computing devices can include one or more virtual machine s running on a physical host computing device or host machine operated by the organization. As one example the organization may use one virtual machine as a database server and another virtual machine as a mail server both virtual machines operating on the same host machine.

A virtual machine includes an operating system and associated virtual resources and is hosted simultaneously with another operating system on a physical host computer or host machine . A hypervisor typically software and also known in the art as a virtual machine monitor or a virtual machine manager or VMM sits between the virtual machine and the hardware of the physical host machine. One example of hypervisor as virtualization software is ESX Server by VMware Inc. of Palo Alto Calif. other examples include Microsoft Virtual Server and Microsoft Windows Server Hyper V both by Microsoft Corporation of Redmond Wash. and Sun xVM by Oracle America Inc. of Santa Clara Calif. In some embodiments the hypervisor may be firmware or hardware or a combination of software and or firmware and or hardware.

The hypervisor provides to each virtual operating system virtual resources such as a virtual processor virtual memory a virtual network device and a virtual disk. Each virtual machine has one or more virtual disks. The hypervisor typically stores the data of virtual disks in files on the file system of the physical host machine called virtual machine disk files in the case of VMware virtual servers or virtual hard disk image files in the case of Microsoft virtual servers . For example VMware s ESX Server provides the Virtual Machine File System VMFS for the storage of virtual machine disk files. A virtual machine reads data from and writes data to its virtual disk much the same way that an actual physical machine reads data from and writes data to an actual disk.

Examples of techniques for implementing information management techniques in a cloud computing environment are described in U.S. Pat. No. 8 285 681 which is incorporated by reference herein. Examples of techniques for implementing information management techniques in a virtualized computing environment are described in U.S. Pat. No. 8 307 177 also incorporated by reference herein.

The information management system can also include a variety of storage devices including primary storage devices and secondary storage devices for example. Storage devices can generally be of any suitable type including without limitation disk drives hard disk arrays semiconductor memory e.g. solid state storage devices network attached storage NAS devices tape libraries or other magnetic non tape storage devices optical media storage devices DNA RNA based memory technology combinations of the same and the like. In some embodiments storage devices can form part of a distributed file system. In some cases storage devices are provided in a cloud e.g. a private cloud or one operated by a third party vendor . A storage device in some cases comprises a disk array or portion thereof.

The illustrated information management system includes one or more client computing device having at least one application executing thereon and one or more primary storage devices storing primary data . The client computing device s and the primary storage devices may generally be referred to in some cases as a primary storage subsystem . A computing device in an information management system that has a data agent installed and operating on it is generally referred to as a client computing device or in the context of a component of the information management system simply as a client .

Depending on the context the term information management system can refer to generally all of the illustrated hardware and software components. Or in other instances the term may refer to only a subset of the illustrated components.

For instance in some cases the information management system generally refers to a combination of specialized components used to protect move manage manipulate analyze and or process data and metadata generated by the client computing devices . However the information management system in some cases does not include the underlying components that generate and or store the primary data such as the client computing devices themselves the applications and operating system operating on the client computing devices and the primary storage devices . As an example information management system may sometimes refer to one or more of the following components and corresponding data structures storage managers data agents and media agents. These components will be described in further detail below.

There are typically a variety of sources in an organization that produce data to be protected and managed. As just one illustrative example in a corporate environment such data sources can be employee workstations and company servers such as a mail server a web server a database server a transaction server or the like. In the information management system the data generation sources include the one or more client computing devices .

The client computing devices may include any of the types of computing devices described above without limitation and in some cases the client computing devices are associated with one or more users and or corresponding user accounts of employees or other individuals.

The information management system generally addresses and handles the data management and protection needs for the data generated by the client computing devices . However the use of this term does not imply that the client computing devices cannot be servers in other respects. For instance a particular client computing device may act as a server with respect to other devices such as other client computing devices . As just a few examples the client computing devices can include mail servers file servers database servers and web servers.

Each client computing device may have one or more applications e.g. software applications executing thereon which generate and manipulate the data that is to be protected from loss and managed. The applications generally facilitate the operations of an organization or multiple affiliated organizations and can include without limitation mail server applications e.g. Microsoft Exchange Server file server applications mail client applications e.g. Microsoft Exchange Client database applications e.g. SQL Oracle SAP Lotus Notes Database word processing applications e.g. Microsoft Word spreadsheet applications financial applications presentation applications graphics and or video applications browser applications mobile applications entertainment applications and so on.

The client computing devices can have at least one operating system e.g. Microsoft Windows Mac OS X iOS IBM z OS Linux other Unix based operating systems etc. installed thereon which may support or host one or more file systems and other applications .

The client computing devices and other components in information management system can be connected to one another via one or more communication pathways . For example a first communication pathway may connect or communicatively couple client computing device and secondary storage computing device a second communication pathway may connect storage manager and client computing device and a third communication pathway may connect storage manager and secondary storage computing device etc. see e.g. and . The communication pathways can include one or more networks or other connection types including one or more of the following without limitation the Internet a wide area network WAN a local area network LAN a Storage Area Network SAN a Fibre Channel connection a Small Computer System Interface SCSI connection a virtual private network VPN a token ring or TCP IP based network an intranet network a point to point link a cellular network a wireless data transmission system a two way cable system an interactive kiosk network a satellite network a broadband network a baseband network a neural network a mesh network an ad hoc network other appropriate wired wireless or partially wired wireless computer or telecommunications networks combinations of the same or the like. The communication pathways in some cases may also include application programming interfaces APIs including e.g. cloud service provider APIs virtual machine management APIs and hosted service provider APIs. The underlying infrastructure of communication paths may be wired and or wireless analog and or digital or any combination thereof and the facilities used may be private public third party provided or any combination thereof without limitation.

Primary data according to some embodiments is production data or other live data generated by the operating system and or applications operating on a client computing device . The primary data is generally stored on the primary storage device s and is organized via a file system supported by the client computing device . For instance the client computing device s and corresponding applications may create access modify write delete and otherwise use primary data . In some cases some or all of the primary data can be stored in cloud storage resources e.g. primary storage device may be a cloud based resource .

Primary data is generally in the native format of the source application . According to certain aspects primary data is an initial or first e.g. created before any other copies or before at least one other copy stored copy of data generated by the source application . Primary data in some cases is created substantially directly from data generated by the corresponding source applications .

The primary storage devices storing the primary data may be relatively fast and or expensive technology e.g. a disk drive a hard disk array solid state memory etc. . In addition primary data may be highly changeable and or may be intended for relatively short term retention e.g. hours days or weeks .

According to some embodiments the client computing device can access primary data from the primary storage device by making conventional file system calls via the operating system. Primary data may include structured data e.g. database files unstructured data e.g. documents and or semi structured data. Some specific examples are described below with respect to .

It can be useful in performing certain tasks to organize the primary data into units of different granularities. In general primary data can include files directories file system volumes data blocks extents or any other hierarchies or organizations of data objects. As used herein a data object can refer to both 1 any file that is currently addressable by a file system or that was previously addressable by the file system e.g. an archive file and 2 a subset of such a file e.g. a data block .

As will be described in further detail it can also be useful in performing certain functions of the information management system to access and modify metadata within the primary data . Metadata generally includes information about data objects or characteristics associated with the data objects. For simplicity herein it is to be understood that unless expressly stated otherwise any reference to primary data generally also includes its associated metadata but references to the metadata do not include the primary data.

Metadata can include without limitation one or more of the following the data owner e.g. the client or user that generates the data the last modified time e.g. the time of the most recent modification of the data object a data object name e.g. a file name a data object size e.g. a number of bytes of data information about the content e.g. an indication as to the existence of a particular search term user supplied tags to from information for email e.g. an email sender recipient etc. creation date file type e.g. format or application type last accessed time application type e.g. type of application that generated the data object location network e.g. a current past or future location of the data object and network pathways to from the data object geographic location e.g. GPS coordinates frequency of change e.g. a period in which the data object is modified business unit e.g. a group or department that generates manages or is otherwise associated with the data object aging information e.g. a schedule such as a time period in which the data object is migrated to secondary or long term storage boot sectors partition layouts file location within a file folder directory structure user permissions owners groups access control lists ACLs system metadata e.g. registry information combinations of the same or other similar information related to the data object.

In addition to metadata generated by or related to file systems and operating systems some of the applications and or other components of the information management system maintain indices of metadata for data objects e.g. metadata associated with individual email messages. Thus each data object may be associated with corresponding metadata. The use of metadata to perform classification and other functions is described in greater detail below.

Each of the client computing devices are generally associated with and or in communication with one or more of the primary storage devices storing corresponding primary data . A client computing device may be considered to be associated with or in communication with a primary storage device if it is capable of one or more of routing and or storing data e.g. primary data to the particular primary storage device coordinating the routing and or storing of data to the particular primary storage device retrieving data from the particular primary storage device coordinating the retrieval of data from the particular primary storage device and modifying and or deleting data retrieved from the particular primary storage device .

The primary storage devices can include any of the different types of storage devices described above or some other kind of suitable storage device. The primary storage devices may have relatively fast I O times and or are relatively expensive in comparison to the secondary storage devices . For example the information management system may generally regularly access data and metadata stored on primary storage devices whereas data and metadata stored on the secondary storage devices is accessed relatively less frequently.

Primary storage device may be dedicated or shared. In some cases each primary storage device is dedicated to an associated client computing device . For instance a primary storage device in one embodiment is a local disk drive of a corresponding client computing device . In other cases one or more primary storage devices can be shared by multiple client computing devices e.g. via a network such as in a cloud storage implementation. As one example a primary storage device can be a disk array shared by a group of client computing devices such as one of the following types of disk arrays EMC Clariion EMC Symmetrix EMC Celerra Dell EqualLogic IBM XIV NetApp FAS HP EVA and HP 3PAR.

The information management system may also include hosted services not shown which may be hosted in some cases by an entity other than the organization that employs the other components of the information management system . For instance the hosted services may be provided by various online service providers to the organization. Such service providers can provide services including social networking services hosted email services or hosted productivity applications or other hosted applications . Hosted services may include software as a service SaaS platform as a service PaaS application service providers ASPs cloud services or other mechanisms for delivering functionality via a network. As it provides services to users each hosted service may generate additional data and metadata under management of the information management system e.g. as primary data . In some cases the hosted services may be accessed using one of the applications . As an example a hosted mail service may be accessed via browser running on a client computing device . The hosted services may be implemented in a variety of computing environments. In some cases they are implemented in an environment having a similar arrangement to the information management system where various physical and logical components are distributed over a network.

The primary data stored on the primary storage devices may be compromised in some cases such as when an employee deliberately or accidentally deletes or overwrites primary data during their normal course of work. Or the primary storage devices can be damaged lost or otherwise corrupted. For recovery and or regulatory compliance purposes it is therefore useful to generate copies of the primary data . Accordingly the information management system includes one or more secondary storage computing devices and one or more secondary storage devices configured to create and store one or more secondary copies of the primary data and associated metadata. The secondary storage computing devices and the secondary storage devices may sometimes be referred to as a secondary storage subsystem .

Creation of secondary copies can help in search and analysis efforts and meet other information management goals such as restoring data and or metadata if an original version e.g. of primary data is lost e.g. by deletion corruption or disaster allowing point in time recovery complying with regulatory data retention and electronic discovery e discovery requirements reducing utilized storage capacity facilitating organization and search of data improving user access to data files across multiple computing devices and or hosted services and implementing data retention policies.

The client computing devices access or receive primary data and communicate the data e.g. over one or more communication pathways for storage in the secondary storage device s .

A secondary copy can comprise a separate stored copy of application data that is derived from one or more earlier created stored copies e.g. derived from primary data or another secondary copy . Secondary copies can include point in time data and may be intended for relatively long term retention e.g. weeks months or years before some or all of the data is moved to other storage or is discarded.

In some cases a secondary copy is a copy of application data created and stored subsequent to at least one other stored instance e.g. subsequent to corresponding primary data or to another secondary copy in a different storage device than at least one previous stored copy and or remotely from at least one previous stored copy. In some other cases secondary copies can be stored in the same storage device as primary data and or other previously stored copies. For example in one embodiment a disk array capable of performing hardware snapshots stores primary data and creates and stores hardware snapshots of the primary data as secondary copies . Secondary copies may be stored in relatively slow and or low cost storage e.g. magnetic tape . A secondary copy may be stored in a backup or archive format or in some other format different than the native source application format or other primary data format.

In some cases secondary copies are indexed so users can browse and restore at another point in time. After creation of a secondary copy representative of certain primary data a pointer or other location indicia e.g. a stub may be placed in primary data or be otherwise associated with primary data to indicate the current location on the secondary storage device s of secondary copy .

Since an instance of a data object or metadata in primary data may change over time as it is modified by an application or hosted service or the operating system the information management system may create and manage multiple secondary copies of a particular data object or metadata each representing the state of the data object in primary data at a particular point in time. Moreover since an instance of a data object in primary data may eventually be deleted from the primary storage device and the file system the information management system may continue to manage point in time representations of that data object even though the instance in primary data no longer exists.

For virtualized computing devices the operating system and other applications of the client computing device s may execute within or under the management of virtualization software e.g. a VMM and the primary storage device s may comprise a virtual disk created on a physical storage device. The information management system may create secondary copies of the files or other data objects in a virtual disk file and or secondary copies of the entire virtual disk file itself e.g. of an entire .vmdk file .

Secondary copies may be distinguished from corresponding primary data in a variety of ways some of which will now be described. First as discussed secondary copies can be stored in a different format e.g. backup archive or other non native format than primary data . For this or other reasons secondary copies may not be directly useable by the applications of the client computing device e.g. via standard system calls or otherwise without modification processing or other intervention by the information management system .

Secondary copies are also in some embodiments stored on a secondary storage device that is inaccessible to the applications running on the client computing devices and or hosted services . Some secondary copies may be offline copies in that they are not readily available e.g. not mounted to tape or disk . Offline copies can include copies of data that the information management system can access without human intervention e.g. tapes within an automated tape library but not yet mounted in a drive and copies that the information management system can access only with at least some human intervention e.g. tapes located at an offsite storage site .

Creating secondary copies can be a challenging task. For instance there can be hundreds or thousands of client computing devices continually generating large volumes of primary data to be protected. Also there can be significant overhead involved in the creation of secondary copies . Moreover secondary storage devices may be special purpose components and interacting with them can require specialized intelligence.

In some cases the client computing devices interact directly with the secondary storage device to create the secondary copies . However in view of the factors described above this approach can negatively impact the ability of the client computing devices to serve the applications and produce primary data . Further the client computing devices may not be optimized for interaction with the secondary storage devices .

Thus in some embodiments the information management system includes one or more software and or hardware components which generally act as intermediaries between the client computing devices and the secondary storage devices . In addition to off loading certain responsibilities from the client computing devices these intermediate components can provide other benefits. For instance as discussed further below with respect to distributing some of the work involved in creating secondary copies can enhance scalability.

The intermediate components can include one or more secondary storage computing devices as shown in and or one or more media agents which can be software modules operating on corresponding secondary storage computing devices or other appropriate computing devices . Media agents are discussed below e.g. with respect to .

The secondary storage computing device s can comprise any of the computing devices described above without limitation. In some cases the secondary storage computing device s include specialized hardware and or software componentry for interacting with the secondary storage devices .

To create a secondary copy involving the copying of data from the primary storage subsystem to the secondary storage subsystem the client computing device in some embodiments communicates the primary data to be copied or a processed version thereof to the designated secondary storage computing device via the communication pathway . The secondary storage computing device in turn conveys the received data or a processed version thereof to the secondary storage device . In some such configurations the communication pathway between the client computing device and the secondary storage computing device comprises a portion of a LAN WAN or SAN. In other cases at least some client computing devices communicate directly with the secondary storage devices e.g. via Fibre Channel or SCSI connections . In some other cases one or more secondary copies are created from existing secondary copies such as in the case of an auxiliary copy operation described in greater detail below.

Some or all primary data objects are associated with corresponding metadata e.g. Meta which may include file system metadata and or application specific metadata. Stored on the secondary storage device s are secondary copy data objects A C which may include copies of or otherwise represent corresponding primary data objects and metadata.

As shown the secondary copy data objects A C can individually represent more than one primary data object. For example secondary copy data object A represents three separate primary data objects C and C represented as C and C respectively and accompanied by the corresponding metadata Meta Meta and Meta respectively . Moreover as indicated by the prime mark a secondary copy object may store a representation of a primary data object and or metadata differently than the original format e.g. in a compressed encrypted deduplicated or other modified format. Likewise secondary data object B represents primary data objects B and A as B and A respectively and accompanied by corresponding metadata Meta Meta and Meta respectively. Also secondary data object C represents primary data objects A B and A as A B and A respectively accompanied by corresponding metadata Meta Meta and Meta respectively.

The information management system can incorporate a variety of different hardware and software components which can in turn be organized with respect to one another in many different configurations depending on the embodiment. There are critical design choices involved in specifying the functional responsibilities of the components and the role of each component in the information management system . For instance as will be discussed such design choices can impact performance as well as the adaptability of the information management system to data growth or other changing circumstances.

As noted the number of components in the information management system and the amount of data under management can be quite large. Managing the components and data is therefore a significant task and a task that can grow in an often unpredictable fashion as the quantity of components and data scale to meet the needs of the organization. For these and other reasons according to certain embodiments responsibility for controlling the information management system or at least a significant portion of that responsibility is allocated to the storage manager . By distributing control functionality in this manner the storage manager can be adapted independently according to changing circumstances. Moreover a computing device for hosting the storage manager can be selected to best suit the functions of the storage manager . These and other advantages are described in further detail below with respect to .

The storage manager may be a software module or other application which in some embodiments operates in conjunction with one or more associated data structures e.g. a dedicated database e.g. management database . In some embodiments storage manager is a computing device comprising circuitry for executing computer instructions and performs the functions described herein. The storage manager generally initiates performs coordinates and or controls storage and other information management operations performed by the information management system e.g. to protect and control the primary data and secondary copies of data and metadata. In general storage manager may be said to manage information management system which includes managing the constituent components e.g. data agents and media agents etc.

As shown by the dashed arrowed lines in the storage manager may communicate with and or control some or all elements of the information management system such as the data agents and media agents . Thus in certain embodiments control information originates from the storage manager and status reporting is transmitted to storage manager by the various managed components whereas payload data and payload metadata is generally communicated between the data agents and the media agents or otherwise between the client computing device s and the secondary storage computing device s e.g. at the direction of and under the management of the storage manager . Control information can generally include parameters and instructions for carrying out information management operations such as without limitation instructions to perform a task associated with an operation timing information specifying when to initiate a task associated with an operation data path information specifying what components to communicate with or access in carrying out an operation and the like. Payload data on the other hand can include the actual data involved in the storage operation such as content data written to a secondary storage device in a secondary copy operation. Payload metadata can include any of the types of metadata described herein and may be written to a storage device along with the payload content data e.g. in the form of a header .

In other embodiments some information management operations are controlled by other components in the information management system e.g. the media agent s or data agent s instead of or in combination with the storage manager .

According to certain embodiments the storage manager provides one or more of the following functions 

The storage manager may maintain a database or storage manager database or management database of management related data and information management policies . The database may include a management index or index or other data structure that stores logical associations between components of the system user preferences and or profiles e.g. preferences regarding encryption compression or deduplication of primary or secondary copy data preferences regarding the scheduling type or other aspects of primary or secondary copy or other operations mappings of particular information management users or user accounts to certain computing devices or other components etc. management tasks media containerization or other useful data. For example the storage manager may use the index to track logical associations between media agents and secondary storage devices and or movement of data from primary storage devices to secondary storage devices . For instance the index may store data associating a client computing device with a particular media agent and or secondary storage device as specified in an information management policy e.g. a storage policy which is defined in more detail below .

Administrators and other people may be able to configure and initiate certain information management operations on an individual basis. But while this may be acceptable for some recovery operations or other relatively less frequent tasks it is often not workable for implementing on going organization wide data protection and management. Thus the information management system may utilize information management policies for specifying and executing information management operations e.g. on an automated basis . Generally an information management policy can include a data structure or other information source that specifies a set of parameters e.g. criteria and rules associated with storage or other information management operations.

The storage manager database may maintain the information management policies and associated data although the information management policies can be stored in any appropriate location. For instance an information management policy such as a storage policy may be stored as metadata in a media agent database or in a secondary storage device e.g. as an archive copy for use in restore operations or other information management operations depending on the embodiment. Information management policies are described further below.

According to certain embodiments the storage manager database comprises a relational database e.g. an SQL database for tracking metadata such as metadata associated with secondary copy operations e.g. what client computing devices and corresponding data were protected . This and other metadata may additionally be stored in other locations such as at the secondary storage computing devices or on the secondary storage devices allowing data recovery without the use of the storage manager in some cases.

As shown the storage manager may include a jobs agent a user interface and a management agent all of which may be implemented as interconnected software modules or application programs.

The jobs agent in some embodiments initiates controls and or monitors the status of some or all storage or other information management operations previously performed currently being performed or scheduled to be performed by the information management system . For instance the jobs agent may access information management policies to determine when and how to initiate and control secondary copy and other information management operations as will be discussed further.

The user interface may include information processing and display software such as a graphical user interface GUI an application program interface API or other interactive interface s through which users and system processes can retrieve information about the status of information management operations e.g. storage operations or issue instructions to the information management system and its constituent components. Via the user interface users may optionally issue instructions to the components in the information management system regarding performance of storage and recovery operations. For example a user may modify a schedule concerning the number of pending secondary copy operations. As another example a user may employ the GUI to view the status of pending storage operations or to monitor the status of certain components in the information management system e.g. the amount of capacity left in a storage device .

An information management cell or storage operation cell or cell may generally include a logical and or physical grouping of a combination of hardware and software components associated with performing information management operations on electronic data typically one storage manager and at least one client computing device comprising data agent s and at least one media agent . For instance the components shown in may together form an information management cell. Multiple cells may be organized hierarchically. With this configuration cells may inherit properties from hierarchically superior cells or be controlled by other cells in the hierarchy automatically or otherwise . Alternatively in some embodiments cells may inherit or otherwise be associated with information management policies preferences information management metrics or other properties or characteristics according to their relative position in a hierarchy of cells. Cells may also be delineated and or organized hierarchically according to function geography architectural considerations or other factors useful or desirable in performing information management operations. A first cell may represent a geographic segment of an enterprise such as a Chicago office and a second cell may represent a different geographic segment such as a New York office. Other cells may represent departments within a particular office. Where delineated by function a first cell may perform one or more first types of information management operations e.g. one or more first types of secondary or other copies and a second cell may perform one or more second types of information management operations e.g. one or more second types of secondary or other copies .

The storage manager may also track information that permits it to select designate or otherwise identify content indices deduplication databases or similar databases or resources or data sets within its information management cell or another cell to be searched in response to certain queries. Such queries may be entered by the user via interaction with the user interface . In general the management agent allows multiple information management cells to communicate with one another. For example the information management system in some cases may be one information management cell of a network of multiple cells adjacent to one another or otherwise logically related in a WAN or LAN. With this arrangement the cells may be connected to one another through respective management agents .

For instance the management agent can provide the storage manager with the ability to communicate with other components within the information management system and or other cells within a larger information management system via network protocols and application programming interfaces APIs including e.g. HTTP HTTPS FTP REST virtualization software APIs cloud service provider APIs and hosted service provider APIs. Inter cell communication and hierarchy is described in greater detail in e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 7 747 579 and 7 343 453 which are incorporated by reference herein.

As discussed a variety of different types of applications can operate on a given client computing device including operating systems database applications e mail applications and virtual machines just to name a few. And as part of the process of creating and restoring secondary copies the client computing devices may be tasked with processing and preparing the primary data from these various different applications . Moreover the nature of the processing preparation can differ across clients and application types e.g. due to inherent structural and formatting differences among applications .

The one or more data agent s are therefore advantageously configured in some embodiments to assist in the performance of information management operations based on the type of data that is being protected at a client specific and or application specific level.

The data agent may be a software module or component that is generally responsible for managing initiating or otherwise assisting in the performance of information management operations in information management system generally as directed by storage manager . For instance the data agent may take part in performing data storage operations such as the copying archiving migrating and or replicating of primary data stored in the primary storage device s . The data agent may receive control information from the storage manager such as commands to transfer copies of data objects metadata and other payload data to the media agents .

In some embodiments a data agent may be distributed between the client computing device and storage manager and any other intermediate components or may be deployed from a remote location or its functions approximated by a remote process that performs some or all of the functions of data agent . In addition a data agent may perform some functions provided by a media agent or may perform other functions such as encryption and deduplication.

As indicated each data agent may be specialized for a particular application and the system can employ multiple application specific data agents each of which may perform information management operations e.g. perform backup migration and data recovery associated with a different application . For instance different individual data agents may be designed to handle Microsoft Exchange data Lotus Notes data Microsoft Windows file system data Microsoft Active Directory Objects data SQL Server data SharePoint data Oracle database data SAP database data virtual machines and or associated data and other types of data.

A file system data agent for example may handle data files and or other file system information. If a client computing device has two or more types of data a specialized data agent may be used for each data type to copy archive migrate and restore the client computing device data. For example to backup migrate and or restore all of the data on a Microsoft Exchange server the client computing device may use a Microsoft Exchange Mailbox data agent to backup the Exchange mailboxes a Microsoft Exchange Database data agent to backup the Exchange databases a Microsoft Exchange Public Folder data agent to backup the Exchange Public Folders and a Microsoft Windows File System data agent to backup the file system of the client computing device . In such embodiments these specialized data agents may be treated as four separate data agents even though they operate on the same client computing device .

Other embodiments may employ one or more generic data agents that can handle and process data from two or more different applications or that can handle and process multiple data types instead of or in addition to using specialized data agents . For example one generic data agent may be used to back up migrate and restore Microsoft Exchange Mailbox data and Microsoft Exchange Database data while another generic data agent may handle Microsoft Exchange Public Folder data and Microsoft Windows File System data.

Each data agent may be configured to access data and or metadata stored in the primary storage device s associated with the data agent and process the data as appropriate. For example during a secondary copy operation the data agent may arrange or assemble the data and metadata into one or more files having a certain format e.g. a particular backup or archive format before transferring the file s to a media agent or other component. The file s may include a list of files or other metadata. Each data agent can also assist in restoring data or metadata to primary storage devices from a secondary copy . For instance the data agent may operate in conjunction with the storage manager and one or more of the media agents to restore data from secondary storage device s .

As indicated above with respect to off loading certain responsibilities from the client computing devices to intermediate components such as the media agent s can provide a number of benefits including improved client computing device operation faster secondary copy operation performance and enhanced scalability. In one specific example which will be discussed below in further detail the media agent can act as a local cache of copied data and or metadata that it has stored to the secondary storage device s providing improved restore capabilities.

Generally speaking a media agent may be implemented as a software module that manages coordinates and facilitates the transmission of data as directed by the storage manager between a client computing device and one or more secondary storage devices . Whereas the storage manager controls the operation of the information management system the media agent generally provides a portal to secondary storage devices . For instance other components in the system interact with the media agents to gain access to data stored on the secondary storage devices whether it be for the purposes of reading writing modifying or deleting data. Moreover as will be described further media agents can generate and store information relating to characteristics of the stored data and or metadata or can generate and store other types of information that generally provides insight into the contents of the secondary storage devices .

Media agents can comprise separate nodes in the information management system e.g. nodes that are separate from the client computing devices storage manager and or secondary storage devices . In general a node within the information management system can be a logically and or physically separate component and in some cases is a component that is individually addressable or otherwise identifiable. In addition each media agent may operate on a dedicated secondary storage computing device in some cases while in other embodiments a plurality of media agents operate on the same secondary storage computing device .

A media agent and corresponding media agent database may be considered to be associated with a particular secondary storage device if that media agent is capable of one or more of routing and or storing data to the particular secondary storage device coordinating the routing and or storing of data to the particular secondary storage device retrieving data from the particular secondary storage device coordinating the retrieval of data from a particular secondary storage device and modifying and or deleting data retrieved from the particular secondary storage device .

While media agent s are generally associated with one or more secondary storage devices one or more media agents in certain embodiments are physically separate from the secondary storage devices . For instance the media agents may operate on secondary storage computing devices having different housings or packages than the secondary storage devices . In one example a media agent operates on a first server computer and is in communication with a secondary storage device s operating in a separate rack mounted RAID based system.

Where the information management system includes multiple media agents see e.g. a first media agent may provide failover functionality for a second failed media agent . In addition media agents can be dynamically selected for storage operations to provide load balancing. Failover and load balancing are described in greater detail below.

In operation a media agent associated with a particular secondary storage device may instruct the secondary storage device to perform an information management operation. For instance a media agent may instruct a tape library to use a robotic arm or other retrieval means to load or eject a certain storage media and to subsequently archive migrate or retrieve data to or from that media e.g. for the purpose of restoring the data to a client computing device . As another example a secondary storage device may include an array of hard disk drives or solid state drives organized in a RAID configuration and the media agent may forward a logical unit number LUN and other appropriate information to the array which uses the received information to execute the desired storage operation. The media agent may communicate with a secondary storage device via a suitable communications link such as a SCSI or Fiber Channel link.

As shown each media agent may maintain an associated media agent database . The media agent database may be stored in a disk or other storage device not shown that is local to the secondary storage computing device on which the media agent operates. In other cases the media agent database is stored remotely from the secondary storage computing device .

The media agent database can include among other things an index see e.g. which comprises information generated during secondary copy operations and other storage or information management operations. The index provides a media agent or other component with a fast and efficient mechanism for locating secondary copies or other data stored in the secondary storage devices . In some cases the index does not form a part of and is instead separate from the media agent database .

A media agent index or other data structure associated with the particular media agent may include information about the stored data. For instance for each secondary copy the index may include metadata such as a list of the data objects e.g. files subdirectories database objects mailbox objects etc. a path to the secondary copy on the corresponding secondary storage device location information indicating where the data objects are stored in the secondary storage device when the data objects were created or modified etc. Thus the index includes metadata associated with the secondary copies that is readily available for use without having to be first retrieved from the secondary storage device . In yet further embodiments some or all of the information in index may instead or additionally be stored along with the secondary copies of data in a secondary storage device . In some embodiments the secondary storage devices can include sufficient information to perform a bare metal restore where the operating system of a failed client computing device or other restore target is automatically rebuilt as part of a restore operation.

Because the index maintained in the media agent database may operate as a cache it can also be referred to as an index cache. In such cases information stored in the index cache typically comprises data that reflects certain particulars about storage operations that have occurred relatively recently. After some triggering event such as after a certain period of time elapses or the index cache reaches a particular size the index cache may be copied or migrated to a secondary storage device s . This information may need to be retrieved and uploaded back into the index cache or otherwise restored to a media agent to facilitate retrieval of data from the secondary storage device s . In some embodiments the cached information may include format or containerization information related to archives or other files stored on the storage device s . In this manner the index cache allows for accelerated restores.

In some alternative embodiments the media agent generally acts as a coordinator or facilitator of storage operations between client computing devices and corresponding secondary storage devices but does not actually write the data to the secondary storage device . For instance the storage manager or the media agent may instruct a client computing device and secondary storage device to communicate with one another directly. In such a case the client computing device transmits the data directly or via one or more intermediary components to the secondary storage device according to the received instructions and vice versa. In some such cases the media agent may still receive process and or maintain metadata related to the storage operations. Moreover in these embodiments the payload data can flow through the media agent for the purposes of populating the index cache maintained in the media agent database but not for writing to the secondary storage device .

The media agent and or other components such as the storage manager may in some cases incorporate additional functionality such as data classification content indexing deduplication encryption compression and the like. Further details regarding these and other functions are described below.

As described certain functions of the information management system can be distributed amongst various physical and or logical components in the system. For instance one or more of the storage manager data agents and media agents may operate on computing devices that are physically separate from one another. This architecture can provide a number of benefits.

For instance hardware and software design choices for each distributed component can be targeted to suit its particular function. The secondary computing devices on which the media agents operate can be tailored for interaction with associated secondary storage devices and provide fast index cache operation among other specific tasks. Similarly the client computing device s can be selected to effectively service the applications thereon in order to efficiently produce and store primary data .

Moreover in some cases one or more of the individual components in the information management system can be distributed to multiple separate computing devices. As one example for large file systems where the amount of data stored in the management database is relatively large the database may be migrated to or otherwise reside on a specialized database server e.g. an SQL server separate from a server that implements the other functions of the storage manager . This distributed configuration can provide added protection because the database can be protected with standard database utilities e.g. SQL log shipping or database replication independent from other functions of the storage manager . The database can be efficiently replicated to a remote site for use in the event of a disaster or other data loss at the primary site. Or the database can be replicated to another computing device within the same site such as to a higher performance machine in the event that a storage manager host device can no longer service the needs of a growing information management system .

The distributed architecture also provides both scalability and efficient component utilization. shows an embodiment of the information management system including a plurality of client computing devices and associated data agents as well as a plurality of secondary storage computing devices and associated media agents .

Additional components can be added or subtracted based on the evolving needs of the information management system . For instance depending on where bottlenecks are identified administrators can add additional client computing devices secondary storage computing devices and corresponding media agents and or secondary storage devices . Moreover where multiple fungible components are available load balancing can be implemented to dynamically address identified bottlenecks. As an example the storage manager may dynamically select which media agents and or secondary storage devices to use for storage operations based on a processing load analysis of the media agents and or secondary storage devices respectively.

Moreover each client computing device in some embodiments can communicate with among other components any of the media agents e.g. as directed by the storage manager . And each media agent may be able to communicate with among other components any of the secondary storage devices e.g. as directed by the storage manager . Thus operations can be routed to the secondary storage devices in a dynamic and highly flexible manner to provide load balancing failover and the like. Further examples of scalable systems capable of dynamic storage operations and of systems capable of performing load balancing and fail over are provided in U.S. Pat. No. 7 246 207 which is incorporated by reference herein.

In alternative configurations certain components are not distributed and may instead reside and execute on the same computing device. For example in some embodiments one or more data agents and the storage manager operate on the same client computing device . In another embodiment one or more data agents and one or more media agents operate on a single computing device.

In order to protect and leverage stored data the information management system can be configured to perform a variety of information management operations. As will be described these operations can generally include secondary copy and other data movement operations processing and data manipulation operations analysis reporting and management operations. The operations described herein may be performed on any type of computing device e.g. between two computers connected via a LAN to a mobile client telecommunications device connected to a server via a WLAN to any manner of client computing device coupled to a cloud storage target etc. without limitation.

Data movement operations according to certain embodiments are generally operations that involve the copying or migration of data e.g. payload data between different locations in the information management system in an original native and or one or more different formats. For example data movement operations can include operations in which stored data is copied migrated or otherwise transferred from one or more first storage devices to one or more second storage devices such as from primary storage device s to secondary storage device s from secondary storage device s to different secondary storage device s from secondary storage devices to primary storage devices or from primary storage device s to different primary storage device s .

Data movement operations can include by way of example backup operations archive operations information lifecycle management operations such as hierarchical storage management operations replication operations e.g. continuous data replication operations snapshot operations deduplication or single instancing operations auxiliary copy operations and the like. As will be discussed some of these operations involve the copying migration or other movement of data without actually creating multiple distinct copies. Nonetheless some or all of these operations are referred to as copy operations for simplicity.

A backup operation creates a copy of a version of data e.g. one or more files or other data units in primary data at a particular point in time. Each subsequent backup copy may be maintained independently of the first. Further a backup copy in some embodiments is generally stored in a form that is different than the native format e.g. a backup format. This can be in contrast to the version in primary data from which the backup copy is derived and which may instead be stored in a native format of the source application s . In various cases backup copies can be stored in a format in which the data is compressed encrypted deduplicated and or otherwise modified from the original application format. For example a backup copy may be stored in a backup format that facilitates compression and or efficient long term storage.

Backup copies can have relatively long retention periods as compared to primary data and may be stored on media with slower retrieval times than primary data and certain other types of secondary copies . On the other hand backups may have relatively shorter retention periods than some other types of secondary copies such as archive copies described below . Backups may sometimes be stored at on offsite location.

Backup operations can include full backups differential backups incremental backups synthetic full backups and or creating a reference copy. A full backup or standard full backup in some embodiments is generally a complete image of the data to be protected. However because full backup copies can consume a relatively large amount of storage it can be useful to use a full backup copy as a baseline and only store changes relative to the full backup copy for subsequent backup copies.

For instance a differential backup operation or cumulative incremental backup operation tracks and stores changes that have occurred since the last full backup. Differential backups can grow quickly in size but can provide relatively efficient restore times because a restore can be completed in some cases using only the full backup copy and the latest differential copy.

An incremental backup operation generally tracks and stores changes since the most recent backup copy of any type which can greatly reduce storage utilization. In some cases however restore times can be relatively long in comparison to full or differential backups because completing a restore operation may involve accessing a full backup in addition to multiple incremental backups.

Synthetic full backups generally consolidate data without directly backing up data from the client computing device. A synthetic full backup is created from the most recent full backup i.e. standard or synthetic and subsequent incremental and or differential backups. The resulting synthetic full backup is identical to what would have been created had the last backup for the subclient been a standard full backup. Unlike standard full incremental and differential backups a synthetic full backup does not actually transfer data from a client computer to the backup media because it operates as a backup consolidator. A synthetic full backup extracts the index data of each participating subclient. Using this index data and the previously backed up user data images it builds new full backup images one for each subclient. The new backup images consolidate the index and user data stored in the related incremental differential and previous full backups in some embodiments creating an archive file at the subclient level.

Any of the above types of backup operations can be at the volume level file level or block level. Volume level backup operations generally involve the copying of a data volume e.g. a logical disk or partition as a whole. In a file level backup the information management system may generally track changes to individual files and includes copies of files in the backup copy. In the case of a block level backup files are broken into constituent blocks and changes are tracked at the block level. Upon restore the information management system reassembles the blocks into files in a transparent fashion.

Far less data may actually be transferred and copied to the secondary storage devices during a file level copy than a volume level copy. Likewise a block level copy may involve the transfer of less data than a file level copy resulting in faster execution times. However restoring a relatively higher granularity copy can result in longer restore times. For instance when restoring a block level copy the process of locating constituent blocks can sometimes result in longer restore times as compared to file level backups. Similar to backup operations the other types of secondary copy operations described herein can also be implemented at either the volume level file level or block level.

For example in some embodiments a reference copy may comprise copy ies of selected objects from backed up data typically to help organize data by keeping contextual information from multiple sources together and or help retain specific data for a longer period of time such as for legal hold needs. A reference copy generally maintains data integrity and when the data is restored it may be viewed in the same format as the source data. In some embodiments a reference copy is based on a specialized client individual subclient and associated information management policies e.g. storage policy retention policy etc. that are administered within information management system .

Because backup operations generally involve maintaining a version of the copied data in primary data and also maintaining backup copies in secondary storage device s they can consume significant storage capacity. To help reduce storage consumption an archive operation according to certain embodiments creates a secondary copy by both copying and removing source data. Or seen another way archive operations can involve moving some or all of the source data to the archive destination. Thus data satisfying criteria for removal e.g. data of a threshold age or size may be removed from source storage. The source data may be primary data or a secondary copy depending on the situation. As with backup copies archive copies can be stored in a format in which the data is compressed encrypted deduplicated and or otherwise modified from the format of the original application or source copy. In addition archive copies may be retained for relatively long periods of time e.g. years and in some cases are never deleted. Archive copies are generally retained for longer periods of time than backup copies for example. In certain embodiments archive copies may be made and kept for extended periods in order to meet compliance regulations.

Moreover when primary data is archived in some cases the corresponding primary data or a portion thereof is deleted when creating the archive copy. Thus archiving can serve the purpose of freeing up space in the primary storage device s and easing the demand on computational resources on client computing device . Similarly when a secondary copy is archived the secondary copy may be deleted and an archive copy can therefore serve the purpose of freeing up space in secondary storage device s . In contrast source copies often remain intact when creating backup copies. Examples of compatible data archiving operations are provided in U.S. Pat. No. 7 107 298 which is incorporated by reference herein.

Snapshot operations can provide a relatively lightweight efficient mechanism for protecting data. From an end user viewpoint a snapshot may be thought of as an instant image of the primary data at a given point in time and may include state and or status information relative to an application that creates manages the primary data. In one embodiment a snapshot may generally capture the directory structure of an object in primary data such as a file or volume or other data set at a particular moment in time and may also preserve file attributes and contents. A snapshot in some cases is created relatively quickly e.g. substantially instantly using a minimum amount of file space but may still function as a conventional file system backup.

A hardware snapshot or hardware based snapshot operation can be a snapshot operation where a target storage device e.g. a primary storage device or a secondary storage device performs the snapshot operation in a self contained fashion substantially independently using hardware firmware and or software operating on the storage device itself. For instance the storage device may be capable of performing snapshot operations upon request generally without intervention or oversight from any of the other components in the information management system . In this manner hardware snapshots can off load other components of information management system from processing involved in snapshot creation and management.

A software snapshot or software based snapshot operation on the other hand can be a snapshot operation in which one or more other components in information management system e.g. client computing devices data agents etc. implement a software layer that manages the snapshot operation via interaction with the target storage device. For instance the component executing the snapshot management software layer may derive a set of pointers and or data that represents the snapshot. The snapshot management software layer may then transmit the same to the target storage device along with appropriate instructions for writing the snapshot.

Some types of snapshots do not actually create another physical copy of all the data as it existed at the particular point in time but may simply create pointers that are able to map files and directories to specific memory locations e.g. to specific disk blocks where the data resides as it existed at the particular point in time. For example a snapshot copy may include a set of pointers derived from the file system or from an application. In some other cases the snapshot may be created at the block level such that creation of the snapshot occurs without awareness of the file system. Each pointer points to a respective stored data block so that collectively the set of pointers reflect the storage location and state of the data object e.g. file s or volume s or data set s at a particular point in time when the snapshot copy was created.

An initial snapshot may use only a small amount of disk space needed to record a mapping or other data structure representing or otherwise tracking the blocks that correspond to the current state of the file system. Additional disk space is usually required only when files and directories are modified later on. Furthermore when files are modified typically only the pointers which map to blocks are copied not the blocks themselves. In some embodiments for example in the case of copy on write snapshots when a block changes in primary storage the block is copied to secondary storage or cached in primary storage before the block is overwritten in primary storage and the pointer to that block changed to reflect the new location of that block. The snapshot mapping of file system data may also be updated to reflect the changed block s at that particular point in time. In some other cases a snapshot includes a full physical copy of all or substantially all of the data represented by the snapshot. Further examples of snapshot operations are provided in U.S. Pat. No. 7 529 782 which is incorporated by reference herein.

A snapshot copy in many cases can be made quickly and without significantly impacting primary computing resources because large amounts of data need not be copied or moved. In some embodiments a snapshot may exist as a virtual file system parallel to the actual file system. Users in some cases gain read only access to the record of files and directories of the snapshot. By electing to restore primary data from a snapshot taken at a given point in time users may also return the current file system to the state of the file system that existed when the snapshot was taken.

Another type of secondary copy operation is a replication operation. Some types of secondary copies are used to periodically capture images of primary data at particular points in time e.g. backups archives and snapshots . However it can also be useful for recovery purposes to protect primary data in a more continuous fashion by replicating the primary data substantially as changes occur. In some cases a replication copy can be a mirror copy for instance where changes made to primary data are mirrored or substantially immediately copied to another location e.g. to secondary storage device s . By copying each write operation to the replication copy two storage systems are kept synchronized or substantially synchronized so that they are virtually identical at approximately the same time. Where entire disk volumes are mirrored however mirroring can require significant amount of storage space and utilizes a large amount of processing resources.

According to some embodiments storage operations are performed on replicated data that represents a recoverable state or known good state of a particular application running on the source system. For instance in certain embodiments known good replication copies may be viewed as copies of primary data . This feature allows the system to directly access copy restore backup or otherwise manipulate the replication copies as if the data were the live primary data . This can reduce access time storage utilization and impact on source applications among other benefits. Based on known good state information the information management system can replicate sections of application data that represent a recoverable state rather than rote copying of blocks of data. Examples of compatible replication operations e.g. continuous data replication are provided in U.S. Pat. No. 7 617 262 which is incorporated by reference herein.

Another type of data movement operation is deduplication or single instance storage which is useful to reduce the amount of non primary data. For instance some or all of the above described secondary storage operations can involve deduplication in some fashion. New data is read broken down into portions e.g. sub file level blocks files etc. of a selected granularity compared with blocks that are already in secondary storage and only the new blocks are stored. Blocks that already exist are represented as pointers to the already stored data.

In order to streamline the comparison process the information management system may calculate and or store signatures e.g. hashes or cryptographically unique IDs corresponding to the individual data blocks in a database and compare the signatures instead of comparing entire data blocks. In some cases only a single instance of each element is stored and deduplication operations may therefore be referred to interchangeably as single instancing operations. Depending on the implementation however deduplication or single instancing operations can store more than one instance of certain data blocks but nonetheless significantly reduce data redundancy. Depending on the embodiment deduplication blocks can be of fixed or variable length. Using variable length blocks can provide enhanced deduplication by responding to changes in the data stream but can involve complex processing. In some cases the information management system utilizes a technique for dynamically aligning deduplication blocks e.g. fixed length blocks based on changing content in the data stream as described in U.S. Pat. No. 8 364 652 which is incorporated by reference herein.

The information management system can perform deduplication in a variety of manners at a variety of locations in the information management system . For instance in some embodiments the information management system implements target side deduplication by deduplicating data e.g. secondary copies stored in the secondary storage devices . In some such cases the media agents are generally configured to manage the deduplication process. For instance one or more of the media agents maintain a corresponding deduplication database that stores deduplication information e.g. datablock signatures . Examples of such a configuration are provided in U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2012 0150826 which is incorporated by reference herein. Instead of or in combination with target side deduplication deduplication can also be performed on the source side or client side e.g. to reduce the amount of traffic between the media agents and the client computing device s and or reduce redundant data stored in the primary storage devices . According to various implementations one or more of the storage devices of the target side and or source side of an operation can be cloud based storage devices. Thus the target side and or source side deduplication can be cloud based deduplication. In particular as discussed previously the storage manager may communicate with other components within the information management system via network protocols and cloud service provider APIs to facilitate cloud based deduplication single instancing. Examples of such deduplication techniques are provided in U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2012 0150818 which is incorporated by reference herein. Some other compatible deduplication single instancing techniques are described in U.S. Pat. Pub. Nos. 2006 0224846 and 2009 0319534 which are incorporated by reference herein.

In some embodiments files and other data over their lifetime move from more expensive quick access storage to less expensive slower access storage. Operations associated with moving data through various tiers of storage are sometimes referred to as information lifecycle management ILM operations.

One type of ILM operation is a hierarchical storage management HSM operation. A HSM operation is generally an operation for automatically moving data between classes of storage devices such as between high cost and low cost storage devices. For instance an HSM operation may involve movement of data from primary storage devices to secondary storage devices or between tiers of secondary storage devices . With each tier the storage devices may be progressively relatively cheaper have relatively slower access restore times etc. For example movement of data between tiers may occur as data becomes less important over time.

In some embodiments an HSM operation is similar to an archive operation in that creating an HSM copy may though not always involve deleting some of the source data e.g. according to one or more criteria related to the source data. For example an HSM copy may include data from primary data or a secondary copy that is larger than a given size threshold or older than a given age threshold and that is stored in a backup format.

Often and unlike some types of archive copies HSM data that is removed or aged from the source is replaced by a logical reference pointer or stub. The reference pointer or stub can be stored in the primary storage device or other source storage device such as a secondary storage device to replace the deleted source data and to point to or otherwise indicate the new location in a secondary storage device .

According to one example files are generally moved between higher and lower cost storage depending on how often the files are accessed. When a user requests access to the HSM data that has been removed or migrated the information management system uses the stub to locate the data and may make recovery of the data appear transparent even though the HSM data may be stored at a location different from other source data. In this manner the data appears to the user e.g. in file system browsing windows and the like as if it still resides in the source location e.g. in a primary storage device . The stub may also include some metadata associated with the corresponding data so that a file system and or application can provide some information about the data object and or a limited functionality version e.g. a preview of the data object.

An HSM copy may be stored in a format other than the native application format e.g. where the data is compressed encrypted deduplicated and or otherwise modified from the original native application format . In some cases copies which involve the removal of data from source storage and the maintenance of stub or other logical reference information on source storage may be referred to generally as on line archive copies . On the other hand copies which involve the removal of data from source storage without the maintenance of stub or other logical reference information on source storage may be referred to as off line archive copies . Examples of HSM and ILM techniques are provided in U.S. Pat. No. 7 343 453 which is incorporated by reference herein.

An auxiliary copy is generally a copy operation in which a copy is created of an existing secondary copy . For instance an initial secondary copy may be generated using or otherwise be derived from primary data or other data residing in the secondary storage subsystem whereas an auxiliary copy is generated from the initial secondary copy . Auxiliary copies can be used to create additional standby copies of data and may reside on different secondary storage devices than the initial secondary copies . Thus auxiliary copies can be used for recovery purposes if initial secondary copies become unavailable. Exemplary compatible auxiliary copy techniques are described in further detail in U.S. Pat. No. 8 230 195 which is incorporated by reference herein.

The information management system may also perform disaster recovery operations that make or retain disaster recovery copies often as secondary high availability disk copies. The information management system may create secondary disk copies and store the copies at disaster recovery locations using auxiliary copy or replication operations such as continuous data replication technologies. Depending on the particular data protection goals disaster recovery locations can be remote from the client computing devices and primary storage devices remote from some or all of the secondary storage devices or both.

Data analysis reporting and management operations can be different than data movement operations in that they do not necessarily involve the copying migration or other transfer of data e.g. primary data or secondary copies between different locations in the system. For instance data analysis operations may involve processing e.g. offline processing or modification of already stored primary data and or secondary copies . However in some embodiments data analysis operations are performed in conjunction with data movement operations. Some data analysis operations include content indexing operations and classification operations which can be useful in leveraging the data under management to provide enhanced search and other features. Other data analysis operations such as compression and encryption can provide data reduction and security benefits respectively.

In some embodiments the information management system analyzes and indexes characteristics content and metadata associated with the primary data and or secondary copies . The content indexing can be used to identify files or other data objects having pre defined content e.g. user defined keywords or phrases other keywords phrases that are not defined by a user etc. and or metadata e.g. email metadata such as to from cc bcc attachment name received time etc. .

The information management system generally organizes and catalogues the results in a content index which may be stored within the media agent database for example. The content index can also include the storage locations of or pointer references to the indexed data in the primary data or secondary copies as appropriate. The results may also be stored in the form of a content index database or otherwise elsewhere in the information management system e.g. in the primary storage devices or in the secondary storage device . Such index data provides the storage manager or another component with an efficient mechanism for locating primary data and or secondary copies of data objects that match particular criteria.

For instance search criteria can be specified by a user through user interface of the storage manager . In some cases the information management system analyzes data and or metadata in secondary copies to create an off line content index without significantly impacting the performance of the client computing devices . Depending on the embodiment the system can also implement on line content indexing e.g. of primary data . Examples of compatible content indexing techniques are provided in U.S. Pat. No. 8 170 995 which is incorporated by reference herein.

One or more components can be configured to scan data and or associated metadata for classification purposes to populate a database or other data structure of information which can be referred to as a data classification database or a metabase . Depending on the embodiment the data classification database s can be organized in a variety of different ways including centralization logical sub divisions and or physical sub divisions. For instance one or more centralized data classification databases may be associated with different subsystems or tiers within the information management system . As an example there may be a first centralized metabase associated with the primary storage subsystem and a second centralized metabase associated with the secondary storage subsystem . In other cases there may be one or more metabases associated with individual components e.g. client computing devices and or media agents . In some embodiments a data classification database metabase may reside as one or more data structures within management database or may be otherwise associated with storage manager .

In some cases the metabase s may be included in separate database s and or on separate storage device s from primary data and or secondary copies such that operations related to the metabase do not significantly impact performance on other components in the information management system . In other cases the metabase s may be stored along with primary data and or secondary copies . Files or other data objects can be associated with identifiers e.g. tag entries etc. in the media agent or other indices to facilitate searches of stored data objects. Among a number of other benefits the metabase can also allow efficient automatic identification of files or other data objects to associate with secondary copy or other information management operations e.g. in lieu of scanning an entire file system . Examples of compatible metabases and data classification operations are provided in U.S. Pat. Nos. 8 229 954 and 7 747 579 which are incorporated by reference herein.

The information management system in some cases is configured to process data e.g. files or other data objects secondary copies etc. according to an appropriate encryption algorithm e.g. Blowfish Advanced Encryption Standard AES Triple Data Encryption Standard 3 DES etc. to limit access and provide data security in the information management system . The information management system in some cases encrypts the data at the client level such that the client computing devices e.g. the data agents encrypt the data prior to forwarding the data to other components e.g. before sending the data to media agents during a secondary copy operation. In such cases the client computing device may maintain or have access to an encryption key or passphrase for decrypting the data upon restore. Encryption can also occur when creating copies of secondary copies e.g. when creating auxiliary copies or archive copies. In yet further embodiments the secondary storage devices can implement built in high performance hardware encryption.

Certain embodiments leverage the integrated ubiquitous nature of the information management system to provide useful system wide management and reporting functions. Examples of some compatible management and reporting techniques are provided in U.S. Pat. No. 7 343 453 which is incorporated by reference herein.

Operations management can generally include monitoring and managing the health and performance of information management system by without limitation performing error tracking generating granular storage performance metrics e.g. job success failure information deduplication efficiency etc. generating storage modeling and costing information and the like. As an example a storage manager or other component in the information management system may analyze traffic patterns and suggest and or automatically route data via a particular route to minimize congestion. In some embodiments the system can generate predictions relating to storage operations or storage operation information. Such predictions which may be based on a trending analysis may predict various network operations or resource usage such as network traffic levels storage media use use of bandwidth of communication links use of media agent components etc. Further examples of traffic analysis trend analysis prediction generation and the like are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 343 453 which is incorporated by reference herein.

In some configurations a master storage manager may track the status of storage operation cells in a hierarchy such as the status of jobs system components system resources and other items by communicating with storage managers or other components in the respective storage operation cells. Moreover the master storage manager may track the status of its associated storage operation cells and information management operations by receiving periodic status updates from the storage managers or other components in the respective cells regarding jobs system components system resources and other items. In some embodiments a master storage manager may store status information and other information regarding its associated storage operation cells and other system information in its index or other location .

The master storage manager or other component may also determine whether certain storage related criteria or other criteria are satisfied and perform an action or trigger event e.g. data migration in response to the criteria being satisfied such as where a storage threshold is met for a particular volume or where inadequate protection exists for certain data. For instance in some embodiments data from one or more storage operation cells is used to dynamically and automatically mitigate recognized risks and or to advise users of risks or suggest actions to mitigate these risks. For example an information management policy may specify certain requirements e.g. that a storage device should maintain a certain amount of free space that secondary copies should occur at a particular interval that data should be aged and migrated to other storage after a particular period that data on a secondary volume should always have a certain level of availability and be restorable within a given time period that data on a secondary volume may be mirrored or otherwise migrated to a specified number of other volumes etc. . If a risk condition or other criterion is triggered the system may notify the user of these conditions and may suggest or automatically implement an action to mitigate or otherwise address the risk. For example the system may indicate that data from a primary copy should be migrated to a secondary storage device to free space on the primary storage device . Examples of the use of risk factors and other triggering criteria are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 343 453 which is incorporated by reference herein.

In some embodiments the system may also determine whether a metric or other indication satisfies particular storage criteria and if so perform an action. For example as previously described a storage policy or other definition might indicate that a storage manager should initiate a particular action if a storage metric or other indication drops below or otherwise fails to satisfy specified criteria such as a threshold of data protection. Examples of such metrics are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 343 453 which is incorporated by reference herein.

In some embodiments risk factors may be quantified into certain measurable service or risk levels for ease of comprehension. For example certain applications and associated data may be considered to be more important by an enterprise than other data and services. Financial compliance data for example may be of greater importance than marketing materials etc. Network administrators may assign priority values or weights to certain data and or applications corresponding to the relative importance. The level of compliance of storage operations specified for these applications may also be assigned a certain value. Thus the health impact and overall importance of a service may be determined such as by measuring the compliance value and calculating the product of the priority value and the compliance value to determine the service level and comparing it to certain operational thresholds to determine whether it is acceptable. Further examples of the service level determination are provided in U.S. Pat. No. 7 343 453 which is incorporated by reference herein.

The system may additionally calculate data costing and data availability associated with information management operation cells according to an embodiment of the invention. For instance data received from the cell may be used in conjunction with hardware related information and other information about system elements to determine the cost of storage and or the availability of particular data in the system. Exemplary information generated could include how fast a particular department is using up available storage space how long data would take to recover over a particular system pathway from a particular secondary storage device costs over time etc. Moreover in some embodiments such information may be used to determine or predict the overall cost associated with the storage of certain information. The cost associated with hosting a certain application may be based at least in part on the type of media on which the data resides for example. Storage devices may be assigned to a particular cost categories for example. Further examples of costing techniques are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 343 453 which is incorporated by reference herein.

Any of the above types of information e.g. information related to trending predictions job cell or component status risk service level costing etc. can generally be provided to users via the user interface in a single integrated view or console not shown . The console may support a reporting capability that allows for the generation of a variety of reports which may be tailored to a particular aspect of information management. Report types may include scheduling event management media management and data aging. Available reports may also include backup history data aging history auxiliary copy history job history library and drive media in library restore history and storage policy etc. without limitation. Such reports may be specified and created at a certain point in time as a system analysis forecasting or provisioning tool. Integrated reports may also be generated that illustrate storage and performance metrics risks and storage costing information. Moreover users may create their own reports based on specific needs.

The integrated user interface can include an option to show a virtual view of the system that graphically depicts the various components in the system using appropriate icons. As one example the user interface may provide a graphical depiction of one or more primary storage devices the secondary storage devices data agents and or media agents and their relationship to one another in the information management system . The operations management functionality can facilitate planning and decision making. For example in some embodiments a user may view the status of some or all jobs as well as the status of each component of the information management system . Users may then plan and make decisions based on this data. For instance a user may view high level information regarding storage operations for the information management system such as job status component status resource status e.g. communication pathways etc. and other information. The user may also drill down or use other means to obtain more detailed information regarding a particular component job or the like. Further examples of some reporting techniques and associated interfaces providing an integrated view of an information management system are provided in U.S. Pat. No. 7 343 453 which is incorporated by reference herein.

The information management system can also be configured to perform system wide e discovery operations in some embodiments. In general e discovery operations provide a unified collection and search capability for data in the system such as data stored in the secondary storage devices e.g. backups archives or other secondary copies . For example the information management system may construct and maintain a virtual repository for data stored in the information management system that is integrated across source applications different storage device types etc. According to some embodiments e discovery utilizes other techniques described herein such as data classification and or content indexing.

As indicated previously an information management policy can include a data structure or other information source that specifies a set of parameters e.g. criteria and rules associated with secondary copy and or other information management operations.

One type of information management policy is a storage policy. According to certain embodiments a storage policy generally comprises a data structure or other information source that defines or includes information sufficient to determine a set of preferences or other criteria for performing information management operations. Storage policies can include one or more of the following items 1 what data will be associated with the storage policy 2 a destination to which the data will be stored 3 datapath information specifying how the data will be communicated to the destination 4 the type of storage operation to be performed and 5 retention information specifying how long the data will be retained at the destination see e.g. .

As an illustrative example data associated with a storage policy can be logically organized into groups. In some cases these logical groupings can be referred to as sub clients . A sub client may represent static or dynamic associations of portions of a data volume. Sub clients may represent mutually exclusive portions. Thus in certain embodiments a portion of data may be given a label and the association is stored as a static entity in an index database or other storage location. Sub clients may also be used as an effective administrative scheme of organizing data according to data type department within the enterprise storage preferences or the like. Depending on the configuration sub clients can correspond to files folders virtual machines databases etc. In one exemplary scenario an administrator may find it preferable to separate e mail data from financial data using two different sub clients.

A storage policy can define where data is stored by specifying a target or destination storage device or group of storage devices . For instance where the secondary storage device includes a group of disk libraries the storage policy may specify a particular disk library for storing the sub clients associated with the policy. As another example where the secondary storage devices include one or more tape libraries the storage policy may specify a particular tape library for storing the sub clients associated with the storage policy and may also specify a drive pool and a tape pool defining a group of tape drives and a group of tapes respectively for use in storing the sub client data. While information in the storage policy can be statically assigned in some cases some or all of the information in the storage policy can also be dynamically determined based on criteria which can be set forth in the storage policy. For instance based on such criteria a particular destination storage device s or other parameter of the storage policy may be determined based on characteristics associated with the data involved in a particular storage operation device availability e.g. availability of a secondary storage device or a media agent network status and conditions e.g. identified bottlenecks user credentials and the like .

Datapath information can also be included in the storage policy. For instance the storage policy may specify network pathways and components to utilize when moving the data to the destination storage device s . In some embodiments the storage policy specifies one or more media agents for conveying data associated with the storage policy between the source e.g. one or more host client computing devices and destination e.g. a particular target secondary storage device .

A storage policy can also specify the type s of operations associated with the storage policy such as a backup archive snapshot auxiliary copy or the like. Retention information can specify how long the data will be kept depending on organizational needs e.g. a number of days months years etc. 

Another type of information management policy is a scheduling policy which specifies when and how often to perform operations. Scheduling parameters may specify with what frequency e.g. hourly weekly daily event based etc. or under what triggering conditions secondary copy or other information management operations will take place. Scheduling policies in some cases are associated with particular components such as particular logical groupings of data associated with a storage policy e.g. a sub client client computing device and the like. In one configuration a separate scheduling policy is maintained for particular logical groupings of data on a client computing device . The scheduling policy specifies that those logical groupings are to be moved to secondary storage devices every hour according to storage policies associated with the respective sub clients.

When adding a new client computing device administrators can manually configure information management policies and or other settings e.g. via the user interface . However this can be an involved process resulting in delays and it may be desirable to begin data protection operations quickly without awaiting human intervention. Thus in some embodiments the information management system automatically applies a default configuration to client computing device . As one example when one or more data agent s are installed on one or more client computing devices the installation script may register the client computing device with the storage manager which in turn applies the default configuration to the new client computing device . In this manner data protection operations can begin substantially immediately. The default configuration can include a default storage policy for example and can specify any appropriate information sufficient to begin data protection operations. This can include a type of data protection operation scheduling information a target secondary storage device data path information e.g. a particular media agent and the like.

Other types of information management policies are possible including one or more audit or security policies. An audit policy is a set of preferences rules and or criteria that protect sensitive data in the information management system . For example an audit policy may define sensitive objects as files or objects that contain particular keywords e.g. confidential or privileged and or are associated with particular keywords e.g. in metadata or particular flags e.g. in metadata identifying a document or email as personal confidential etc. . An audit policy may further specify rules for handling sensitive objects. As an example an audit policy may require that a reviewer approve the transfer of any sensitive objects to a cloud storage site and that if approval is denied for a particular sensitive object the sensitive object should be transferred to a local primary storage device instead. To facilitate this approval the audit policy may further specify how a secondary storage computing device or other system component should notify a reviewer that a sensitive object is slated for transfer.

Another type of information management policy is a provisioning policy. A provisioning policy can include a set of preferences priorities rules and or criteria that specify how client computing devices or groups thereof may utilize system resources such as available storage on cloud storage and or network bandwidth. A provisioning policy specifies for example data quotas for particular client computing devices e.g. a number of gigabytes that can be stored monthly quarterly or annually . The storage manager or other components may enforce the provisioning policy. For instance the media agents may enforce the policy when transferring data to secondary storage devices . If a client computing device exceeds a quota a budget for the client computing device or associated department is adjusted accordingly or an alert may trigger.

While the above types of information management policies have been described as separate policies one or more of these can be generally combined into a single information management policy . For instance a storage policy may also include or otherwise be associated with one or more scheduling audit or provisioning policies or operational parameters thereof. Moreover while storage policies are typically associated with moving and storing data other policies may be associated with other types of information management operations. The following is a non exhaustive list of items the information management policies may specify 

Policies can additionally specify or depend on a variety of historical or current criteria that may be used to determine which rules to apply to a particular data object system component or information management operation such as 

As indicated by the dashed box the second media agent B and the tape library B are off site and may therefore be remotely located from the other components in the information management system e.g. in a different city office building etc. . Indeed off site may refer to a magnetic tape located in storage which must be manually retrieved and loaded into a tape drive to be read. In this manner information stored on the tape library B may provide protection in the event of a disaster or other failure.

The file system sub client and its associated primary data A in certain embodiments generally comprise information generated by the file system and or operating system of the client computing device and can include for example file system data e.g. regular files file tables mount points etc. operating system data e.g. registries event logs etc. and the like. The e mail sub client on the other hand and its associated primary data B include data generated by an e mail application operating on the client computing device and can include mailbox information folder information emails attachments associated database information and the like. As described above the sub clients can be logical containers and the data included in the corresponding primary data A B may or may not be stored contiguously.

The exemplary storage policy A includes backup copy preferences or rule set disaster recovery copy preferences rule set and compliance copy preferences or rule set . The backup copy rule set specifies that it is associated with a file system sub client and an email sub client . Each of these sub clients are associated with the particular client computing device . The backup copy rule set further specifies that the backup operation will be written to the disk library A and designates a particular media agent A to convey the data to the disk library A. Finally the backup copy rule set specifies that backup copies created according to the rule set are scheduled to be generated on an hourly basis and to be retained for 30 days. In some other embodiments scheduling information is not included in the storage policy A and is instead specified by a separate scheduling policy.

The disaster recovery copy rule set is associated with the same two sub clients . However the disaster recovery copy rule set is associated with the tape library B unlike the backup copy rule set . Moreover the disaster recovery copy rule set specifies that a different media agent namely B will be used to convey the data to the tape library B. As indicated disaster recovery copies created according to the rule set will be retained for 60 days and will be generated on a daily basis. Disaster recovery copies generated according to the disaster recovery copy rule set can provide protection in the event of a disaster or other catastrophic data loss that would affect the backup copy A maintained on the disk library A.

The compliance copy rule set is only associated with the email sub client and not the file system sub client . Compliance copies generated according to the compliance copy rule set will therefore not include primary data A from the file system sub client . For instance the organization may be under an obligation to store and maintain copies of email data for a particular period of time e.g. 10 years to comply with state or federal regulations while similar regulations do not apply to the file system data. The compliance copy rule set is associated with the same tape library B and media agent B as the disaster recovery copy rule set although a different storage device or media agent could be used in other embodiments. Finally the compliance copy rule set specifies that copies generated under the compliance copy rule set will be retained for 10 years and will be generated on a quarterly basis.

At step 1 the storage manager initiates a backup operation according to the backup copy rule set . For instance a scheduling service running on the storage manager accesses scheduling information from the backup copy rule set or a separate scheduling policy associated with the client computing device and initiates a backup copy operation on an hourly basis. Thus at the scheduled time slot the storage manager sends instructions to the client computing device i.e. to both data agent A and data agent B to begin the backup operation.

At step 2 the file system data agent A and the email data agent B operating on the client computing device respond to the instructions received from the storage manager by accessing and processing the primary data A B involved in the copy operation which can be found in primary storage device . Because the operation is a backup copy operation the data agent s A B may format the data into a backup format or otherwise process the data.

At step 3 the client computing device communicates the retrieved processed data to the first media agent A as directed by the storage manager according to the backup copy rule set . In some other embodiments the information management system may implement a load balancing availability based or other appropriate algorithm to select from the available set of media agents A B. Regardless of the manner the media agent A is selected the storage manager may further keep a record in the storage manager database of the association between the selected media agent A and the client computing device and or between the selected media agent A and the backup copy A.

The target media agent A receives the data from the client computing device and at step 4 conveys the data to the disk library A to create the backup copy A again at the direction of the storage manager and according to the backup copy rule set . The secondary storage device A can be selected in other ways. For instance the media agent A may have a dedicated association with a particular secondary storage device s or the storage manager or media agent A may select from a plurality of secondary storage devices e.g. according to availability using one of the techniques described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 246 207 which is incorporated by reference herein.

The media agent A can also update its index to include data and or metadata related to the backup copy A such as information indicating where the backup copy A resides on the disk library A data and metadata for cache retrieval etc. The storage manager may similarly update its index to include information relating to the storage operation such as information relating to the type of storage operation a physical location associated with one or more copies created by the storage operation the time the storage operation was performed status information relating to the storage operation the components involved in the storage operation and the like. In some cases the storage manager may update its index to include some or all of the information stored in the index of the media agent A. After the 30 day retention period expires the storage manager instructs the media agent A to delete the backup copy A from the disk library A. Indexes and or are updated accordingly.

At step 5 the storage manager initiates the creation of a disaster recovery copy B according to the disaster recovery copy rule set .

At step 6 illustratively based on the instructions received from the storage manager at step 5 the specified media agent B retrieves the most recent backup copy A from the disk library A.

At step 7 again at the direction of the storage manager and as specified in the disaster recovery copy rule set the media agent B uses the retrieved data to create a disaster recovery copy B on the tape library B. In some cases the disaster recovery copy B is a direct mirror copy of the backup copy A and remains in the backup format. In other embodiments the disaster recovery copy B may be generated in some other manner such as by using the primary data A B from the primary storage device as source data. The disaster recovery copy operation is initiated once a day and the disaster recovery copies B are deleted after 60 days indexes are updated accordingly when after each information management operation is executed completed.

At step 8 the storage manager initiates the creation of a compliance copy C according to the compliance copy rule set . For instance the storage manager instructs the media agent B to create the compliance copy C on the tape library B at step 9 as specified in the compliance copy rule set . In the example the compliance copy C is generated using the disaster recovery copy B. In other embodiments the compliance copy C is instead generated using either the primary data B corresponding to the email sub client or using the backup copy A from the disk library A as source data. As specified in the illustrated example compliance copies C are created quarterly and are deleted after ten years and indexes are kept up to date accordingly.

While not shown in at some later point in time a restore operation can be initiated involving one or more of the secondary copies A B C. As one example a user may manually initiate a restore of the backup copy A by interacting with the user interface of the storage manager . The storage manager then accesses data in its index and or the respective storage policy A associated with the selected backup copy A to identify the appropriate media agent A and or secondary storage device A.

In other cases a media agent may be selected for use in the restore operation based on a load balancing algorithm an availability based algorithm or other criteria. The selected media agent A retrieves the data from the disk library A. For instance the media agent A may access its index to identify a location of the backup copy A on the disk library A or may access location information residing on the disk A itself.

When the backup copy A was recently created or accessed the media agent A accesses a cached version of the backup copy A residing in the index without having to access the disk library A for some or all of the data. Once it has retrieved the backup copy A the media agent A communicates the data to the source client computing device . Upon receipt the file system data agent A and the email data agent B may unpackage e.g. restore from a backup format to the native application format the data in the backup copy A and restore the unpackaged data to the primary storage device .

The storage manager may permit a user to specify aspects of the storage policy A. For example the storage policy can be modified to include information governance policies to define how data should be managed in order to comply with a certain regulation or business objective. The various policies may be stored for example in the management database . An information governance policy may comprise a classification policy which is described herein. An information governance policy may align with one or more compliance tasks that are imposed by regulations or business requirements. Examples of information governance policies might include a Sarbanes Oxley policy a HIPAA policy an electronic discovery E Discovery policy and so on.

Information governance policies allow administrators to obtain different perspectives on all of an organization s online and offline data without the need for a dedicated data silo created solely for each different viewpoint. As described previously the data storage systems herein build a centralized index that reflects the contents of a distributed data set that spans numerous clients and storage devices including both primary and secondary copies and online and offline copies. An organization may apply multiple information governance policies in a top down manner over that unified data set and indexing schema in order to permit an organization to view and manipulate the single data set through different lenses each of which is adapted to a particular compliance or business goal. Thus for example by applying an E discovery policy and a Sarbanes Oxley policy two different groups of users in an organization can conduct two very different analyses of the same underlying physical set of data copies which may be distributed throughout the organization and information management system.

A classification policy defines a taxonomy of classification terms or tags relevant to a compliance task and or business objective. A classification policy may also associate a defined tag with a classification rule. A classification rule defines a particular combination of criteria such as users who have created accessed or modified a document or data object file or application types content or metadata keywords clients or storage locations dates of data creation and or access review status or other status within a workflow e.g. reviewed or un reviewed modification times or types of modifications and or any other data attributes in any combination without limitation. A classification rule may also be defined using other classification tags in the taxonomy. The various criteria used to define a classification rule may be combined in any suitable fashion for example via Boolean operators to define a complex classification rule. As an example an E discovery classification policy might define a classification tag privileged that is associated with documents or data objects that 1 were created or modified by legal department staff or 2 were sent to or received from outside counsel via email or 3 contain one of the following keywords privileged or attorney or counsel or other like terms.

One specific type of classification tag which may be added to an index at the time of indexing is an entity tag. An entity tag may be for example any content that matches a defined data mask format. Examples of entity tags might include e.g. social security numbers e.g. any numerical content matching the formatting mask XXX XX XXXX credit card numbers e.g. content having a 13 16 digit string of numbers SKU numbers product numbers etc.

A user may define a classification policy by indicating criteria parameters or descriptors of the policy via a graphical user interface such as a form or page with fields to be filled in pull down menus or entries allowing one or more of several options to be selected buttons sliders hypertext links or other known user interface tools for receiving user input etc. For example a user may define certain entity tags such as a particular product number or project ID code that is relevant in the organization. In some implementations the classification policy can be implemented using cloud based techniques. For example the storage devices may be cloud storage devices and the storage manager may execute cloud service provider API over a network to classify data stored on cloud storage devices.

The formatting and structure of secondary copies can vary depending on the embodiment. In some cases secondary copies are formatted as a series of logical data units or chunks e.g. 512 MB 1 GB 2 GB 4 GB or 8 GB chunks . This can facilitate efficient communication and writing to secondary storage devices e.g. according to resource availability. For example a single secondary copy may be written on a chunk by chunk basis to a single secondary storage device or across multiple secondary storage devices . In some cases users can select different chunk sizes e.g. to improve throughput to tape storage devices.

Generally each chunk can include a header and a payload. The payload can include files or other data units or subsets thereof included in the chunk whereas the chunk header generally includes metadata relating to the chunk some or all of which may be derived from the payload. For example during a secondary copy operation the media agent storage manager or other component may divide the associated files into chunks and generate headers for each chunk by processing the constituent files. The headers can include a variety of information such as file identifier s volume s offset s or other information associated with the payload data items a chunk sequence number etc. Importantly in addition to being stored with the secondary copy on the secondary storage device the chunk headers can also be stored to the index of the associated media agent s and or the index . This is useful in some cases for providing faster processing of secondary copies during restores or other operations. In some cases once a chunk is successfully transferred to a secondary storage device the secondary storage device returns an indication of receipt e.g. to the media agent and or storage manager which may update their respective indexes accordingly. During restore chunks may be processed e.g. by the media agent according to the information in the chunk header to reassemble the files.

Data can also be communicated within the information management system in data channels that connect the client computing devices to the secondary storage devices . These data channels can be referred to as data streams and multiple data streams can be employed to parallelize an information management operation improving data transfer rate among providing other advantages. Example data formatting techniques including techniques involving data streaming chunking and the use of other data structures in creating copies e.g. secondary copies are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7 315 923 and 8 156 086 and 8 578 120 each of which is incorporated by reference herein.

Referring to the data stream has the stream header and stream payload aligned into multiple data blocks. In this example the data blocks are of size 64 KB. The first two stream header and stream payload pairs comprise a first data block of size 64 KB. The first stream header indicates that the length of the succeeding stream payload is 63 KB and that it is the start of a data block. The next stream header indicates that the succeeding stream payload has a length of 1 KB and that it is not the start of a new data block. Immediately following stream payload is a pair comprising an identifier header and identifier data . The identifier header includes an indication that the succeeding identifier data includes the identifier for the immediately previous data block. The identifier data includes the identifier that the data agent generated for the data block. The data stream also includes other stream header and stream payload pairs which may be for SI data and or for non SI data.

As an example the data structures illustrated in may have been created as a result of two storage operations involving two client computing devices . For example a first storage operation on a first client computing device could result in the creation of the first chunk folder and a second storage operation on a second client computing device could result in the creation of the second chunk folder . The container files in the first chunk folder would contain the blocks of SI data of the first client computing device . If the two client computing devices have substantially similar data the second storage operation on the data of the second client computing device would result in the media agent storing primarily links to the data blocks of the first client computing device that are already stored in the container files . Accordingly while a first storage operation may result in storing nearly all of the data subject to the storage operation subsequent storage operations involving similar data may result in substantial data storage space savings because links to already stored data blocks can be stored instead of additional instances of data blocks.

If the operating system of the secondary storage computing device on which the media agent operates supports sparse files then when the media agent creates container files it can create them as sparse files. A sparse file is type of file that may include empty space e.g. a sparse file may have real data within it such as at the beginning of the file and or at the end of the file but may also have empty space in it that is not storing actual data such as a contiguous range of bytes all having a value of zero . Having the container files be sparse files allows the media agent to free up space in the container files when blocks of data in the container files no longer need to be stored on the storage devices. In some examples the media agent creates a new container file when a container file either includes 100 blocks of data or when the size of the container file exceeds 50 MB. In other examples the media agent creates a new container file when a container file satisfies other criteria e.g. it contains from approximately 100 to approximately 1000 blocks or when its size exceeds approximately 50 MB to 1 GB .

In some cases a file on which a storage operation is performed may comprise a large number of data blocks. For example a 100 MB file may comprise 400 data blocks of size 256 KB. If such a file is to be stored its data blocks may span more than one container file or even more than one chunk folder. As another example a database file of 20 GB may comprise over 40 000 data blocks of size 512 KB. If such a database file is to be stored its data blocks will likely span multiple container files multiple chunk folders and potentially multiple volume folders. Restoring such files may require accessing multiple container files chunk folders and or volume folders to obtain the requisite data blocks.

Examples of systems and methods will now be described for using information local to a secondary storage computing device to improve information management operations particularly with respect to management of a stored set of deduplicated data. For example deduplication data block information can be updated on a generally continuous or otherwise frequent basis in memory that is local to one or more secondary storage computing devices . These local updates can be forwarded for persistent storage in one or more secondary storage device s according to a transaction based scheme thereby providing a relatively robust and efficient mechanism for maintaining deduplication information in the secondary storage subsystem .

While described in some cases with respect to certain types of operations e.g. backup and pruning operations the techniques described herein may be equally compatible with other types of storage operations including archive snapshot and replication operations to name a few. Descriptions of embodiments of these and other types storage operations compatible with embodiments described are provided above. Moreover certain aspects of such techniques may be employed for use in conjunction with stored data sets that are not deduplicated.

For purposes of the example the illustrated embodiment has been simplified to include two client computing devices a single storage manager a single secondary storage computing device and corresponding media agent and two secondary storage device . In other embodiments different numbers of components are possible. For instance any desired number of client computing devices secondary storage computing devices media agents and secondary storage devices may be employed depending on the embodiment.

The deduplication database in the illustrated embodiment is implemented in one or more storage devices that are separate and distinct from the secondary storage computing devices . For instance the deduplication database can communicate with the other components of the information management system via a network such as a SAN LAN and or WAN. In certain other embodiments the deduplication database can be located at another location. For instance the deduplication database in one embodiment is contained in one nor more media agent databases associated with the secondary storage computing device s not shown in see e.g. . In such embodiments the deduplication database can communicate with the secondary storage computing device via a communication bus such as via SCSI connection.

In some embodiments the system can include multiple deduplication databases such as one for each secondary storage computing device and or can include only one deduplication database that is shared amongst multiple secondary storage computing devices and corresponding media agents . When multiple deduplication databases are used a storage policy can determine the allocation of the deduplication information amongst the multiple deduplication databases e.g. based on a scheme using data block signatures as described in greater detail in U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2012 0150826 previously incorporated herein by reference. In some embodiments the deduplication database resides on a slower storage medium than the local database . For example if the local database is implemented in the main memory of the secondary storage computing device the deduplication database can be implemented as an on disk database such as on a hard drive disk drive solid state drive or other storage medium. For instance the deduplication database according to some embodiments is implemented in persistent and or non volatile memory where the contents of the deduplication database are persistently stored and remain accessible in the event of a power down of the memory on which the deduplication database resides or in the event of a crash or other failure associated with the secondary storage computing device .

As shown the deduplication database is stored separately from the corresponding set of data blocks . This architecture can provide certain advantages including enhanced scalability as is described in more detail in U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2012 0150826. In some embodiments including the illustrated embodiment the deduplication database stores database entries that correspond to a set of data blocks contained in the one or more secondary storage devices . For example the database entries in the deduplication database can include or be referred to as signature blocks where each signature block corresponds to a deduplication data block that is stored in the one or more secondary storage devices . The signature blocks can include a hash or other deduplication signature of the corresponding data block also referred to as a data block signature as well as additional information such as the location e.g. memory device identifier and or memory address of the data block the number of references to the data block in the deduplicated data store also referred to as a reference count the location e.g. memory device identifier and or memory address of references e.g. pointers to the data block within the secondary storage device s and or the age of each reference etc. as described in greater detail below with reference to and in U.S. Patent App. Pub. No. 2013 0346373 entitled Collaborative Restore in a Networked Storage System which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

As data blocks are added to and or removed from the secondary storage device s the signature blocks in the deduplication database can be created modified and or deleted as appropriate as described in greater detail below. In addition according to a storage policy the deduplication database can be backed up to secondary storage in the event of a deduplication database failure for subsequent restore.

The secondary storage computing device can advantageously locally store and maintain information associated with the deduplication data store. Such information can include information corresponding to entries in the deduplication database . For instance in the illustrated embodiment the secondary storage computing device maintains local databases A B. The local databases A B can be organized in a database format or in any other appropriate data structure or format depending on the embodiment. As is discussed herein such locally maintained information can be useful in a transaction based scheme to flush updates to the deduplication database .

The local database can store working copies of database entries e.g. signature blocks that are or will be stored in the deduplication database . In some embodiments the local database stores a subset of the database entries stored in the deduplication database . For instance as will be discussed in further detail the local database can store working copies corresponding to a subset of the database entries that have been recently modified. In certain other embodiments local database stores working copies of all of the database entries stored in the deduplication database . In some embodiments the local database can be implemented in main memory of the secondary storage computing device . For example the local database can be implemented in RAM of the secondary storage computing device . For instance the local database can be implemented in relatively faster memory than the memory on which the deduplication database is stored. The local database can be stored in non persistent and or volatile memory e.g. where the contents of the local database may be lost in the event of a power down of the memory on which the local database resides or in the event of a crash or other failure associated with the secondary storage computing device . In certain other embodiments the local database can be implemented in longer term storage such as a hard drive disk drive solid state drive etc.

Each of the working copies of the database entries generally includes information about a corresponding data block in the set of data blocks and can include for example information included in the corresponding database entry in the deduplication database . For instance the working copy can include a complete copy of the corresponding signature blocks in the deduplication database or any portion thereof. In certain embodiments each working copy includes a data block signature and a reference count associated with the corresponding data block. The reference count can indicate the number of references to the data block in the set of files represented by the deduplicated data store. In certain embodiments each working copy can include other information associated with the corresponding data block such as the storage location of the data block e.g. memory device identifier and memory address and or other information from the corresponding signature data block stored in the deduplication database .

Depending on the situation the working copies in the local database can be derived from database entries obtained from the deduplication database and or from deduplication information that does not yet exist in the deduplication database but is instead newly received e.g. as part of an on going backup or other information management operation. For example as will be described in further detail e.g. with reference to as part of a backup operation in which data is being backed up from the primary storage devices to the deduplicated data store in secondary storage devices it may be appropriate to create and or modify database entries in the deduplication database that correspond to data blocks that form the files in the backup data set. As the secondary storage computing device processes the backup data set it can identify the data blocks and can query the local database for working copies of the database entries corresponding to those data blocks. Where working copies exist the secondary storage computing device can modify the working copy as appropriate. Where working copies do not exist the secondary storage computing device can request the appropriate database entry from the deduplication database such as where the data block already exists in the deduplicated data store. Or the secondary storage computing device can create a new database entry such as where a newly added data block is entering the deduplicated data store as part of the backup operation. Once a working copy of a database entry is obtained the secondary storage computing device updates the working copy as appropriate. For instance any of the following types of updates are possible without limitation 

Thus the local database can operate similar to a cache where the relevant working copy is already found in the local database and it can be modified as appropriate. On the other hand if the working copy is not found in the local database it is either generated by the secondary storage computing device or received from the deduplication database . For example the secondary storage computing device can query the deduplication database for the corresponding entry. If the deduplication database has the database entry it can send the entry or a portion thereof to the secondary storage computing device for storage in the local database as a working copy. If the deduplication database does not have the entry the local database can generate the entry locally as a working copy. The working copy can include but is not limited to the data block signature information relating to the location of the data block in secondary storage and a count corresponding to the number of references to the data block that exist in the files maintained in the deduplicated data store.

As indicated the working copies in the local database can be merged with the deduplication database in order to update the information in the deduplication database . For example the working copies can be merged once a threshold number of working copies reside in the local database . In some embodiments the working copies can be merged once the local database reaches a threshold size e.g. 10 MB 100 MB 1 GB etc. . In certain embodiments the working copies can be merged with the deduplication database entries once a threshold time period has been reached e.g. since the last merge operation. The threshold time can be measured since a previous merge and or other event and can be any appropriate value depending on the embodiment such as least 10 seconds at least 20 seconds at least 30 seconds at least 1 minute at least 2 minutes at least 5 minutes or at least 10 minutes or more. During or after a merge operation the local database or a portion thereof can also be flushed to free up space. For example during a flush some or all of the working copies can be deleted from one or more of the local databases A B.

As illustrated in the secondary storage computing device can include multiple local databases such as local databases A B. In some other cases only one local database A is used. Although the illustrated embodiment of only shows two local databases A B it will be understood that the secondary storage computing device can include more than two local databases as desired. When multiple local databases are used the local databases can be daisy chained together such that if one local database e.g. B does not have a working copy of a particular database entry the secondary storage computing device can query one or more other local databases A etc. for the working copy before requesting the database entry from the deduplication database .

For example in some embodiments once a first local database A begins to merge with the deduplication database it can be placed in read only mode e.g. the information management system can remove write access and a second local database B can be identified as the active local database and begin storing and modifying working copies of the database entries. The working copies in the second local database B can be obtained or derived from database entries received from the first or read only local database A or other local databases if present the deduplication database .

For example with reference to when a working copy of a particular a database entry to be modified does not already reside in the second local database B the secondary storage computing device can query the first local database A for a copy. If the first local database A has a copy of the database entry in question the secondary storage computing device can store it in the second local database B as a working copy and modify it as appropriate. If the first local database A does not have the database entry the secondary storage computing device can query the deduplication database for the database entry. If the deduplication database has the database entry it can send it to the secondary storage computing device for storage in the second local database B as the working copy for modification as appropriate. If the deduplication database does not have a database entry corresponding to the data block in question the data block is new to the deduplicated data store. Thus the secondary storage device can compile a working copy using the information provided to it as part of the information management operation e.g. backup that involves the data block for storage in the second local database B.

The event log can be a data structure used to track storage events associated with the deduplicated data store. The event log can reside on a storage device that is separate and distinct from the secondary storage computing device and or can reside on memory associated with the secondary storage computing device such as part of the media agent database . The secondary storage computing device may create and or maintain the event log for example. In certain embodiments each local database A B can be associated with a separate event log or a single event log may separately group entries associated with each local database A B. In some embodiments the event log is maintained persistently in non volatile storage such that the event log is available for use in recovery operations in the event of a crash of the secondary storage computing device or its corresponding media agent as will be discussed further herein.

Log entries associated with relevant storage events can be added to the event log either as the events occur or following completion of the events. For example during an information management operation such as a backup operation snapshot operation etc. each modification to a working copy of the local database can be stored in the event log . The event log can include information such as which working copy was modified how it was modified e.g. database entry added for new data block reference count incremented decremented etc. a timestamp etc. In some cases the event log does not log or track pruning events or events that result or are intended to result in the deletion of a data block from the set of data blocks and or a corresponding database entry from the deduplication database . For instance where an storage event results in the reference count of a working copy in the local database decrementing to zero indicating a deletion of the corresponding data block and or data base entry is appropriate the event log in some cases does not add a corresponding log entry. In contrast the event log in such cases can be configured to add a log entry for a storage even resulting in the addition of a data block to the set of data blocks or a storage event resulting in the incrementing of the reference count of a working copy in the local database .

Additional information related to the information management operation can be included in the event log as appropriate such as the start end time of an operation on the primary storage subsystem and or deduplication database start end time of a merge operation between the local database and the deduplication database timestamp indicating when a working copy was generated or pruned etc. In embodiments where each local database A B has a corresponding event log the event log for each local database A B can store log entries of the storage events that occurred when the corresponding local database A B was active.

In some embodiments the event log can be pruned flushed or otherwise modified over time. For example following a merge of the local database with the deduplication database the log entries in the event log that correspond to the working copies that were merged with the deduplication database can be deleted or the entire event log can be flushed. Similarly following a backup of the deduplication database to the secondary storage device the log entries that correspond to the database entries in the deduplication database that were backed up to the secondary storage device can be deleted in some cases.

The information stored by the event log can be used by the information management system to restore the local database following the unavailability or failure of the secondary storage computing device as described in greater detail below e.g. with reference to . For example following a secondary storage computing device failure the information management system can use the event log to identify the most recent merge time of the local database with the deduplication database . In addition the information management system can identify the storage events for which entries e.g. working copies in the local database were not merged with the corresponding entries in the deduplication database as a result of the secondary storage computing device failure e.g. the storage events that occurred after the merge time . Once identified the information management system can replay the storage events that were not merged to recreate or reconstruct the entries e.g. working copies in the local database . Once the entries in the local database are reconstructed they can be merged with the deduplication database . Following the merge the storage manager can indicate that the deduplication database is up to date or online.

While the data block related information in the deduplication database can be organized in a variety of ways in certain embodiments the information is arranged as a plurality of signature blocks as shown in . Each signature block can correspond to a unique or substantially unique data block signature and corresponding data block in the deduplicated data store.

In some embodiments each signature block includes information regarding the references stored in the deduplicated data store in the secondary storage subsystem that refer to the corresponding data block also referred to as data block references . Furthermore signature blocks stored in the deduplication database can include various other pieces of information or metadata associated with the corresponding data block. For example each signature block can include a signature field including the data block signature a number of references or reference count field that identifies the number references to the data block that are found in the deduplicated data store in the secondary storage subsystem a data block location field that provides the storage location of the data block in the secondary storage subsystem e.g. memory device identifier and memory address information . The signature block can also include a set of reference entries each corresponding to a different reference to the data block in the deduplicated data store. As one illustrative example three files are stored in the deduplicated data store. Two instances of a particular data block form constituent parts of the first file a single instance of the data block is included in the second file and the third file does not include any instances of the data block. In this example there would be three reference entries corresponding to the three instances of that data block. The reference entries can further include a location information field and an age information field described further below.

Each signature block can include additional or less information as desired. Moreover in some embodiments the deduplication database can be organized differently. For instance while the illustrated embodiment generally groups entries for the data block references into a separate signature block for each unique signature other embodiments may instead organize the entries according to some other scheme. In some embodiments entries can be grouped based on the time the data block reference was added to the secondary storage subsystem or according to any other appropriate scheme.

Generally speaking the data block signatures can be used as a reference to determine whether a particular data block is already stored in the secondary storage subsystem and or in the local database or deduplication database . The signature in the signature field can be derived by performing a hash or other function on the corresponding data block. The signature can be generated by a variety of different components depending on the implementation such as the client computing device the secondary storage computing device the storage manager the media agent and or a module executing on a primary storage device or secondary storage device . In some embodiments signatures are derived each time data is written to or modified on a primary storage device . In other cases signatures are generated in association with a backup restore or other storage operation or based on some other appropriate schedule as determined by the storage policy. In an embodiment the SHA 512 algorithm is used e.g. on a 64 kB or 128 kB data block to derive the signature . In some embodiments the resulting signature is 256 bytes and can be used for deduplication purposes. Hash functions other than SHA 512 can be used on the data blocks to derive the signature as well as other non hash functions. In addition different sized signatures may be used.

The data block location field can indicate the location of the data block in the secondary storage subsystem . The location information can include physical and or logical memory address information usable to access the data block within the secondary storage device s . For example the location information can include but is not limited to an identifier of the memory device or other information store where the data block resides a cluster identifier and or an offset.

The reference ID field can include an identifier for a particular data block reference stored in the secondary storage subsystem . For example in some embodiments the first reference to the data block can have a reference ID of one the second reference to the data block can have a reference ID of two etc.

The location information field can include information specifying the location of the data block reference in the secondary storage subsystem . The location information can additionally include physical and or logical memory address information usable to access the reference to the data block within the secondary storage device . For example the location information can include but is not limited to an identifier for the information store e.g. memory device identifier where the data block resides a cluster identifier and or an offset.

Each reference entry can also include age information in an age field . The age field can be used to determine how long a particular reference to a data block has existed in the secondary storage subsystem . The age field in one embodiment includes an age ID which can be an alphanumeric indication of when the reference entry was added or revised relative to other reference entries. For instance the age ID may be a unique identifier for the particular reference to the data block.

The signature block and or corresponding reference entries can contain fewer or more pieces of information than what is illustrated in the examples shown in . For example the signature block can include date data such as the date when the signature block was created or modified etc. In some embodiments the reference entries can include file identifiers that indicate to which file or backup a reference entry belongs. The file identifiers can be located in the location field in another field or in a separate field. Furthermore the reference entries can include organizational data that indicates where the data block corresponding to the reference entry is located with respect to other data blocks in a particular file etc. In some embodiments the signature block and each reference entry can include a removal flag that indicates that the particular signature block and or reference entry can be removed as part of a pruning operation discussed in greater detail below with reference to .

It will be understood that although reference is made to the deduplication database the embodiments described above can also apply to the local database which includes complete or partial copies of the database entries in the deduplication database . Furthermore it will be understood that because the working copies of the database entries in the local database include some or all of the information in a signature block the embodiments described above with reference to the signature block can also apply to the working copies of the database entries in the local database .

Prior to performing a merge operation the secondary storage computing device can receive one or more instructions and or data. The instructions can be to perform one or more information management operations such as a backup or archive operation deduplication data store pruning operation etc. As illustrated the secondary storage computing device can receive the instructions and or data from the storage manager and or the client computing devices . For example as part of a A backup operation the secondary storage computing device can receive data from the client computing devices as packaged by the appropriate corresponding data agents for backup to the secondary storage subsystem . The data can include one or more files to be backed up to the secondary storage subsystem for example. The secondary storage computing device or other appropriate entity in the secondary storage subsystem can break the received files up at a level of chosen granularity into deduplication data blocks. In other cases the data agent or other appropriate entity in the primary storage subsystem breaks the files up into the deduplication data blocks before sending the data to the secondary storage computing device . The received data can also include deduplication signatures corresponding to the data blocks in some such cases or any other appropriate type of information.

Other types of operations are possible. As another example the storage manager can instruct the secondary storage computing device to B prune the deduplication database and or set of data blocks . For example the storage manager can instruct the secondary storage computing device to B prune the deduplication database and or set of data blocks as part of routine maintenance of the deduplication data store or the pruning may result from another information management operation such as an archive operation.

The storage operation can be scheduled based on any desired storage policy indicating that at certain times e.g. once a day once a week etc. or following certain events a particular storage operation is to be performed.

The secondary storage computing device A processes the instructions and or data and B logs the storage events as they occur into the event log . As part of the processing the secondary storage computing device can determine what changes to the deduplication database and or set of data blocks are appropriate. For example the secondary storage computing device can determine whether entries are to be added removed or modified e.g. reference counts incremented or decremented from the deduplication database . Furthermore in some embodiments as part of the processing the secondary storage computing device can generate entries e.g. including data block signatures and other appropriate information that correspond to data blocks that are or will be stored in the set of data blocks .

In addition as part of the processing the secondary storage computing device can determine whether any of the working copies of database entries that are already stored in the local databases are affected by the storage operations. For example the secondary storage computing device can query the local database e.g. local database A for signatures that are part of the storage operation. If the secondary storage computing device determines that the active local database A includes the relevant working copies it can omit step 3 .

As part of logging the events B the secondary storage computing device can log what storage events and or associated modifications to the working copies in the local database occurred the time they occurred and information regarding the other storage events as they occur etc. It is to be understood that the secondary storage computing device can log the storage events at any appropriate time e.g. before after or concurrently with any one of the actions illustrated in .

Upon processing the instructions the secondary storage computing device can request and receive relevant data from the deduplication database . For example if the secondary storage computing device determines that a working copy of an entry corresponding to a particular data block is not found in the local database it can request the particular entry and or any other relevant information from the deduplication database . The requested entry and other information can include but is not limited to the data block signature reference count of the signature the location of the corresponding data block etc.

The secondary storage computing device modifies the local database as appropriate in accordance with the data received from the client computing devices A and or the storage manager B . For example if the files to be backed up include one or more references to a data block that already exists in the set of data blocks of the deduplicated data store the secondary storage computing device can increment the reference count of the working copy of the corresponding database entry. On the other hand if a file is being modified or deleted such that one or more references to a data block that already exists in the set of data blocks are to be deleted the secondary storage computing device can decrement the reference count of the working copy of the corresponding database entry. Upon decrementing the reference count the secondary storage computing device can also determine whether any references to the data block remain within the secondary storage device . For example if the reference count is decremented to less than a threshold count such as one the secondary storage computing device can determine that the corresponding data block is no longer needed and should be pruned from the set of data blocks . Accordingly the secondary storage computing device can modify the working copy of the database entry to include information sufficient to indicate that the corresponding database entry should be removed from the deduplication database and or that the data block should be removed from the set of data blocks .

If after processing the instructions the secondary storage computing device determines that the backup data set includes a new data block that does not already exist in the set of data blocks the secondary storage computing device can create a working copy of the database entry. Accordingly in some instances the local database can include working copies of newly generated database entries that are not found in the deduplication database . The secondary storage device may process the data block to generate the data block signature for example and then compile the working copy by including the generated signature as well as a reference count of one or of greater than one if there are plural instances of the data block in the set of files to be backed up.

According to a storage policy the secondary storage computing device can merge the local database with the deduplication database . As part of the merge the secondary storage computing device can modify the local database to be read only such that no additional modifications can be made to the local database during the merge. This can help keep the local database and the deduplication database synchronized. In this way the information management system can act as a transaction based system.

In addition as part of the merge operation the secondary storage computing device can send working copies of the database entries that are stored in the local database to the deduplication database . The deduplication database can update the deduplication database based on the received working copies e.g. by comparing the working copies of the database entries with the database entries that reside in the deduplication database and make changes accordingly.

For example if a database entry corresponding to the working copy in the local database does not exist in the deduplication database the deduplication database can generate a new database entry based on the received working copy. If the working copy received from the secondary storage computing device indicates that additional references to a data block have been or will be added to the secondary storage device the deduplication database can update the corresponding signature block with the relevant information. For example the deduplication database can increment the reference count of the signature block and or include the location of the new reference to the signature block within the secondary storage device .

Similarly if the working copy received from the secondary storage computing device indicates that one or more references to a data block are to be removed from the secondary storage device the deduplication database can update the corresponding signature block or other type of entry in the deduplication database with the relevant information. For example the deduplication database can decrement the reference count of the signature block and indicate the location within the secondary storage devices where the corresponding reference to the data block resides.

It will be understood that for simplicity only some of the operations performed by the different components are illustrated. For example in addition to what is illustrated in and described below the secondary storage computing device can perform a number of other operations before after or concurrently with the operations described below. In addition the deduplication database and or the set of data blocks can be backed up to one or more other secondary storage devices not shown according to a storage policy. In some embodiments the backup of the deduplication database and or the set of data blocks is handled by the secondary storage computing device .

Furthermore although not illustrated in it will be understood that the information management system can perform additional operations. For example in some embodiments when one local database A is merging with the deduplication database that local database A can be set to read only and a second local database B becomes the active local database. Accordingly modifications to working copies are made in the second local database B during the merge. In certain embodiments once the merge is completed the working copies residing within the merged local database are deleted. In some embodiments following the merge the log entries in the event log or the entire event log that correspond to the merged local database A are deleted. In some cases more than two local databases A B can be employed. For instance where both the first and second local databases A B become full or are otherwise scheduled for merging with the deduplication database but have not yet been merged the first and second local databases A B can be designated as inactive pending the merge e.g. set to read only permission and a third local database can be created as an active database. Any number of local databases can be created in this manner in some embodiments thereby allowing the secondary storage computing device to continue processing the backup or other information management operation while the merges of the inactive local databases are pending. In some other cases there is a pre defined maximum number of local databases A B that can be created. Once the maximum is reached one or more of the inactive local databases must be merged with the deduplication database and or flushed before further operations involving the use of the local database can proceed.

At block the system receives one or more instructions to modify a database entry in the deduplication database . As described in greater detail above the instructions can include one or more instructions to store or prune a data block in secondary storage add remove an entry in the deduplication database increment decrement the reference count of an entry and the like. In addition as described previously the database entry in the deduplication database can include a data block signature that corresponds to a data block that has resided does reside or will reside in the secondary storage device .

At decision block the information management system determines whether a working copy of the database entry resides in the local database s . To determine whether the local database s includes a working copy of the database entry the information management system can query the local database s for the data block signature. If the data block signature is found in the local database s the information management system can move to block discussed below.

However if the information management system determines that the working copy is not in the local database the information management system can query the deduplication database for the corresponding entry or to otherwise obtain the relevant data as illustrated in block . If the deduplication database has an entry corresponding to the relevant data block or includes the relevant data in some other appropriate form it can return it to the secondary storage computing device . If the deduplication database does not have an entry corresponding to the relevant data block and does not include the relevant data in other form it can inform the secondary storage computing device that this is the case.

In some embodiments the relevant data queried for by the information management system includes the database entry in the deduplication database including the data block signature or a portion thereof. In certain embodiments upon receipt of the request from the secondary storage computing device the information management system can review the database entries for an entry that matches the data block signature. For example another secondary storage computing device not shown associated with the secondary storage device may review the entries in the deduplication database . In some cases the same secondary storage computing device that maintains the local database can perform the review. If the entry is found the database entry or portions thereof can be sent to the secondary storage computing device . For example the secondary storage computing device can receive the entry or a portion thereof e.g. including the data block signature and the reference count of the signature obtained from the deduplication database . For instance where another secondary storage computing device performs the review it can forward the relevant information to the secondary storage computing device that maintains the local database . On the other hand if the signature is not found an indication can be sent to the secondary storage computing device indicating that the deduplication database does not include an entry corresponding to the data block.

At block the information management system modifies the working copy of the database entry in the local database based on the received instruction. In some embodiments modifying the working copy includes generating the working copy editing the working copy adding information to the working copy sufficient to indicate that the corresponding data block and or database entry are to be deleted and or deleting the working copy. In certain embodiments if the relevant data is not found in the deduplication database indicating that the data block is new to the deduplicated data store and not already stored in the set of data blocks the secondary storage computing device can generate a working copy that can in turn be used as part of a merge operation to generate a database entry in the deduplication database .

If the instructions indicate that a new reference to the data block corresponding to the signature is stored or will be stored in the deduplicated data store in the secondary storage subsystem the information management system can increment the reference count. If the instructions indicate that a reference to the data block corresponding to the signature is being pruned from the deduplicated data store in the secondary storage subsystem the information management system can decrement the reference count. Furthermore if the information management system determines that no more references to the data block corresponding to the signature reside or will reside following the storage operation in the secondary storage subsystem the information management system can indicate that the working copy the database entry and or the corresponding data block should be removed. In some embodiments the information management system can make the indication by setting a flag in the working copy. In certain embodiments the information management system can make the indication by placing the working copy in a table including entries for data blocks scheduled for deletion from the set of data blocks .

At block the system merges the local database with the deduplication database . In some embodiments the information management system merges the local database with the deduplication database according to a storage policy. As described previously in certain embodiments the storage policy can indicate that the local database is to merge with the deduplication database when a threshold time period has expired e.g. since the last merge operation and or when the size of the local database satisfies a threshold size or contains a threshold number of entries working copies.

As part of the merge operation in some embodiments the information management system can compare the database entries in the deduplication database with the working copies of the database entries that are stored in the local database . Based at least in part on the comparison the information management system can update the database entries in the deduplication database .

For example in some embodiments if a database entry in the deduplication database corresponding to a working copy in the local database cannot be found the information management system can generate the database entry. In certain embodiments if the working copy in the local database indicates that additional references to a data block have been or will be added to the secondary storage device the information management system can update the corresponding signature block in the deduplication database with the relevant information. For example the deduplication database can increment the reference count of the signature block and or include the location of the new reference to the signature block within the secondary storage device .

Similarly in some embodiments if the working copy received from the secondary storage computing device indicates that one or more references to a data block are to be removed from the secondary storage device the information management system can update the corresponding signature block in the deduplication database with the relevant information. For example the information management system can decrement the reference count of the signature block and indicate the location within the secondary storage device where the corresponding reference resides. Furthermore if the information management system determines that there are no more references to a particular data block the information management system can flag the signature block and or add an identifier for the data block e.g. the data block signature to a table that can be used to remove the data block from secondary storage.

Additional fewer or different blocks can be used to implement the routine without departing from the spirit and scope of the description. For example when multiple local databases are used the active local database can query one or more other local databases such as one or more read only local databases for the relevant data prior to querying the deduplication database . If the one or more other local databases include the relevant data the information management system can copy the data to the active local database .

As discussed where a data block and or database entry are to be pruned the secondary storage computing device can generally update the working copy of the corresponding database entry to include information sufficient to determine that the data block and or database entry should be deleted. For instance the working copies of the corresponding database entries in the local database can be modified to decrement the reference count to zero set a pruning flag or otherwise indicate that deletion of the data block and or corresponding database entry is appropriate.

With further reference to as described previously the changes to the local database are merged with the deduplication database . Once merged the deduplication database can be reviewed by a secondary storage computing device storage manager or other appropriate entity to identify the database entries and or corresponding data blocks that can be removed. For example the deduplication database can generate a separate table of database entries and or corresponding data blocks scheduled for removal. In some embodiments a flag can be set in association with the relevant database entries identifying the entries and or the corresponding data blocks for removal. Returning to the secondary storage computing device can receive an instruction to remove the data blocks from the set of data blocks and or database entries from the deduplication database that have been scheduled for deletion pruning. The secondary storage computing device can receive the instruction from the storage manager and or initiate the removal based on a storage policy. In the illustrated embodiment the secondary storage device that receives the instruction to perform the removal is the same secondary storage device that maintains the local database and implemented the merge with the deduplication database . In other cases a different secondary storage computing device or other appropriate entity performs the removal of the data blocks and or database entries scheduled for deletion.

The secondary storage computing device or another secondary storage computing device or other appropriate entity can review the deduplication database to identify database entries identified for removal e.g. as a result of one or more merge operations.

Once the secondary storage computing device has identified the data blocks and or corresponding database entries for removal the secondary storage computing device can A B remove them or cause the secondary storage devices to remove them as appropriate. Although not illustrated in once completed the deduplication database can indicate to the secondary storage computing device storage manager or other appropriate entity that the removal process has completed successfully.

It will be understood that for simplicity only some of the operations performed by the different components are illustrated. For example in addition to what is illustrated in the secondary storage computing device can perform a number of other operations before after or concurrently with the operations described below. For example in addition to identifying the database entries and or reference entries in the deduplication database that are to be removed the secondary storage computing device can identify the corresponding data blocks including data block references in secondary storage that are to be removed. The secondary storage computing device can also instruct the secondary storage device to permanently remove the corresponding data block reference and or data block itself from secondary storage as applicable.

At block the information management system receives an instruction to remove database entries to be pruned and or corresponding data blocks. For instance in some embodiments the instruction can be received from the storage manager . In certain embodiments the information management system initiates the removal process based on a storage policy. For example the removal process can be initiated following one or more merge operations once a day once a week etc.

At block the information management system queries the deduplication database for database entries to be pruned. In some embodiments the information management system e.g. a selected secondary storage computing device or corresponding media agent can review the database entries to identify the database entries and or corresponding data blocks to be pruned e.g. entries that have satisfied a threshold reference count . To accomplish this in some embodiments the information management system can check a flag on each database entry and or each reference entry . In certain embodiments the information management system can check the actual reference count of each database entry. Furthermore in some embodiments as part of the merge operation the information management system generates a separate table or other datastructure including the database entries and or reference entries that are to be removed. In such embodiments the deduplication database can identify the database entries to be pruned based on the database entries found in the generated table. Once the database entries to be pruned are identified the deduplication database can send an identifier of the database entries to be pruned to the secondary storage computing device .

At block the information management system removes the data blocks scheduled for deletion from the set of data blocks residing on the secondary storage devices . The information management system can use location information e.g. memory device identifier and or memory address information present in the deduplication database to locate and remove the data blocks including any data block references . For instance a secondary storage computing device or other appropriate entity may access the location information from the database entries in the deduplication database that correspond to each data block scheduled for deletion.

At block the information management system can in some embodiments remove at least a portion of the database entries scheduled for deletion from the deduplication database . Such entries can include those that correspond to data blocks that were also deleted as part of the pruning operation for example or that were previously deleted as part of another pruning operation.

Additional fewer or different blocks can be used to implement the routine without departing from the spirit and scope of the description. For example in some embodiments routine can omit one of blocks or . In certain embodiments blocks can be performed iteratively e.g. on a data block by data block basis or blocks and can be performed in parallel.

At block the information management system receives an instruction to reconstruct one or more local databases based at least in part on a failure of the secondary storage computing device . For example in some embodiments the information management system e.g. the storage manager can detect a failure e.g. hardware or software failure of the secondary storage computing device . Following the failure and as part of restoring the secondary storage computing device the information management system e.g. the media agent or the secondary storage computing device can receive an instruction to reconstruct the contents of any local databases e.g. A B that were lost as a result of the failure e.g. contents of the local databases that were not merged with the deduplication database prior to the failure . For example in some embodiments the information management system can identify the local databases that were lost by accessing and reviewing entries in the event log which can be stored in persistent non volatile memory such as on one or more hard drives or solid state drives for example. For instance in the case of a failure of the media agent running on the secondary storage computing device once the media agent is re started the media agent can identify local databases that should be reconstructed by accessing and reviewing entries in the event log . As another example where there is a hardware failure associated with the secondary storage computing device a replacement secondary storage computing device can be brought online and the media agent associated with the replacement secondary storage computing device can similarly identify the local databases that need to be reconstructed by accessing and reviewing entries in the event log .

At block the information management system can reconstruct the local databases that were lost. In some embodiments the information management system can use the event log to reconstruct the local databases . As described previously the event log can log each storage event. These events can include any events resulting in modifications to the local databases e.g. resulting in creation and modification of working copies of entries from the deduplication database or the actual modifications to the local databases themselves. In some embodiments a new event log is created each time a local database is merged with the deduplication database . In some cases the event log can include entries indicating when the local databases were merged with the deduplication database .

Accordingly in certain embodiments the information management system can review the event log to identify the most recent merge time of the local database with the deduplication database . Once identified the information management system can re play the contents of the event log subsequent to the last merge to reconstruct the local databases . Where a new event log is created after each merge the information management system can re play all the contents of the event log to reconstruct the local databases .

At block the information management system can merge the reconstructed local database s with the deduplication database . The reconstructed local database s can be merged with the deduplication database as described above with reference to block of .

Additional fewer or different blocks can be used to implement the routine without departing from the spirit and scope of the description. For example the routine can include recording deduplication related events in the event log recording a create time of a local database which can be used to identify which local databases were lost and or recording a merge time of a local database with the deduplication database etc. Furthermore in some embodiments once the information management system detects a secondary storage computing device failure it can place the deduplication database in an offline or read only state. In the offline read only state the deduplication database can be inaccessible for writes and or can be accessible only to an administrator. Once the reconstructed databases are merged with the deduplication database the information management system can return the deduplication database to an online or read write state.

As indicated previously in some embodiments the event log is not configured to track pruning events such as events that result in the scheduled deletion of a data block from the set of data blocks or of a corresponding database entry from the deduplication database . Thus the reconstruction and merge process of utilizing the event log may in such cases result in only a partial recovery from the failure associated with the secondary storage computing device because pruning events captured by the local database prior to the crash will be lost. The pruning events can be reissued in such cases as will be described with respect to . In other embodiments the event log captures pruning events and a full recovery can be achieved using the event log without reissuance of the pruning events.

In some embodiments the storage manager can track which data blocks and or corresponding database entries are to be pruned and or whether they have actually been pruned successfully. For example following a pruning operation the secondary storage computing device can transmit a report or other message to the storage manager indicating that the secondary storage computing device has completed the pruning. In some embodiments the secondary storage computing device can individually identify the data blocks that have been pruned. Accordingly in some embodiments if the storage manager does not receive the message that the pruning has completed successfully or if it receives an indication that some but not all of the data blocks and or corresponding database entries that should have been deleted have actually been deleted it can identify the data blocks and or corresponding database entries that still need to be deleted.

At block the information management system can instruct the deduplication database to prune the identified one or more data blocks and or corresponding database entries. Accordingly the data blocks and or corresponding database entries that were intended for deletion can be pruned based on the new instruction. The information management system can then initiate the pruning in any of the manners described herein e.g. with reference to .

Additional fewer or different blocks can be used to implement the routine without departing from the spirit and scope of the description. For example in some embodiments the routine can omit block . In such embodiments the information management system can identify one or more data blocks that were to be pruned but have not been and then instruct the deduplication database to prune the identified data blocks.
