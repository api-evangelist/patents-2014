title: Terahertz analog-to-digital converter employing active-controlled spoofed surface plasmon polariton architecture
abstract: A high-speed terahertz analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is provided. The ADC is comprised of an interferometer, a modulator and an array of detectors. The interferometer is configured to receive a carrier signal and guide a spoofed surface plasmon polariton (SSPP) wave in each of its two arms. The SSPP waves are emitted from the free end of each arm into a propagation space and combined in the space to form an interference wave. The modulator modulates the carrier signal in at least one of two arms with a modulating signal, where the radiation pattern of the interference wave in a far field of the propagation space is shifted in accordance with the amplitude of the modulating signal. The array of detectors are spatially separated from the interferometer by the propagation space and arranged to receive the interference wave.

This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 840 775 filed on Jun. 28 2013. The entire disclosure of the above application is incorporated herein by reference.

This invention was made with government support under FA9550 12 1 0402 awarded by the United States Air Force AFOSR. The Government has certain rights in the invention.

The present disclosure relates to an analog to digital converter employing active controlled spoofed surface plasmon polariton architecture.

Structures and devices designed to work in the frequency range of 0.1 10 THz are proved to be essential in imaging spectroscopy biosensing and other applications alike. They are also strong candidates for building the next generation integrated circuits that will eventually close the gap between electronics and optics. Concentration of terahertz radiation in small volumes can facilitate the sub wavelength transmission of the signal generating new possibilities for low loss low dispersion delivery of terahertz radiation over distance. The strong confinement of the E M field can also enhance the signal matter interaction hence maximizing the modulation efficiency in active device designs.

Strong mode localization at terahertz frequency is realized by adding periodic surface features onto the material interface of conventional waveguide structures. Unlike using resonant structures with dimensions comparable with the wavelength the metamaterial created by the sub wavelength surface modifications can support a special surface mode named spoofed surface plasmon polariton SSPP mode. With discrete transmission peaks and valleys the SSPP modes can be modulated by changing geometric dimensions and material parameters of the structure. In most of the studies employing SSPP terahertz architectures the discrete passing bands and their amplitude modulation due to external stimuli serve at the backbone of the device functionality.

Kramers Kronig relationship dictates coupled evolution of the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant. Therefore the change in transmittance must be accompanied with the shift in phase accumulation. The inclusion of phase information is hence critical in the effort to achieve higher resolution and sensitivity for the SSPP terahertz devices. A metamaterial terahertz phase modulator based on metallic split ring resonator design has been proposed. In the proposed design voltage across the Schottky contact formed by the doped semiconductor GaAs layer and metal electrode causes depletion of free carriers changing the complex transmittance of the structure at terahertz frequencies. Phase modulators in the form of waveguides have also been proposed and fabricated by a number of research groups where doped Si is used to form a thin strip ring resonator. The phase of the propagating signal can be adjusted by free carrier injection through a p i n junction and as a result the coupling efficiency of the ring resonator can be modulated. Due to the large loss tangent of Si in terahertz domain however such design can only be effectively applied up to near infrared frequencies.

In this disclosure a terahertz beam bender is presented that can be actively controlled through free carrier density modulations. Based on this phenomenon a multibit analog to digital converter ADC can be realized that utilizes terahertz signals. The disclosure is organized as follows. First the mathematical analysis of the DC SSPP structure will be briefly described and phase modulation with refractive index change in a simplified model will be presented. Next finite element simulations for the terahertz beam bender operating in the enhancement mode and depletion mode will be discussed followed by a section on design and analysis of the ADC.

This section provides background information related to the present disclosure which is not necessarily prior art.

This section provides a general summary of the disclosure and is not a comprehensive disclosure of its full scope or all of its features.

An analog to digital converter is presented. The analog to digital converter includes an interferometer a modulator interfaced with the interferometer and an array of detectors spatially separated from the interferometer by the propagation space and arranged to receive an interference wave from the interferometer. The interferometer has an input configured to receive a carrier signal and two arms. Each arm is configured to guide a spoofed surface plasmon polariton wave from one end of the arm to the free end of the arm such that the spoofed surface plasmon polariton waves propagate at a speed slower than the carrier signal and are emitted from the free end of each arm into a propagation space and combine in the propagation space to form an interference wave. The modulator modulates the carrier signal in at least one of the two arms with a modulating signal where the modulating signal has an amplitude in a predefined range of values and the radiation pattern of the interference wave in a far field of the propagation space is shifted in accordance with the amplitude of the modulating signal.

Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the description provided herein. The description and specific examples in this summary are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.

Corresponding reference numerals indicate corresponding parts throughout the several views of the drawings.

The wavevectors as solved by 1 and 2 are functions of the refractive index n. As a result when n is modulated by certain external stimuli the wavevector will be altered correspondingly. show the dispersion relation of an example DC SSPP waveguide with dimensions

In a significant shift of the overall phase accumulation can be observed for the two frequencies chosen which when applied to a MZI structure will give rise to changing interferometric output. In the design of terahertz beam bender this MZI architecture is applied to achieve deflected beam radiation in the far field. To realize active external control doped semiconductor is chosen as the dielectric material and modulation to the refractive index is induced by injecting or depleting the free carriers within the semiconductor layer. While specific reference is made throughout this disclosure to terahertz signals it is understood that the concepts described herein are applicable to signals having different frequencies for example ranging from 100 GHz to 30 THz.

The working modes based on injection and depletion of free carriers in doped semiconductor are known as the enhancement mode and the depletion mode respectively. This terminology is used to refer to two different types of terahertz beam bender designs in the following sections. As the mathematical model can only predict phase modulation of simple architectures with accuracy finite element simulations are performed on the realistic beam bender structures in order to verify the idea and optimize the design.

The dielectric constant of semiconductor as a function of frequency follows the Drude model. As a result of optical phonon vibrations of the crystal lattice in heteropolar semiconductors the Drude model needs to be modified for these materials in terahertz frequencies and is expressed as

As an example the dielectric constant of GaAs is calculated as a function of frequency and free carrier density using 4 and the result is illustrated in . With the free carrier concentration of N 2 10cm the phonon resonance can be clearly marked by the sharp peak at in the curve of imaginary versus frequency and abrupt change in the curve of real to be 8.05 THz. To illustrate the significance of the phonon resonance the dielectric constant calculated without the second term in 4 is also included in thin dashed line at with visibly large discrepancies.

Among the common semiconductor materials GaAs has low intrinsic free carrier density moderate carrier mobility and electron effective mass. As observed from in terahertz frequencies GaAs demonstrates effective change of the real with different free carrier densities as indicated at and mild change to the small imaginary at the same time as indicated at . Such properties are desirable in this application where large modulation depth and stable power output throughout the working range are required. As a result GaAs is deployed as the semiconductor material in the design of the terahertz beam bender. While particular reference is made to GaAs it is readily understood that other types of semiconductor materials having low intrinsic free carrier density moderate carrier mobility and electron effective mass such as InSb also fall within the scope of this disclosure.

In the example embodiment the entire beam bender structure is made of an intrinsic semiconductor e.g. GaAs covered by metal with an exception in the grooves where dopants are introduced to create a thin layer of n type GaAs. In some embodiments dopants may be introduced throughout the entire region of grooves or some select portions thereof depending on the application. In other embodiments the intrinsic semiconductor material is encased in a metal structure of varying dimensions e.g. thickness . Although not a focus of this particular report this structure can be fabricated following conventional procedures including electron beam lithography for patterning dopant implantation for defining the n GaAs region and physical vapor deposition for forming the metal shell.

For the beam bender spoofed surface plasmon polariton SSPP waves are derived from the input carrier signal and traverse through the arms of the waveguide along the metal dielectric interface where the SSPP waves propagate at a speed slower than the input carrier wave. In particular the SSPP mode is largely confined to the groove region near resonance. The localized n GaAs can therefore effectively lower the insertion loss of the device without sacrificing the performance.

Free carriers are injected into the semiconductor material of one or both arms via an external stimulus. Such stimuli can be thermal optical or electrical depending on its specific applications. For example thermal carrier injection can be achieved via direct thermal contact of the heated metal. In another example free carriers are injected electrically using a metal electrode formed on an exterior surface of the beam bender. A forward bias voltage is applied to the junction formed by the metal and the semiconductor. The applied voltage serves as a modulating signal having an amplitude selected from a predefined range of values. In either case free carriers are injected into the semiconductor which in turn changes the effective refractive index of the material. Consequently the radiation pattern i.e. angle of radiation of wave in the far field is shifted in accordance with the amplitude of the modulating signal.

HFSS is used to simulate the beam bender structure as mentioned previously with the dimensions of each SSPP arm being

The slight nonlinearity of the curve in comes from the modified Drude model. From equations 4 and 5 and it is easy to notice the linear evolution of with N. The phase change on the other hand is proportional to n square root over square root over N . A simple mathematic routine of Taylor expansion however shows that such nonlinearity can be mostly corrected when carriers are injected in both arms in a differential manner. That is the carrier density in one arm is increased while that in the other arm is decreased keeping the overall carrier concentration a constant. This may be accomplished for example by applying modulating signals to both arms of the interferometer such that the modulating signals are 180 degrees out of phase with each other. The insertion loss on the other hand is obtained as the portion of output power versus input to be 4 dB. About 2 dB of this loss is found to come from reflection of the bifurcated MZI structure and the Fabry Perot F P echelon effect which can be further alleviated by optimizing the design therein.

In addition to the given example the beam bending effect is not confined by specific structural dimensions. In fact the initial doping concentration of n GaAs and operating frequency of the structure can change in pairs as long as the imaginary refractive index is not too large to prevent effective wave propagation. Correspondingly the dimensions of the structure can be adjusted in scale making this design highly adaptable to various requirements. As an example using 4 the operating frequencies of initial doping density of N 2 10cmand N 2 10cmare calculated to be 11 and 24 THz corresponding to the refractive indices of n 2.54 i0.03 and n 2.49 i0.02 respectively. For these operating frequencies the beam bender has the size of d 4.2 m and d 1.9 m individually. The output angle as a function of free carrier density in those two cases and is illustrated in . Similarly the beam deflection is accompanied with nonlinearity which can be effectively overcome when differential carrier injection is applied. The refractive indices in these two cases are chosen such that the insertion losses are comparable and of which a significant contribution still comes from the MZI structure itself.

Since the doping concentration of GaAs layer is much higher than its intrinsic free carrier density N 2.1 10cm the beam bender can also operate in depletion mode. In this mode a Schottky contact is formed by the metal electrode and the underlying semiconductor material. By applying a negative biased voltage across the Schottky contact the free carriers will be extracted and a depletion zone will be formed. The thickness of the depletion zone as a function of the external voltage is given by

In depletion mode a similar MZI structure is used as in enhancement mode with the only exception of the n type GaAs which in this case occupies the entire groove region. In the depletion mode when the n GaAs in one arm is depleted by various thicknesses via external voltage the phase of the propagating terahertz signal is changed and the output radiation is deflected accordingly. Such deflection effect is also illustrated at in for the structure with dimensions

Similar to the enhancement mode the beam bender in the depletion mode can operate with different combinations of frequency and doping concentrations. In the output angle as a function of the control voltage for different initial doping concentrations up to N 4 10cmare shown and compared by and . The dimension of the structure is adjusted to d 4.4 m and d 3.7 m for the cases of N 2 10cmand N 4 10cm respectively and the operating frequencies are chosen such that effective beam deflection and comparable insertion loss are obtained. In all circumstances the nonlinear increase of the deflection angle is caused by the proportionality between Dand square root over V V . Again such nonlinearity can be mostly corrected when differential voltage is applied to both arms of the MZI structure.

Earlier the beam bending effect of the DC SSPP architecture was demonstrated. The ability to control the deflection angle of the output through external stimuli makes such a structure valuable in building a number of active devices. A spatial resolved terahertz ADC is one of the many important applications.

Analog to digital conversion is an indispensable technology for mixed signal circuits. Although electronic ADCs have been primarily used for the task alternatives such as optically assisted and all optical ADCs have been intensely studied to overcome the performance limitations of the electronic ADCs. Among them the idea of an optical ADC operating on diverted far field radiation patterns has been proposed by H. F. Taylor in the An optical analog to digital converter Design and analysis IEEE J. Quantum Electron Vol. 15 No. 4 pp. 210 216 April 1979 where multiple phase shifters with geometrically increasing lengths were used. In recent years further works have been conducted in an effort to realize high speed analog to digital conversion. For example others have used the quantum confined Stark effect to induce the phase change in one or both arms of an MZI waveguide consisting of travelling wave shifters. The diverted beam is received by detector arrays arranged in binary manner and digitized output is readout directly.

Despite its wide bandwidth BW in theory the speed advantage of optical ADC has yet been fully utilized due to the lack of resonant conversion between photons and electrons. Terahertz frequency band on the other hand can interact coherently with electronics and is hence a more promising candidate for building high speed integrated components. A terahertz ADC design can serve as a gateway to emerging landscapes of broadband terahertz assisted as well as all terahertz systems.

In the terahertz domain the index guiding waveguide design shows small modal confinement factor and high signal power loss hence is incapable of delivering signals at these frequencies with good beam quality and radiation efficiency. To overcome this problem the DC SSPP structure is applied to realize confined propagation of terahertz wave in the form of a spoofed surface mode. Room temperature spatial resolved ADC operations employing terahertz carrier signals can be realized by having the DC SSPP beam bender as the first stage as is shown in the architecture shown in .

In the proposed ADC design depletion mode is chosen as the operating mode to enable beam steering and the control voltage serves as the analog input. The change in the position of radiation maxima can be interpreted into binary bits by the detector arrays when their positions and properties are carefully designed.

In the example embodiment the beam deflector stage of the terahertz ADC consists of 10 periods of grooves on each arm of the interferometer structure and has dimensions of

In ideal cases of the ADC design employing beam steering mechanisms the main peak of the radiation pattern needs to be coupled independently into separate detectors in order to directly readout the digitized bits of the analog input. By applying classic diffraction theories it is easy to conclude that in this case at least N 2phase shifters in the first stage are needed in order to realize an n bit ADC. In this design however only two SSPP branches are used to form the MZI structure. Therefore for any attempt to have more than 1 bit digitized output the radiation peak can only be partially coupled into separate detectors. The outcome as a result of the partial coupling is shown in where eight identical linear detectors are used in an attempt to obtain a 3 bit output. It is observed that only one period of the sign change can be obtained at for all 3 bits in this case which indicates an actual ADC resolution of only 1 bit.

To tackle this problem detectors operating in saturated conditions are employed. With carefully designed gains and nonlinearities for the detector arrays up to 2periods of sign change within 2 phase shift for the nth bit output can be achieved. In Table II an example of such a design for an array of eight detectors from the top to the bottom as shown in is summarized. The non unity relative gain is used to emphasize the edges of the main radiation peak. The saturation power is determined in a way that a considerable width centered on the peak position is deemed as equal by the detectors and its value is given in the arbitrary unit so that it can be in reality proportionally adjusted to fit different terahertz source and detector specifications. shows the digitized readout and from such detector array. A 3 bit output can be obtained in this case with the analog input voltage changing from 0 to 3 V. It should be noted that in the actual realization of the ADC the detector arrays will have finite width along the transverse dimension y axis of the output beam. Due to the nonuniform power distribution along this direction the gains and nonlinearities of the detector stages need to be adjusted accordingly.

The effort to increase the operating bandwidth of electrical sampling ADC is challenged by the relatively large temporal jitter of the sampling signal. Recent developments in optical ADC have attempted to solve this problem using ultra stable sampling pulses of mode locked lasers whereas the speed of operation of such design is still limited by the bandwidth of the E O modulator stage. Despite the small jitter of the pulses the repetition rate of the state of the art mode locked laser is mostly in the sub gigahertz range. As a result to date the bandwidth characterization of optical sampling ADCs is carried out by either using sinusoidal continuous wave analog input or by generating significantly aliased signals after digitization with under sampling.

In the proposed terahertz ADC design it is helpful to calculate the operating bandwidth of the beam deflector stage analogy to the E O modulator stage in optical ADC which will provide a good idea of the speed performance of the design in comparison with its optical counterparts. In depletion mode the Schottky contact formed by the electrode and doped GaAs layer contributes to a finite phase settling time of the modulator which in turn will determine the operating bandwidth of the stage as described by the following formula 

When the space charge region is reasonably thin and the electric field is not very strong the carrier transit time of a Schottky contact can be calculated mathematically. When the two terminals are separated by a distance comparable with the mean free path of the carrier motion the electrons undergo ballistic transport which is best described as the accelerated motion under the external bias voltage. The dc transit time in this case can be obtained as

The realistic is therefore estimated with the following equation with d being the carrier displacement 

The RC time constant on the other hand is determined by the series resistance and the barrier capacitance of the Schottky contact. These characteristic impedance values are dependent on the geometric dimension of the contact and are further influenced by nonideality factors such as skin effect carrier inertia and displacement current. In a realistic situation one can define the dielectric relaxation frequency and the scattering frequency to count for the effect of the above mentioned nonidealities

In the example beam bending structure the surface area of the substrate on the groove region is A 14.2 m 3.3 m. To the first order of approximation choose r 3.86 m in the calculation to represent a substrate of the same area. The RC time constant is plotted against the radius r in .

In the RC time constant increases proportionally with the Schottky contact radius when skin effect carrier inertia and displacement current are not considered in the calculation as indicated as . In real world scenarios however those nonideality factors can have a significant influence on the characteristic impedance of the contact as indicated at and RC time constant is seen to deteriorate greatly from the ideal case when it is close to the plasmonic resonance frequency of GaAs. In this case is reasonably far from such resonance with the Schottky contact having the same area as the substrate and is calculated to be 1.2 ps.

Taking both and back into 7 the maximum operating speed of our ADC is estimated to be 63.7 GS s. It is noted that both the carrier transit time and the RC time constant can be further reduced by incorporating higher initial doping concentration of the n GaAs region which will feature smaller device dimensions as well as a thinner space charge region.

In variants of these concepts ADC bit resolution can be increased by adding interference arms to the beam bending structure as shown in . Moreover sampling frequency can be further increased by using the concept of temporal interleaving as shown in . As illustrated the sampling rate can be increase by more than four times. By scaling the temporal interleaving structure it is envisioned that the sampling frequency can be increased even more. These techniques can lead to a ADC with very high sampling rates and an implementation of 250 to 500 GS s as shown in .

In this disclosure a terahertz beam steering structure is designed utilizing SSPP mode E M propagation through the doubly corrugated closed waveguide having sub wavelength dimensions. The SSPP mode propagation is further enhanced by adding a thin layer of doped n GaAs on the groove walls of the waveguide. The modulation to the free carrier concentration of GaAs causes the change in phase for the propagating terahertz wave which by combining two corrugated waveguides to construct an interferometer can induce significant deflection of the output beam.

The beam bender can operate in either the enhancement mode or the depletion mode depending on the nature of the free carrier density modulation. In the enhancement mode free carriers are injected thermally optically or electronically into the GaAs layer. In the depletion mode free carriers are extracted from the semiconductor via an external voltage across the Schottky contact. In both cases the radiation angle of the output is effectively modulated. The visible nonlinear change of the diversion angle can be effectively corrected when differential controls are applied to the double arms of the MZI structure. The dielectric constant of the GaAs varies with its free carrier concentration as well as frequency. As a result for both operating modes different combinations of the two parameters can be used to optimize the design making it highly adaptable to various applications.

In an effort to achieve higher operating speed for analog to digital conversion the SSPP beam bender is utilized in a spatial resolved binary encoded sensor array with terahertz response time. With a differential voltage input asserted to both the arms of the MZI a symmetric deflection angle change as large as 20 is achieved with nearly perfect linearity. Due to the beam steering effect being realized with only two interferometric branches the far field radiation pattern is not suitable for coupling into independent detectors. As a result detectors with carefully designed gains and saturation powers are used in order to readout multiple bits. By employing the beam deflector operating in depletion mode a 3 bit ADC is realized with the speed of operation exceeding 60 GS s. The maximum speed of the device is limited by the drifting carrier transit time across the space charge region as well as the parasitic RC constant of the Schottky contact. These time constants can be potentially minimized with a higher initial doping concentration of the n GaAs that will further boost the operating BW of the proposed ADC design.
