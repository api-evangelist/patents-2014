The present disclosure is related and claims priority as a continuing application to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 843 563 entitled INDIVIDUAL LOCATION TRACKING IN DETENTION ENVIRONMENTS by Grant Gongaware et al. and filed on Mar. 15 2013 the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes.

The present disclosure generally relates to computer systems and more particularly to the use of a computer system to monitor a location of an individual.

Many detention environments attempt to keep an updated record of a location of individuals or residents at the facility in order to provide appropriate limited access to the individual to items or spaces in the facility. In order to maintain the record the detention environment or controlled facility which may be a correctional facility e.g. detention center jail or prison military installation or even secure office location commonly requires facility staff to manually update the location of individuals in the facility in a legacy system. For example in a correction facility a jail management system is manually updated with recent user e.g. a resident or inmate location data such as an identification of the cell or home room to which the resident is assigned.

In many cases because the updates of an individual s location are input manually by facility staff the location of the individual recorded in the legacy system is often in disagreement with the actual location of the individual. The incorrect information can last from a period of a few minutes to many days or weeks. The out of date information can cause denial of access to items or physical spaces the individual would otherwise have access to if the legacy system were updated with the individual s current location.

For example in a correction facility there are often a limited number of communication terminals e.g. telephones video visitation stations etc. by which a large number of residents may communicate with visitors family and friends. As residents usually do not have access to terminals outside the physical space in which they reside a resident must commonly reserve a terminal or book use of the terminal e.g. by walking up to and laying claim to the terminal at a time for a scheduled visit so as to ensure the availability of the terminal to the resident. Furthermore to allow incoming telephone calls to be routed to a terminal that the resident to whom the call is intended has access to particularly those telephone calls that are not pre scheduled it is necessary to know which location the resident is currently in. Residents who are unable to make or receive telephone calls or video visitations after being moved to a new location are likely to file formal complaints stating that they are unable to contact friends family or legal representation for some period after being moved. These complaints tie up the valuable time of facility staff for example to arrange an update for a resident s location identified in the jail management system and these complaints cause both the facility and communications provider to incur costs such as legal costs or other related costs.

It is understood that other configurations of the subject technology will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description wherein various configurations of the subject technology are shown and described by way of illustration. As will be realized the subject technology is capable of other and different configurations and its several details are capable of modification in various other respects all without departing from the scope of the subject technology. Accordingly the drawings and detailed description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.

In the following detailed description numerous specific details are set forth to provide a full understanding of the present disclosure. It will be apparent however to one ordinarily skilled in the art that the embodiments of the present disclosure may be practiced without some of these specific details. In other instances well known structures and techniques have not been shown in detail so as not to obscure the disclosure.

It is desirable to devise a system in which a current location of an individual user or resident within a facility can be determined automatically thus ensuring proper access rights are provided to physical spaces and items such as phones allowing a greater degree of accuracy to be applied to that resident s biometric identification. In certain aspects the term resident is understood to refer to an individual subject to a detention environment e.g. residing or secured in or on parole work release or probation from jails prisons detention facilities secured hospitals or addiction treatment facilities . If a resident can be determined to be in a location then that resident s biometric information such as voiceprint fingerprint facial recognition may be compared to those known to be in the same physical space rather than all individuals in a facility. This allows greater accuracy when using biometric identification which in turn provides greater protection against fraudulent activity such as falsely logging into a phone as a different individual and using that resident s calling funds. It is also desirable to obtain date and time information for the resident s location in the detention environment so that movement of the resident can be chronologically identified. It is further desirable to have a system that automatically updates a resident s location within the detention environment that interfaces with and independently verifies a manually updated resident s location provided by an official record of resident status.

This disclosed system updates a location of a resident in a detention environment based on usage of a communications terminal by the resident. As a result incorrect or delayed updates from an official record of resident status are disregarded or corrected. For example the disclosed system may use two forms of authentication. An initial authentication such as a personal identification number PIN is provided first for a resident by a user e.g. the resident presumably being the user . If the initial authentication is received at a communications terminal that the resident identified by the initial authentication is not associated with then a secondary authentication that can be input by only the correct user can be required because the initial authentication can be input by any user. The secondary authentication can be a biometric identification such as a voiceprint or facial scan that identifies the resident s identity and location of the communications terminal that is otherwise not previously associated with the resident. The association between the communications terminal and the resident can then be updated based on the successful authorization at the communications terminal so that the resident can subsequently log into the communications terminal using just the initial authentication.

While many examples are provided herein in the context of a correction facility the principles of the present disclosure contemplate other types of controlled facilities as well. For example businesses and governmental entities e.g. administrative or military are all considered within the scope of the present disclosure. Furthermore although many examples provided herein describe a resident s location information being stored in memory permission is granted for each resident to have such resident location information stored. In the context of a detention environment permission may be granted by the resident agreeing to be present in the detention environment or by another entity with appropriate legal authorization to grant permission to track the location of the resident in the detention environment. Each resident can be provided notice that such resident information will be stored. The stored resident information may be encrypted to protect resident security.

Each of the communications terminals is connected to a communications manager . In certain aspects for purposes of load balancing the communications terminals can be connected to many communications managers. The communications terminals can be audio communication terminals video communication terminals tactile communications terminals e.g. for the visual and or hearing impaired or other terminals configured for communication between two individuals. In certain aspects the communication terminals can be mobile such as mobile smartphones or mobile kiosks. The communications manager to which the communications terminals are connected can be for example a networking device such as a router gateway or switch. The communications manager can be configured for various protocols of communication including for example Internet Protocol IP voice over IP VoIP audio and video Internet telephony network protocols or telephone switching.

The communications manager is connected to the network such as the Internet a metropolitan area network MAN a wide area network WAN a broadband network BBN and the like. Further the network can include but is not limited to any one or more of the following network topologies including a bus network a star network a ring network a mesh network a star bus network tree or hierarchical network and the like. In certain aspects where the communications server is located at the detention environment the network can include for example any one or more of a personal area network PAN a local area network LAN or a campus area network CAN . The connection between the communications manager and the network can be protected using a communications firewall which can be particularly relevant to protecting the security of the detention environment by limiting log ins to devices in the detention environment to authorized residents or processes.

The facility management server is a system of record for storing the facility s official record of resident status. The facility management server is also configured to receive user entered e.g. manual information regarding the access rights of a resident in the detention environment to log into one or many of the communications terminals . The facility management server is accessible from the facility management terminal which can be for example a desktop computer mobile computer tablet computer mobile device or any other device having appropriate processor memory and communications capabilities. The user entered information can include an identifier of an assigned location for a resident in the detention environment . The access rights can be location based or resident based. For example permission to log into a communications terminal can be defined according to constructs such as groups.

Groups may be used to subdivide portions of the detention environment and to differentiate locations and residents in the detention environment so as to provide group specific permissions for communications terminals associated with those groups. For example a location is designated as a shared location if access to the shared location and any communications terminal in the shared location is provided to multiple but not all residents in the detention environment . Permission to log into a communications terminal in the shared location can for instance be authorized for a group of residents in a first location of the detention environment e.g. a first jail unit and residents in a second location of the detention environment e.g. a second jail unit but not for a group of residents in another location of the detention environment e.g. a third jail unit . A location is designated as a common location if access to the common location and any communications terminal in the common location is provided to all residents in the detention environment . A communications terminal may be located in e.g. assigned to a shared unshared common or other type of location.

The facility management server may assign residents or groups of residents to a specific unshared location or home room in addition to shared and common locations. Residents are then permitted to log into communications terminals located in their home room in shared rooms associated with the home room and in common rooms accessible to the entire facility or alternately shared rooms accessible to a subset of the facility associated with the group of which that the collection of rooms is a member.

The communications server is connected to the network through the communications server firewall . The communications server is responsible for hosting resident location information provided by the communications terminals for residents in the detention environment . The communications server can be any device having an appropriate processor memory and communications capability for hosting the terminal based resident location information.

In certain aspects the communications server receives an update from a communications terminal regarding a location of a resident upon the resident successfully accessing the communications terminal . A user may successfully log in to a communications terminal as a resident by providing at least a first form of authentication such as a PIN to identify the resident. The PIN may be preceded by the user identifying which resident the user is e.g. by name in the detention environment. If the identified resident does not currently have permission to log into the communications terminal such as where the resident is part of a group that is not associated with the communications terminal then the user is prompted for a second form of identification for instance a biometric identification such as a voiceprint. In certain aspects the user may initially be prompted for the second form identification thereby bypassing the first form of authentication. If the second form of identification is verified the user is permitted to log into the communications terminal as the resident and the terminal based user location information stored on the communications server is updated to reflect an updated location for the resident so that the resident has permission to log into the communications terminal .

The communications server is also configured to obtain resident assigned location information from the facility management server . The resident assigned location information can be obtained for example during regularly scheduled requests from the communications server to the facility management server . If the resident assigned location information is identified as being more current than the terminal based resident location information of the communications server e.g. if the resident assigned location information has a more recent timestamp or is for a new location not previously identified in the terminal based resident location information then the terminal based resident location information is updated with the resident assigned location information from the facility management server . In certain aspects if the terminal based resident location information is determined to be more accurate than the resident assigned location information then the communications server can update the resident assigned location information on the facility management server . The update can be provided for example using an application programming interface for the facility management server .

The ability to automatically detect and verify that a resident in a detention environment has moved even when the resident assigned location information of the facility management server has not yet been updated allows the resident to for example use communications terminals or receive deliveries immediately after moving to the new location. Additionally a visualization of the resident s movement over time can be provided. Automatic detection and verification avoids tasking facility staff or telecommunications provider staff with manually updating the resident assigned location information and avoids having the resident be unable to communicate using the communications terminal . Furthermore the communications server is configured to provide current location information e.g. in a report for any resident in response to a request such as might be needed during an emergency evacuation.

Furthermore in addition to tracking the location of residents in the detention environment the communications terminals can be used to track the location of staff e.g. security guards or officers in a correction facility as a way to verify completion of assigned rounds and to cross reference staff and resident locations in order to track and record occurrences of staff being present in locations that are germane to relevant inquiries or reports. For example in a correction facility tracking of staff can be referenced when a staff member picks up an inmate phone and enters the staff member s own PIN.

Although the disclosed architecture permits an automated process of granting residents permission to log into communications terminals it will be obvious to one skilled in the art that the communications terminal and the communications server by nature of the recording of actual resident location each time the resident logs into a communications terminal can be used to generate a list map or other report detailing each resident s likely current location and history of movement throughout the detention environment .

The communications terminal which can be a telephone videophone or camera includes a processor or connected downstream to a processor e.g. at communications server the communications module and a memory that includes an application . Although the communications terminal is illustrated as including the processor for example only it is understood that in certain aspects where for example the communications terminal is a telephone the processor is not included in the communications terminal. The application is configured to control log ins to the communications terminal . The communications terminal also includes an input device and an output device such as a display. The input device can include for example a keyboard a touchpad a microphone a camera touchscreen or mouse.

The processor of the communications terminal is configured to execute instructions such as instructions physically coded into the processor instructions received from software e.g. application in memory or a combination of both to restrict logging in based on the location of the communications terminal within a detention environment . For example the processor of the communications terminal executes instructions from the application to receive e.g. by input device a request from a user to log into the communications terminal . The request includes a first authentication for a resident provided by the user. The first authentication can be for example a PIN a text or image password a username and password combination a visual shape or pattern or a touch motion. The processor is configured to verify the first authentication provided by the user and identify the user based on the verified first authentication. For example using respective communications modules and the processor can send a request to the communications server that includes the first authentication provided by the user. The processor of the communications server can compare the received first authentication against terminal based resident location information in the memory of the communications server to determine whether the first authentication is valid and whether the resident associated with the first authentication has permission to log in to use the communications terminal . For example a determination that the identified resident is restricted from logging into the communications terminal can be based on comparing a stored location of the resident e.g. from resident assigned location information on the facility management server with the location of the communications terminal and determining that the stored location of the resident is different than the location of the communications terminal . The terminal based resident location information can be initially generated using the resident assigned location information and can be updated when a resident first successfully logs into a communications terminal from a different location than the location for the resident indicated in the resident assigned location information .

The processor is further configured to determine based on the location of the communications terminal whether the identified resident is restricted from logging into the communications terminal . For instance the communications terminal may be located in an area to which the resident or the resident s group does not have permission to log in from. A determination based on information provided in the response from the communications server that the resident is restricted from logging into the communications terminal can include determining that the stored location e.g. in the resident assigned location information of the facility management server of the resident restricts the resident from logging in to terminals in the actual location of the communications terminal .

When it is determined that the resident identified by the user s first authentication is restricted e.g. by the facility management server from logging into the communications terminal the processor is configured to provide for display a prompt requesting a second authentication from the user. The prompt can be visible or audible. The second authentication can be one or a combination of physiological biometric identifications or behavioral biometric identifications. Example physiological biometric identifications include the resident s voice DNA finger print palm print retinal scan facial scan iris scan vein matching. Example behavioral biometric identifications include the resident s handwriting sample typing rhythm gait or voice.

Upon receiving the second authentication from the user e.g. using input device the processor of the communications terminal verifies the second authentication provided by the user. Similar to verification of the first authentication the processor can send a request to the communications server that includes the second authentication provided by the user. The processor of the communications server can compare the received second authentication against the terminal based resident location information to determine whether the second authentication is valid. If a determination e.g. based on information provided in the response from the communications server is made that the second authentication is valid thereby indicating that a biometrically matching resident is at the communications terminal then the processor is configured to permit the user to log into the communications terminal e.g. as the resident based on the verified second authentication.

In certain aspects the processor of the communications terminal or the processor of the communications server is configured to update the resident assigned location information of the facility management server based on the location of the communications terminal when the second authentication provided by the user is verified. For example the resident assigned location information can be updated with the current location of the resident e.g. based on the location of the communications terminal using an application programming interface configured to update the resident assigned location information . In certain aspects updating the stored location of the resident based on the location of the communications terminal can include storing an identification of a time at which the request from the resident to log into the communications terminal is received. For example the resident assigned location information can be updated to include a time and day at which the resident successfully logged into the communications terminal in addition to updating the resident assigned location information with the location of the user.

In certain aspects the processor of the communications terminal or the processor of the communications server is configured to update the stored location of the resident e.g. in the terminal based user location information with location information received from a resident database e.g. from resident assigned location information of the facility management server . The stored location can be updated when the information from the resident database indicates that the actual location of the resident is different than the stored location of the resident or the location of the communications terminal or that a user is otherwise attempting to log into the communications terminal as the resident in an unauthorized manner. For example if the resident assigned location information indicates that a resident is located in Residential Unit C and the terminal based resident location information indicates the resident is currently located in Residential Unit and further indicates the resident has not successfully placed a call from a communications terminal in Unit C or otherwise been located in Unit C then the terminal based resident location information can be updated to reflect the resident s location in Residential Unit C and provide appropriate log in permission to the resident to communication terminals in Residential Unit C.

Although the disclosed block diagram illustrates the terminal based resident location information as being stored in the memory of the communications server the terminal based user location information can be stored in the memory of the communications terminal or the communications server can be located in the detention environment . For example the terminal based user location information can be provided by the communications server to one or many communications terminals for example as a form of data replication.

In decision step a determination is made whether the first authentication is active e.g. valid . If the determination of step indicates the first authentication is not active the process ends in step . If the determination of step indicates the first authentication is active the process proceeds to decision step in which a determination is made whether the resident s assigned location as already present in the communications server database and based on the synchronization process described above is the same as the current location e.g. of the communications terminal . If the determination of step indicates that the resident s assigned location is the same as the current location then the user is logged in to the communications terminal e.g. as the resident in step and the process ends in step .

If the determination of step indicates that the user s assigned location is not the same as the current location then the user is prompted for a second authentication in step and the user may then in step provide second authentication. Next in decision step a determination is made whether the second authentication matches a valid authentication for the identified resident e.g. a matching fingerprint or voiceprint .

If the determination of step indicates the second authentication is a match the process proceeds to decision step in which a determination is made whether the current location is a common location. Optionally if the determination of step indicates the second authentication is not a match e.g. does not provide a sample or provides an incorrect sample an appropriate authority may be informed of the attempted use and follow up with the resident identified by the first authentication. If the determination of step indicates that the current location is a common location the user is authorized using the second authentication in step and the process ends in step . If the determination of step indicates that the current location is not a common location the terminal based user location information for the resident on the communications server is updated with the current location of the user and the process proceeds to step where the user is authorized. The process then ends in step . Depending on the desires of the facility management the new terminal base user location may be reported to the facility staff which may then update their resident assigned location or investigate whether the inmate is in an unauthorized or undocumented area.

If the determination of step indicates the second authentication is not a match the process proceeds to step in which the user login is rejected and a denial message is displayed on the communications terminal in step . Next the user login attempt is recorded in step and the process ends in step .

The correction facility illustrated in includes two nodular cell block buildings or pods Pod A and Pod B . Pod A is illustrated in detail. Pod A includes a first unit Unit which includes a number of cells for housing residents of the correction facility . Unit also includes three communications terminals namely two videophones and and one telephone . Pod A also includes a second unit Unit similar to Unit which also includes a number of cells for housing residents of the correction facility . Unit also includes three communications terminals namely two videophones and and one telephone . Pod A also includes one shared location namely a law library . The law library also includes one communications terminal videophone

Pod A further includes a public visitation room that includes one communications terminal videophone . Access to the public visitation room is restricted to outside visitors for the purpose of conducting on site video visitations using videophone and thus none of the residents are permitted to log into the videophone . The detention environment also includes a common location outside of Pod A namely an exercise yard between Pod A and Pod B with one communications terminal videophone

With reference to residents of Pod A Unit are allowed to use Law Library A and exercise yard but may not enter Unit . Likewise residents in Unit of Pod A are allowed to use Law Library A and exercise yard but may not enter Unit . Similarly residents of either unit in Pod B may use the exercise yard but may not enter Pod A . Residents of Unit in Pod A are allowed to use the Law Library A and exercise yard but may not enter Unit . Likewise residents in Unit of Pod A are allowed to use Law Library A and Exercise Yard but may not enter Unit . Similarly inmates of Unit and Unit in Pod B may use the Exercise Yard and their own Law Library B but may not enter Pod s Law Library A or any of its Units and . The exercise yard is defined as a common location or common room to which all inmates at the facility have access. Likewise Law Library A is defined as a shared location or shared room which only some inmates at the facility have access to namely those residing in Unit and Unit . The Public Visitation room can be defined as a visitation room which is restricted to outside visitors for the purpose of conducting on site video visitations and thus none of the inmates are allowed access to or to use telecommunications terminals therein. Telephone and or video visitation terminals may be located in any or all of these types of rooms.

With reference to the example process of the process begins by proceeding from start step when a resident currently residing in Unit attempts to use the videophone as a user. The resident was recently transferred from Unit to Unit but the resident assigned location information in the jail management system was not updated with the resident s location in Unit .

Upon arriving in Unit the resident in step attempts to log into the videophone by entering the resident s unique PIN to identify the resident to the videophone . Using previously existing systems the resident would not be able to successfully log in to the videophone because the videophone would rely on outdated information from the resident assigned location information .

In decision step the videophone asks the communications server if the PIN is valid e.g. with reference to the terminal based resident location information . The determination of step indicates the PIN is valid according to the communications server and the process proceeds to decision step in which the videophone asks the communications server whether the resident s assigned location e.g. with reference to the terminal based resident location information is the same as the current location e.g. Unit in which the videophone is located . The determination of step indicates that the resident s assigned location of Unit as reported by the resident assigned location information of the jail management system is not the same as the resident s current location Unit so the resident is prompted for a biometric identification in step namely a voiceprint sample of the resident s name.

Biometric identification of the resident is advantageous in that it is more accurate in identifying the resident than a PIN because biometric identification requires a physical presence and is therefore much more difficult to impersonate. Requirement of a physical presence as a form of identification makes it more difficult to steal trade copy or fabricate the biometric identification. The authentication provided by biometric identification protects against a resident using another resident s PIN to get around restrictions based on available funds for the videophone or prohibited contacts.

Next in decision step the videophone asks the communications server if the voiceprint of the resident s name provided by the resident to the videophone is valid for the identified resident e.g. with reference to the terminal based resident location information . The determination of step indicates the voiceprint is valid according to the communications server and the process proceeds to decision step in which a determination is made whether the current location Unit is a common location e.g. like the exercise yard . The determination of step indicates that Unit is not a common location so the terminal based resident location information on the communications server is updated with the current location Unit of the resident along with the time and date of the resident s use of the videophone . The process proceeds to step where the resident is authorized to use the videophone and the process then ends in step .

In decision step a determination is made whether the resident assigned location for the resident as indicated by the received resident assigned location information in step indicates that the resident s location is different in the resident assigned location information than in the terminal based resident location information and whether the resident assigned location information for the resident is more recent e.g. by timestamp than the terminal based resident location information for the resident. If the determination of decision step indicates the locations do not differ then the process proceeds to step in which the terminal based resident location information for the resident is preserved and the process then ends in step .

If the determination of decision step indicates both that the locations do differ and that the resident assigned location information for the resident is different than both the terminal based resident location information and the previously reported resident assigned location information for the resident then the process proceeds to step in which the terminal based resident location information for the resident is updated with the more recent and likely more accurate information on the resident from the resident assigned location information . The process then ends in step .

The process begins by proceeding from beginning step each time the communications server queries the jail management system to step when updated resident assigned location information is received from the jail management system . Next in step the resident assigned location information is merged with the terminal based resident location information . In decision step a determination is made whether the resident assigned location for each resident e.g. in the resident assigned location information has changed since a previous merging of the resident assigned location information with the terminal based resident location information .

The determination in decision step indicates a resident s location in the resident assigned location information Unit has changed since the previous merge where the resident was identified as being located in Unit so the process proceeds to decision step in which a determination is made whether the resident assigned location of Unit for the resident as indicated by the received resident assigned location information in step has changed since the last merge step and is different from both the resident assigned location from the previous merge step and from the current terminal based resident location information for the resident. If so the process proceeds to step in which the terminal based resident location information for the resident is updated with the more recent information on the resident from the resident assigned location information indicating the resident is in Unit . The process then ends in step .

Computer system e.g. communications terminal facility management server and communications server includes a bus or other communication mechanism for communicating information and a processor e.g. processor and coupled with bus for processing information. By way of example the computer system may be implemented with one or more processors . Processor may be a general purpose microprocessor a microcontroller a Digital Signal Processor DSP an Application Specific Integrated Circuit ASIC a Field Programmable Gate Array FPGA a Programmable Logic Device PLD a controller a state machine gated logic discrete hardware components or any other suitable entity that can perform calculations or other manipulations of information.

As used herein the phrase at least one of preceding a series of items with the terms and or or to separate any of the items modifies the list as a whole rather than each member of the list i.e. each item . The phrase at least one of does not require selection of at least one item rather the phrase allows a meaning that includes at least one of any one of the items and or at least one of any combination of the items and or at least one of each of the items. By way of example the phrases at least one of A B and C or at least one of A B or C each refer to only A only B or only C any combination of A B and C and or at least one of each of A B and C.

Furthermore to the extent that the term include have or the like is used in the description including the claims such term is intended to be inclusive in a manner similar to the term comprise as comprise is interpreted when employed as a transitional word in a claim.

A reference to an element in the singular is not intended to mean one and only one unless specifically stated but rather one or more. The term some refers to one or more. All structural and functional equivalents to the elements of the various configurations described throughout this disclosure that are known or later come to be known to those of ordinary skill in the art are expressly incorporated herein by reference and intended to be encompassed by the subject technology. Moreover nothing disclosed herein is intended to be dedicated to the public regardless of whether such disclosure is explicitly recited in the above description.

While this specification contains many specifics these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of what may be claimed but rather as descriptions of particular implementations of the subject matter. Certain features that are described in this specification in the context of separate embodiments can also be implemented in combination in a single embodiment. Conversely various features that are described in the context of a single embodiment can also be implemented in multiple embodiments separately or in any suitable subcombination. Moreover although features may be described above as acting in certain combinations and even initially claimed as such one or more features from a claimed combination can in some cases be excised from the combination and the claimed combination may be directed to a subcombination or variation of a subcombination.

Similarly while operations are depicted in the drawings in a particular order this should not be understood as requiring that such operations be performed in the particular order shown or in sequential order or that all illustrated operations be performed to achieve desirable results. In certain circumstances multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous. Moreover the separation of various system components in the aspects described above should not be understood as requiring such separation in all aspects and it should be understood that the described program components and systems can generally be integrated together in a single software product or packaged into multiple software products.

The subject matter of this specification has been described in terms of particular aspects but other aspects can be implemented and are within the scope of the following claims. For example the actions recited in the claims can be performed in a different order and still achieve desirable results.
