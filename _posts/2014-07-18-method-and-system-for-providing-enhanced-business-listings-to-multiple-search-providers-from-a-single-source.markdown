title: Method and system for providing enhanced business listings to multiple search providers from a single source
abstract: A source server receives listing identification data for transmission of an enhanced listing comprising enhanced content to a provider server. The source server searches the provider server for a matching listing based on the received listing identification data. When the source server determines that there is no matching listing on the provider server or that a potential matching received from the provider server is a non-matching listing, the source server transmits the enhanced listing without an identifier as an indication to the provider server to create a listing using the enhanced content. When the source server determines that the potential matching listing received from the provider server is a matching listing, the source server transmits to the provider server the enhanced listing with an identifier provided by the provider server as an indication to the provider server to update the enhanced listing on the provider server with the enhanced content.

This application is a continuation of and claims the benefit of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 342 540 filed Jan. 3 2012 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The present invention relates generally to Internet search methods and more particularly to a method and system for providing enhanced business listings to multiple search service providers from a single source system in an integrated fashion.

A consumer and or merchant may rely heavily on services rendered via the Internet. One such service is searchable listings provided by a search service also known in some instances as yellow pages or Internet yellow pages e.g. Google.com Amazon.com Yahoo.com Yelp.com MapQuest.com Superpages.com etc. . Searchable listings may include businesses such as restaurants people information product information etc. The information provided may include for example a name of a person or business addresses telephone numbers i.e. a network access point NAP . The information provided may also include web site URLs photos videos e mail addresses etc. as well as a special tagline to be used for promotional purposes the latter included in a visual tag highlight together enhanced content . The consumer may be presented with other information about a business by either clicking anywhere in the listing including the tagline or placing a mouse pointer or finger over the listing including the tagline.

Certain search service providers such as Google.com WhitePages.com MapQuest.com provide some or all of the requested information in alphabetical most visited or distance order i.e. distance from a location that the consumer entered for a search or a distance from a location of the search provider . A merchant may wish to ensure that the NAP information provided in the search results is correct so that a consumer may find a listing when searching in her local area and if the consumer does choose to call or visit the merchant s business the consumer is provided with correct information. Furthermore a merchant may desire to maximize the chance that a consumer will select the merchant s listing from among those returned. The listing may be displayed higher in the search results and or be featured in a more prominent and attractive fashion. The ordering of the listings is sometimes influenced by the extent to which enhanced content is available for the listing. Also the enhanced content may be employed in the display of search results such that the presence and quality of enhanced content associated with a listing may increase the attractiveness of the listing to the consumer. Further still the merchant may desire to maximize the probability that a consumer that views additional information about a business will have a favorable impression of the business.

The above goals may be achieved by maximizing the presence and quality of enhanced content associated with a listing. The merchant associated with a listing may therefore desire to be listed with multiple search services. Unfortunately the merchant currently needs to obtain their listing from each search service provider separately i.e. they need to contact each of the search service providers separately provide the listing information to each of the search service providers and pay each of the search service providers separately. Moreover if they wish to update their listing each service provider needs to be contacted separately.

Assuming a listing is updatable at each of the search service providers an update may take days weeks or more to be reflected at a consumer facing Web site mobile directory application etc. of each of the search service providers. Therefore in the related art updates cannot occur in real time or near real time. Moreover the merchant cannot provide their customers with information about real time or near real time services such as for example an offer of a discount coupon for the next hour only. 

The above described problems are addressed and a technical solution is achieved in the art by providing a method and system for providing listings that include both NAP information and enhanced content hereinafter enhanced listings to multiple search service providers from a single source system. According to an embodiment of the present invention the source system receives listing identification data from a merchant. The listing identification data is transmitted to each individual provider system. Potential matching listings are received from each provider system. The potential matching listings are matched to the listing identification data previously supplied by the merchant and a measure of certainty of a match for each provider system is determined. If a match is found for a given provider system that equals or exceeds a predetermined level or more of certainty then a provider supplied External ID for that match is recorded in the source system and is associated with the listing information provided by the merchant and the returned listing data is recorded by the source system in the source system database as ready to be delivered to a provider system. If no such match is found the source system presents the listing information from the provider system to the merchant or an analyst working on behalf of the merchant .

According to an embodiment of the present invention when the source system presents the listing information from the provider system to the merchant the source system may receive from the merchant an indication as to whether returned listing data from a provider system matches the merchant s listing. If the merchant confirms a match the returned listing data is recorded by the source system in the source system database as ready to be delivered to a provider system. If the merchant indicates that the returned listing data is incorrect or if no probable match of returned listing data from the provider system was found then the merchant searches directly for their listing on the provider system via a source system interface. If the provider system returns listing data that the merchant confirms as a match then the provider supplied External ID is recorded for the listing that the merchant confirmed in the database of the provider system. The listing data is also recorded by the source system in the source system database as ready to be delivered to a provider system after a cross check by a human operator.

According to an embodiment of the present invention after completing a search on the provider system via a source system interface the merchant may indicate that no listing on the provider system matches the merchant listing. In such circumstances the source system records an indication in the source system database that the listing should be delivered to the provider system as a new listing to be added to the provider system after a cross check by a human operator.

According to an embodiment of the present invention a cross check by a human operator may be conducted when the merchant has indicated that the merchant listing did not match the provider data automatically selected and then has either indicated that another provider listing matches or that no provider listing matches. The human operator either accepts as a match returned listing data from the provider system that the merchant indicated as a non match accepts as a match the provider listing selected by the merchant searches and selects the provider system himself for a different match of listing data via a source system interface or indicates that no valid listing is present on the provider system. Accordingly the returned listing data is recorded by the source system in the source system database as ready to be delivered to a provider system either with the External ID included in the provider listing data selected as a match or if no such listing was selected with an indication that the merchant listing is to be added to the provider site.

According to an embodiment of the present invention when listing data is recorded in the source system database as being ready for delivery one or more methods of delivery may be selected to deliver an enhanced listing to the provider system. The selection of a deliver method may be based on 1 which methods are available on the provider system 2 which data fields are included in the enhanced listing to be provided and 3 which methods may cause the data fields associated with the enhanced listing to be sent to the provider system as quickly as possible. In one embodiment all fields may be delivered through a single method. In another embodiment some fields may be delivered through one method to provide faster delivery while other fields may be delivered through a slower method.

According to an embodiment of the present invention the following delivery methods are provided 1 periodic feed files 2 real time API integration 3 JavaScript enhanced content and 4 frequent delta updates.

According to an embodiment of the present invention in the periodic feed files listings delivery method at periodic intervals a file for each provider system containing associated target listings that are to become enhanced listings is generated for each provider system by the source system. This file contains NAP information and enhanced content for each of the merchant listings and possibly the provider supplied External ID previously identified and associated with the listing. If the provider supplied external ID for a given listing is not provided this is an indication that the listing does not exist on the provider system and should be created by the provider system. For each of the provider systems the generated file is transmitted to the corresponding provider system.

According to an embodiment of the present invention the provider system processes the received listings. If at least one new listing is found that does not have an External ID supplied the provider system adds a listing into the provider database and generates an External ID for it. The provider then updates the listings in the provider database with the listing information NAP and enhanced content provided by the source system for each listing identifying each by External ID. In this manner the merchant listing information on each provider is added and updated from a single point and as a result the enhanced listing is now present on each provider.

According to an embodiment of the present invention in the real time API integration listings delivery method as soon as new or updated merchant listing information is provided to the source system and as applicable approved according to the methods described above the source system contacts the provider system through a real time API and provides merchant listing information including but not limited to NAP and enhanced content as well as the corresponding External ID for the listing on the provider system or an indication that this listing is to be added to the provider system . The provider system updates its database with the new listing information and is made available to consumers searching for business listings on the provider site. If the source system is contacting the provider system concerning a listing for the first time the provider system provides the source system either substantially immediately or after some interval with the source system assigned Listing ID the provider assigned External ID and a URL where the consumer can expect to see the listing on the provider system. For any listings appearing for the first time the merchant is provided with an indication that the listing is now in service on that provider and supplies the merchant with a URL from which the provider listing associated with the business of the merchant may be seen.

According to an embodiment of the present invention the periodic feed files delivery method or the real time API integration delivery method may be augmented by a JavaScript enhanced content delivery method. The JavaScript enhanced content delivery method permits enhanced content to be updated for a listing in real time even if a provider does not support real time updates to its database e.g. as in the periodic feed files delivery method or if the provider does support updates to its database but cannot substantially immediately display the updates to a consumer as may happen in the real time API integration listings delivery method .

The JavaScript enhanced content delivery method is executed after completing the steps of the periodic feed files delivery method or the real time API integration delivery method. In the JavaScript enhanced content delivery method the provider system is configured to store in its database an indication that the listing with a particular External ID is to include JavaScript based enhanced content possibly to include a promotional highlight when displayed in a consumer Web browser. When the provider system provides listing information for any such listings to the consumer the provider system may include a JavaScript in the Web page. This JavaScript runs on the consumer s Web browser and is configured to contact the source system to obtain the enhanced content associated with the listing identified by the External ID or a source system ID of the listing in question. The source system returns the most up to date enhanced content for the listing which is then displayed to the consumer. Thus the most up to date enhanced content including but not limited to a real time promotional highlight message is displayed to the consumer thus rendering a complete enhanced listing available to consumers on a provider system.

According to an embodiment of the present invention a variation of the JavaScript enhanced content delivery method may be used. In this variation the provider system requests the enhanced content in question directly from the source system through a server to server connection and then serves this information to the consumer as though it were incorporated into the provider system database although it has not been.

According to an embodiment of the present invention the periodic feed files delivery method may be augmented with the frequent delta updates delivery method. In the frequent delta updates delivery method the source system keeps track of all merchant listing records that are recorded either for the first time or for which the merchant has provided updated information. At regular intervals for example every five minutes the provider system contacts the source system for an update. The source system delivers all of the updated listing information from the time since the last contact. The provider system processes this information by updating its own listing records based on the listing information supplied in the delta update. This up to date information is presented to consumers.

According to an embodiment of the present invention in connection with the periodic feed files delivery method the provider system may assemble a list of all of the listings with listing information controlled and updated by the source system may generate a receipt file containing these listings and may transmit the receipt file to the source system. The receipt file may include for each listing the source system assigned Listing ID the provider system supplied External ID and a URL where the consumer can expect to see the listing on the provider system. For any listings appearing for the first time the merchant is provided with an indication that the listing is now in service on that provider and supplies the merchant with a URL from which the provider listing associated with the business of the merchant may be seen.

According to an embodiment of the present invention the methods described for delivering listings may be employed both when a listing is initially provided by the merchant to the source system and when updates to the NAP or enhanced content for a listing is provided by the merchant to the source system.

It is to be understood that the attached drawings are for purposes of illustrating the concepts of the invention and may not be to scale.

Methods and systems for enabling merchants to have their business listed in the so called organic search results on a large number of directories including Web sites mobile apps etc. through a single product system are provided. As used herein the term organic search results refers to but is not limited to listings on search engine results pages that appear because of their relevance to the search terms as opposed to their being advertisements. In contrast non organic search results may include pay per click advertising.

A merchant is permitted to list promotional material comprising enhanced content associated with a listing through among other things highlighted content in search results and more complete content in the business profile on the service provider. In some embodiments a URL is provided to permit the merchant to see their promoted listing on each search service provider s Web site. The merchant is permitted to update their information e.g. when they move or when their phone number changes and enhance their listing e.g. by adding or modifying photos text descriptions special offers hours etc. i.e. enhanced content from a single point substantially in real time or near real time.

The term computer or computer platform is intended to include any data processing device such as a desktop computer a laptop computer a tablet computer a mainframe computer a server a handheld device a digital signal processor DSP an embedded processor an example of which is described in connection with hereinbelow or any other device able to process data. The computer computer platform is configured to include one or more microprocessors communicatively connected to one or more non transitory computer readable media and one or more networks. The term communicatively connected is intended to include any type of connection whether wired or wireless in which data may be communicated. The term communicatively connected is intended to include but not limited to a connection between devices and or programs within a single computer or between devices and or separate computers over a network. The term network is intended to include but not limited to OTA over the air transmission ATSC DVB T packet switched networks TCP IP e.g. the Internet satellite microwave MPEG transport stream or IP direct broadcast satellite analog cable transmission systems RF and digital video transmission systems ATSC HD SDI HDMI DVI VGA etc.

The one or more computer readable media may be used for storing the instructions to be executed by the one or more processors including an optional operating system such as the Windows or the Linux operating system. The computer readable media may further be used for the storing and retrieval of data in one or more databases. The computer readable media may include a combination of volatile memory such as RAM memory and non volatile memory such as flash memory optical disk s and or hard disk s . Portions of the data stored in the computer readable media may be provided by one or more human users at one or more monitors. The monitor s may be equipped with a keyboard and a mouse for selecting objects of interest by the user or for inputting data.

A plurality of provider application programming interfaces APIs permits the source system to search for matching listings as part of a matching process. The provider API searcher is configured to accommodate existing APIs provided that it meets system standards. In certain circumstances a provider may need to modify their API so that it may operate properly with the source system . The provider listing update APIs are configured to receive information about new and updated listings to display from the listing delivery engine . Should a provider not be able to supply a provider listing update API the provider may supply a periodic feed receiver for processing periodic data updates generated by the source system containing listings that should contain enhanced content. These are modules designed by each of the providers. They are generally designed to accommodate a source system enhanced listings format. The provider directory site mobile app etc. is a module that serves the directory sites with which a consumer interacts e.g. MapQuest.com the MapQuest iPhone app etc.

The modules are in turn are communicatively connected to a plurality of user devices running some form of communication software preferably in a consumer Web browser over a network such as the Internet and a provider database . In a preferred embodiment the computer platform may be communicatively connected to each of the plurality of user devices via a PowerListings JavaScript running in the consumer Web browser when enhanced content is pulled directly from a consumer Web browser or device rather than passing through a service provider computer platform e.g. to be described hereinbelow in connection with . In such circumstances the PowerListings JavaScript either provided by the system provider or written by the service provider and included within a Web page calls the real time content server and obtains the needed enhanced content. Alternatively the PowerListings JavaScript may be replaced with for example a mobile application or some other non Web application. In such circumstances the mobile or external application may communicate directly with the real time content server to obtain the real time content updates. However in the preferred embodiment a request typically passes through a service provider computer platform e.g. rather than having a direct connection between the application running on the consumer s device and the real time content server .

In Step the provider API searcher invokes a provider API with the listing identification data supplied by the merchant . In Step the provider API of the provider system may return potential matching listings to the provider API searcher . In Step the provider API searcher employs a method to determine which of the returned results matches the listing identification data supplied by the merchant if any and a measure of certainty of a match for the provider system . Each potential match is given a score that indicates the system s level of certainty that the potential match listings corresponds with the listing identification data supplied by the merchant. To calculate this score the system normalizes the core listing information supplied by the merchant and returned with each potential match. Then the system assigns up to one point for similarity of each of the following data fields name address including city state and postal code and primary phone number. The system also assigns points for matches of non primary phone numbers and merchant URL. If a match has at least three points which can happen only if the name address and primary phone number match exactly or if two of the three match and the other fields match exactly the listing is considered to be so perfect a match that it can be recorded as a listing match without merchant verification i.e. equal to or above a predetermined level of certainty . If it has a match of at least one point then it is considered a possible match and can be presented to the merchant as such. Otherwise it is considered that there are no possible matches.

In Step if a match is found that equals or exceed a predetermined level or more of certainty then in Step the provider API searcher records a provider supplied External ID for the listing along with returned listing data e.g. the name address telephone number and URL associated with the listing found on the provider system in the system database otherwise processing proceeds to step . As used herein an External ID refers to a unique identifier that each of the provider systems has assigned to a listing for their own purposes. This contrasts with a system provided Listing ID that is a unique identifier assigned by the source system to the same listing on a per provider per listing basis. In step a matching process is conducted by the source system wherein an attempt is made to determine the External ID of the listing on the provider s system that most closely matches the listing with the system provided Listing ID. The purpose of the matching process is to ascertain whether there is a corresponding listing on the server provider s side. If in step a match is found then in step the provider supplied External ID is associated with the system supplied Listing ID in the system database for the provider system e.g. . If in Step no match was returned then in Step the provider API searcher records no match found in the system database for the provider system . Also a no External ID corresponding to the Listing ID in question is recorded in the database for the provider system

In Step if a probable match was found then in Step the PowerListings Web application displays the returned listing data e.g. the name address and phone number as supplied by the provider system and prompts the merchant to confirm that the correct returned listing data was identified. If in Step the merchant confirms a matching returned listing data then in Step the returned listing data is recorded by the source system in the system database along with an indication that the returned listing data is ready to be delivered to the provider system as described hereinbelow. If in Step the merchant indicates that the returned listing data is incorrect or if no probable match of returned listing data from the provider system was found then in Step the merchant searches directly for their listing on the provider systems via queries made through the PowerListings Web application the provider API searcher and the provider API of the provider system . If in step as a result of the queries in Step the provider system returns listing data that the merchant confirms as a match then in Step the source system records the provider supplied External ID for the listing that the merchant confirmed in the system database for the provider system . If in Step the provider system does not return listing data or in Step none of the returned listing data is considered a match by the merchant then in Step the source system records a NO LISTING FOUND or some other negative indication in the system database for the provider system . Also a no External ID corresponding to the Listing ID in question is recorded in the system database for the provider system

In Step the provider system processes the listings file received in Step on a per listing basis. In step a query is made whether the listing contains an external ID. If in step the listing does not have an external ID then in Step the provider system e.g. creates a new listing record in the provider database assigns the listing record a new external ID adds content from the feed i.e. the listing data to the new listing record and sets a flag for the listing indicating that the listing is to receive a promotional highlight when displayed in a consumer Web browser as provided by the corresponding provider directory site . If in Step an external ID for the listing was supplied then in step a query is made whether the listing was provided before by the source system . If in step an external ID was supplied but the listing was not previously provided by the source system i.e. it was previously associated with a listing via selection by either the human operator via the a human review application or via the merchant via the tags Web application on the source system then in Step the provider system e.g. stores an indication that the listing with the External ID is to receive enhanced content when displayed in a consumer Web browser as provided by a provider directory site associated with the provider system stores a source system listing ID that should be associated with the listing and incorporates the listing content from the feed into an existing listing record in the provider database e.g. e.g. NAP and enhanced content . If in Step an external ID was supplied and a listing was previously provided by the source system then in Step the provider system updates the existing listing in the provider database to reflect the information provided with the received listing. In Step a query is made whether there are any more listings in the listing file to be processed. If in Step the last listing in the listing file has not been processed then execution returns to Step otherwise processing proceeds to Step .

In Step the provider system assembles a list of all of the listings that the provider system indicates should have an enhanced listing See and in Step the provider periodic feed interface corresponding to the provider system generates a receipt file containing these listings including for each listing the system assigned Listing ID an External ID and a URL where the consumer can expect to see the promotional listing on the provider system See . In Step the source system receives the receipt file from each of the provider systems wherein the provider periodic feed interface returns the receipt file to the listings delivery engine . The PowerListings backend coordinator receives the receipt files from provider periodic feed interface . In Step for any listings appearing for the first time as determined by a query into the system database by the tags backend coordinator the PowerListings backend coordinator provides the merchant via the tags Web application with an indication that that the enhanced listings are now in service and supplies the merchant with a URL from which the enhanced listing associated with the business of the merchant may be seen. According to an embodiment of the present invention the backend coordinator may employ a Web crawler to confirm that the enhanced listing is visible on the supplied URL and that all content including the promotional highlight and message name address phone descriptions photos etc. is visible and correct before notifying the merchant that the enhanced listing is live .

According to an embodiment of the present invention the periodic feed files delivery method or the real time API integration delivery method may be augmented by a JavaScript enhanced content delivery method. The JavaScript enhanced content delivery method permits enhanced content to be updated for a listing in real time even if a provider system e.g. does not support real time updates to its database e.g. e.g. as in the periodic feed files delivery method or if the provider system e.g. does support updates to its database e.g. but cannot substantially immediately display the updates to a consumer as may happen in the real time API integration listings delivery method .

The JavaScript enhanced content delivery method is executed after completing the steps of the periodic feed files delivery method or the real time API integration deliver method.

According to one embodiment of the present invention a variation of the JavaScript enhanced content delivery method may be used. In this variation the provider system requests the enhanced content in question directly from the source system through a server to server connection and then serves this information to the consumer as though it were incorporated into the provider system database although it has not been.

According to an embodiment of the present invention the periodic feed files delivery method may be augmented with the frequent delta updates delivery method. is a process flow diagram illustrating exemplary steps for the source system delivering enhanced content to each of the provider systems from a single source i.e. the source system employing a frequent delta updates delivery method according to an embodiment of the present invention. In this method in step the source system keeps track of all merchant listing records that are recorded either for the first time or for which the merchant has provided updated information. In step at regular intervals e.g. every five minutes the provider system contacts the source system for an update. In step the source system delivers all of the updated listing information from the time since the last contact. In step the provider system processes this information by updating its own listing records in the provider database based on the listing information supplied in the delta update. In Step when the provider system receives a request from the consumer from a consumer Web browser to provide listing information for any such listings to the consumer then in Step the provider system provides the up to date information to the consumer in a consumer Web browser .

Referring now to FIGS. and A B the consumer Web browser initially displays the listing as served by the provider system without real time content such as a promotional message. In Step the PowerListings JavaScript requests the most up to date real time content such as a real time promotional message for each of the indicated listings from the real time content server . In Step the real time content server returns the most up to date message as updated by the merchant . In Step the PowerListings JavaScript locates the correct location in the consumer Web browser for rendering the message for each listing based on the hidden HTML tag rendered in Step and places the message at that location. As a result the most up to date real time content is always displayed.

According to certain embodiments of the present invention the steps of the source system updating enhanced listings on each of the provider systems at the request of the merchant of and rendering listings in response to a search request on the consumer Web browser of are subject to numerous variations. For instance rather than rendering a blank area for the real time message the provider directory site may render the most recent message supplied via the periodic feed files delivery method to the provider periodic feed receiver which is then replaced with a JavaScript. Rather than including PowerListings JavaScript the provider system may include a custom written JavaScript that makes calls directly to the real time content server . A provider supplied JavaScript may be preferable when the provider system has a JavaScript included in its own applications and it is desirable for the provider system to integrate the call to the real time content server within the existing logic of the provider system 

According to an embodiment of the present invention the JavaScript mechanism for real time content updates described above can be used by provider systems either when displaying search results which may include one or more enhanced listings mixed with regular listings which may include less information concerning each or when displaying a page with detailed information for a single enhanced listing. In the latter case the information that is pulled from the real time content server may include an extensive set of the content fields associated with the enhanced listing so that all or nearly all of the information supplied with the enhanced listing is served directly from the source system s real time content server without being processed by the provider system directly.

According to an embodiment of the present invention rather than passing a JavaScript to a consumer Web browser the provider directory site may request the most up to date enhanced content for each enhanced listing in server to server communication with the real time content server on demand and then may render the enhanced content including the promotional message or tag line as static text in the consumer Web browser . As used herein a tag line refers to a real time promotional message associated with a listing. Although other information associated with the listing may be supplied through the real time mechanism as well the tag line i.e. promotional message is the one that is most time sensitive because it often contains promotional deals e.g. 20 off a refrigerator today only .

According to an embodiment of the present invention if the listings are not rendered in a consumer Web browser but via a mobile application navigation application etc. the device hosting the application may not be operable to employ JavaScript. In such circumstances the provider directory site may request the most up to date listings content for listings on demand via the real time content server before serving the listings to the consumer via the application.

According to an embodiment of the present invention the listings delivery engine may pass real time content updates to real time provider listing update APIs rather than via the provider periodic feed receiver executing in the provider system for the purpose of receiving real time content updates.

According to an embodiment of the present invention when the merchant changes listing information data e.g. the name address or phone number of a listing the change is updated via the PowerListings Web application . The update is passed from the tags Web application via the listings delivery engine to the provider periodic feed receiver or the provider listing update API . Because the listing includes an External ID the provider periodic feed receiver or provider listing update API interprets the new information as an update to an existing listing rather than a new listing and updates the listing in the provider database . In this way the merchant may maintain their listing information from a single location i.e. the PowerListings Web application of the source system .

The exemplary computer system includes a processing device a main memory e.g. read only memory ROM flash memory dynamic random access memory DRAM such as synchronous DRAM SDRAM or Rambus DRAM RDRAM etc. a static memory e.g. flash memory static random access memory SRAM etc. and a data storage device which communicate with each other via a bus .

Processing device represents one or more general purpose processing devices such as a microprocessor central processing unit or the like. More particularly the processing device may be complex instruction set computing CISC microprocessor reduced instruction set computer RISC microprocessor very long instruction word VLIW microprocessor or processor implementing other instruction sets or processors implementing a combination of instruction sets. Processing device may also be one or more special purpose processing devices such as an application specific integrated circuit ASIC a field programmable gate array FPGA a digital signal processor DSP network processor or the like. Processing device is configured to execute device queue manager logic for performing the operations and steps discussed herein.

Computer system may further include a network interface device . Computer system also may include a video display unit e.g. a liquid crystal display LCD or a cathode ray tube CRT an alphanumeric input device e.g. a keyboard a cursor control device e.g. a mouse and a signal generation device e.g. a speaker .

Data storage device may include a machine readable storage medium or more specifically a computer readable storage medium having one or more sets of instructions e.g. listing manager logic embodying any one or more of the methodologies of functions described herein. Listings manager logic may also reside completely or at least partially within main memory and or within processing device during execution thereof by computer system main memory and processing device also constituting machine readable storage media. Listings manager logic may further be transmitted or received over a network via network interface device .

Machine readable storage medium may also be used to store the device queue manager logic persistently. While machine readable storage medium is shown in an exemplary embodiment to be a single medium the term machine readable storage medium should be taken to include a single medium or multiple media e.g. a centralized or distributed database and or associated caches and servers that store the one or more sets of instructions. The term machine readable storage medium shall also be taken to include any medium that is capable of storing or encoding a set of instruction for execution by the machine and that causes the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies of the present invention. The term machine readable storage medium shall accordingly be taken to include but not be limited to solid state memories and optical and magnetic media.

The components and other features described herein can be implemented as discrete hardware components or integrated in the functionality of hardware components such as ASICs FPGAs DSPs or similar devices. In addition these components can be implemented as firmware or functional circuitry within hardware devices. Further these components can be implemented in any combination of hardware devices and software components.

Some portions of the detailed descriptions are presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here and generally conceived to be a self consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually though not necessarily these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored transferred combined compared and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times principally for reasons of common usage to refer to these signals as bits values elements symbols characters terms numbers or the like.

It should be borne in mind however that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities.

The present invention has several advantages over prior art business listings and local search engines systems. For example existing search service providers provide a daily weekly monthly or quarterly feed for updating listings of local merchant data which may be the only way of updating content. Existing listings services rely on the recipient of the listing information provider systems to attempt any matching of their own listings e.g. some provider systems accept only an advertised listing from a single source. As a result there may be duplicate listing of the same merchant with no attempt by the provider systems to remove the duplicate entries . As of this writing search service providers do not perform matching from a central server system and do not provide each provider system with its ID for a listing. Still further there are no known instances of service providers providing a combination of accepting data in a periodic feed serving content with special markers based on this data and having this data augmented with a JavaScript based call back to the original central server system which solves an apparent latency problem for updating content in a number of domains. There are also no known instances of a service provider accepting listing information from a merchant and delivering it to multiple provider systems via a real time API. There are also no known instances of a service provider accepting listing information from a merchant and then distributing it to multiple providers using a combination of these mechanisms based on the capabilities of each provider system in order to minimize the latency of distribution new listing information as far as possible. There are also no known instances of such a listings service using automated mechanisms to ascertain whether the listings sent out to provider systems are correctly added and correctly updated.

A merchant is provided with the most up to date information possible associated with their business listings. Provider systems each have different capabilities and mechanisms for the support of the adding and updating of merchant listings. Some of them have systems that can operate only on a daily or multi day cycle through the use of feed files that contain listing information and are processed daily. Others are able to process feed files more frequently and still others have assorted miscellaneous mechanisms allowing for faster updates. Methods and systems according to certain embodiments of the present invention provide a way to make use of each of the existing mechanisms available with each provider system in the most efficient manner possible to effect updates to listings in a manner as near to real time as possible. Provider systems that can process feed updates only infrequently to nevertheless display certain elements of the enhanced content in real time or near real time. Embodiments of the present invention provide a means for those provider systems with proper technical capacity to implement a mechanism through which from a single source system all content on any provider listings can be updated in real time or near real time.
