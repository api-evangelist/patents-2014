Security is often described as a continuum between convenience and safety. A system that requires ten layers of authentication may be very difficult to attack but it may also be so inconvenient that it will never be used. At the opposite end a system with no means of authentication or authorization is highly convenient for users but also highly insecure. Many systems now offer an option for two factor authentication which requires an additional piece of information beyond or in place of the traditional username and password combination. Some two factor authentication systems may involve additional devices such as mobile phones and tablets. These two factor authentication systems may ask the user to enter a code sent to a mobile device or to take an action on the mobile device that is then transmitted back to an authentication server to complete the login process.

One downside of two factor authentication systems that involve mobile devices is that repeated illegitimate login attempts by malicious third parties may cause a flood of notifications to the mobile device annoying users. Some traditional systems may allow a user to block notifications from being pushed to their mobile device. However in these systems the user may be unaware that notifications are now being blocked and may become frustrated by the failure of their subsequent login attempts. Accordingly the instant disclosure identifies and addresses a need for additional and improved systems and methods for completing multi factor authentication via mobile devices.

As will be described in greater detail below the instant disclosure describes various systems and methods for completing multi factor authentication via mobile devices by determining that authentication notifications are blocked for a mobile device receiving a manually triggered communication from the mobile device confirming the authentication and enabling completion of the multi factor authentication process after receiving the communication from the mobile device. The systems described herein may also re enable authentication notifications for the mobile device in response to receiving the manually triggered communication.

In one example a computer implemented method for completing multi factor authentication via mobile devices may include 1 identifying a request to communicate with a user s mobile device to complete multi factor authentication of the user to an online service 2 determining that authentication notifications are disabled for attempts made by the user to login to the online service 3 in response to determining that authentication notifications are disabled preventing an authentication notification from being displayed on the user s mobile device 4 receiving an out of band authentication communication from a mobile device 5 determining that the mobile device that sent the out of band authentication communication is the user s mobile device and is therefore trusted to complete the multi factor authentication of the user to the online service and 6 in response to determining that the out of band authentication communication was received from a device trusted to complete the multi factor authentication of the user to the online service enabling the user to login to the online service.

In some examples enabling the user to login to the online service may include enabling authentication notifications for attempts made by the user to login to the online service. Additionally or alternatively the computer implemented method may further include enabling authentication notifications for attempts made by the user to login to the online service in response to receiving a request from the user via the user s mobile device to enable authentication notifications.

In one embodiment the computer implemented method may further include displaying at a web browser used by the user to initiate the multifactor authentication a message that indicates that authentication notifications are disabled for attempts made by the user to login to the online service. For example the message may be displayed on the login page of the online service. In some examples the message may include instructions for the user to complete an out of band authentication action using a trusted device.

In some embodiments preventing the authentication notification from being displayed on the mobile device may include queuing the authentication notification. In some examples the computer implemented method may further include expiring the queued authentication notification based on 1 receiving an additional authentication notification from the online service and or 2 exceeding a predetermined time threshold for holding authentication notifications in the queue.

In one embodiment the computer implemented method may further include disabling authentication notifications for attempts made by the user to login to the online service in response to receiving a number of authentication requests from the online service that exceeds a predetermined threshold for authentication requests. Additionally or alternatively the computer implemented method may further include disabling authentication notifications for attempts made by the user to login to the online service in response to receiving a request from the user s mobile device to disable authentication notifications for the online service.

In one embodiment the computer implemented method may further include 1 identifying an additional request to communicate with the user s mobile device to complete multi factor authentication of the user to the online service 2 determining that authentication notifications are enabled for attempts made by the user to login to the online service 3 in response to determining that authentication notifications are enabled sending an authentication notification to the user s mobile device for display on the user s mobile device 4 receiving an authentication communication from the user s mobile device sent in response to the authentication notification and 5 in response to determining that the authentication communication was sent in response to the authentication notification enabling the user to login to the online service.

In some examples enabling the user to login to the online service may include automatically completing the multi factor authentication of the user to the online service in response to receiving the out of band authentication communication from the mobile device and determining that the out of band authentication communication was received from a device that is trusted to complete the multi factor authentication. In one embodiment the out of band authentication communication from the mobile device may include a communication sent from an application on the mobile device that is associated with the multi factor authentication of the user to the online service and the out of band authentication communication may be sent in response to the user accessing the application on the mobile device.

In one embodiment a system for implementing the above described method may include 1 an identification module stored in memory that identifies a request to communicate with a user s mobile device to complete multi factor authentication of the user to an online service 2 a notification determination module stored in memory that determines that authentication notifications are disabled for attempts made by the user to login to the online service 3 a prevention module stored in memory that prevents in response to determining that authentication notifications are disabled an authentication notification from being displayed on the user s mobile device 4 a receiving module stored in memory that receives an out of band authentication communication from a mobile device 5 a device determination module stored in memory that determines that the mobile device that sent the out of band authentication communication is the user s mobile device and is therefore trusted to complete the multi factor authentication of the user to the online service 6 an enabling module stored in memory that in response to determining that the out of band authentication communication was received from a device trusted to complete the multi factor authentication of the user to the online service enables the user to login to the online service and 7 at least one physical processor configured to execute the identification module the notification determination module the prevention module the receiving module the device determination module and the enabling module.

In some examples the above described method may be encoded as computer readable instructions on a non transitory computer readable medium. For example a computer readable medium may include one or more computer executable instructions that when executed by at least one processor of a computing device may cause the computing device to 1 identify a request to communicate with a user s mobile device to complete multi factor authentication of the user to an online service 2 determine that authentication notifications are disabled for attempts made by the user to login to the online service 3 prevent in response to determining that authentication notifications are disabled an authentication notification from being displayed on the user s mobile device 4 receive an out of band authentication communication from a mobile device 5 determine that the mobile device that sent the out of band authentication communication is the user s mobile device and is therefore trusted to complete the multi factor authentication of the user to the online service and 6 in response to determining that the out of band authentication communication was received from a device trusted to complete the multi factor authentication of the user to the online service enable the user to login to the online service.

For example at step identification module may as part of computing system in identify a request to communicate with user s mobile device to complete multi factor authentication of user to online service .

The term request as used herein generally refers to any communication sent from a computing device to another computing device. In some examples a request may be sent from a mobile device to an online service. In other examples a request may be sent from an online service to an authentication system as part of a multi factor authentication. Additionally or alternatively a request may be sent by an authentication server to a mobile push service. In one example a request may be sent by an online service indicating that an authentication system should initiate a multi factor authentication process.

The term multi factor authentication as used herein generally refers to any type of authentication process that involves more than one factor. In some embodiments a multi factor authentication process may involve multiple computing devices. For example a multi factor authentication process launched from a desktop computer may require a user to supply a username and or password and may also require the user to authorize the login attempt from an additional device linked to their user account in order to log in.

The term online service as used herein generally refers to any service provided via a network such as the Internet an enterprise network a wide area network a local area network etc. An online service may include without limitation a website a news feed an application programming interface a file server a messaging application a location service and or any other application that may send data via the Internet.

Identification module may identify the request in a variety of ways and or contexts. For example identification module may be part of an authentication service that is configured to send a request to communicate with a user s mobile device. In another example identification module may be part of a mobile push service that may receive a request. In some examples identification module may be part of an online service configured to handle authentication for the online service. Additionally or alternatively identification module may intercept a request generated by a service of which identification module is not a part.

At step one or more of the systems described herein may determine that authentication notifications are disabled for attempts made by the user to login to the online service. For example at step notification determination module may as part of computing system in determine that authentication notifications are disabled for attempts made by user to login to online service .

The term authentication notification as used herein generally refers to any message designed to alert a user that an authentication attempt with their credentials is taking place. For example an authentication notification may be sent to a mobile device in response to a login attempt on another device. In some embodiments an authentication notification may be part of a multi factor authentication and or may inform a user that further action on their part is required to complete an authentication process. For example an authentication notification may provide a user with a code to enter into a login form and or allow a user to click a button to send a message to the authentication service.

In some examples an authentication notification may be triggered by an illegitimate authentication attempt. For example a malicious actor may make repeated authentication attempts to a user s account in an attempt to brute force the account credentials. In this example a user may receive numerous authentication notifications due to the repeated authentication attempts.

Notification determination module may determine that authentication notifications are disabled in a variety of ways and or contexts. For example notification determination module may include a flag and or switch that may be set to on to allow notifications and to off to block notifications. In some examples notification determination module may be part of a notification push service.

In some embodiments notification determination module may maintain individual switches for each online service that uses the notification system. For example an online shopping service may have the authentication notification switch set to off while an online banking service may have the authentication notification switch set to on. Additionally or alternatively notification determination module may maintain individual switches on a per device basis. For example notifications may be disabled for a user s mobile phone but enabled for the user s tablet.

In one embodiment the systems described herein may include a display module that displays at a web browser used by the user to initiate the multifactor authentication a message that indicates that authentication notifications are disabled for attempts made by the user to login to the online service. In some examples the message may include instructions for the user to complete an out of band communication. In some embodiments the systems described herein may send a message to the online service indicating that a message should be displayed to the user. Additionally or alternatively the systems described herein may include an authentication system for the online service.

In some examples the message may inform the user that authentications are disabled for a specific mobile device and or may inform the user of how to continue the authentication process. In one example the message may appear in the same web browser window that the user is using to log in to the online service. In another example the message may appear in a pop up window generated by the online service and or the authentication service.

At step one or more of the systems described herein may prevent in response to determining that authentication notifications are disabled an authentication notification from being displayed on the user s mobile device. For example at step prevention module may as part of computing system in prevent in response to determining that authentication notifications are disabled authentication notification from being displayed on user s mobile device .

Prevention module may prevent the authentication notification from being displayed in a variety of ways and or contexts. In one embodiment prevention module may be a part of a notification push service that may be responsible for sending authentication notifications and may prevent the authentication notification by not generating and or not sending the authentication notification. In some embodiments prevention module may prevent an authentication notification by refraining from instructing a push service to send the authentication notification. In another embodiment prevention module may not be a part of a notification push service and may intercept an authentication notification sent by a notification push service. Additionally or alternatively prevention module may intercept and or block a notification request sent by an authentication service to a notification push service.

In some examples prevention module may prevent the authentication notification from being displayed on the mobile device by queuing the authentication notification. In some embodiments prevention module may store the authentication notification in a queue at the authentication server. In another embodiment prevention module may store the authentication notification in a queue at the notification push service. Additionally or alternatively prevention module may store the authentication notification in a queue in an application on the mobile device. In some embodiments prevention module may queue a request that triggers an authentication notification in place of or in addition to queuing the authentication notification itself.

In some examples systems described herein may include an expiring module that expires the queued authentication notification based on receiving an additional authentication notification from the online service and or exceeding a predetermined time threshold for holding authentication notifications in the queue. For example the systems described herein may hold only one authentication notification from a given online service in a queue at once and therefore may immediately expire a queued authentication notification after receiving an additional authentication notification from the same service. Additionally or alternatively the systems described herein may expire authentication notifications after a preset time limit such as three minutes fifteen minutes one hour or one day.

At step one or more of the systems described herein may receive an out of band authentication communication from a mobile device. For example at step receiving module may as part of computing system in receive an authentication communication from mobile device .

The term out of band authentication communication as used herein generally refers to any communication sent to an authentication server by a mobile device that does not directly respond to a communication sent successfully to the mobile device from the authentication server. For example an authentication server may normally send an authentication notification to a mobile device but the authentication notification may be prevented i.e. the authentication server may refrain from sending the notification . In this example a user of the mobile device may manually confirm authentication via a user interface in an application in the mobile device thereby sending or triggering an out of band authentication communication from the mobile device to the authentication server.

Receiving module may receive the out of band authentication communication in a variety of ways. For example receiving module may be part of an authentication server and may receive a message directed to the authentication server by an authentication application on a mobile device.

In some embodiments a user may send the out of band communication from the mobile device by enabling authentication notifications from an authentication application on the mobile device and then interacting with a queued authentication notification sent to the mobile device in response to authentication notifications being re enabled. Additionally or alternatively an out of band communication may be automatically triggered when a user opens and or accesses an application associated with the authentication process e.g. an application associated with the online service an application used to perform multifactor authentication etc. .

At step one or more of the systems described herein may determine that the mobile device that sent the out of band authentication communication is the user s mobile device and is therefore trusted to complete the multi factor authentication of the user to the online service. For example at step device determination module may as part of computing system in determine that the mobile device that sent authentication communication is mobile device and is therefore trusted to complete multi factor authentication of user to online service .

Device determination module may determine that the mobile device that sent the authentication notification is trusted in a variety of ways. For example device determination module may match the mobile device against a list of mobile device trusted to complete multi factor authentication operations for the user. In some examples device determination module may use a device identifier to determine that the mobile device that sent the authentication communication is the same mobile device to which an authentication notification would have been sent if authentication notifications were enabled. Additionally or alternatively device determination module may identify a token in the authentication communication that indicates that the mobile device sending the authentication communication is trusted.

At step one or more of the systems described herein may in response to determining that the out of band authentication communication was received from a device trusted to complete the multi factor authentication of the user to the online service enable the user to login to the online service. For example at step enabling module may as part of computing system in and in response to determining that authentication communication was received from a device designated to complete multi factor authentication of user to online service enable user to login to online service .

Enabling module may enable the user to login to the online service in a variety of ways. In some examples enabling module may enable the user to login to the online service by automatically completing the multi factor authentication of the user to the online service in response to receiving the out of band authentication communication from the mobile device and determining that the out of band authentication communication was received from a device that is trusted to complete the multi factor authentication. In these examples receiving an authentication communication from a mobile device may be the last step of the login process.

In one embodiment the out of band authentication communication from the mobile device may include a communication sent from an application on the mobile device that is associated with the multi factor authentication of the user to the online service and the out of band authentication communication may be sent in response to the user accessing the application on the mobile device. For example a user may be attempting to login to a website that may display a message informing the user that authentication notifications for the website are disabled and or that the user may need to access an authentication application on a mobile device to complete the login process. In this example the user may then access the authentication application and may use the authentication application to send an authentication communication. In one embodiment a user may send an authentication communication with a one click hot key set in a mobile device.

In some embodiments the systems described herein may include and or communicate with a user s computing device a user s mobile device an authentication server a push service and or a website. is a block diagram of an exemplary computing system for completing multi factor authentication via mobile devices. As illustrated in a user may be associated with both a user s computing device and a user s mobile device . User may use computing device e.g. a desktop computer a laptop computer an additional mobile device such as a tablet etc. to attempt to login to a website . Website may have multi factor authentication enabled and may communicate with an authentication server . Authentication server may send a notification push request to a push service .

In some examples authentication server may determine the notification status for the user s mobile device and or may send a message to website instructing website to display the notification status to user . If authentication notifications are enabled push service may send an authentication notification to mobile device . User may then approve the authentication attempt via mobile device and mobile device may transmit that information to authentication server . Authentication server may then send a message to website indicating that the multi factor authentication process has been successfully completed.

The systems described herein may enable and or disable authentication notifications sent to a mobile device on behalf of an online service in a variety of ways. is a flow diagram of an exemplary method for enabling or disabling authentication notifications while completing multi factor authentication via mobile devices. As illustrated in at step authentication notifications may be enabled. From there authentication notifications may be disabled in several ways.

At step a user may manually disable authentication notifications. In some examples systems described herein may disable authentication notifications for attempts made by the user to login to the online service in response to receiving a request from the user s mobile device to disable authentication notifications for the online service. For example a user may access an authentication application on a mobile device and may change a setting on the authentication application to disable authentication notifications for the mobile device.

Additionally or alternatively as shown at step authentication may be automatically disabled due to rate limiting. In one embodiment the systems described herein may disable authentication notifications for attempts made by the user to login to the online service in response to receiving a number of authentication requests from the online service that exceeds a predetermined threshold for authentication requests. In some examples a predetermined threshold for authentication requests from an online service may be a fixed number such as three five or ten. In other examples a predetermined threshold may also be based on a time component. For example five authentication requests in the span of ten minutes may trigger the systems described herein to disable authentication notifications while five authentication requests in the span of a day may not affect whether notifications are enabled.

Additionally or alternatively a user may disable authentication notifications in a variety of other ways such as changing a setting in an online service via a browser and or contacting a customer service representative. In some embodiments authentication notifications may be disabled by a disabling module configured to disable authentication notifications in any or all of the ways described above.

At step regardless of what method was used to disable authentication notifications authentication notifications may be disabled. Authentication notifications may be re enabled in any of a variety of ways.

At step a user may manually enable authentication notifications via a mobile device. In some examples systems described herein may enable authentication notifications for attempts made by the user to login to the online service in response to receiving a request from the user via the user s mobile device to enable authentication notifications. For example a user may change a setting in an authentication application on a mobile device to enable authentication notifications for the mobile device from an online service.

At step authentication notifications may be automatically enabled due to a successful authentication from the mobile device. In some embodiments enabling module may enable the user to login to the online service and may also enable authentication notifications for attempts made by the user to login to the online service. In some examples enabling module may always enable authentication notifications to a mobile device from an online service as a result of a successful login to the online service via the mobile device.

Additionally or alternatively a user may enable authentication notifications in a variety of other ways such as changing a setting in an online service via a browser and or contacting a customer service representative.

At step authentication notifications may be re enabled. From there the process may repeat and authentication notifications may be disabled and or re enabled any number of times in any manner.

If authentication notifications are enabled the multi factor authentication process may proceed differently than if authentication notifications are disabled. In one embodiment systems described herein may perform the following steps 1 identifying an additional request to communicate with the user s mobile device to complete multi factor authentication of the user to the online service 2 determining that authentication notifications are enabled for attempts made by the user to login to the online service 3 in response to determining that authentication notifications are enabled sending an authentication notification to the user s mobile device for display on the user s mobile device 4 receiving an authentication communication from the user s mobile device sent in response to the authentication notification and 5 in response to determining that the authentication communication was sent in response to the authentication notification enabling the user to login to the online service.

As explained above in connection with method the systems described herein may complete multi factor authentication via mobile devices while allowing users greater control of whether or not authentication notifications are sent to their mobile devices. A user may initiate a login attempt for a website from a computing device and may see a message indicating the status of authentication notifications from the website. If authentication notifications are disabled a user may enable them from an application on their mobile device. If an authentication notification was blocked and held in a queue it may be sent to the mobile device once authentication notifications are enabled. A user may then respond to an authentication notification on their mobile device and or may complete the login process via an application on their mobile device. In some examples authentication notifications for the mobile device may be automatically re enabled if a user completes the authentication process via the mobile device without manually re enabling authentication notifications. By displaying the status of authentication notifications to users via the browser and allowing users to enable and disable authentication notifications from mobile devices the systems described herein may allow users to more conveniently and transparently manage authentication notifications while avoiding being spammed by unwanted notifications thus increasing the convenience of multi factor authentication systems.
