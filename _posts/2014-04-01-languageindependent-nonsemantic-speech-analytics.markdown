The disclosure relates to the field of speech analytics and more particularly to the field of analyzing speech patterns using language independent non semantic speech analytics.

In the field of speech analytics much progress has been made in recognizing and processing natural spoken language effectively. However current approaches focus on language specific analytics such as processing for words phrases or phonemes that are tied to a particular world language.

There are some efforts to monitor or interpret speech patterns without regard for the content being spoken thus a language independent approach but the current methods focus on speech analysis only insofar as monitoring simple metrics such as speech rate of a telephone call participant or comparing a speaker s voice patterns when calm against patterns when emotional such as to determine when they are in an emotional state such as for truth detection for example . These approaches offer only a simplistic approach to speech analytics measuring a single metric or focusing on a specific speaker or use case rather than answering a broader need for language independent speech analytics in general.

What is needed is a means to analyze speech using means that are not tied to any specific language instead focusing on non semantic elements of spoken language and that may be applied broadly to existing or novel speech analysis systems or hardware and in various use cases as needed.

Accordingly the inventor has conceived and reduced to practice in a preferred embodiment of the invention various methods for language independent non semantic speech analytics that are both use and language independent and may utilize existing or novel speech analysis systems as necessary.

According to a preferred embodiment of the invention a system for language independent non semantic speech analytics comprising a media server stored and operating on a network connected computing device a database stored and operating on a network connected computing device that stores the audio input for future reference an analytics server stored and operating on a network connected computing device and a management server stored and operating on a network connected computing device is disclosed. The media server receives audio input from a plurality of network connected devices and stores raw audio in the database the management server configures operation of the analytics server based at least in part on manual input from a human user the analytics server performs processing operations on the audio input and the database stores the results of the processing operations. The processing operations comprise at least analyzing via an analytics server stored and operating on a network connected device the audio input to determine an audio waveform analyzing the waveform to determine a plurality of periods of silence analyzing the waveform to identify a plurality of spoken syllables analyzing the spoken syllables to determine speech characteristics including at least a pace of speech during an interaction and a change in pace of speech during an interaction analyzing the waveform to determine a plurality of periods of cross talk wherein two or more interaction participants are speaking simultaneously and analyzing the waveform to determine an emotional state of a speaker.

According to another preferred embodiment of the invention a method for language independent non semantic speech analytics comprising the steps of receiving an audio signal such as a call recording or other audio input processing the audio for amplitude peaks in an audio waveform indicating the presence of an utterance or other noise performing silence detection to identify gaps or periods of low amplitude as might indicate pauses in speech and returning results of silence detection such as presenting to a user or storing for future review . It should be appreciated that an audio source may be any appropriate source of audio data such as a live audio stream or stored audio file or recording and may comprise one or more speakers as well as other audio sources such as background noise or other nonverbal audio and it should be further appreciated by one having skill in the art that with current audio processing technologies common in the art it is easy to isolate human speech from background noise as well as to separate speakers when multiple individuals are present in an audio recording.

According to a further embodiment of the invention a method for language independent non semantic speech analytics may comprise alternative steps as opposed to those presented above in a preferred embodiment of processing an audio input and identifying spoken syllables or other basic units of speech and returning the results of syllable identification as opposed to silence detection as described previously . According to the embodiment syllable detection may be utilized to identify speech patterns such as cadence or rhythm rather than attempting to extract actual linguistic meaning by recognizing the meaning of the syllables themselves. In this manner speech analysis may reveal speech patterns regardless of the language being spoken or the speaker being heard by utilizing discrete verbal units such as syllables as a basis for analysis.

According to a further embodiment of the invention a method for language independent non semantic speech analytics may comprise additional steps of utilizing syllable identification to analyze speech cadence or rhythm such as to identify rushed hesitant or otherwise unusually paced speech regardless of the content of that speech. In this manner analysis may be seen to build upon itself that is successive stages of analysis may reveal additional information by utilizing the results of previous stages such as according to the embodiment utilizing syllable detection as a basis for speech cadence recognition. Again as described above such analysis may be performed and provide useful results regardless of the language being spoken or the content of the speech itself enabling meaningful analysis even if a speaker or language is not known for example speech analysis could be performed on recordings of unknown or even fictional spoken language and still yield useful results by analyzing various described properties or components of the speech without regard for its content .

According to a further embodiment a method for language independent non semantic speech analytics may comprise alternative steps of identifying individual speakers within an audio input and analyzing the crosstalk or occurrence of multiple speakers speaking simultaneously or talking over each other . In this manner speech analysis may identify events such as an argument where multiple speakers may be trying to speak simultaneously or individual speaker characteristics such as impatience for example by determining that a particular speaker has an unusually high tendency to speak while another speaker is already speaking for example. Again this analysis may be performed without regard for the content of the speech and may reveal such patterns and other results regardless of the language being spoken who the speakers are or the content of their speech.

According to a further embodiment a method for language independent non semantic speech analytics may comprise additional steps of utilizing crosstalk analysis as described above and determining a talk ratio representing each speaker s relative role in a conversation by determining how much of a conversation each speaker contributed how much of a conversation was crosstalk or other such relationships. Such analysis might reveal further detail into a conversation without regard for the content of the speech itself such as revealing whether a particular speaker might have been giving a presentation or lecture where one speaker might dominate a conversation by a large margin with several other speakers contributing little or relationships between individual speakers such as indicating that whenever a particular speaker says something another speaker usually follows as might indicate a personal or professional relationship between the two .

It should be appreciated that as described above such analytic techniques may be performed without regard for the content of speech or the identities of speakers involved instead relying on the structure of the speech itself. It therefore becomes possible to perform such analysis on speech that is otherwise unintelligible such as an unknown or foreign language a fictitious or obscured language such as code talk or a muffled garbled or otherwise unintelligible recording. It may therefore be appreciated that such analysis as described herein may yield useful results where other techniques fail and also that such analysis does not require specialized equipment or linguistic knowledge to yield results as described.

In a further preferred embodiment of the invention a system for non speech based speech analytics comprising a media server stored and operating on a network connected device that may receive audio media such as voice recordings or live audio streams an analytics server stored and operating on a network connected device that may perform processing operations on media a database that may store media and analysis results and a management server stored and operating on a network connected device that may configure or modify analysis operations as well as present analysis results to a user for viewing or interaction is disclosed. According to the embodiment a media server may receive audio as input from various media sources such as audio recording devices or stored audio information such as recordings stored on a database or a media player for example . An analytics server may perform processing operations on audio such as those described above in the embodiments of the invention for example to analyze audio according to the invention. A management server may configure or modify such analysis operations such as by manual input from a human user or automated or semi automated operation such as by rules based or machine learning operation. In this manner it may be seen that operation of audio analysis may be performed with or without human interaction interchangeably as appropriate. According to the embodiment a management server may also present analysis operation results to a user for viewing or interaction such as to rearrange or modify data for example to perform manual cleanup to remove additional noise or unneeded audio elements after listening to an audio source.

Accordingly the inventor has conceived and reduced to practice in a preferred embodiment of the invention various methods for non speech based speech analytics that are both use and language independent and may utilize existing or novel speech analysis systems as necessary.
