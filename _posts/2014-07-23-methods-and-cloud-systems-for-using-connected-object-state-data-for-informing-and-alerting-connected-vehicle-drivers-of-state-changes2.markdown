The present invention relates to systems and methods for enhancing communication between connected vehicles and connected objects and methods for exchanging information with cloud based processing systems.

Vehicles such as motorized vehicles and electric vehicles have been around for some time. Vehicles provide a way that enable humans to drive from place to place. In today s world vehicles have become an indispensable mode of transportation and provide the freedom to travel at any time of day and for various distances. Vehicles can be publically operated or can be privately owned. Humans most commonly operate vehicles no matter the type whether electric or combustion engine based. In recent years technology has been advancing to allow for better wireless interfacing and networking with vehicles.

The methods systems and apparatus include electronics and software of vehicles that drive display devices in vehicles and communicate wirelessly with Internet services. Some embodiments define method and systems for enabling communication between connected vehicles and other connected objects. Connected objects can be other vehicles stationary objects objects installed in various locations such as streets street intersections traffic lights traffic cameras traffic sensors and the like. In one embodiment a subject vehicle may receive information from other connected objects based on the geo location of the subject vehicle and certain of the connected objects within a zone of influence to the subject vehicle may be surfaced to the subject vehicle and or mobile devices within the vehicle or associated with the vehicle.

In some implementations a connected vehicle may arrive or be headed toward at an intersection and the state of a traffic light may be understood by software hardware of the vehicle. For instance the state may be the color of the traffic light and identification of one or more of the traffic lights that are relevant to the direction of the travel of the subject vehicle. Still further some implementations may utilize information regarding the state of operation of the vehicle such as steering turning turn signals direction of viewing by the driver gestures by the driver merging into certain turn lanes at the intersection etc. to identify an intent or predict a direction of travel through the intersection. Based on this information software and or systems of the vehicle may receive information from cloud processing systems regarding the state of a traffic light. For instance if the vehicle is in the left turn lane as identified by GPS and or cameras and or sensors the state of the left hand turn arrow may be displayed on one or more screens.

The screens may be the screens of the vehicle such as in an area that is close to other applications that the user may be using while stopped and waiting for the light. Thus when the light turns green the green arrow or green color or some other text indictor or sound indicator or tactile feedback may be provided to the user so as to alert the user that he or she needs to look forward and drive the vehicle. If during the time that the user was looking down at a display a pedestrian or some object came close to the vehicle while the user was looking down and the light turns green sensors of the vehicle may delay showing of the green arrow or alert the driver that some obstacle is still present even though the light turned green. In some other embodiments the screen or display of the vehicle may present one or more lights or indicators showing the state of the lights at the intersection. For instance if the user arrives at the intersection and it is uncertain whether the driver is turning left right or going straight the indicator shown on the display screen of the vehicle may be two or more lights or indicators. For instance the screen may show icons or text or colors for more than one options of proceeding e.g. one light for left turn one light for straight one light for right turn or fewer or more lights depending on the intersection or the certainty of the anticipated direction of travel .

In some embodiments the notifications and or alerts and or indicators can be dynamically managed to be more or less sensitive based on user preference and or learned preferences of users. For instance if one user prefers to have more sensitivity to alerts or notifications the number of alerts and or notifications may increase. Additionally for certain drivers such as handicapped drivers the notifications and or alerts may be more magnified to improve safety. In other cases the alerts and or notifications may be reduced e.g. by reducing the sensitivity. Thus the notifications and or alerts may be dynamically throttled based on user profile settings preferences learned preferences or adjustments made over time.

In still other embodiments sensors and or cameras installed on or near traffic lights or intersections may be used to track the movement of objects past or at the intersection. The tracking can occur in an unanimous manner simply to identify traffic flows and provide vehicles with status or state regarding traffic lights. In such examples the traffic lights or its systems may be connected to the internet and the information can be shared with cloud processing servers. The cloud processing servers that receive information from vehicles can also access the traffic light data and motion or movement of traffic at the intersection.

In one embodiment it is possible to find an intersection of the traffic tracking by the traffic light systems or sensors with the information of the vehicle location. The intersection of this tracking data can be used to verify or reinforce the identification of location of the vehicle at a particular intersection and provide state information to the correct vehicles at a particular intersection. Still further tracking data from intersection sensors combined with tracking data of connected vehicles can be used as overlay data to mapping and traffic prediction systems.

In one embodiment a method is provided that includes receiving geo locations of a vehicle and identifying heading direction of the vehicle based on changes in the geo locations of the vehicle. The method may also include in some examples receiving sensor data for a surrounding area of the vehicle. The method includes receiving state information from a connected object that is located within an area of influence associated with a current geo location of the vehicle and sending an alert to the vehicle when the vehicle is at the current geo location. In one example the alert is sent upon determining that the state information changed while the current geo location of the vehicle remains unchanged for a threshold period of time after the state information changed. In various examples methods systems and infrastructure for enabling connected vehicles to communicate with cloud services and with other vehicles or connected objects are provided.

In some implementations the connected object is independent of the vehicle and the state information from the connected object is utilized while the current geo location of the vehicle is within the area of influence.

In one embodiment a method may further include receiving state information from additional connected objects that are within the area of influence of the current geo location of the vehicle and identifying which of the connected object or one of the additional connected objects is a primary connected object to be used for determining that the state information changed.

In some implementations the primary connected object is identified based at least in part on the heading direction of the information and current geo location of the vehicle.

In some implementations the alert is one of a notification to a computer of the vehicle or a notification to a user device located in the vehicle or a combination thereof.

In some implementations the alert includes instructions for enabling tactile feedback to be applied by a portion of the vehicle such that the tactile feedback provides an indication that the state information changed.

In some implementations the tactile feedback is provided when the state information changed or after a period of time passes from when the state information changed.

In some implementations the alert includes instructions communicated to a device of a passenger of the vehicle the instructions directing activation of tactile feedback as an indication that the state information changed.

In some implementations the connected object is independent of the vehicle and has an independent connected identity the connected object being in communication with a network of one or more servers and storage the storage is configured to store data received from the connected object including the state information and changes to the state information wherein state information and the changes to the state information of the connected object are received by a cloud services server that is connectable to the vehicle the cloud services server being configured to send the alert to the vehicle over a wireless network.

In some implementations the connected object is one of another car or a sensor or a building or a road sensor or a traffic light or a traffic metering sensor or a global positioning system device or a stationary device or a moving device or an intersection sensor or a camera or a motion sensor or a radar sensor or multiple traffic lights or multiple cars or a connected device or an internet connected device or a light post or a light or combinations thereof.

In some implementations the received sensor data for a surrounding area of the vehicle is defined by one or more of motion sensors of the vehicle or one or more cameras of the vehicle or radar sensors of the vehicle or biometric sensors of the vehicle or weight sensors of the vehicle or temperature sensors of the vehicle or climate sensors of the vehicle or tire sensors of the vehicle or brake sensors of the vehicle or seat sensors of the vehicle or occupancy sensors of the vehicle or user identification sensors of the vehicle or passenger sensors of the vehicle or pedestrian sensors around the vehicle or object sensors around the vehicle or combinations thereof.

In some implementations the heading direction obtained from the changes in geo location of the vehicle identify a direction of travel and wherein in the area of influence a plurality of connected objects are identified the method further comprising i identifying from the plurality of connected objects stationary connected objects and non stationary connected objects ii filtering stationary connected objects in the area of influence to exclude connected objects that are not in the direction of travel and iii using at least the stationary objects that are in the direction of travel for determining that the state information changed while the current geo location of the vehicle remains unchanged for the threshold period of time after the state information changed.

In some implementations the heading direction obtained from the changes in geo location of the vehicle identify a direction of travel and wherein the direction of travel is periodically updated using changes in the geo location of the vehicle and or turn signal indicator data and or steering direction changes and or mapped direction data.

In some implementations the alert further includes control information for causing one or more of a change in state of operation of a user interface of the vehicle and a change in state of operation of a user device within a driver control zone of the vehicle.

In some implementations when the alert is indicative that active driving should resume the change in state of operation includes one of a disabling fading or reduction in function of content accessible or apps usable via a user interface of the vehicle or a user interface of a device within a driver control zone within the vehicle.

In some implementations receiving sensor data for a surrounding area of the vehicle includes processing sensor data from sensors of the vehicle and or sensor data of other co located vehicles and or sensor data of connected objects within the area of influence to the vehicle.

In some implementations the alert further includes or is data that is used to set a color indicator on a screen of the vehicle or a screen of a device within the vehicle the color being a color of a traffic light that corresponds to the vehicle for a geo location location of the vehicle wherein updates to the data used to set the color indicator are received such that the color indicator changes when or after the color of the traffic light changes.

In some implementations when the color indicator changes to red or stop a reduction in functional operation of certain applications or content of the screen of the vehicle and or the screen of the device is processed.

In one embodiment a method is provided for receiving at a server geo locations of a vehicle. The method includes identifying heading direction of the vehicle based on changes in the geo locations of the vehicle and receiving state information from a connected object that is located within an area of influence associated with a current geo location of the vehicle. The method further includes sending an alert to the vehicle when the vehicle is at the current geo location the alert being sent upon determining that the state information changed while the current geo location of the vehicle remains unchanged for a threshold period of time after the state information changed. In one example the connected object is independent of the vehicle and has an independent connected identity the connected object being in communication with a network of one or more servers and storage the storage is configured to store data received from the connected object including the state information and changes to the state information. In one example state information and the changes to the state information of the connected object are received by a cloud services server that is connectable to the vehicle the cloud services server being configured to send the alert to the vehicle over a wireless network the method being executed by a processor.

In some implementations the heading direction is obtained from the changes in geo location of the vehicle identify a direction of travel and wherein in the area of influence a plurality of connected objects are identified the method further comprising i identifying from the plurality of connected objects stationary connected objects and non stationary connected objects ii filtering stationary connected objects in the area of influence to exclude connected objects that are not in the direction of travel and iii using at least the stationary objects that are in the direction of travel for determining that the state information changed while the current geo location of the vehicle remains substantially unchanged for the threshold period of time after the state information changed.

In one example an interaction mode defines one or more settings of a vehicle that can be customized for user interaction. For a particular interaction mode settings within settings may also be configured. In still other implementations interaction modes can be defined selected and customized via any connected device over the Internet or through the vehicle computer and interfaces inputs. In some embodiments the interaction modes can be applied to the vehicle dynamically so such as when the interaction mode is specific to a particular driver profile. In such embodiments the interaction mode can be set once the user logs in to the vehicle is identified using biometrics synced via wireless keys or detection pairing or the like. As the user makes use of the inputs and settings provided the interaction mode refinements can occur based on learned preferences.

In one embodiment an interaction mode can define a single setting or a plurality of settings. If a plurality of settings is defined for one interaction mode individual settings of that interaction mode may be modified by the user or automatically in view of learned patterns learned behavior or the like. In some embodiments the learned patterns can be identified from a collection of similar users. For example if other users are registered with a cloud service for connected vehicles typical settings changes control modifications preferences demographic preferences regional cultural preferences language preferences etc. can be mined to identify patterns. In one embodiment these patterns can be mined without requiring the actual identify of a user so that privacy protection can be maintained for all user accounts.

In some implementations the learning and predicting embodiments may utilize learning and prediction algorithms that are used in machine learning. In one embodiment certain algorithms may look to patterns of input inputs to certain user interfaces inputs that can be identified to biometric patterns inputs for neural network processing inputs for machine learning e.g. identifying relationships between inputs and filtering based on geo location and or vehicle state in real time logic for identifying or recommending a result or a next input a next screen a suggested input suggested data that would be relevant for a particular time geo location state of a vehicle and or combinations thereof. In one embodiment use of machine learning enables the vehicle to learn what is needed by the user at a particular time in view of one or more operating status state of the vehicle in view of one or more state of one or more sensors of the vehicle. Thus one or more inputs or data presented to the user may be provided without explicit input request or programming by a user at that time.

Overtime machine learning can be used to reinforce learned behavior which can provide weighting to certain inputs.

In one embodiment the custom configuration is generated using tools and programs made available on a website. The tools and programs may be executed by computers such as computers of a data center to provide cloud based processing. The data centers can be distributed geographically and the communication to specific vehicles can be dynamically assigned to various geographic data centers as the vehicles move around geographically.

Embodiments of the present invention define methods systems and apparatus for use with connected vehicles and interaction with cloud services. Some embodiments illustrate methods and systems for enabling communication between connected vehicles and other connected objects COs . Connected objects can be other vehicles stationary objects objects installed in various locations such as streets street intersections traffic lights traffic cameras traffic sensors and the like. In one embodiment a subject vehicle may receive information from other connected objects based on the geo location of the subject vehicle and or sensor data of the connected vehicle. In various examples the data exchanged or received by a connected vehicle may be dependent upon whether certain of the connected objects are within a zone of influence to the subject vehicle and may be surfaced to the subject vehicle and or mobile devices within the vehicle or associated with the vehicle.

In some embodiments when a vehicle reaches a stop e.g. some intersection or read location some vehicle user interfaces UIs and or access to certain apps of smart devices may be enabled. When the vehicle starts to move the UIs of some devices may be disabled as well as some smart devices or apps. In one embodiment implementations provide various ways to notify vehicle drivers when traffic lights have changed state and will require the driver to begin moving the vehicle. One embodiment is provided to enable vehicles to communicate with traffic lights or traffic lights via the Internet or cloud server so that drivers can be provided with alerts of state changes i.e. traffic light changes . In one embodiment the alert may be provided when a driver is detected to be actively using a device. In other embodiments the alert can be provided in various forms such as tactile feedback e.g. seat vibrates sound voice user device screen changes color icons color text user device color changes user device notifications vehicle computer screen changes vehicle screen notifications colors associated with traffic lights and or combinations thereof.

In another embodiment in addition to detecting state changes of traffic lights vehicles can also communicate with other vehicles within the vicinity or proximity of the subject vehicle. In one embodiment a vicinity or proximity or zone of influence may be within 100 meters of the vehicle. In other embodiments where more connected objects are located proximate to the vehicle the range may be less such as within 50 meters or within 30 meters of the vehicle. In certain cases where the vehicle is moving slowly e.g. less than 25 miles per hour the range may be less than 20 meters of the vehicle. In other cases where the vehicle is stopped or almost stopped the zone may be within 10 meters around the vehicle e.g. so as to identify vehicles in front or behind or beside the subject vehicle . In such cases the range for detecting nearby vehicles by different than a range for detecting traffic lights e.g. to identify which traffic lights are relevant to the subject vehicle . That is the range for traffic light correspondence or relevance may be larger than the range for nearby vehicles.

In one example a vehicle can detect that a vehicle in front has started to move away yet the subject vehicle remained stopped at a traffic light that required the vehicle to move. This can signal that the user needs to resume driving so an alert can be sent. In one embodiment the UI and or device may be disabled when the vehicle resumes driving or upon receiving the alert or just before receiving the alert. In other embodiments communication with traffic lights is not required but vehicles can communicate with other vehicles utilizing sensors of the vehicles themselves and communication can also be had with cloud services. The vehicle sensors can include for example cameras ultrasonic sensors radar motion sensors inertial sensors IR sensors GPS etc. to determine that the vehicle in front has moved away after the vehicle was stopped presumably at a stop light .

In one embodiment GPS can also be used to determine if the user is on the road and or at an intersection which can be used to throttle the ON OFF use of this feature. For example if the driver is in his home driveway or some other location that would not benefit from alerts the system would know this or predict it so it would not turn on the alerts automatically. The system can also learn when the user needs alerts or when alerts should be sent. The learning can occur for instance if the user turns off alerts when in town when at home or turns on alerts when in a large city or when in the country etc. Also learning can be used to determine when the user wishes to use alerts such as only on weekends only for AM driving etc. Further learning can be used to determine if the user prefers alerts when other passengers are also in the vehicle or only when the user is alone. The learning in one embodiment can be processed to make predictions of use of the alert and notification features and such information can be associated with the user profile of the user and or user account.

Another embodiment the user may be arriving at a stop light. As the vehicle gets closer to stop and the light is red the vehicle may get data from connected objects e.g. either directly or via a cloud server such as traffic lights i.e. select ones that correspond to the direction of travel . In one example a light indicator can be provided in the vehicle display or a device of the user indicating the color of the traffic light. Thus the traffic light color may be surfaced to the display of the vehicle to provide indication of the state of the traffic light. This information may be useful in various contexts. One example contact may be for vehicles that may be stopped e.g. at an intersection behind a row of vehicles and the traffic light is not visible. Still further the light may be surfaced to a user s phone tablet or other connected device and these devices may show the color of the traffic light is well in some region of the display screen. In one configuration when the light turns green the light shows green on the phone and the phone fades to sleep so the user does not use the phone while driving.

In still a further embodiment the system may detect the vehicle s direction of travel and determine if the direction of travel will lead the user to an intersection where a right turn or left turn will be made instead of progressing forward. Indicators from the vehicle may be used to identify if the user intends to make a turn. Such indicators can include identifying if a blinker for turning is active in the vehicle using turns in steering wheel using where the user is looking e.g. via face eye detection using a mapped destination direction navigation or combinations thereof.

In some embodiments information regarding use of alerts and or communication with connected objects may be shared with others friends on social network and or may be provided to build data sources from crowd sourced data or the like.

With the above features in mind the following examples will provide additional embodiments and configurations and implementations that can be used with alerts regarding other connected objects COs or instead of using alerts. In some examples combinations of elements can be use or substituted for others so as to define implementations of connected vehicles vehicles with access to cloud services vehicles with customized displays vehicles that share state with other vehicles and remote access of vehicles systems and notifications.

For additional discussion regarding examples of connected object CO communication alerts and traffic light interactions with connected vehicles reference can be made to . However it is understood that any feature described herein and or incorporated herein by reference may be combined to define specific implementations.

The methods systems and apparatus include electronics of vehicles that drive display devices in vehicles and communicate wirelessly with Internet services. Some embodiments define method and systems for enabling customization of displays of a vehicle. The displays can be customized based on a user profile and can include settings based on learned preferences. The displays and outputs of the vehicle are also configured to output or display supplemental content obtained for the user profile based on contextually relevant information.

The contextual relevance can be based on information associated with the geo location of the vehicle the state condition of the vehicle learned preferences information in user online accounts information from social networks information from patterns of use by the user information based on the time of day week month or based on when certain inputs or data is requested or looked up by the user. The intersection of these information points allows for the system e.g. server vehicle computer user device or combinations thereof to provide contextually relevant information to the vehicle when the user needs the information so that distracted driving can be reduced.

Further the vehicle can be customized or the user account profile can be customized for vehicles to allow interaction modes to be used. Interaction modes define the way of access input look and feel content simplicity complexity skins etc. of the user interfaces or controls of the vehicle. By enabling this level of customization vehicles can be configured or customized over time to the way each user is most comfortable thus reducing distracted driving. This customization can also extend to physical inputs such as knobs switches buttons dials etc. The customization can be in one embodiment by adding display screens to physical inputs to define hybrid inputs. The display screens can be on the physical inputs or beside the inputs so that the content displayed can change thus changing the functionality of each or some or one of the physical input based on an interaction mode or setting. By providing this level of customization distracted driving can be reduced as the vehicle is customized to what the user is most comfortable with and can thus concentrate on driving.

The Internet services provide access to cloud services. The cloud services provide access to user accounts and access to settings configurations applications and other customization defined by the user. Customization can include user interface customization of a vehicle display or displays. The customization can include the ability to select specific applications APPS to be activated by the vehicle and interfaced via the display or displays voice input touch input etc. The customization is also provided with a learning engine that learns use by the user and automatically implements settings or programming to aspects of the user interface. The programming can include automatic programming at certain times days months years etc. and can be updated or molded over time as the user continues to use the vehicle UI.

In one embodiment a user can access cloud services for a vehicle manufacturer and identify the particular vehicle from selected choices. The user can then identify a customization profile for the vehicle by defining the look and feel of a UI display arrangement of vehicle controls on displays add and associate third party APPS to the vehicle display and save the configuration.

The configuration in one embodiment is saved to the profile of the user. In one embodiment the profile is saved on a database of a specific vehicle manufacturer that offers the customization option. In still other embodiments once a configuration is saved to the profile account of a user that configuration can be shared to other vehicles of the user. In still other embodiments when a user buys a new car the custom configuration can be transferred either entirely or partially to the new vehicle. In some embodiments if the vehicle has more or less system functions the customization can be adjusted automatically or the user can be provided with options to update the customization to add or delete features. In one embodiment the customization will be facilitated via a website. In one embodiment the website may be of the vehicle manufacturer. In one embodiment the website of the vehicle manufacturer can allow the user to add APPS that are created by third parties. The third parties can create APPS that communicate with APIs of the system components of specific vehicles of the manufacturer. Once APPS are selected the user can add them to the custom user interface UI display.

The user can also be allowed to arrange the APPS or icons of APPS in a specific custom arrangement that is saved to the user s profile. In one embodiment the user s profile can also be run on various vehicles other than those owned by the user. For instance if the user is renting a vehicle and the vehicle has access to cloud services the user can enter his user name and password or other identifiers which log the user into the cloud services and saved profiles. The saved profiles will then enable logic to build a custom UI for the user based on the vehicle being driven. In one embodiment the system components and APIs of the system components of the rented vehicle can be paired or linked to the users saved APP selections.

The user s saved UI configuration may also be transferred to the display of the rented or other vehicle vehicle. A best fit configuration can also be generated using the user s profile selections so that the configuration provided for the other vehicle will closely resemble or appear as it does for the configured vehicle. In other embodiments the user s use metrics can be monitored. The use metrics can include use of APPS use be of system components of the vehicle use of the vehicle environment conditions and historical actions taken by the user via the input output controls of the vehicle e.g. buttons levers keys fobs display selections display interface actions communication actions etc. .

These historical actions can then be used to define learned actions. The learned actions can be analyzed to change configuration settings in the user s saved profile. For instance if the user uses a particular APP every day at a particular time that APP icon can be surfaced to the display or preset to start. The APP can then provide information to the user at about the same time the user normally needs the information. Other historical use patterns can be monitored and such data can be saved to the user s profile. The data can then be used by algorithms that build assumptions based on historical inputs by a user as well as environmental inputs location inputs vehicle diagnostic inputs internet connected marketing deals the user s calendar traffic conditions as well as news. The assumptions the algorithm builds are then processed into decisions and actions by an additional algorithmic process to activate local or remote audio and visual alerts change vehicle systems display information on a vehicle s displays and request a decision from a user locally or remotely to complete an action.

A number of embodiments are described below with reference to specific implementations that refer to vehicles but such implementations should be broadly construed to include any type of vehicle structure or object. Without limitation vehicles can include any type of moving object that can be steered and can include vehicles that are for human occupancy or not. Vehicles can include those that are privately owned owned by corporations commercially operated vehicles such as buses automobiles trucks cars buses trains trolleys etc. Example vehicles can include those that are combustion engine based electric engine EV based hybrids or other types of energy source vehicles.

A cloud processing system as described herein will include systems that are operated and connected to the Internet or to each other using local networking communication protocols. A cloud processing system can be defined as interconnected and distributed physical or virtual software defined network that utilizes virtual or physical processing and storage machines that enable various applications and operating systems to facilitate the communication with and between various client devices vehicles user devices structures objects etc. . The communication with and between the various client devices will enable the cloud processing system to deliver additional processing information data and real time metrics concerning data obtained from other processing systems as well as client feedback data. The distributed nature of the cloud processing system will enable users of various vehicles structures and objects to access the Internet and be presented with more flexible processing power that will provide the requested services in a more effective manner.

The processing systems can be defined from various data centers that include multiple computing systems that provide the processing power to execute one or more computer readable programs. The processing of the computer readable programs can produce operations that can respond to requests made by other processing systems that may be local to a vehicle s electronic system. For example a vehicle can include electronics that utilize memory and a processor to execute program instructions to provide services.

In other embodiments the electronics of a vehicle can synchronize with a user s portable electronics. The user s electronics can include for example mobile devices that include smartphones tablet computers laptop computers general purpose computers special purpose computers etc. The various computing devices of the vehicle and or the computing devices of the user smart devices can be connected to the Internet or to each other. Provided that a user has access or account access to the cloud service the cloud processing services on the Internet can provide additional processing information to the electronics of the vehicle.

The wireless communication can include cellular tower communication that couples and communicates through various networks to the Internet to provide access to cloud processing . Other methods can include providing Wi Fi communication to local Wi Fi transmitters and receivers which communicate with cloud processing . Other types of communication can include radio frequency communication such as 802.11.ac 802.11ad and subsequent wireless networking protocols Bluetooth communication or combinations of Wi Fi and Bluetooth. It should be understood that vehicle electronics can communicate with cloud processing via any number of communication methods so long as exchanges of data can be made with cloud processing from time to time.

The communication can be made by vehicle electronics while the vehicle is on or when the vehicle is off so long as communication and processing circuitry of vehicle electronics has a power source. The power source can include battery power that powers vehicle electronics to communicate with cloud processing when vehicle is turned off. When vehicle is turned on the battery that drives vehicle electronics can be recharged.

The applications provided to the vehicle manufacturers can also verify functionality and approve aspects of the application to be provided to an applications database. Users of vehicles made by the manufacturer can then access a website to select specific applications for addition to their vehicles. In one example an Internet site may therefore be managed by or for the vehicle manufacture. User account profiles can be managed to provide access to APPS of an app portal . In other examples the site can be managed by third party companies partner companies that cooperate with a vehicle manufacturers and or internet companies that provide some or all of the backend or front end services and cloud storage and processing.

The vehicle manufacturer may also manage or provide a vehicle type database or provide data for the database . As the vehicle manufacturer makes updates to existing APPS systems or adds new vehicles to its vehicle lines the vehicle type database may also be updated accordingly. Updates can also be forwarded to the vehicle over time or can be automatically installed. The updates in one embodiment can provide new UI features controls etc. As shown the app portal may include a plurality of applications that have been developed by developers and or also approved by the manufacturer of the vehicle.

The app portal can also include APPS that are produced by the vehicle manufacturer or applications that are made for the vehicle manufacturer. Cloud services includes various modules that allow customers of the vehicle manufacturers to access the vehicle manufacturers cloud services and provide interconnection to the vehicles in operation. In one example a user uses a computing device to access cloud services in order to customize the user interface of a vehicle. Broadly speaking the user interface of a vehicle can include any display device in the vehicle.

In one embodiment the display device can include displays that can provide instrumentation normally provided by standard vehicle indicators. The display device is not limited to a display normally placed in the center console but can also any display screen. The display screen can also include that used to normally provide speed and systems settings in the dash over the wheel. The display screen can also include other screens in a vehicle such as those in passenger areas. Additionally the user interface can also include display devices that display systems and auxiliary information such as that provided by applications generated by developers and or applications produced by the vehicle manufacture. In one embodiment the vehicle manufacturer will produce a software module for systems information that allows access to the system components of the vehicle.

The systems component is shown as SYS which is interfaced with an application programming interface API . The vehicle module will therefore include the systems component and the API that will provide access and interface with applications produced by third parties and applications produced by the vehicle manufacture. In one embodiment the system components interfaced with selected ones of the applications will produce a customized configuration . The customize configuration will define the selected applications that were interfaced with the systems of the selected vehicle by the user . Once the customize configuration has been selected e.g. the APPS selected by the user to add or augment the current system APPS or system controls the user may be provided with options to customize the arrangement of the UI user interface .

The customization in one embodiment includes enabling the user to customize the user interface by arranging specific components of the user interface and specific locations on the display. For example a user is allowed to select specific components modules applets widgets code pieces and arrange them in specific locations that are preferred to the specific user for ease of use or frequency of use or for a specific look and feel.

This arrangement of the UI will therefore enable specific applications to act as modules that can be arranged on a display. The applications can then expand or contract to occupy the entire display when selected and exposing additional functions buttons annualize when selected. As will be defined below additional customization of the arrangement of the UI will allow user interaction with the user interface to customize itself based on learned use activity e.g. over a history period by the user.

In one optional embodiment a user is allowed to associate a smartphone or portable device having applications with the customization configuration in operation . For example if certain applications are already loaded on a smartphone or portable device that is proximate or in the vehicle the applications can synchronize or pair with the applications that are part of the customize configuration . The capability of synchronizing certain applications with the customize configuration of the vehicle allows for an integration of applications known and used by the user on the personal device and applications that were made part of the customize configuration using the customization tools of the vehicle manufacturer.

Once the user has customized the arrangements and has associated any portable device applications to the customized configuration the custom UI may be transferred to the user account profile in operation . The transfer of the customize UI to that user account profile can include saving specific identifier information application information and any customization desired by the user for that specific vehicle or plurality of vehicles. Once the custom UI has been saved to the user account profile database the user can then transfer or the manufacturer cloud services can transfer the profile and custom UI to the vehicle in operation .

The transfer of the custom UI to the vehicle can be made by Internet connection between the vehicle electronics and the Internet . As shown in the transfer of the custom UI to the vehicle can occur once the customization has occurred. In one embodiment the customization configured by the user can also be saved to the user account of user in a database of the manufacturer. If the user then buys another car from the same manufacturer the custom user interface can be transferred to the other vehicle in a seamless manner. If the other vehicle has additional features not provided by the earlier a mapping algorithm provided by cloud services can adjust the settings for the new vehicle to match or substantially match those of the earlier vehicle based on the user s preferences. In one embodiment the matching can be a best fit or compatible scenario which provides the user with substantially similar configuration. The configuration can then be updated by the user if the custom settings or configurations made by the cloud services do not meet the user s desire or configuration.

The API provides a defined method and structure for accessing the various control interfaces of the system elements of a vehicle. Other types of systems can also include add on components plug ins such as those that may be downloaded to the vehicle from third party companies from the manufacturer or installed by the manufacturer automatically or with pre permission . Still further other systems can include displays which may be part of the vehicle. The displays can be provided with a control interface to enable the API to access the display functionality. In one embodiment a vehicle can have a number of displays. The number displays can be for example the main dashboard for vehicle a center console of the vehicle a rear display a passenger display a glass display a mirror display a heads up display glasses of the driver the windshield of a vehicle with display capability a window of the vehicle a touch surface of the vehicle or portable devices link or synchronized to the vehicle electronics that provide access to the display system and control interfaces via the API .

As illustrated the system component may be defined by a vehicle manufacturer for a specific vehicle type. In one embodiment a vehicle website or third party site may provide access to system component definitions for specific vehicles. In one example the vehicle website may be provided by a vehicle manufacturer . The vehicle manufacturer may provide a listing of the types of vehicles sold by the manufacturer and the various years for those vehicles as model types and functionality in each model change over time. In one embodiment a user can visit the vehicle manufacturer via websites or a cloud service and select the vehicle to obtain the system component . In one embodiment a particular vehicle type and year of vehicle may make use of more than one system component if the manufacturer provided more than one system component or update.

For example an application can be selected by the user to provide a custom radio interface which replaces the radio interface provided by the vehicle manufacturer. In still another example an application can be provided to replace the temperature meters with custom temperature meters and provide additional data on the display not provided by the standard vehicle manufacturer user interfaces.

In still another embodiment the application selected by the user can define complementary functionality that will function in conjunction with the system components. In this example the application functionalities that are paired with the system component to define the custom configuration will provide a hybrid user interface that is custom to the user. The customization is defined by the user for example by selecting specific applications selecting different background colors wallpapers for the user interfaces selecting different input interfaces adjusting the location and positioning of application components displayed on a vehicle display and programming the various application elements and functions to operates and provide feedback based on user defined programming.

In still another embodiment the custom configuration can be defined by the user to provide a different background color on different days of the week. The background color can be customized or replaced with pictures or photographs customized and selected or uploaded by the user. In this way the user interface system components and applications installed on the vehicle will provide a customized look and feel that is defined by the user for the vehicle and additional functionality will cooperate and function with the systems of the vehicle by providing the mapping to the API to each of the applications that are selected by the user.

In still another embodiment the applications can function alongside system components without requiring the applications to interface directly with manufacturers systems the of the control interfaces. In this scenario applications can function and be placed in the user interface of the custom configuration in the same locations set by the user.

In one embodiment the custom configuration will define a custom interface that will be rendered on a display of a vehicle or on more than one display of vehicle. In one embodiment the applications that are provided for selection in listing may include third party produced applications as well as applications produced by the vehicle manufacturer. Still further the applications may be add on applications that provide additional functionality to existing applications or existing system configurations. In still other embodiments the applications can be defined as applets plug ins widgets code subsets skins code or combinations of one or more thereof.

The cloud services may provide interface customization tools that will allow the user to select the application select the system component for the vehicle and arrange the selected applications arrangement of the applications on the display screen settings for the different applications etc. to thus define a custom configuration for the user interface. The custom configuration will then be saved to a user profile database which saves the custom configuration and provides access to the custom configuration for updates from time to time by the user or for updates provided by the vehicle manufacturer.

In one specific example a user can visit a website an app or a portal to customize a vehicle display using tools provided by a website that allows the customization. The tools can include pull down menus selection icons text entries radio buttons arrangement and customization feature selectors program settings etc. The user can access the website using any user device. The user device can also include setting the custom configuration via a vehicle . In general the configuration can be made using any device that has access to the Internet.

In operation the user will select a vehicle using the tools provided by the website. Selecting the vehicle will allow the correct selection of the system component for that vehicle and any other updates or parameters defined by the vehicle manufacturer. The systems for the vehicle user interface will then be identified in operation . A tool than be provided to allow selection of the apps to add to the interface in operation . As mentioned in this disclosure the user can select any number of applications to add to the custom configuration. From time to time the user can select additional applications to add to the custom configuration or removed from the custom configuration. In operation the user customization for the user interface will be received including the defined applications and systems.

In operation the custom configuration will then be generated and can be assigned to the user profile of a user account in a database s of websites handling the cloud services . In some embodiments the website may be hosted in a distributed manner using virtualization and distributed data centers. The distributed data centers can then communicate data and process operation to the vehicle to execute the applications and system components and provide resources from third party applications and applications over the Internet.

The generated custom configuration can then be transferred to the vehicle and operated using vehicle electronics . Vehicle electronics can also include a display. As mentioned above the display can be a single display or a plurality of displays. The displays are configured to generate images for various screens selections icons buttons controls and received touch input and communicate text information and other data to users.

A user having an account with cloud services will have previously defined custom configurations that may be downloaded or accessed without download for the specific vehicle. The vehicle ID would be sent to the cloud services by the vehicle upon sending the request for the custom configuration.

In this example the display is populated with user interfaces for the system as well as the applications. As shown app interfaces may be presented in specific locations in the user interface as well as system interfaces that are provided in other specific locations in the user interface. In one embodiment the definition of where the specific user interfaces for the systems and the apps are to be defined is set by the user during the configuration process.

In other embodiments the positioning and layout or arrangement of the specific components of the user interface whether they are system interfaces or app interfaces may be custom arranged by the system over time based on use patterns. The use patterns of the user can be learned by the system so as to arrange the various system components and app components in various locations of the display . In other embodiments certain interfaces will be surfaced e.g. shown or presented on the display at certain times of day certain times of the week certain times of the month certain times of the year etc. Better placement of the app components and system components and programming of data into the components can be optimized over time based on learning the input patterns provided by the user to user interface.

For example if the user always views the weather in the mornings at 8 o clock or 9 o clock and a.m. then the weather icon or interface will automatically start to be surfaced e.g. show or displayed or illustrated visually or audibly on the display during those times. If the user plays rock n roll rock music on the weekends and classical music during the weekdays this preference will also be learned. Learning of these preferences will act to custom define the layouts and placement of the icons and user interfaces on the display over time. In still other embodiments the specific placement location and arrangement of the apps system components buttons controls etc. will be preset and fixed by the user based on predefined settings.

These predefined or learned settings can be saved to the database in cloud services and associated with the user account. Updates to the settings can then be made at any time by accessing cloud services over the Internet using any device whether the devices are in the car of the car a portable device a home computer a work computer a tablet a smart phone a smart watch computer etc. Also shown in is an embodiment where a user s smart phone or mobile device is synchronized with the user interface of the vehicle . In this embodiment the user s portable device can synchronize and upload content and UI controls from applications stored and running on the portable device . This provides for safer driving as the controls shown on the vehicle display can be restricted based on driving or operation status.

In one embodiment the user can custom configure to have content from applications running on the portable device to be displayed in the vehicle displayed in a specific location. This location on the display can then be synchronized or mirrored to that part of the display based on the configuration. In still other embodiments the custom configuration can determine to synchronize an application running on the portal device to occupy the entire display . For example if the user wishes to use his own telephone calling interface and contacts that are stored on the portable device that information can be populated and mirrored to the display device while still using other system components or other applications of the vehicle in the background or in a separate screen that is not currently active. In this example the portable device as well as the vehicle electronics can communicate with cloud services at the same time or when specific functions data or communication is required.

However the user that defines the custom configuration can decide to maintain certain system component applications . The custom interface may therefore include a hybrid of third party applications and system applications all designed to be laid out arranged and provide the look and feel functionality desired by the user. In this illustration a third party app is provided for a calendar. The calendar may be synchronized with a user s online calendar which automatically populates the user s data to the vehicle user interface. The radio app may also be a third party app which may have radio stations that are a mix of land based radio and Internet radio. Scores from time to time the user can then arrange the location of the specific applications to different portions of the display.

Still further certain applications can increase in size when being used or decrease in size to enable selection at a later time. For example selecting the temperature system component may expand the system component to a larger space thus temporarily removing other displayed components. The user can also select other buttons to access other system controls other apps or modify or add applications or system controls. When modifications are made the modifications are saved to a user database and profile of the user as managed by cloud services.

Cloud services will therefore allow any future modifications to be made to the custom configuration at any time and from any computer connected to the Internet. Still further the custom configuration can be transferred to a second vehicle. If the custom configuration is transferred to a second vehicle the system can select the system components for the second vehicle and attempted do a best match of applications available for the second vehicle that resemble or match the ones used in a first vehicle. Specific settings arrangements and other features may also be transferred to a second vehicle by simply transferring the custom configuration to a second vehicle.

If the sections are customizable the user can select certain portions of interface to be provided by another third party application . For example interfaces can be used to customize the entire system component such as the entire radio interface or the customize radio interface . The interface can be itself customized by adding sub applications or subcomponents of code that define smaller user interface sections for the custom system configuration of a radio.

Once specific modules have been customized either by selecting pre customized third party applications or by constructing a custom module these modules can be arranged to define a custom placement or arrangement of user interface modules to be displayed on a vehicle display . The customized display can therefore be defined by a plurality of modules which may be provided or obtained by adding third party applications to the custom interface design by the user or by moving or arranging existing user interface components provided by the manufacturer to specific locations on a screen arrangement. Other customization features can include adding custom backgrounds such as images pictures and other multimedia components to the display.

In one embodiment the custom interface can include smaller icons GUIs that identify specific applications that were added to the custom interface that when selected expand to provide the functionality of the applications. The applications can be minimized or maximized on the screen. In one embodiment the functions of the specific applications illustrated in the display will be monitored and restricted depending on safety considerations while driving. For example if the interfacing functionality requires more interactivity with the display or requires a reading of text or inputting text those functions will be disabled during operation of the vehicle. Once the vehicle comes to a stop or is placed in Park certain of these functions will be activated. In other embodiments other safety considerations will allow for applications to shift from outputting text to outputting audio or voice. The input can also be changed from touchscreen button touches selections and or voice input. In still other embodiments safety considerations can allow certain user interface components to move about the display to provide easier reading while driving or automatic conversion of text to audio.

For example content being displayed in the center panel display of the vehicle can be automatically shown in the dashboard display region of the vehicle such as in front of the steering wheel. In still other embodiments some content or display data can be moved from the center console or the display in front of the steering wheel to the windshield of the vehicle in a heads up display area. Accordingly algorithms executed by the applications and applications of the manufacturer can cooperate to provide functionality to the application features and interfaces while maintaining safety parameters defined by rules. The safety parameters will therefore allow content of the user interface to be shifted around to various displays of the vehicle or translated to voice or audio at certain points in time.

These settings and customizations can be made through the web cloud services and tools provided by the website of for example the manufacturer of the vehicle. In one embodiment the cloud services provided by the manufacturer can be provided by a partner of the manufacturer. The partners of the manufacturer can include software companies that develop host or manage certain functionality provided by the vehicle manufacturer. In other embodiments the partner software companies can integrate tools or components with tools and components of the vehicle manufacturer. This provides for an integration with one or more cloud services software services Internet services and services provided by systems of vehicles or systems of the vehicle manufacture. In either case whether the software and logic is designed and constructed by one or more entities the cloud services provided by the vehicle manufacturer or the website that provides the tools for customization will appear as a unified simple to use interface for the user. As mentioned above the cloud services can provide databases for saving the user profile and data associated with the user account.

The user profile can include settings made by the user customizations made by the user identification of applications purchased or added to the vehicle customizations etc. Still further the user profile data can be part or be associated with the user account. In this manner the user that customized a user interface can access the Internet at any time whether through the vehicle or through any other computing device having access to the Internet and make changes modifications or access control features of the vehicle remotely. In one embodiment the profile of the user can be accessed from any vehicle such as rented vehicles or shared vehicles. Settings and profile data can then be shared for a period of time on any vehicle and use data on that vehicle can be stored.

Continuing with the example of it is shown that several of the components of the custom interface can include applications from 3rd parties or applications and controls provided by the vehicle manufacturer. In one embodiment an application provided by third party such as an online calendar can be synchronized with the user s calendar managed by a 3rd party or stored by a 3rd party on a website. For example if the user uses a cloud service to store his or her calendar the calendar appointments can also be displayed on the vehicle interface and are synchronized to the users global calendar settings that are accessible through any computing device. In one embodiment the daily planner can include data or information for the user such as reminders to purchase or get certain things. If while the user is driving around those certain things can be purchased or obtained from local merchants the user can be provided with notifications of availability of those particular things or goods the user desires to purchase.

In still other embodiments advertisers can provide data to the user that is relevant to the user such as discounts for the goods or services the user wishes to purchase. In still another embodiment an application can be provide for the vehicle that provides a user the ability to set and to find certain things such as goods and services the user needs. As the user drives around and algorithm determines whether certain goods or services are available in the proximity of the vehicle s driving actions. If the vehicle approaches or is near certain goods and services and such goods and services are advertised to have a discount or availability the user can be notified on the user display or by audio output by the vehicle. This functionality can be enabled or disabled on demand as programmed by the user in the application that s added to the user interface.

Still in it is shown that other applications can be embedded into other applications. For example the standard system interface for the temperature control and fan of the vehicle can be customized to add additional features. For example in addition to the controls for the standard vehicle settings the user can also be provided with controls to access or add additional applications. These additional applications can be embedded or overlaid on other applications. In one example and embedded application can allow user to embed a weather application which is synchronized to an Internet service. In other embodiments other applications such as phone messages notes and the like can be synchronized with an Internet application or with a local device.

The local device might be the user s mobile phone the user s computer wristwatch the user tablet computer the user s laptop computer or the mobile device of a person inside the vehicle. In one embodiment data from the local devices can be synchronized locally to the display of the vehicle in selected regions. These selected regions of the display can be defined by the user during customization or can be defined automatically by the system based on sizing areas on the display relative to other applications or features displayed on the one or more displays of the vehicle.

Also noted is that the system can automatically arrange or move certain applications or components on the display depending on size constraints or other features that are synchronized with system settings. In operation the user can be provided with tools to enable preview of the user interface and allow for modifications from time to time. The customization can then be saved to the user profile or user account in operation . In operation the custom configuration can then be transferred to the UI settings of the vehicle to allow for display in accordance with the arrangement configuration selection of applications configuration and rules enforced by the vehicle manufacturer to enable safety and use of the applications and features.

As shown in various ones of applications can be located in different locations of a display screen. Although the display and features of the display are described as being applications the icons can represent access to the applications and the icons can expand to encompass the entire screen or part of the screen at various times of use. In one embodiment the user can customize the display directly from the display by selecting more apps can view different screens by selecting a next screen can access system applications can access the phone can provide for other customizations and layouts can update the profile. As noted earlier the custom configuration can be set for a particular user.

When the user is not using the vehicle the custom configuration can be turned off or locked out for another session. Once the user wants to start a new session the user can log back in and the custom configuration returns. In other embodiments the custom configuration will automatically turn off when the user is not driving the vehicle or has not logged into the vehicle. In other embodiments the custom configuration can be automatically turned on when the user is detected. The user can be detected using biometrics login credentials image detection of the face fingerprint detection retina scans etc. Still further the custom configuration can be transferred to other vehicles.

If the user wishes to use his or her custom configuration in another vehicle the user can login to the custom configuration or user account from another vehicle. If the other vehicle does not have all the system components needed to define the custom configuration the custom configuration can be supplemented with other similar components automatically. In other embodiments the custom configuration can be transferred from one vehicle to another or when the user buys a new vehicle. In another embodiment the custom configuration can be adjusted based on the driver. The custom configuration can also be preset remotely from the Internet using the cloud services. The custom configuration can also be configured to provide limited use of certain systems or the vehicle such as when a guest is driving the vehicle. In other embodiments restrictions can be placed on the vehicle speed location of driving and automatic notifications for the user or the master user of the vehicle. The master user of the vehicle can have a master account with administrator credentials.

In still another embodiment the vehicle can be loaned to a child of driving age under 21 18 years of age and the child can be provided with restricted use of the vehicle. When the child exceeds or does not follow the restrictions of the vehicle automatic notifications can be provided to the user that is the administrator of the vehicle. The notifications can be by cell phone smartphone tablet computer mobile device text messages phone calls commendations of phone calls and text audio messages audible sounds vibrations and commendations thereof. History use of the vehicle can also be maintained in cloud services. The history use can provide the user with information as to where the vehicle has been the speed or events violations that occurred when use of the vehicle etc. The configuration can also provide messages to the driver warning the driver of when the vehicle has exceeded a restriction or is approaching a restriction in use driving area speed etc.

In operation the method provides controls to enable user input to select systems and placement of control interfaces on screen views or pages of screen displays. The screen displays can have various configurations placements sizes number of pages tabs etc. and the user can provide controls for some or all of the interfaces and controls in certain locations. In operation selection can be enabled for third party applications. The third party applications can be selected from the vehicle site or by providing links to third party sites. The third party applications can be pre identified by the site and displayed to the user if they are compatible with the particular vehicle selected. In another embodiment the third party applications can all be shown to the user whether or not they are compatible with the vehicle. Upon binding pairing or attempting to find application for the vehicle compliance as to whether the applications operate or comply with the particular vehicle can be made.

As mentioned in this disclosure certain third party applications can be reviewed by the vehicle site administrators before they are made available to users for selection. In other embodiments the third party applications can be approved or disapproved. In still other embodiments the third party applications can be augmented with restrictions made by the vehicle manufacturer or dictated by law. The restrictions can be applied based on the anticipated interfacing with the vehicle interfaces to ensure safety during driving. For instance if a particular application requires entry of text navigation of controls or other activities that would distract the driver during operation of the vehicle such vehicle controls or application controls for application interfaces can be temporarily disabled. In some embodiments when the vehicle has come to a stop or is place to park certain controls or interfaces can be re enabled. In operation the tools provided by the vehicle site or third party site can provide for customization of the layout of the display screens of the user interface.

The customization can include organizing or laying out system interfaces as well as application interfaces such as those interfaces provided by 3rd parties. In operation interface rules are applied to determine if the system interfaces can be replaced with third party application interfaces while providing access to the control interfaces via the APIs of the systems. For example if the user wants to provide a custom speed indicator the speed indicator should be compliant via APIs and or mapping with the system interfaces so that the speed readings can be populated to the third party application. In operation rules can be integrated with or applied to the applications and system user interfaces for when the vehicle is moving. As mentioned above such rules can limit interactivity with certain user interfaces while the vehicle is moving to prevent unsafe driving. In operation the custom user interface is saved to the user profile.

The user profile may contain settings such as selections of the user interface components associated with the system of the vehicle as well as user interface is provided by third party applications. In addition the user profile can contain and store settings provided by the user. The settings provided by the user as mentioned is this disclosure can also be learned settings based on use. The settings can further include remote access settings as well as settings allow the user to control vehicle components from a remote location or a remote computer. The setting can also include providing access to the user account to view historical driving patterns recent driving activities the performance of the vehicle during specific driving sessions the performance of specific vehicle components etc.

In operation the custom user interface configuration can then be transferred to the vehicle. The custom configuration as mentioned above is stored in the database of the vehicle manufacturer or a database held by a 3rd party that cooperates with the vehicle manufacturer to provide cloud services. The database in one embodiment is a network accessible storage which allows access to the user to program and modify the user interface using any computer or device having access to the Internet including the vehicle itself or a third party vehicle. The method then proceeds to operation where the custom user interface can be activated in managed for Internet connectivity for components of the custom interface. For example the vehicle s Internet access protocols can be set or registered with an Internet provider or service provider for the cloud services. The service provider for the cloud services can be the vehicle manufacturer a company cooperating with the vehicle manufacturer a third party company or combinations thereof.

In operation the method can also enable local communication with mobile devices that may be in the vehicle. The enablement may be provided by allowing synchronization with the computing system of the vehicle or with the computing communications of the portable device. For example the local communication can be paired automatically based on a preset pairing process where pairing keys are entered. This provides for automatic settings and synchronization when the user enters the vehicle with the portal device. As mentioned above user interfaces associated with applications loaded on the user s portal device can also synchronize to the display screens of the vehicle as predefined by the user.

Accordingly the disclosed methods may allow users to add various vehicles to the user profile including cars from different brands such as Brand X and brand Y. In the illustrated example the user profile for the user may include custom user settings custom interface styles custom applications and other custom settings and learned settings as described in this disclosure.

The users also able to select various applications from an application database which may provide a plurality of applications from vehicle manufacturers and the user can select applications for the vehicle types selected. In one embodiment certain applications can include native vehicle functions as well as control and mapping protocols to allow the applications to interface with native system controls through appropriate map APIs. In operation the custom user interface can be generated using cloud processing with the preferences set by the user the applications the native vehicle controls and the customer arrangements. The profile that was generated can then be synchronized to the vehicle such as car A.

The synchronization may include downloading of the customized interface from cloud services to the vehicle. In other embodiments part or all of the customization created on the portable device or other computer can be transferred to the vehicle directly without requiring transfer from cloud processing. In other embodiments the synchronization or transfers can include operations performed by portable devices local to the vehicle computing devices on the vehicle computing devices of cloud processing or combinations thereof.

Charge grid load data can also be collected for example for electric vehicle data. Charge grid load can obtain data from a grid power demand source which can include power company s local utilities and the like. Route based discounts can also be provided to the user by collecting mapping data as well as discounts provided by goods and services providers in the marketplace. Mapping data can also be managed to monitor the location of the vehicle in relation to goods and services that may be provided when the vehicle is in proximity. In some embodiments discount data advertisements sales goods and services offers etc. can be provided to the user automatically based on the vehicle s location.

In other embodiments the user can provide settings in the user interface that identifies which type of offers or discounts or information the user wishes to receive. In some embodiments alerts regarding offers and discounts can be provided to the user in an audio manner to avoid driving distractions. Live traffic data can also be provided to the data manager as well as geo data . The data manager is in communication with cloud services to provide these services to computer smart devices remote location and a display of the vehicle .

The display the vehicle can be interfaced with logic that runs on vehicle electronics. The vehicle of products can include memory and processors that execute instructions operating systems API processing application management telecommunications network accessing local communication with wireless devices and general communication with the Internet. Route request can also be provided at the demand of the user via the display and instant routing can provide routes to the user based on data collected and managed by data manager .

Each input will then trigger manipulation of the system s model portion of the APP software paradigm thus invoking stored routines within APPS which then in turn interact with the vehicle s API system built upon the vehicle s operating system . Depending on the app presented to the user the input may trigger stored routines or functions on APP software or operating system level restricted stored routines or functions.

After the processing of stored procedure code is manipulated with arguments provided by the controller inputs visual and or sensory results are presented to the user in the view portion of the model view controller paradigm. These sensory outputs data streams electrical signals may all be translated as additional options results dynamic updating and audio or visual graphical user interface changes on any of the user s connected display devices. The user will notice these results visually or audibly but may also feel or detect changes in the vehicle s mechanical systems. Updates from the model may also be used to toggle vehicle settings which in turn may invoke changes in the vehicle s physical mechanical and electrical systems .

Then the system controller may receive additional updates from the vehicle systems affected or additional user cloud services vehicle systems feedback inputs to re engage the user in a cyclical fashion. If no inputs are sensed the system s controller will continue to poll its electrical and data I O systems for input on a continuous basis.

The model view controller paradigm described is one example of the software input output lifecycle that may be used to invoke manipulate process update portions of computer readable code such as APPS using an intermediary API to communicate with the vehicle s operating system . However APPS may be run on physically wired wirelessly connected or remote devices having processing abilities to translate the computer readable code in APPS into actionable invocations on one or more vehicles in order to facilitate or utilize the vehicle s electrical and mechanical systems in prescribed or customizable fashions.

In this example the vehicle computer has the ability to transmit receive and process information using wired or wireless connections. One such wireless connection is provided by a wireless data sending and receiving antenna connected to a network interface useful for pairing with and communicating data with portable or stationary wireless devices which may or may not be part of a network . Such wireless devices include but are not limited to wireless displays portable smart phones portable computers and even stationary objects structures buildings toll bridges other vehicles etc. The vehicle s network interface through antenna may also communicate with cloud services to receive instructions from a remote location that invokes stored programs such as APPs on the vehicle s computer.

The vehicle may also send and receive data wirelessly in order to establish a connection with a peer to peer ad hoc network. Invocations may result in output data streams interpreted by wireless devices as well as wired devices such as wired displays or vehicle integrated display devices such as windshield heads up projected display or integrated glass displays . All data streams generated by APPs stored on the vehicle s computer may also be triggered by wired devices such as vehicle sensors vehicle electrical systems vehicle electrical systems engine control systems vehicle diagnostics systems user input as well as environmental input.

A user and or vehicle may find system useful in one example where the user drives the vehicle past an electronic toll bridge where a fee is required to pass the toll bridge. The vehicle s computer will communicate wirelessly as it passes the stationary structure transmitting and receiving information with it as it drives by. The user s vehicle may have an APP installed on the vehicle computer that can process the input using the computer s wireless antenna network interface input output system automatically responding to the toll bridge with payment information. Once the payment is received and processed the APP receives information from the stationary wireless toll taking device which is then stored either locally on the vehicle s storage or remotely using cloud services . The results of the transaction are then sent via data stream from the compute code running on the APP to a display device s where the user can visually confirm that the toll was paid accepted and show the user s remaining balance all through the GUI displayed for APP .

In this example of an API computer readable code is arranged in such a fashion that the type of API is described and in this case an API that allows third party control of the vehicle s HAVC system is declared. A declaration may be useful for reserving the vehicle s computer long term and short term memory in order to run stored procedures. The shown declaration describes an example set of data that may reference memory locations and their contents. The contents of this memory location may be modified by stored procedures or functions.

This HVAC API has the ability to store data relating to the vehicle s temperature status target temperature split zone temperate data from electrical and mechanical sensors calendar dates error information among others. Invocable functions are the methods by which a third party APP may manipulate data on board a computer. Free access is not given to the restricted data on a vehicle s computer thus a structured method or methods are described for user by third party APP developers. These functions that may or may not take arguments in order to execute may include functions in the example HVAC API that update temperatures for both the left and right or given zones of the vehicle toggle are conditioning allow visual skins on the APP GUI manipulate schedules and displays etc. The HVAC API described is one example of how one API can control one vehicle system. There may be variations of the APIs for multiple vehicle systems or one superset API that allows access to all of the vehicle s systems through stored procedures or methods.

The stored function may invoke other helper or associate functions within the API in step which all in tern invokes restricted computer readable code at the operating system and or kernel level in step . These invocations will then in turn command mechanical and or electrical systems in step in order to achieve the requested response in step . The results of the commands on the vehicles systems are based back to the vehicle s operating system or kernel level in step which then updates data on the API in step that the APP is polling such as updating the display to show the resulting temperature in step . The results of a function that is invoked at the API level updating the display produces a data stream translatable and displayable by the vehicle s screen showing the APP s GUI in .

Some of the inputs and results that an APP can take and produce locally or remotely include but are note limited to the set that can receive an action react to an action control an action manipulate data models report changes to a view or GUI record events or incidents learn the types of requests being submitted learn the times of request being submitted over time learn the days of the year the requests are being submitted over time generalize and interpret requests assume user intent in order to automatically invoke changes automatically and pre emptively act on behalf of a user fine tune learned user behavior etc.

The learned behavior e.g. learned settings that provide for automatic programming can be assigned to particular applications particular sub features of applications to particular native system features of the vehicle or combination of one or more thereof. The learned settings can also be managed via an interface which shows to the user settings that have been learned and provides the user with options to modify learned settings. The modifications of the learned settings can be made via the vehicle display or any other device having access to cloud services. The learned settings can also be communicated to the user via notifications. Such as We noticed you like your truck temperature at 3 pm to be 60 degrees Please confirm or We noticed you like your car temperature at 8 am to be 75 degrees this will be preset for you automatically or We have detected your favorite settings please login to your account to see settings we have programmed for you or make updates or other similar notifications via the vehicle or to any connected device over the Internet.

In other cases notifications may not be sent. In some cases the settings will just occur automatically. In some cases the settings can be manually adjusted by the user way from the auto settings. In such cases the manual setting can be learned and can be provided more weighting since the user took the time to correct an auto setting. Thus various levels of weighting or importance can be given to learn settings.

This decision and action engine has the ability to execute on what the assumption and reasoning logic module has determined needs to be done. The decision and action engine has the ability to produce alerts both local on screen audibly visually or remotely on a remote display device using a data network. The decision and action engine also has the ability to change vehicle controls automatically on behalf of a user without user action based on assumptions made by the assumption and reasoning logic module . Additionally the decision and action engine has the ability to request a decision from the user preemptively in order to change vehicle controls.

This may be achieved locally or remotely requiring input from a user to proceed. For instance the assumption and reasoning logic engine has determined that the user may want to have his or her car automatically started at 7 55 am because the user typically starts the car at 8 am. Starting the car at five minutes early will allow the system to heat the vehicle to the user s typical liking. However the assumption and reasoning logic may have only reached a level of confidence of 75 where 80 confidence is required to act without user input. Thus the system being only 75 sure that the car should be turned on will automatically send the user an alert requesting a decision on whether or not to turn the vehicle on. Once the user provides a decision remotely on their remote device the decision engine updates the assumption module so that it can augment it s assumptions for an updated level of confidence on the next action trigger. These actions by the user automatically and continually update the assumption and reasoning logic module in order to fine tune the level of confidence on acting without user input and learn the user s behavior for future decisions.

The system by using prior data points has stored assumptions based on conditions the day it is the temperature of the environment and historical events that the user will most likely start the vehicle s engine between 803 am and 805 am and if the temperature is in the 30s inside the vehicle the user will most likely set the interior temperature to between 70 and 80 degrees it is not likely that the user will use the are conditioning unit if there is ice on the windshield the user will most likely defrost the windshield for 7 minutes before departure the user usually drives between 15 and 18 miles at this time of day the user typically starts the vehicle again in the afternoon between 505 pm and 510 pm if the temperature is in the mid 70s the user usually activates the AC and sets the temperature to 65 degrees typical weekend behavior the user typically makes frequents stops does not have a set time the vehicle is started uses certain APPs at certain times and has a history of certain destinations as recorded by GPS.

In one embodiment the user the vehicle may log into the vehicle or be paired to the vehicle automatically so that a user account of the user provides the preferences of the user for displaying select information and communicating with cloud services . Cloud services can communicate with other Internet data sources and cloud applications of the user such as calendars appointment books reservations websites merchants mapping applications discount providing applications charge location services payment services parking services vehicle avoidance services etc.

Continuing with the example of the user interface provided in the main dashboard in front of the steering wheel has been rendered for the user account of the user in accordance with the user s interaction mode selection. As will be described below the interaction mode selection will allow the user to either custom configure or select from custom configurations the type of information that would be rendered on the displays of the vehicle or provided via audio output of the vehicle. In this example the interaction mode for the user account is one that has been selected to reduce the amount of clutter provided in the main dashboard interface.

As used herein dashboard clutter or display clutter refers to when too many gauges icons information GUIs meters text pop ups colors designs animations etc. are rendered on the displays and which may cause distraction while the user is driving. Reducing the amount of clutter is a feature for vehicles that provide interactive displays that can populate so much information that a driver may become distracted. In one implementation the level of information that may cause distraction will vary as this is a subjective metric that is personal to each user driver. In some embodiments the amount of information provided to the displays can be dynamically changed based on the condition of the driving or non driving of the vehicle. For instance if the vehicle is not being driven more information can be rendered on the displays for the user.

If the vehicle is parked or at a stop sign or stop light more information may be rendered on the displays. When the vehicle is operationally moving less information would be rendered on the displays so that clutter can be reduced. In one embodiment more or less information or icons or gauges may be displayed or shown on the displays in a fade in and fade out fashion so that the instant appearance of gauges will not be distracting sight for the driver. In one embodiment when reduce clutter displays are provided basic gauges for operating the vehicle or required by law will be required to stay viewable in the displays while the vehicle is being driven or is in operation. For example a speedometer gauge is required or is vital to the driving of the vehicle and therefore such gauges would not be removed or not shown when reduce clutter displays are selected. It should be understood that reduced clutter is subjective and the interaction modes provide for different types of modes and modes that can be customized or customized over time such that the level of information is not distracting to the particular user from a personal and subjective view point.

In one embodiment the information that is provided on the displays can be dynamically set based on the context of the vehicle s state the user s calendars the weather and other factors. In one example the fuel gauge shown in the main dashboard display of the vehicle in is shown to include a fuel gauge. The fuel gauge in this example is shown to have appeared on the dashboard display because the vehicle s state is that the fuel is low and requires refueling. In one embodiment the vehicle computer can be communicating with cloud services which will automatically identify information regarding available fueling stations nearby.

For example one of the displays of the vehicle shown in illustrates that contextual information can be provided as a recommendation which identifies that a gas station is within 0.25 miles of the current location of the vehicle. In addition a mapping service or map program of the vehicle can be automatically displayed on one of the displays of the vehicle showing the location of the gas station e.g. Ted s Gas . Accordingly the information being displayed on the vehicle is contextually related to the state of the vehicle the location of the vehicle and applications are automatically loaded and provided for generating information relevant to the vehicle and its state.

In this example the type of information that is surfaced to displays of the vehicle can depend on the context of information associated with the user who is logged into the vehicle by way of a user account that is connectable to cloud services . In this example certain information can be examined to determine what type of contextual recommendation can be provided to the user and what type of contextual information can be provided based on learned behavior of the user which provides a prediction or likelihood of the type of information that may be most relevant to the user in the particular context. In one embodiment a server may determine what data to send to the vehicle and when sent the data can be presented on a screen or audio output of the vehicle.

In one implementation the data sent can include a time threshold that identifies e.g. identifier or tag or data when the data can be presented or when the data may no longer be presented. The time threshold can be in the form of data a tag a marker an identifier flag or the like which identifies when the data should no longer be presented e.g. data may become of context and thus no longer contextually relevant . For example the data may be relevant for a particular time window of time or period of time. If the period of time has passed the data can be considered stale such that the data is no longer allowed to be shown even if the vehicle received the data. For example the data may be sent to the vehicle when the user is actively using some display or input and the use of the display or input may prevent the sent data from being presented. In this example the data is held in memory until the user has completed the input or use of the vehicle or personal device that may be active e.g. phone tablet directions device etc. to avoid interruption.

Once the interaction has been completed vehicle software and or electronics can determine that the data received is no longer valid stale or no longer relevant to the current geo location personal preferences vehicle condition or some other factor. In one implementation therefore data that is sent to the vehicle for presentation or surfacing may not be presented if other local conditions user conditions and or geographical conditions determine that the data is stale or no longer useful. Thus gating the data from presentation even after receipt by the vehicle enables for presentation of possibly un needed data to the user thus reducing distractions.

In another example contextual information that may be viewed may include them on a fuel that remains in the vehicle at the particular time which is a state of the vehicle among many different types of states of the vehicle the day of the week whether the day of the week of the holiday information from the personal calendar historical travel times during the time of day the time of day loyalty cards that the user may hold or like traffic information associated to the current geo location of the vehicle the current weather learned past behavior when the user likes to stop for coffee nearby coffee shops coffee shops being a learned type of good liked by the user discounts located nearby discounts located nearby other services that are needed at a particular point in time and other factors.

These contextual types of information associated with the user the vehicle the number of passengers in the vehicle at the time the user s calendar the users likes the users past interactions the predictions of what the user wishes to see or may want etc. are only but a few examples and are shown without limitation.

Continuing with the example of based on the contextual information obtained by the vehicle computer from cloud services and from information stored in the vehicle computer or obtained from a computing device of the user determinations can be made as to the type of contextual recommendation that may be surfaced to a display screen of the vehicle.

It should be understood that surfacing too much information can cause distraction while driving so therefore contextually relevant information that is predicted to be needed or wanted at a particular point in time should be displayed as a contextual recommendation. It is believed that the information that is automatically being contextually provided to the user on the displays is information that would have been searched for by the driver.

Thus by providing the intelligence surfacing of contextual information to displays and or audio outputs of the vehicle less distraction will occur because the driver will not need to interact with user interfaces but instead the information will be provided to the driver just as the driver will need the information. For example the drivers being provided with information to the closest Chevron station which is 0.45 miles away from the current location a map to the Chevron station is shown and a coffee coupon is also shown on the display.

The coffee coupon is provided to the user because the coffee shop is located near the Chevron and the user typically purchases coffee during this particular point in time and the coffee shop is next to the Chevron where the user will likely wish to purchase gas based on his ownership of loyalty cards for Chevron. As such this information has been provided to the user at time when the user would want or need the information which cuts down in screen clutter and also reduces distracted driving.

As shown an RPM revolutions per minute gauge may surface gradually on the main dashboard display when it is determined that the vehicle s RPMs are too high. The gradual surfacing in one embodiment allows for reduced distraction of the driver. This is because fast surfacing of gauges or icons on the display screen may distract the driver to look down and away from the road. However when the gauges are surfaced in a fade in from light gray to full color or contrast the driver will notice the newly surfaced information gauge when the driver next looks down at the gauge.

In the example of it is also shown that the contextual information regarding the user the vehicle the geo location of the vehicle the time of day the day of the week and information found in the user s online calendars and to do lists can be mined to provide contextual recommendations. As shown as the vehicle is communicating with cloud services contextual information can be provided to the vehicle display s . The contextual information at the particular time of day and when the user is driving or activating the vehicle is provided when the user is likely going to need the information.

For instance the current to do list shows that the user needs a hammer and other things and because the user is near a store that sells hammers that information can be provided to the user. The information is provided or surfaced to the user by presenting it on a display after cloud processing determines that other contextual parameters suggest that the user would be interested in a particular good or service e.g. in this example a hammer at that particular time of day and day and particular geo location. In addition learning systems also can determine that the user usually likes discounts so special discounts can be automatically searched for from various online and off line retailers and the discount or coupon can be surfaced to the vehicle display at the time the contextual information is provided to the user.

As shown in addition to presenting the distance to the user providing a map to the store location the discount is presented on the display. The discount can be provided for use by the user in various ways. In some examples the discount can be automatically sent to user s device e.g. smartphone tablet watch etc. . The discount can be in the form of a digital coupon a code a link or some other identifiable form. In still another example the coupon can be provided to the user when the user selects it on one of the displays of the vehicle. The coupon can then be transferred to the user s device or can be sent to the retailer with the user s account info so when the user arrives at the store the coupon is automatically credited or can be sent from the server directly to the user s device.

The low clutter selection e.g. selectable as an interaction mode is configured to present very few icons or gauges such as those that may be required for vehicle operation. In the illustrated drawing the main gauge that is shown is the speed gauge and an optional digital read out of the speed. As the user drives around or uses the vehicle it turns out that the user s calendar determines that an appointment call needs to be made. This determination can be made by reference to the user s online calendar or calendar on a device that is shared with the vehicle. The appointment to call is for example Call Ted. 

At the time the appointment time arrived the user was listening to music but if the vehicle computer server determines that the call should be suggested the vehicle display can change to show Calling . . . Ted. Also or alternatively the main dash of the vehicle can show an icon that is surfaced gradually to the display which may be an indicator of an audio interface. The audio interface can for example as the user if he wishes to call Ted and the user can simply answer by voice input. The voice input can then trigger the activation of the call for the user. Still further other parameters in addition to the calendar can be analyzed to determine that the context is appropriate for surfacing the question to the user.

The analysis can include for instance processing the information associated with the current context of the user the vehicle the current time of day week historical data weather discounts service data etc. Over time based on the selections choices of interfacing what was selected and when what was selected when the vehicle was particular geo locations what was selected and how many people were in the vehicle with the user selections or preferences made by passengers of the vehicle and other data. This data is mined to find overlapping intersections in data and to apply rules and assumptions that form learned data and patterns. This learned data and patterns are used to build a learning database that can grow to include richer data over time and can assist in providing intelligent contextual data for display on the displays of the vehicle or for audio output to the vehicle.

It is believed that by providing users with information they need they will spend less time making raw user interface selections e.g. requiring one or more inputs taps touches swipes navigations launching of apps selection menus inputs etc. which may increase distraction. In one specific example data from a user s online data sources can be mined to provide information the user needs and contextually when needed.

For instance if the user s email shows that the user has booked airline tickets and the time of departure is within 2 hours the user may be provided with a map to the airport may be provided with online checking interfaces for voice entry may provide rental car check in or return information etc. Thus based on the context of what the user is doing what the user has planned when the user has done in the past e.g. learning certain information can be surfaced for consumption by the user. The result is less distracted driving and efficient usage of the user s time.

In one embodiment information data that is sent to the vehicle from a server has a higher likelihood of being consumed or used when it is examined for context. As used herein the information is likely to be accessed consumed viewed read listened to and otherwise used when the information is sent upon confirming context of one or more dimensions e.g. geo location vehicle state user history learned preferences current interaction etc. . In one embodiment data that is sent but not yet presented may lose context and that data may be come stale. In such cases data may not be presented by the vehicle even after safe receipt by the vehicle electronics. Thus context can be checked at the vehicle as well and or the data can be received with identifier data that identifies or tags when such data sent is or may no longer be valid. Thus in one embodiment the vehicle may simply filter or cull out information e.g. supplemental content that may no longer be valid based on the received identifier or tag e.g. such as the time frame of when the data was valid has passed or the vehicle is no longer close to a particular merchant or the like.

In one embodiment traffic data is obtained when the system determines that the user would likely be checking traffic information. This may be triggered when for example the user appears to be taking longer to drive home after work than normal or the driver is driving slower than a current speed limit of a road or a traffic accident is identified ahead or based on learned use e.g. the user typically checks traffic at 5 pm on a workday etc. .

In the displays are shown to be populated with information obtained by cloud services or obtained by the vehicle or obtained by a device of the user in the vehicle or combinations of two or more thereof . The system may alert the user that an accident is up ahead. The user based on account information e.g. history of user propensity or likelihood may usually select to re route so the system automatically provides a re route in the map on the display. In one embodiment data for information associated with the geo location is sent to the vehicle when the profile of the user identifies likelihood for consumption of the information associated with the geo location. An example may be without limitation a user drives by a Chevron gas station but the user prefers Teds Gas so the user will not stop even though the vehicle needs gas and the user is proximate to Chevron. The user would be viewed to not have a likelihood to consume information regarding the nearby Chevron.

If the user s shows that the user does not have appointments or does not urgently need to arrive at the destination the system may not provide a re route option if the extra distance is more than the user likes to drive. Other contextual information can be mined including a learned profile of the user which shows what the user likes does prefers has done over time as a pattern etc.

Alternatively the information can be displayed in a heads up display on the windshield of the vehicle e.g. as overlaid or non overlaid text or icons or graphics videos or combinations which reduce distraction of the driver. Continuing with other displays also show contextually relevant information such as the range remaining for the EV coupons for coffee near the charge locations the price of charge the option to buy ahead of arriving buying to reserve the EV charging spot etc. As noted above the contextual information is processed by parsing data obtained over the internet data obtained from the user s history profile data obtained from learned preferences or habits. In some embodiments the history profile can itself include learned preferences of the user by way of the user s account.

In addition user interactions and input settings can also be communicated to cloud services . This information is communicated regarding user interactions such as inputs or settings is also tied to the geo location of the vehicle the time at which the settings were made the circumstances of when the changes were made the contextual relationship of circumstances to when settings are made or inputs are made and the like. As shown cloud services can include applications and logic and other components which are described above.

Additionally cloud service can include user accounts and databases. In some implementations cloud services can be operated by specific service provider or multiple service providers a vehicle cloud service an internet company vehicle manufacturers vehicle service providers third party service providers or combinations thereof. Example communications by cloud services are shown without limitation. The example communications can be to geo location time of day data local events and news day of the week calendar data learn the preferences explicit preferences online calendars device calendars social media data etc.

In one implementation at least one aspect of one of the preferences is data obtained from an internet service. The internet service can be a private cloud a public cloud website data available via open APIs or combinations thereof. The internet service may also be one of a website or a calendar or social network website or a news site or a dictionary site or mapping service or a to do list or a phone list or a merchant website or a shopping website or a coupon site or a discount site or gasoline price site or an electric vehicle EV charge locator service or an EV charge reservation service or an e payments site or an energy pricing site or a route mapping service or a traffic service or site or a movie site or a music site or travel site or a vehicle site or vehicle manufacturer site or a rental car site or an airline reservation site or a restaurant finding site or a review site or a weather site or a loyalty rewards site or a database or a historical driving database or a vehicle to vehicle database or a holiday calendar or the internet or combinations thereof.

This list of exemplary data and services should not be viewed as limited to the set of data but simply as an example of data can be accessed and process to identify contextual related supplemental content . In operation the interaction mode for the vehicle can be identified. The interaction mode can be the mode that s already selected for the vehicle and therefore the data that that vehicle is expecting will be in accordance with the interaction mode and it settings.

In operation select supplemental content can be sent to the displays of the vehicle or output via the audio system. As noted above the type of information such as the select supplemental content is tailored for the interaction mode selected for the vehicle as well as based on user interactions and the contextual relationship of those inputs to the time the geo location learned preferences and the like.

With the above features in mind it should be understood that the any of the features implementations and or components or system may be combined to define specific implementations. Such implementations may extend to features obtained from any of the figures disclosed herein or incorporated by reference. For additional discussion regarding connected objects the following are provided with the understanding that such embodiments are simply just examples without limitation to specific configurations or combinations.

In some examples some traffic lights are oriented toward a particular direction of travel such that vehicles that wish to proceed down certain directions can be provided with status indicators such as the color of a light e.g. red green yellow green arrow red arrow green text red text yellow text sound outputs flashing colors and or combinations thereof . In some embodiments traffic lights may be connected to the electronics that are local to a particular area zone intersection or substation. Certain lights can communicate with logic or software that is controlled by the particular local zones which may be associated with particular intersections. In some embodiments each zone at particular intersections can communicate with the substation or internet connection hotspot or hub or router or computer. The substation can include a larger geographic control zone that communicates with multiple intersections. The substation can then communicate timing patterns to regulate the flow of traffic during particular times of day or for special events.

In some embodiments local electronics at an intersection can be provided with wireless communication. The wireless communication can provide a signal that can be transmitted to other connected objects that may be near the particular intersections. In one embodiment control signals can be shared between multiple traffic lights so that the traffic lights can be synchronously or asynchronously communicating with each other. The instructions can be populated to one traffic light based on one or more incidences that may have occurred in the traffic that is proximate to that intersection. For instance if an accident occurred near the intersection the traffic lights may be turned to flash in red. In other embodiments each traffic light can include its own communication logic such that each traffic light can communicate independently with the substation of the intersection. In still other embodiments each traffic light can operate as an independent connected object which can communicate over the Internet to a substation. In yet another embodiment each traffic light can communicate with other connected objects in a particular area such as the area proximate to the intersection in which the traffic light is positioned.

In particular implementations traffic lights being connected objects COs can communicate with systems and or software of vehicles that may enter an area of the intersection where the traffic light or lights sit. In this configuration the vehicle is also a connected object. In still another embodiment a user device in a vehicle entering the area of the intersection may be detected as well. The communication between for instance a vehicle CO and a traffic light CO may depend on which traffic light will correspond to the vehicle.

In one embodiment the direction of travel of particular vehicles can be monitored. The direction of travel can be in one embodiment monitored using global positioning system GPS data. For example GPS data can be communicated by the vehicle or device in the vehicle to a server over a wireless connection such as the Internet. In the same manner each of the traffic lights can communicate over a wired or wireless connection to the Internet. The traffic lights as mentioned above may communicate locally with electronics software control panels subsystems or devices that are proximate to one or more of the traffic lights in an intersection.

Communication can therefore be processed from the traffic lights to the Internet by any one of the mentioned systems that are local to the traffic light or lights. In this manner the state of particular traffic lights and changes in state at intersections can be monitored and a determination can be made as to which vehicles may have entered or are entering or are leaving a particular intersection. The identification of vehicles can be done utilizing an anonymous communication signals and exchange data e.g. temporarily tag data . For example identification of vehicles can be made such that the vehicles are identified as moving tagged objects that may be traversing a particular intersection yet identification of the actual vehicle users ownership of the vehicle may be omitted. In other embodiments vehicles may be identified using license plates of the vehicles or by identification of a unique signal ID of the vehicle.

In other embodiments any identification data of the vehicle entering an intersection may be deleted from the system and only used temporally for the period of time when a vehicle enters an intersection. In this manner the system will not store information that may be sensitive to drivers and users in particular locations and will only be stored for a temporal period of time in order to utilize information to provide data regarding state changes of particular traffic lights two particular vehicles that may be entering or leaving specific intersections.

Thus privacy concerns are reduced as the information is not permanently stored regarding the entering and leaving of vehicles of particular intersections. In other embodiments data collected regarding vehicles entering or leaving particular intersections are automatically purged from memory and not saved to permanent memory associated with any device local or Internet storage . Thus the data is utilized just in time and processed for providing state change data e.g. the color of traffic lights to specific vehicles entering or leaving intersections and then removed from the system completely to avoid distribution of potentially sensitive or privacy related travel of specific vehicles.

In the illustrated example a plurality of vehicles are shown traversing various streets having various intersections with traffic lights. As mentioned above some or all of the traffic lights and vehicles may be connected objects. Each of the connected objects can have direct or indirect communication with the Internet or a network of servers or computers and servers that process cloud services. The cloud services in one embodiment provide information to particular vehicles regarding the state of particular traffic lights. Providing information regarding the state of traffic lights can improve traffic flow safety of vehicles traversing particular intersections and avoid collisions. In one embodiment information regarding particular traffic lights and the state of each traffic light that may pertain to a particular vehicles is communicated to those particular vehicles based on their geo location relative to specific intersections directions of travel e.g. heading direction speed relationship between other vehicles and their changing geolocation data based on their moving or non moving condition . As further shown in this example a subject vehicle is identified with a heading direction and the subject vehicle is entering a particular intersection.

Cloud services may be monitoring the location of the subject vehicle using GPS data or other tracking information or combinations of methods. The subject vehicle is known to be entering a particular intersection and the subject vehicle will have an associated area of influence. The area is influence of a subject vehicle may be a sphere or zone that is configurable to a particular dimension based on the size of the vehicle the speed of the vehicle the direction of travel and its proximity to particular intersections. In this illustrated example the subject vehicle is traveling toward the intersection and therefore the area of influence is larger toward the front of the vehicle instead of the rear of the vehicle. However the area of influence behind the vehicle may be sufficiently large to identify other vehicles that may be close enough to potentially affect the subject vehicle. Because the subject vehicle is entering an intersection and the intersection includes a plurality of traffic lights the cloud processing system must determine which of the traffic lights correspond to the subject vehicle s direction of travel. In this illustration the relevant connected objects in relation to the subject vehicle are identified. As noted above the actual size of the area of influence or zone or distance around or from a connected vehicle may vary depending on the context of the vehicle and or other vehicles and or travel circumstances and or intersection conditions.

The relevant connected objects may include the vehicle behind the subject vehicle the vehicle in front of the subject vehicle e.g. and beside the vehicle and to traffic lights that are on opposing sides of the intersection. In one embodiment it is determined that the subject vehicle is intending to proceed forward across the intersection instead of making a right hand turn or a left hand turn. This determination or prediction can be made by monitoring systems of the subject vehicle. The systems can include whether the vehicle is steering to the right or steering to the left starting to turn to the lab starting to turn to the right braking while turning to the right whether the vehicle has a turn signal on or off i.e. left hand turn right hand turn the vehicle is traversing along a mapped path using GPS guidance and other motions or changes in direction of the vehicle.

Continuing with the example shown in it is determined that the subject vehicle will be proceeding forward across the intersection and therefore the two front facing traffic lights on the opposite side of the street will be identified as the relevant connected objects for the subject vehicle. If the vehicle starts to turn right or makes a right hand turn signal cloud services may update the prediction that the user is turning right and then associate as the relevant connected objects to the subject vehicle. In still another embodiment a camera of the subject vehicle may detect that a vehicle in front has its turn signal on and is blinking for a left hand turn. And if the subject vehicle is stopped at or near an intersection and is stopped behind a vehicle that has its left turn signals on image detection can be used to detect the intension of the vehicle in front to turn left and cloud services may deduct or predict that the subject vehicle is also intending to turn left. Still further the shown area of influence may have a shape that corresponds to the direction of travel. For instance because the subject vehicle is traveling forward the area of influence takes on a semi oval shape. In other embodiments the area of influence may not take on specific shapes but may simply include objects or exclude objects. In other embodiments objects can be included or excluded based on their distance from the subject vehicle. Distances can be calculated based on geolocation separation between connected objects which can be updated from time to time as one or more moving objects connected objects traverse particular areas.

In some embodiments this information is communicated to cloud services so as to provide alerts or information or notifications to one or more of the vehicles to assist in avoiding accidents. In still other embodiments in addition to notifications or data regarding other connected objects control information can be transferred to one or more of the vehicles so as to enable accident avoidance. For instance tactile feedback can be provided to various vehicles so as to alert drivers when potential exists for a collision between one or more of the vehicle s or stationary objects.

In some embodiments vehicles may approach an intersection yet not stop at the intersection when the light is green. This may be the case often as drivers progress around from intersection to intersection. Accordingly if the light is green and or the vehicle does not stop at the intersection likely because the light is green the color indicator and or text or notification of the state of the light may not be surfaced or shown on a display of the vehicle or device to reduce clutter. Thus logic processed by the vehicle and or the cloud processing can determine to show or not show e.g. surface or not surface the state information to the screen of the vehicle or a device in the vehicle. This feature therefore provides an automatic throttle to avoid presentation or refrain from presenting status indicators when conditions indicate that the status information is not useful or likely to be needed. The same can be said for other types of environmental alerts and or notifications. If conditions indicate that the information is not useful based on the context of driving or the context of driving in particular environments and or conditions the information is not surface or presented on a screen of the vehicle and or a device of the user in the vehicle. Similar filtering of information and or instructions to system of the vehicle can be processed or avoid to reduce clutter distraction and improve driving safety.

The sensors can include sensors directed in various locations in the vehicle including the top of the vehicle sides of the vehicle front of the vehicle rear of the vehicle inside the vehicle etc. Sensor information such as proximity to another vehicle may be communicated to cloud services by the subject vehicles computers. The location of the subject vehicle and the heading direction can also be communicated to cloud services by the vehicle or determined by cloud services based on the location of the vehicle. Based on the location of the vehicle certain connected objects within the area of influence can be identified. In this example traffic lights have been identified and their state has also been identified at a particular time. The state in this example is green.

For discussion purposes green means that the traffic light will allow the driver to proceed across the direction of travel for which the traffic light is associated or directed for. In one example the vehicle in front of the subject vehicle may have begun to move forward after the state change of the traffic light e.g. the light turns green. At time 0 the vehicle in front of the subject vehicle starts and moves to a direction and placement beyond the traffic lights at time 1. If during this period of time e.g. delta time lapse or duration the subject vehicle fails to move forward a signal can be communicated to the subject vehicle by cloud services to alert the subject vehicle that the light is green and the car in front has moved forward. This period of time may vary but generally it may be if 12 or 10 or 8 or 6 or 4 or 2 seconds passes after the front vehicle has moved. In some cases the sensitivity of when to send alerts will be context and location specific. For instance in some cities users are in a hurry and the trigger may be if the user sits for more than 2 seconds. In other areas such as in the country or low traffic zones the trigger may be closer to 12 seconds.

By providing this information a vehicle behind the subject vehicle will not become annoyed that the driver has not proceed to move when the light has turned green. In one embodiment if the driver becomes distracted while the light is red the driver may fail to look up and notice that the light has turned green.

In this manner providing an alert by cloud services to the subject vehicle the subject vehicle s driver may continue his driving activities and discontinued his distracted state. As will be described below there are situations where the driver of the subject vehicle may be operating a mobile device while at the intersection. If the light turns green the driver of the subject vehicle may not notice the light turning green i.e. state change and the driver behind the subject vehicle may become annoyed. If the period of time has passed when the state change has occurred and the driver of the subject vehicle has not moved and the vehicle in front has already moved then the subject vehicle may receive an alert. The alert may be in the form of an audio alert a mechanical alert tactile feedback notifications and messages. In one embodiment the notifications and messages may be communicated to the mobile device or electronics of the vehicle that the user was interfacing with while at the stop sign or stop light. For example if the user is utilizing a smart phone while at the stop light certain parts or portions or applications of the smart phone or device may deactivate automatically when the light turns green. In another embodiment only certain applications that are not allowed during vehicle driving may be turned off or deactivated such as navigational applications on a computer and a vehicle display .

In some embodiments the portable device being utilized within the vehicle is detected to be in the proximity of the driver s zone will be inactivated when the light turned green. Inactivation of the user device can occur in numerous ways. The user device can be put to sleep can be deactivated for certain applications and the user may receive notifications of the state of the light on the user device or the vehicle display. For instance if the user is utilizing a texting function on a mobile device and the light turns green the green light may be rendered in some icon or region of the display screen which indicates of the user that the light turned green. By doing this the state of the light for which the user was waiting to turn from red to green is actually reproduced on the mobile device screen or the screen of the vehicle. In this manner if the user is focusing on the screen of their device or the vehicle device the user will instantly see that the light has turned green and discontinued use.

In some embodiments in addition to showing the color of the light and the state change certain functions applications features and or the entire device will become the deactivated for a period of time while the vehicle is being driven or is identified to be in drive mode.

The following are only examples and other systems having connection to the Internet may also provide data which may be useful for cloud services in rendering information to connected vehicles. In this example cloud services may be in communication with connected objects data traffic substation data relevant traffic lights and data weather applications and systems police data and relevant accident information social networks including identification of friends nearby map data identifying current locations and proximate businesses and or services and or traffic lights and or activity GPS data for one or more vehicles vehicle to vehicle data management vehicle sensor data of one or more vehicles smart devices in vehicles pedestrian smart devices and sensors that may be located in an area of influence etc. As shown the vehicle may be in the process of turning right and the heading direction is shown with an arrow. In addition the turn signal may be turned for a right turn. At this point in time the corresponding traffic lights that would relate to the right turn may be identified as having a condition or state of RED. The vehicle state and changing state and movement direction can also be monitored as the vehicle approaches the intersection in the heading direction.

For instance if the user is moving the steering wheel slightly to the right and continues to move to the right hand lane to potentially make a right hand turn this information is used along with the fact that the right turn signal is active. In another embodiment the user may be traversing a mapped path and following term by turn information using a navigation system. This information can be utilized to identify where the vehicle will go after it reaches the intersection which in this example the vehicle would turn right.

One of the displays in the vehicle can also illustrate the corresponding color of the traffic light that may apply to the direction of travel of the vehicle. For example the color RED may appear on one or more displays of the vehicle signaling to the user that the traffic light is red for the intended traversing direction. In some embodiments advertising data may also be provided to the user devices or the vehicle displays depending on the geo location of the vehicle. For example the user e.g. displays of the vehicle or devices of the user or occupants may be provided with advertising related to business or merchants that are nearby. In further embodiments serving of advertising may be filtered based on user preferences so that advertisements that are not of interest to the user are omitted or not of interest based on predicted likes or dislikes based on historical interaction. Other ways of filtering ads or finding ads or serving ads to the user may also be used as described in this document or in incorporated by reference materials.

In addition other relevant connected objects in the intersection may also be identified relative to the subject vehicle. For instance other vehicles that may be entering or leaving an intersection may also be identified. In certain circumstances some connected objects may be approaching an intersection at high speeds and may not be prepared to stop at the intersection. This information can be communicated to other connected objects approaching the intersection. This information for example can be communicated to a vehicle that has the right away yet another vehicle is about to enter the same intersection and breach the right away.

This information can be useful to avoid collisions that may occur at intersections when in fact drivers feel that they have the right away based on the color of the lights. In other embodiments emergency vehicles entering certain intersections may cause cloud services to communicate with traffic signals to place all traffic lights or certain traffic lights in red or flashing red. This information can be used to clear a path along intersections for emergency vehicles. In other embodiment emergency vehicles may cause certain traffic lights to turn their state to green to allow the emergency vehicles to progress while changing opposing traffic lights to red. This may be done in advance of the emergency vehicle reaching an intersection.

For example if the emergency vehicle is headed in a particular direction which may include a number of intersections that are mapped along a path those traffic signals along that path may automatically change to green for the direction of the emergency vehicle while at the same time placing other opposing traffic lights in red to clear a safer password traversing vehicles. In a similar manner if emergency vehicles are traversing a particular path that takes them through various intersections in addition to changing traffic lights to facilitate their traversal along the path certain traffic lights can also be equipped with cameras and other sensors that can monitor intersections in advance of emergency vehicles entering or reaching particular intersections.

In some embodiments emergency vehicles may communicate signals via a cloud system to other vehicles in their path. For example if an emergency vehicle is traveling in a direction and there are several cars in front the cars in front may be provided with an alert or display indicator alerting them that an emergency vehicle is approaching behind them and to move over to the left or right or stop if they are being pulled over for some infraction or potential infraction .

This information can also be used to communicate safety information to approaching emergency vehicles such that emergency vehicles are notified if particular intersections are blocked in their intended traverse direction. If intersections are blocked rerouting of emergency vehicles can take place in addition to resetting of traffic lights to suit the intended direction of emergency vehicles. The location of emergency vehicles can be tracked just as any other connected object is tracked and the state of the traffic lights connected objects can also be tracked such that cloud services can provide the appropriate information to the vehicles as well as to the connected objects.

The mobile device of the passenger can control features of the vehicle such as settings associated with his or her seat air conditioning windows radio apps of the car and other features. In one embodiment the passenger can be communicating with the vehicle computer to provide access to those specific features that affect the passenger. During the manipulation and interaction with applications on the mobile device by the passenger one embodiment may include providing an identifier on some portion of the screen that identifies the state of the traffic light. For example the state of the traffic light is red so at some portion of the display screen the identifier can be presented on the mobile device while the user is interacting with other applications. The same can be said for the mobile device of the driver as well as the display unit of the vehicle. As shown the display of the vehicle can include various applications mapping applications and other features.

While the vehicle is stopped the state of the traffic light red can be displayed so that users focusing in on their applications or mobile devices will see that the traffic light is red. As further shown the vehicle computer can also be communicating with cloud services . In this example the vehicle can be associated to the user account and preferences of the vehicle and of the driver can be maintained. The preferences can include preferences that are entered by the driver or learned preferences for the specific vehicle. For example the preferences can include information as to how the user wishes to be notified when the traffic light changes from red to green. Notification can include audio notification text notification tactile feedback notification multiple notifications multiple messages color changes on the display screen color indicators on the display screen and the like.

The activation or disabling or fading of certain applications is required or configurable based on local regulations laws or settings. By disabling or fading certain applications on either or both of the mobile devices that are provided with accessible reach in the driver control zone drivers are alerted that a traffic light has changed so the driver can proceed to look forward and pay attention to driving instead of connected devices. As shown the vehicle computer can also be communicating with other sensors. Certain sensors can include cameras radar ultrasonic audio sensors tactile feedback sensors etc. Certain sensors can be used to identify when a vehicle at a stop sign or stop light is required to proceed with movement when the state change of the traffic light indicates that the vehicle should move forward. For example if the vehicle in front of the subject vehicle has already moved forward and the connected light is green yet the subject vehicle has not moved forward the vehicle computer can provide state change information to tactile feedback units within the vehicle to alert the user that the traffic light has turned green.

In addition to tactile feedback or instead of tactile feedback audio alerts can be provided to the driver or simply stayed changes to the applications displays functionality interactivity of devices and display screens that are accessible to the driver. In one embodiment passengers in the vehicle may also be provided with information of the state change such as the light turning green. However because the passenger is not required to pay attention to driving the applications on devices of passengers may remain active.

In another embodiment a way to keep someone from texting and driving is to not let their text be sent when the car is moving. In one embodiment a parent friend that is concerned about a kid friend texting can place a setting on their device. For instance the user can send a message to another user indicating that no message will be read from that person while their device is detected to be in the vehicle that is being driven. For example a parent can send a message to a kid notifying the kid that if the kid sends a message while driving that message will not be received by the parent. Thus the kid will be discouraged from sending text messages to the parent as the parent would not be receiving those messages while the vehicle is moving. The same can be done by any friend utilizing an application that notifies the friend that no message it will be red if messages are sent from their device and the devices associated with a moving vehicle. For example I put a setting on MY phone that does not let ME receive any texts when my friend or kid the text SENDER is driving.

If all my friends set their phones to NOT let me send them texts when I am driving then I will not be sending any texts because they will not get them. As a real friend most friends will set this settings on their phone apps or devices so friends will drive safely. In one embodiment a determination is made if a particular device is associated with a driving person. This determination can be made by sensors or proximity sensors within the driving zone of a vehicle. As shown in if the cell phone is proximate to the driver even if not being viewed by the driver that cell phone will be disabled while the vehicle is moving. If the cell phone is moved away from the driver control zone that phone would be enabled and usable by another passenger.

Thus messages sent to the mobile device or attempted to be sent from the mobile device while the driver is handling the device in the driver control zone will not be sent. In one embodiment this feature can be included as part of an application of the vehicle. In another embodiment this feature can be enabled as a standalone application of a device. In other embodiments the application can communicate with electronics of the vehicle to identify movement of the vehicle or with GPS or other cloud services to identify movement of the vehicle and identify the position of the mobile device within the vehicle.

In one embodiment one or more servers of a cloud system can execute methods which enable sending of data to connected objects e.g. connected vehicles and or other connected objects and receiving data from connected objects e.g. connected vehicles and or other connected objects . The server or servers of a cloud system that may provide cloud services may receive one or more geo locations of a vehicle over time. This geo location data may be used to identify the location of the vehicles and the movement of the vehicles around various areas traversed. In some embodiments sensor data of the vehicle may be used. The sensor data may include various types of sensors such as to detect the presence of other vehicles or objects and detect when other vehicles or objects have moved.

In one embodiment a vehicle and or a server of the cloud system may receive information from the vehicle and the vehicle may be getting information from some other device e.g. traffic light another car a sensor a building a road a light post or some other thing that is connected or can communicate with other connected objects or one or more servers connected to the internet or a network. In one embodiment an area of influence with respect to a subject vehicle may be within 500 feet or within 50 200 feet if the connected object is a traffic light.

In some embodiments it is understood that various connected objects are independent of each other meaning one connected object does not control the other. For instance a traffic light being a connected object is independent of a vehicle which is also a connected object. In some embodiments each connected object may have its own independent connected identify such as an IP address or internet ID or serial number or code or identifier so that each can be identified and distinguished. In other embodiments one connected object may control another connected object. In some embodiments a vehicle may receive data from more than one connected object either directly by communication with the connected objects or via a wireless connection to the internet.

In some embodiments a current geo location is the geo location identified by a GPS coordinate and that coordinate can be associated to a mapped location and the mapped location can be associated to traffic lights buildings businesses and other objects nearby. In one embodiment the state information of an object may change from time to time. In the example of a traffic light the state change may be if the light changes from green to red or red to green or is yellow or is an arrow of red or green color or is in a transition between any color or text or state.

In one embodiment the heading direction of a vehicle may be where the vehicle is pointed or oriented. This may provide an indicator as to which light the vehicle is facing i.e. in front of the car . Or at least an area ahead of the vehicle so a user may view the light from the current orientation heading. In one embodiment the direction of travel can be straight can include a turn up ahead a curve up ahead or multiple turns up ahead. In some examples the direction of travel may exclude reads or turns behind that are not current options of travel due to the current geo location and or movement direction.

In some embodiments information regarding at least the stationary objects that are in the direction of travel are used for determining that the state information changed while the current geo location of the vehicle remains unchanged for the threshold period of time after the state information changed. The threshold period of time can vary for example between 2 12 seconds and more likely between 2 6 seconds and more likely between 1 5 seconds and more likely between 1 3 seconds. In one embodiment the threshold is configurable by a user such that the threshold is reached sooner or later depending on how urgent or desperate or casual the driver may be. For example city drivers may request a lower threshold e.g. closer to the less than 3 seconds while country drivers may request or set a higher threshold e.g. closer to less than 10 seconds .

In this example vehicle electronics may communicate with connected objects either directly or via cloud services such as the Internet networks local networks wide area networks or combinations thereof. In some cases vehicle electronics may be able to communicate directly with certain connected objects such as using peer to peer cellular wireless radio or other connection methods and or systems. In this example connected objects may include traffic lights other vehicles smart devices connected buildings road signs emergency vehicles and the like. In one embodiment cloud services is receiving information from vehicle electronics regarding the vehicles heading and location changes. Utilizing this information cloud services may identify the subject vehicle and whether or not it is approaching an intersection. The vehicles heading can also be identified relative to the intersection such as to identify relevant traffic lights or other connected objects that will relate to the direction of travel of the vehicle. In some embodiments identifying the direction of travel and the speed of the vehicle may also determine whether or not the vehicle may be stopping at the intersection.

If the vehicle is not stopping at the intersection then alerts may be turned off or not activated. For instance if the light is green notification to the display screen of the vehicle that the light is green is simply extra information that may clutter the screen and or audio output of the vehicle and may cause distraction instead of helping. Once it is determined with the identity of the heading direction is for the subject vehicle and the conditions of whether the vehicle is going to stop or not stop or is attempting to stop at an intersection or near a traffic light the method can move to process and receive other data from the vehicle such as sensor data. The sensor data can also be collected at any time and need not be collected after identifying the heading direction so therefore the order of the method operations is not necessarily the order in which the processes will occur. In some embodiments the processes will occur simultaneously synchronously or asynchronously or in different orders. The sensor data from the vehicle may include external sensors and internal sensors. Some centers may include cameras infrared sensors inertial sensors radar sensors GPS sensors proximity sensors image processors sensor logic and the like. For example some of the sensors which may include cameras inside the vehicle may detect the face or body parts of the driver to identify alertness direction that the user is looking whether the user is distracted and other identifying information regarding the driver to provide information to the driver when the driver needs the information.

For example if the driver is alertly looking toward a traffic light the user may not need additional notifications or alerts to the display screens of the vehicle or audio displays. If the driver the vehicle is looking away from the traffic light or toward the display screen of the vehicle or a passenger the alert may be more likely to be rendered or provided to the driver or vehicle. In one embodiment if the vehicle is at intersection and traffic lights are relevant to the subject vehicle information such as state of the traffic lights can be provided to the vehicle. Once it is determined that certain connected objects are relevant to the subject vehicle it is determined whether or not to send the information to the vehicle. One filtering process may include identifying whether the connected objects are within the zone of influence of the subject vehicle. If the connected objects are too far away or outside of the zone of influence of the subject vehicle and alert may not be sent to the vehicle as those connected objects may not be relevant to the driver and will increase clutter not helpful for reducing distracted driving. Once it is determined which connected objects are relevant to the connected vehicle cloud processing may determine to send an alert to the subject vehicle. As mentioned above the alerts can take on various forms. And alert can be simply to provide data to the subject vehicle which is then processed by the vehicle electronics computers applications running on the vehicle and other decisions can take place in the subject vehicle before presenting the alert to the displays audio tactile feedback objects and other systems.

In one embodiment the alert can also take on the form of a message a notification a traffic light state e.g. the light is green the light is red the turn signal is green the turn signal was red a pedestrian is in the right away an oncoming car is approaching an intersection when the light is green emergency vehicle is approaching and emergency vehicle is requesting that the subject vehicle stop etc. . In some embodiments certain user interfaces of the vehicle will be disabled when the vehicle is determined to be moving traversing or active driving is taking place or should be taking place. In some embodiments certain applications or user interfaces of the vehicle will be enabled when the vehicle is at a stop and intersection or is in Park. In some embodiments when the state changes of the connected objects such as the light turning green certain features or applications or functions of the computing systems of the vehicle display screens or user devices within the vehicle may be disabled deactivated place to sleep paused stopped turned off etc. In some embodiments the activity that takes place to those connected devices can be configured by the user and can be set as part of preferences of the user account. In one embodiment the preferences and settings made during times of use can be monitored to identify patterns and predict what features the user wishes to activate learned preferences and improve the interfaces for the particular users.

In one embodiment when users enter different vehicles the user can pair his or her user account to any vehicle. Therefore the preferences learned settings and interactions that are specific to specific users can be transferred from vehicle to vehicle utilizing the information stored in cloud services. Accordingly the functionality and features described herein are not necessarily tied to a specific vehicle that can be ported over to many vehicles or the vehicle s that correspond to the particular drivers users and user accounts managed by one or more cloud services. With the above features in mind it should be understood that more or less of the features described herein may be integrated together to defined specific implementations.

In one embodiment at a remote location a user is able to access a user interface for an application which provides users access to user accounts. A user account can be for a user and the user can add one or more vehicles objects data or appliances for remote reporting viewing and control. In one embodiment a user is an owner or user of a vehicle. The user can register the vehicle with a remote service.

The remote service can be accessed over the Internet such as via a website or application of a portable device. The remote service can provide a multitude of cloud services for the user such as remote control features remote viewing services remote alarm controls remote camera activation remote audio video recording of the vehicle i.e. areas around the vehicle and inside the vehicle . In one embodiment the vehicle is able to connect to the Internet e.g. when the vehicle engine is off on and or is occupied or un occupied to allow a user via a remote cloud service to access features of the vehicle. The vehicle can be accessed when running when parked when stopped when moving etc. The vehicle and its audio recording devices and video cameras can be accessed from remote locations to allow users to remotely communicate with the vehicle or with people riding or residing inside the vehicle.

The remote communication can also allow a person to communicate remotely with people standing outside or inside of a vehicle. For instance if a user is accessing his or her vehicle from a remote location cameras installed in and or on the vehicle allow the remote user to see a person standing proximate to the vehicle. The remote user can then communicate with a person standing proximate to the vehicle using microphones and speakers of the vehicle.

In some embodiments described herein vehicles structures and objects may include circuitry and communication logic to enable communication with a cloud processing system over the Internet.

In one embodiment the services provided by the electronic systems of a vehicle can include services that access the various components or subsystems of a vehicle such as door locks service histories user profiles audio settings entertainment settings mapping functions communications systems telecommunication synchronization systems speakers heating and cooling functions auto engine start shut off remotely via smart devices remote heating cooling initiation remote face to face conferencing etc. The electronic systems within a vehicle can also provide a user interface such as a graphical user interface. The graphical user interface can include a plurality of buttons controls and transceivers to receive input from a user. The input from a user can also be provided by voice input facial recognition eye retina scans fingerprint scans a combination of biometrics or via a capacitive or regular touchscreen contained or displayed within the vehicle the vehicle s glass doors dashboard etc.

In one embodiment vehicles can maintain information regarding where they are where they are heading and their destination maintained which is maintained by GPS and navigation systems on board. The information collected and maintained by every vehicle may be mutually exclusive meaning that each individual vehicle is aware of its own heading rate of speed and current location. This information in one embodiment is crowd sourced and or crowd shared consumed for use in for accident avoidance or other communication. By networking vehicles within a certain radius together all individually location aware vehicles become aware of all other vehicles in their sphere of influence. Vehicles may network with vehicles in their range using wireless communication systems such as but not limited to Wi Fi Wi Gig LTE cellular radio near field communication or other methods.

In one embodiment the communications of the vehicle and electronics of the vehicle will enable direct communication with a user of the vehicle. The user of the vehicle can include for instance the owner of the vehicle a driver of the vehicle or any third party having access to the vehicle either to drive the vehicle to monitor the vehicle remotely etc. 

The access to the data can also be encrypted to prevent unauthorized access to the data. GPS and mapping services can also be in communication with the cloud processing provide data concerning the locations of the vehicles and activities that occurred to the vehicles when at particular locations. The cloud processing can be access by the vehicles themselves using their electronics and communications via mobile devices from home from work etc.

In some embodiments the vehicles may establish peer to peer links to facilitate fast transfer of data. In other embodiments vehicles may link to each other using pairing algorithms that allow the vehicles to exchange data using WiFi Bluetooth near field communication NFC or some other short range communication protocol.

A user s APP homepage may also include dynamically updating sections in which the most relevant information at a given time may be displayed or surfaced to a user. If a user has parked in a certain parking area he or she may want to monitor metrics related to incidents that may have occurred to his or her vehicle vehicles around his or her vehicle any dynamically received alerts as well as precaution levels. Additionally a user may choose to configure his or her APP homepage to display the most pertinent audio and video feeds to their needs.

In one embodiment the vehicles can communicate directly with each other via a temporary pairing process. The temporary pairing process can be automatically enabled when vehicles become too close to each other for example. When this happens local communication between the vehicles such as a peer to peer connection Wi Fi connection NFC connection or Bluetooth connection can be established to enable the vehicles to share information concerning their proximity to one another.

This local communication will enable one or both vehicles to take correction actions or alert a driver to change course or trigger automatic collision prevention measures e.g. more aggressive notifications to one or both operators slow the speed of one or more vehicles change the driving direction of one or more vehicles etc. . Once the close proximity communication occurs and some corrective action is made the data regarding the occurrence and the actions taken can be communicated to the cloud system for storage. The information can then be viewed by a registered user having access to an account for the vehicle s .

The storage may be saved on cloud storage data centers or the like which are accessible over the Internet. The access may be wired or wireless. In vehicles the connection to the Internet may be wireless and the connection can be continuous or non continuous depending connection. Code on the vehicle electrons can execute at least some of the method operations when not connected and other operations are executed jointly between vehicle electronics e.g. memory code and processors of a vehicle and cloud processing which may implement one or more servers either virtual or not.

It will be obvious however to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances well known process operations have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention. Some embodiments are defined by combining features from embodiments defined throughout the present application and materials incorporated by reference.

In some implementations the learning and predicting embodiments may utilize learning and prediction algorithms that are used in machine learning. In one embodiment certain algorithms may look to patterns of input inputs to certain user interfaces inputs that can be identified to biometric patterns inputs for neural network processing inputs for machine learning e.g. identifying relationships between inputs and filtering based on geo location and or vehicle state in real time logic for identifying or recommending a result or a next input a next screen a suggested input suggested data that would be relevant for a particular time geo location state of a vehicle and or combinations thereof. In one embodiment use of machine learning enables the vehicle to learn what is needed by the user at a particular time in view of one or more operating status state of the vehicle in view of one or more state of one or more sensors of the vehicle. Thus one or more inputs or data presented to the user may be provided without an explicit input request or programming by a user at that time. In one embodiment reference is made to learning and prediction wherein both terms may be referencing the same or similar function e.g. looking at user interactions preferences tendencies etc. in order to identify or select a particular type of data that may be useful for the user based on the learning or prediction. In other embodiments learning may be defined closer to the traditional sense of machine learning pattern learning historical data input analysis etc. while prediction is may be defined closer to the traditional sense of identifying some data which is predicted to be relevant based on analysis of the context in which the data is predicted. In still other embodiments prediction and learning may be hybrids used in conjunction for providing contextually relevant supplemental content to a vehicle user account user device or some target associated with a user account or profile.

Overtime machine learning can be used to reinforce learned behavior which can provide weighting to certain inputs. For instance the more times a user turns on the windshield wipers when it is raining and within two minutes of turning on the car may signal that this patterns is likely to happen again. In another example if a user stops to charge his vehicle at a particular charge station which is 20 miles from his home repeatedly on Tuesdays at 6 pm when nobody is a passenger in the vehicle and the vehicle had less than 5 charge may be used as a strong pattern that this may occur again in the future. This data combined with other data may be used to recommend data regarding the charge station in advance so that the user need no look up the charge station to reserve a spot or the like. It should be understood that these are just simplified examples to convey examples of recommendations which may be based on some learning preferences or pattern analysis or likelihoods.

Thus context awareness across multiple dimensions will allow for more accurate predictions learning e.g. by building and refining behavior models and surfacing suggesting recommendations of supplemental content or settings when it is most probable or likely or useful or needed by the user or vehicle and user or relevant at a current or proximate or near or destination geo location.
