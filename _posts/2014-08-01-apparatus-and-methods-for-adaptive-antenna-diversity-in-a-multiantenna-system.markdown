The present disclosure relates generally to antennas and multiple input multiple output MIMO antennas systems with diversity reception and more particularly to mobile devices employing such MIMO antenna systems.

Mobile devices may incorporate multiple antennas or an antenna array for diversity reception and for implementing spatial multiplexing. Spatial multiplexing involves splitting a high data rate signal into two or more separate data streams that are intended to arrive at a receiver antenna array with different spatial signatures such that the two or more separate data streams can be reassembled to construct the high data rate signal. At least two separate mobile device antennas or two antenna elements of an antenna array each receive one of the separate data streams. Therefore spatial multiplexing may be considered a form of antenna diversity reception.

The goal of antenna diversity reception is to take advantage of decorrelation between the diversity antennas. The decorrelation may be achieved by physical placement polarization or by using differing antenna beam patterns. Mobile device diversity and MIMO multiple input multiple output antenna systems have been developed based on static figure of merit FoM requirements total efficiency gain imbalance and envelope correlation coefficient values i.e. antenna correlation that are fixed regardless of prevalent operating parameters or the environment in which the mobile device is operating.

Performance of the MIMO system may be negatively impacted by changes in the radiated channel conditions and the user s position and handgrip on the mobile device because the hand position may impair radio frequency RF reception by the MIMO antennas. For this and other reasons challenges exist for achieving good performance of diversity antenna systems in a mobile device.

Briefly the disclosed embodiments provide apparatuses and methods that obtain real time performance measurements and adaptively select MIMO antennas in response to the real time performance measurements to improve MIMO antenna performance under given conditions. More particularly the disclosed embodiments prioritize envelope correlation over antenna efficiency and gain imbalance or vice versa based on the real time performance measurements. The prioritization is achieved based on a discovery of a relationship between environment signal to noise ratio SNR antenna correlation and gain imbalance. Specifically characteristics in which a MIMO antenna figure of merit FoM requirement varies depending on the environment SNR in which the MIMO device is operating is advantageously used in the various disclosed embodiments.

One disclosed method of operation includes determining a dominant figure of merit for an antenna system comprising a primary antenna and at least two diversity antennas. The dominant figure of merit is determined from at least two figure of merit requirements or figure of merit types related to performance of the primary antenna when paired with one or the other of the at least two diversity antennas. The method of operation includes switching to one or the other of the at least two diversity antennas to obtain the dominant figure of merit in response to a signal quality metric relationship to the at least two figure of merit types. The method may further include obtaining the signal quality metric using a first signal quality metric measurement for the primary antenna and a first diversity antenna having a first orientation with respect to the primary antenna and a second signal quality metric measurement for the primary antenna and a second diversity antenna having a second orientation with respect to the primary antenna. The dominant figure of merit is then determined based on the signal quality metric s relation to an inflection point in an empirically determined relationship between figure of merit types and data throughput. In the present embodiments empirical data for known antennas has been found to show a deterministic correlation of signal to noise ratio and data throughput to the figure of merit types. This deterministic correlation was discovered by way of collecting empirical data. More specifically signal to noise ratios above the inflection point indicate selection of an antenna pair having a first figure of merit type as the dominant figure of merit and signal to noise ratios below the inflection point indicate selection of an antenna pair having a second figure of merit type as the dominant figure of merit.

In one embodiment the method of operation switches to one of the diversity antennas that has a lower antenna correlation with the primary antenna when antenna correlation is the dominant figure of merit and switches to another of the diversity antennas that has a lower gain imbalance with the primary antenna when gain imbalance is the dominant figure of merit.

Another disclosed method of operation includes calculating an effective signal quality metric using a first signal quality metric measurement for a primary antenna and a first diversity antenna that has a first orientation with respect to the primary antenna and a second signal quality metric measurement for the primary antenna and a second diversity antenna that has a second orientation with respect to the primary antenna. The method of operation then includes switching between the first diversity antenna and the second diversity antenna in response to the effective signal quality metric s relation to a threshold. More specifically the threshold indicates dominance of a first figure of merit type for values above the threshold and dominance of a second figure of merit type for values below the threshold. In one embodiment an effective signal to noise ratio is calculated as the effective signal quality metric. The effective signal to noise ratio is calculated using a first signal to noise ratio for the primary antenna and the first diversity antenna and a second signal to noise ratio for the primary antenna and the second diversity antenna.

The method may therefore further include switching between the first diversity antenna and the second diversity antenna based on an inflection point in a relationship of signal to noise ratio and data throughput to the first figure of merit type and to the second figure of merit type where the inflection point is used as the threshold. The relationship showing the inflection point is a deterministic correlation of signal to noise ratio and data throughput to the first figure of merit type and to the second figure of merit type where the inflection point is used as the threshold. The deterministic correlation was arrived at in the present embodiments by the collection of empirical data. More specifically signal to noise ratios above the inflection point indicate selection of an antenna pair having lower antenna correlation with the primary antenna and signal to noise ratios below the inflection point indicate selection of an antenna pair having lower gain imbalance with the primary antenna. In other words antenna correlation is the first figure of merit type and gain imbalance is the second figure of merit type.

In some embodiments the method of operation may include predicting the effective signal quality metric based on a user history and preselecting a diversity antenna in response to the prediction.

A disclosed apparatus that performs the disclosed methods of operations includes at least one transceiver a primary antenna a first diversity antenna that has a first placement with respect to the primary antenna a second diversity antenna that has a second placement with respect to the primary antenna and antenna selection logic. The antenna selection logic is operatively coupled to the primary antenna the first diversity antenna the second diversity antenna and the at least one transceiver. The antenna selection logic is operative to determine a dominant figure of merit from at least two figure of merit types related to performance of the primary antenna when paired with one or the other of the first diversity antenna or the second diversity antenna and switch to one or the other of the two diversity antennas to obtain the dominant figure of merit in response to a signal quality metric s relationship to the at least two figure of merit types.

The antenna selection logic is also operative to obtain the signal quality metric using a first signal quality metric measurement for the primary antenna and the first diversity antenna and a second signal quality metric measurement for the primary antenna and the second diversity antenna. The antenna selection logic determines the dominant figure of merit based on the signal quality metric s relation to an inflection point in a relationship of signal to noise ratio and data throughput to the figure of merit types. More specifically signal to noise ratios above the inflection point indicate selection of an antenna pair having a first figure of merit type as the dominant figure of merit and signal to noise ratios below the inflection point indicate selection of an antenna pair having a second figure of merit type as the dominant figure of merit.

Another disclosed apparatus includes at least one transceiver a primary antenna a first diversity antenna having a first orientation with respect to the primary antenna and a second diversity antenna having a second orientation with respect to the primary antenna. The apparatus also includes antenna selection logic that is operatively coupled to the primary antenna the first diversity antenna the second diversity antenna and to the at least one transceiver. The antenna selection logic is operative to calculate an effective signal quality metric using a first signal quality metric measurement for the primary antenna and the first diversity antenna and a second signal quality metric measurement for the primary antenna and the second diversity antenna. The antenna selection logic switches between the first diversity antenna and the second diversity antenna in response to the effective signal quality metric s relation to a threshold. The threshold indicates dominance of a first figure of merit type for values above the threshold and dominance of a second figure of merit type for values below the threshold.

In one embodiment the antenna selection logic calculates an effective signal to noise ratio as the effective signal quality metric. The effective signal to noise ratio is calculated using a first signal to noise ratio for the primary antenna and the first diversity antenna and a second signal to noise ratio for the primary antenna and the second diversity antenna. The antenna selection logic may then switch between the first diversity antenna and the second diversity antenna based on an inflection point in a relationship of signal to noise ratio and data throughput to the first figure of merit type and to the second figure of merit type where the inflection point is used as the threshold. More particularly signal to noise ratios above the inflection point indicate selection of an antenna pair that has lower antenna correlation with the primary antenna and signal to noise ratios below the inflection point indicate selection of an antenna pair that has lower gain imbalance with the primary antenna. In other words antenna correlation is the first figure of merit type and gain imbalance is the second figure of merit type. The relationship may be obtained by collected empirical data for the antenna pairs or antenna arrays used in the mobile device.

In some embodiments the apparatus also includes memory operative to store a user profile including a user history and condition prediction logic. The condition prediction logic is operatively coupled to the memory and to the antenna selection logic and is operative to predict the effective signal quality metric based on the user history stored in the memory. The condition prediction logic sends a control signal to the antenna selection logic to preselect a diversity antenna in response to the prediction.

Another disclosed apparatus includes at least one transceiver and a plurality of antenna systems with each antenna system including at least two antennas such as an antenna array. The apparatus also includes antenna selection logic that is operatively coupled to the plurality of antenna systems and to the at least one transceiver. The antenna selection logic is operative to determine a dominant figure of merit from at least two figure of merit types related to performance of the each of the antenna systems. The antenna selection logic may then switch to an appropriate antenna system in order to obtain the dominant figure of merit in response to a signal quality metric s relationship i.e. a deterministic correlation to the at least two figure of merit types.

The antenna selection logic is also operative to obtain the signal quality metric using a plurality of signal quality metric measurements for the each antenna system. The antenna selection logic then determines the dominant figure of merit based on the signal quality metric s relation to an inflection point in a relationship which exhibits a deterministic correlation of signal to noise ratio and data throughput to the figure of merit types. Signal to noise ratios above the inflection point indicate selection of an antenna system that has a first figure of merit type as the dominant figure of merit and signal to noise ratios below the inflection point indicate selection of an antenna system that has a second figure of merit type as the dominant figure of merit.

Turning now to the drawings wherein like numerals represent like components is a block diagram of a mobile device having antenna selection logic in accordance with the embodiments. The mobile device includes a primary antenna a first MIMO diversity antenna and a second MIMO diversity antenna . The primary antenna is operatively coupled to one or more transceivers via RF coupling . The first MIMO diversity antenna is operatively coupled to an antenna switch via RF coupling and the second MIMO diversity antenna is operatively coupled to the antenna switch via RF coupling . The first MIMO diversity antenna and the second MIMO diversity antenna are operatively coupled to the transceivers through the antenna switch and RF coupling between the antenna switch and the transceivers .

The first MIMO diversity antenna and the second MIMO diversity antenna are configured and positioned such that one of the two antennas provides low gain imbalance but with any antenna correlation to the primary antenna while the other antenna of the two antennas provides low antenna correlation to the primary antenna but with any gain imbalance. In other words one of the two antennas may be positioned for optimized antenna correlation without considering the gain imbalance while the other of the two antennas may be positioned for optimized gain imbalance without considering the antenna correlation. For example the first MIMO diversity antenna may provide high correlation to the primary antenna and low gain imbalance. The second MIMO diversity antenna may provide low correlation for example by being orthogonally polarized with respect to the primary antenna and may provide high gain imbalance. The terms antenna correlation also correlation and gain imbalance are also each referred to herein individually as a figure of merit or as a figure of merit type. In other words antenna correlation is one example of a figure of merit or figure of merit type and gain imbalance is another example of a figure of merit or figure of merit type.

As understood by those of ordinary skill it is preferable to have low correlation and low gain imbalance however a tradeoff must be made in any design because of limitations related to MIMO antenna system placement user head and hand effect mismatch and insertion losses source pull complex mismatch among other design restrictions imposed on a mobile device. It is to be understood that is an example only and that the actual positions of the primary antenna first MIMO diversity antenna and second MIMO diversity antenna may be different in accordance with the embodiments from the example shown in . Specifically the actual positions and or configurations of the MIMO diversity antennas may differ with respect to the primary antenna and to each other however the MIMO diversity antennas will be positioned and configured as noted above regarding the tradeoff between correlation and gain imbalance.

The terms high and low as used herein are relative terms that are to be construed such that one of the MIMO diversity antennas exhibits a better or worse performance with respect to the other of the two MIMO diversity antennas by comparison of measured performance values between the two antennas but irrespective of the actual numerical range of any such measured performance value. More particularly a MIMO diversity antenna exhibiting a low correlation to the primary antenna is herein considered as exhibiting a better correlation than a MIMO diversity antenna exhibiting a high correlation i.e. worse to the primary antenna . A MIMO diversity antenna exhibiting a low gain imbalance with respect to the primary antenna is herein considered as exhibiting a better gain imbalance than a MIMO diversity antenna exhibiting a high gain imbalance i.e. worse with respect to the primary antenna . Therefore by comparison of correlation and gain imbalance measurements for the first MIMO diversity antenna and the second MIMO diversity antenna one of the two antennas may be found to have a high or higher correlation and a low or lower gain imbalance and the other may be found to have a low or lower correlation and a high or higher gain imbalance with respect to each other by the comparison.

Each antenna is also operatively coupled to an antenna selector in accordance with the embodiments. For example the primary antenna is operatively coupled to the antenna selector via RF coupling . The first MIMO diversity antenna is operatively coupled to the antenna selector via RF coupling and the second MIMO diversity antenna is operatively coupled to the antenna selector via RF coupling . The antenna selection logic therefore includes the antenna switch the antenna selector and the various RF coupling.

It is to be understood that the various RF coupling described may include but is not limited to transmission lines and matching networks as understood by those of ordinary skill. For example the transmission lines may be implemented using microstrip stripline or any suitable RF circuit technology as understood by those of ordinary skill and may include transmission line elements such as capacitances or inductances discrete components or combinations thereof as needed to implement matching networks between the various components.

The antenna selector monitors one or more performance metrics between the primary antenna the first MIMO diversity antenna and the second MIMO diversity antenna . The antenna selector is operative to control the antenna switch to switch between the first MIMO diversity antenna and the second MIMO diversity antenna based on the monitored one or more performance metrics. In the various embodiments the adaptive antenna system shown in including the antenna switch may be implemented using for example antenna placement switching parasitic resonators variable phase shifters transmission line switching etc. or any other suitable components as understood by those of ordinary skill.

In decision block if the effective SNR or effective SINR is above a threshold the method of operation proceeds to operation block . In operation block the antenna selector provides the control signal to control the antenna switch and switch to the MIMO antenna determined to provide low correlation and high gain imbalance. More particularly the second MIMO diversity antenna is selected by the antenna selector because this antenna has been designed and configured to provide low correlation and high gain imbalance. The method of operation then ends.

If the effective SNR is below the threshold in decision block the method of operation proceeds to operation block . In operation block the antenna selector provides the control signal to control the antenna switch and switch to the MIMO antenna determined to provide high correlation and low gain imbalance. More particularly the first MIMO diversity antenna is selected by the antenna selector because this antenna has been designed and configured to provide high correlation and low gain imbalance. The method of operation then ends.

Among other advantages the above described method of operation is based on the discovery that the prioritization of the antenna FoM changes depending on mobile device operating environment SNR. While the antenna envelope correlation has high priority in high SNR conditions total efficiency and gain imbalance has very limited impact on MIMO antenna performance. On the other hand in low SNR conditions the envelope correlation also referred to herein as antenna correlation has very limited or null impact in MIMO antenna performance while total efficiency and gain imbalance has higher priority. Put another way different FoM types are dominant depending on operating environment SNR. The dominant FoM type as used herein refers to the FoM type having the largest impact on throughput for the given operating environment SNR.

Therefore the adaptive antenna system of the disclosed embodiments changes the MIMO antenna configuration as triggered by real time environmental SNR conditions. For high SNR conditions the antenna system is adapted to optimize and prioritize low envelope correlation while total efficiency and gain imbalance are de prioritized. For low SNR conditions the antenna system is configured to optimize and prioritize high total efficiency and low gain imbalance while de prioritizing a low envelope correlation coefficient. In some embodiments low SNR may be considered to be SNR that is less than about 6 dB. A high SNR condition may therefore be considered to be 6 dB and above.

Further in some embodiments a mobile device may predict the environmental SNR and trigger MIMO antenna adaptation in response to such predictions. Turning to another example mobile device is illustrated and which is one example apparatus in accordance with the embodiments. The mobile device includes antennas having a primary antenna and at least two MIMO diversity antennas. The primary antenna of the antennas is operatively coupled to the transceivers by RF coupling . The MIMO diversity antennas of antennas are operatively coupled to antenna selection logic by RF coupling and to the transceivers by RF coupling which provides the switched output of antenna selection logic . In some embodiments the antennas may include one or more antenna systems. An antenna system may have multiple antenna elements such as an antenna array. Each antenna array or antenna system may be evaluated by a FoM for the antenna system or antenna array.

The mobile device also includes a set or an array of touch sensors that are positioned about the mobile device housing and that are operative to sense the user s fingers and hand when the user grips the mobile device housing. The touch sensors may be but are not limited to infrared IR touch sensors capacitive touch sensors or combinations thereof. The touch sensors are operatively connected to condition prediction logic by coupling and provide sensor outputs to the condition prediction logic as inputs . The condition prediction logic may also be operatively coupled to location detection logic by coupling such that the condition prediction logic is operative to receive location data. The condition prediction logic is operatively coupled to memory by read write connection such that the condition prediction logic may read from and write to a user profile stored in the memory .

The condition prediction logic is operatively coupled to the antenna selection logic by coupling to send prediction data to the antenna selection logic . For example the condition prediction logic receives sensor data from the touch sensors and may determine the position of the user s fingers and hand on the mobile device housing. Because the user s hand position may cause impairment to RF reception by the MIMO diversity antennas the condition prediction logic may predict that a low or high SNR condition will result and may send a flag low SNR predict flag or high SNR predict flag to the antenna selection logic . The antenna selection logic may then use the prediction to switch to the appropriate MIMO diversity antenna as an initial setting i.e. prior to determination of the actual SNR condition .

In some embodiments the condition prediction logic may obtain additional data in addition to data received from the touch sensors and may create a user profile that includes the obtained data for use in predictions. For example the condition prediction logic may collect user history for data call and voice calls including time stamps and location data stamps and store this history information in the user profile . The condition prediction logic may also obtain SNR measurement data from the antenna selection logic for these data calls and voice calls. Based on past activities the condition prediction logic may therefore then predict the SNR based on past SNR measurements associated with these past activities by reading the user profile . For example if the user profile data shows that the user routinely makes a data call at 3 00 pm on a certain day and time and at a certain location and the measured SNR indicated selection of a certain MIMO diversity antenna the condition prediction logic will make this prediction determination and will send the appropriate SNR predict flag to the antenna selection logic . In this way the MIMO diversity antenna appropriate for the predicted condition can be selected in advance which enhances the mobile device performance and the user s experience with the device.

The flowchart of provides an example method of operation for the mobile device . The method of operation begins and in operation block a data channel is established by the transceivers . In operation block the condition prediction logic may check the user profile for similar activity by the mobile device . The user profile data may include times and dates when voice and data calls were made the hand grip used based on touch sensor data the location and the SINR measurements obtained for those calls etc. Based on the user profile data the condition prediction logic may send an appropriate SNR or SINR predict flag to the antenna selection logic which may then preselect a MIMO diversity antenna.

In operation block the antenna selection logic measures the real time signal to noise and interference SINR value for each MIMO diversity antenna with respect to the primary antenna. In decision block the antenna selection logic determines an effective SINR and checks it against a threshold. If the effective SINR is below the threshold the method of operation proceeds to operation block and the antenna selection logic selects a MIMO diversity antenna to prioritize total efficiency and gain imbalance i.e. to obtain low gain imbalance . If however the effective SINR is above the threshold the method of operation proceeds to operation block and the antenna selection logic selects a MIMO diversity antenna to prioritize antenna correlation i.e. to obtain low correlation . In either case the method of operation loops back to operation block and continues until the data channel is terminated in operation block at which point the method of operation ends.

In another example mobile device includes at least one internal communication bus which provides operative coupling between the various components. Each of the various components of the mobile device that are operatively coupled to the communication bus may accordingly send information to or receive information from a processor . In addition to the processor the mobile device components include but are not limited to transceivers antenna selection logic antennas location detection logic such as but not limited to a GPS receiver display and user interface audio equipment memory and a sensor hub .

The sensor hub is operatively coupled to a plurality of sensors which may include thermal sensors proximity sensors accelerometers gyroscopic sensors light sensors etc. The sensor hub is also operatively coupled to a set of touch sensors which are position about the housing of the mobile device and which are operative to sense the user s hand and fingers when placed upon the housing and to send data to the sensor hub . The touch sensors may be optical sensors capacitive sensors or combinations of both. The sensor hub is a low power processor that offloads the processor from some tasks such as obtaining data from the sensors and from touch sensors . The sensor hub may provide functions while the processor is placed in a sleep mode in order to conserve mobile device battery power. The sensor hub is operative to receive data from the various sensors and to convey the data to the processor over the internal communication bus .

Similar to the mobile device in the mobile device includes antennas having a primary antenna and at least two MIMO diversity antennas. The primary antenna of the antennas is operatively coupled to the transceivers by RF coupling . The MIMO diversity antennas of antennas are operatively coupled to antenna selection logic by RF coupling and to the transceivers by RF coupling which provides the switched output of antenna selection logic . In some embodiments the antennas may include one or more antenna systems. An antenna system may have multiple antenna elements such as an antenna array. Each antenna array or antenna system may be evaluated by a FoM for the antenna system or antenna array.

The processor is operative to execute executable instructions also referred to as executable code or code stored in memory including operating system executable code to run at least one operating system wireless protocol stack code to run one or more wireless protocol stacks and application or user space executable code to run one or more applications . In accordance with the embodiments the processor is also operative to execute condition prediction code to implement condition prediction logic .

The condition prediction logic may interact and communicate with the operating system by one or more APIs of a suite of APIs application programming interfaces or by other appropriate operative coupling. The condition prediction logic is operative to communicate with the sensor hub to obtain data from the touch sensors the sensors or combinations thereof. This data may include information about the position of the mobile device such as whether the mobile device is stationary in a docking station placed flatly on a table surface etc. and other information related to the ambient environment surrounding the mobile device . The location detection logic may also be accessed by the condition prediction logic to obtain location information for the mobile device . The condition prediction logic may collect and aggregate this data into a user profile stored in memory .

The data contained in the user profile is time and date stamped and geotagged using location data from the location detection logic . The operation of the condition prediction logic is similar to the condition prediction logic operation described with respect to . That is the condition prediction logic may obtain data from the touch sensors and from position sensors and other sensors or sensors and may create the user profile that includes the obtained data for use in predictions.

In the example mobile device the condition prediction logic may obtain SNR or SINR measurement data from the antenna selection logic over the internal communication bus . The method of operation described with respect to may therefore also be performed by the example mobile device .

It is to be understood that any of the above described software components i.e. executable instructions or executable code in the example mobile device or any of the above described components of example mobile device or mobile device may be implemented as software or firmware or a combination of software and firmware executing on one or more processors or using ASICs application specific integrated circuits DSPs digital signal processors hardwired circuitry logic circuitry state machines FPGAs field programmable gate arrays or combinations thereof. Therefore the mobile devices illustrated in the drawing figures described herein provide examples of a mobile device and are not to be construed as a limitation on the various other possible mobile device implementations that may be used in accordance with the various embodiments.

More particularly condition prediction logic may be a single component or may be implemented as any combination of DSPs ASICs FPGAs CPUs running executable instructions hardwired circuitry state machines etc. without limitation. Therefore as one example the condition prediction logic may be implemented using an ASIC or an FPGA. In another example the antenna selection logic may be a combination of RF hardware for implementation of switching between MIMO diversity antennas and software or firmware executed by a processor that makes the decision regarding when to switch to a given antenna etc. These example embodiments and other embodiments are contemplated by the present disclosure.

It is to be understood that although the present disclosure discusses SNR as a signal quality metric used to determine a dominant FoM for an antenna pair or for an antenna system SINR signal to interference plus noise ratio or signal to noise plus interference ratio may be also be used interchangeably with SNR. In other words a relationship may be shown between SINR and FoM values and throughput and therefore an inflection point in such relationship plots may be used as the threshold as disclosed and described in detail herein to make antenna pair or antenna system selection decisions to improve throughput under the given environmental conditions i.e. SINR conditions . The relationship involves a deterministic correlation between SINR and FoM values and throughput which was discovered by analysis of empirically collected data for antennas of known correlation.

While various embodiments have been illustrated and described it is to be understood that the invention is not so limited. Numerous modifications changes variations substitutions and equivalents will occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.
