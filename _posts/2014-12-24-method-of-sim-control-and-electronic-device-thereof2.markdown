Herein the reference quality may include at least one of a connection response time a transfer rate a signal strength and a noise with respect to a BS. It is assumed herein that the reference quality is input by a user or is pre stored in a system or is transmitted from a server. For example the electronic device may confirm whether the connection response time with respect to the BS is a time further delayed than the reference connection response time. For another example the electronic device may confirm whether the transfer rate is slower than a reference transfer rate. For another example the electronic device may confirm whether the signal strength is lower in level than a reference signal strength. For another example the electronic device may confirm whether the noise is higher in level than a reference noise.

If the network connection state is not lower in quality than the reference quality in step the electronic device may use the network with the SIM card which is currently in the activation state.

Otherwise if the network connection state is lower in quality than the reference quality in step the electronic device displays a menu for confirming whether the SIM card is changed. For example as illustrated in since the network connection state of the SIM card i.e. 1SIM which is currently in the activation state is not constant the electronic device may display a menu for confirming whether to change to the different SIM card i.e. 2SIM . In this case as illustrated in the electronic device may display information of the SIM card i.e. 1SIM which is currently in the activation state in a notification area see .

In step the electronic device confirms whether the SIM card is changed. For example as illustrated in the electronic device may confirm whether to change the SIM card based on any one of a yes and a no selected from the menu for confirming the SIM card change. In addition if any one of the yes and the no is not selected during a reference time the electronic device may release the display of the menu for confirming the SIM card change.

If the SIM card is not changed in step the electronic device uses the network with the SIM card which is currently in the activation state. For example as illustrated in if the no is selected from the menu for confirming the SIM card change the electronic device may use the network with the SIM card i.e. 1SIM which is currently in the activation state.

Otherwise if the SIM card is changed in step the electronic device uses the network with the changed SIM card. For example as illustrated in if the yes is selected from the menu for confirming the SIM card change the electronic device may use the network by changing to the SIM card i.e. 2SIM . In this case as illustrated in the electronic device may display a notification window for notifying the change to the 2SIM. In addition as illustrated in the electronic device may display the change to the 2SIM in a notification area see .

In the aforementioned exemplary embodiment the electronic device may confirm whether to change the SIM card based on at least one condition among each SIM card s free usage amount usage fee occurrence or non occurrence of network error and network connection quality.

In another exemplary embodiment as illustrated in a notification area may include a menu for setting a SIM mode which includes an economic mode for confirming whether the SIM card is changed based on at least one of each card s free usage amount and usage fee and a performance mode for confirming whether the SIM card is changed based on at least one of a occurrence or non occurrence of network error and network connection quality. In this case the electronic device may display at least one of information of the SIM card currently in the activation state and mode information in the notification area see .

In the aforementioned exemplary embodiment the electronic device displays a menu for changing a SIM card and controls the SIM card change based on a menu selection. In this case the electronic device may perform the SIM card change without a menu display. In addition the electronic device may provide control to change to the selected SIM card by displaying a SIM card list.

In addition if a text message is transmitted to a plurality of recipients the text message may be transmitted by using each SIM card which stores a contact number of each recipient. In this case if the contact number is selected a menu for selecting a SIM card to be used to transmit the text message may be displayed.

As described above since a SIM card in use is changed to a different SIM card based on a SIM card usage condition among a plurality of SIM cards users can use the SIM cards according to a situation.

While the disclosure has been shown and described with reference to certain exemplary embodiments thereof it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. Therefore the scope of the disclosure is defined not by the detailed description of the disclosure but by the appended claims and their equivalents and all differences within the scope will be construed as being included in the present disclosure.
