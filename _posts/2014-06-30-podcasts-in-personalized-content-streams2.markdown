title: Podcasts in personalized content streams
abstract: Software on a content-aggregation website obtains a resource associated with a podcast from a website publishing the podcast and stores it e resource on the content-aggregation website. The software adds the resource as a leaf node to a taxonomy generated by the content-aggregation website. The addition is based on data associated with the podcast. The non-leaf nodes in the taxonomy are categories of content. The software determines that a user of the content-aggregation website is qualified as to at least one category that includes the resource as a leaf node. The determination is based at least in part on feedback from the user that includes a viewing or listening history for the user. Then the software serves the resource to the user in a content stream published by the content-aggregation website, based at least in part on a personalization score associated with the resource.

Podcasts usually consist of audio video PDF and or ePub files that are published or broadcast online in a series of episodes. They can be downloaded using software known as a podcatcher and played or streamed by a media player. Though many podcasts are paid for using a subscription many are also accessible for free. Often a user accesses a podcast through a web feed link on a wall webpage e.g. MyYahoo associated with a user.

Facebook Twitter Google and other social networking websites present items of content including text images and videos to their users using a content stream that is in reverse chronological order e.g. with the topmost item in the stream being the last in time or ordered according to an interestingness algorithm e.g. with the topmost item in the stream having the highest interestingness score according to the algorithm and or a personalization algorithm. Such content streams are now also used by content aggregation websites such as Yahoo News and Google News.

In an example embodiment a processor executed method is described. According to the method software running on servers at a content aggregation website obtains a resource associated with a podcast from a website publishing the podcast and stores the resource on the content aggregation website. The software adds the resource as a leaf node to a taxonomy generated by the content aggregation website. The addition is based at least in part on data associated with the podcast. The non leaf n des in the taxonomy are categories of content. The software determines that a user of the content aggregation website is qualified as to at least one category that includes the resource as a leaf node. The determination is based at least in part on feedback from the user that includes a viewing or listening history for the user. Then the software serves the resource to the user in a content stream published by the content aggregation website based at least in part on a personalization score associated with the resource.

In another example embodiment an apparatus is described namely computer readable media which persistently store a program that runs on a content aggregation website. The program obtains a resource associated with a podcast from a website publishing the podcast and stores the resource on the content aggregation website. The program adds the resource as a leaf node to a taxonomy generated by the content aggregation website. The addition is based at least in part on data associated with the podcast. The non leaf nodes in the taxonomy are categories of content. The program determines that a user of the content aggregation website is qualified as to at least one category that includes the resource as a leaf node. The determination is based at least in part on feedback from the user that includes a viewing or listening history for the user. Then the program serves the resource to the user in a content stream published by the content aggregation website based at least n part on a personalization score associated with the resource.

Another example embodiment also involves a processor executed method. According to the method software running on servers at a content aggregation website obtains a resource associated with a podcast from a website publishing the podcast and stores the resource on the conntnet aggregation website. The software adds the resource as a leaf node to a taxonomy generated by the content aggregation website. The addition is based at least in part on data associated with the podcast. The non leaf nodes in the taxonomy are categories of content. The taxonomy can be represented as a B tree and is generated by it e content aggregation website using supervised classifiers. The software determines that a user of the content aggregation website is qualified as to at least one category that includes the resource as a leaf node. The determination is based at least in part on feedback from the user that includes a viewing or listening history for the user. Then the software serves the resource to the user in a content stream published by the content aggregation website based at least in part on a personalization score associated with the resource.

In the following description numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the exemplary embodiments. However it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the example embodiments may be practiced without some of these specific details. In other instances process operations and implementation details have not been described in detail if already well known.

Subject matter will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof and which show by way of illustration specific example embodiments. Subject matter may however be embodied in a variety of different forms and therefore covered or claimed subject matter is intended to be construed as not being limited to any example embodiments set forth herein example embodiments are provided merely to be illustrative. Likewise a reasonably broad scope for claimed or covered subject matter is intended. Among other things for example subject matter may be embodied as methods devices components or systems. Accordingly embodiments may for example take the form of hardware software firmware or any combination thereof other than software per se . The following detailed description is therefore not intended to be taken in a limiting sense.

Throughout the specification and claims terms may have nuanced meanings suggested or implied in context beyond an explicitly stated meaning. Likewise the phrase in an example embodiment as used herein does not necessarily refer to the same embodiment and the phrase in another example embodiment as used herein does not necessarily refer to a different embodiment. It is intended for example that claimed subject matter include combinations of example embodiments in whole or in part.

In general terminology may be understood at least in part from usage in context. For example terms such as and or or and or as used herein may include a variety of meanings that may depend at least in part upon the context in which such terms are used. Typically or if used to associate a list such as A B or C is intended to mean A B and C here used in the inclusive sense as well as A B or C here used in the exclusive sense. In addition the term one or more as used herein depending at least in part upon context may be used to describe any feature structure or characteristic in a singular sense or may be used to describe combinations of features structures or characteristics in a plural sense. Similarly terms such as a an or the again may be understood to convey a singular usage or to convey a plural usage depending at least in part upon context. In addition the term based on may be understood as not necessarily intended to convey an exclusive set of factors and may instead allow for existence of additional factors not necessarily expressly described again depending at least in part on context.

In an example embodiment website might be an online social network such as Facebook or Twitter. As used here and elsewhere in this disclosure the term online social network is to be broadly interpreted to include for example any online service including a social media service that allows its users to among other things a selectively access e.g. according to a friend list contact list buddy list social graph interest graph or other control list content e.g. text including web links images videos animations audio recordings games and other software etc. associated with each other s profiles e.g. Facebook walls Flickr photo albums Pinterest boards etc. b selectively e.g. according to a friend list contact list buddy list social graph interest graph distribution list or other control list broadcast content e.g. text including web links images videos animations audio recordings games and other software etc. to each other s newsfeeds e.g. content activity streams such as Facebook s News Feed Twitter s Timeline Google s Stream etc. and or c selectively communicate e.g. according to a friend list contact list buddy list social graph interest graph distribution list or other control list with each other e.g. using a messaging protocol such as email instant messaging short message service SMS etc. .

And as used in this disclosure the term content aggregation is to be broadly interpreted to include any online service including a social media service that allows its users to among other things access and or annotate e.g. comment on content e.g. text including web links images videos animations audio recordings games and other software etc. aggregated ingested by the online service e.g. using its own curators and or its own algorithms and or its users and presented in a wall view or stream view. It will be appreciated that a website hosting online content aggregation might have social features based on a friend list contact list buddy list social graph interest graph distribution list or other control list that is accessed over the network from a social networking website through an application programming interface API exposed by the social networking website. For example Yahoo News might identify the content items in its newsfeed e.g. as displayed on the front page of Yahoo News that have been viewed read by a user s friends as listed on a Facebook friend list that the user has authorized Yahoo News to access.

In an example embodiment websites and might be composed of a number of servers e.g. racked servers connected by a network e.g. a local area network LAN or a WAN to each other in a cluster e.g. a load balancing cluster a Beowulf cluster a Hadoop cluster etc. or other distributed system which might run website software e.g. web server software database software search engine software etc. and distributed computing and or cloud software such as Map Reduce Google File System Hadoop Hadoop File System Pig Hive Dremel CloudBase etc. The servers in website might be connected to persistent storage the servers in website might be connected to persistent storage and the servers at website might be connect to persistent storage . Persistent storages and might include flash memory a redundant array of independent disks RAID and or a storage area network SAN in an example embodiment. In an alternative example embodiment the servers for websites and and or the persistent storage in persistent storages and might be hosted wholly or partially in a public and or private cloud e.g. where the cloud resources serve as a platform as a service PaaS or an infrastructure as a service IaaS .

Persistent storages and might be used to content e.g. text including web links images videos animations audio recordings games and other software etc. and or its related data. Additionally persistent storage might be used to store data related to users and their social contacts e.g. Facebook friends as well as software including algorithms and other processes for presenting the content to the users in a personalized stream which might be ordered from top to bottom a in reverse chronology e.g. latest in time on top or b according to personalization scores as described in further detail below. In an example embodiment some of the content and or its related data stored in persistent storages and might have been received from a content delivery or distribution network CDN e.g. Akami Technologies. Or alternatively some of the content and or its related data might be delivered directly from the CDN to the personal computer or the mobile device without being stored in persistent storages and .

Personal computer and the servers at websites and might include 1 hardware consisting of one or more microprocessors e.g. from the x86 family the ARM family or the PowerPC family volatile storage e.g. RAM and persistent storage e.g. flash memory a hard disk or a solid state drive and 2 an operating system e.g. Windows Mac OS Linux Windows Server Mac OS Server etc. that runs on the hardware. Similarly in an example embodiment mobile device might include 1 hardware consisting of one or more microprocessors e.g. from the ARM family or the x86 family volatile storage e.g. RAM and persistent storage e.g. flash memory such as microSD 2 an operating system e.g. iOS webOS Windows Mobile Android Linux Symbian OS RIM BlackBerry OS etc. that runs on the hardware and 3 one or more accelerometers one or more gyroscopes global positioning system GPS or other location identifying type capability.

Also in an example embodiment personal computer and mobile device might each include a browser as an application program or as part of an operating system. Examples of browsers that might execute on personal computer include Internet Explorer Mozilla Firefox Safari and Google Chrome. Examples of browsers that might execute on mobile device include Safari Mozilla Firefox Android Browser and webOS Browser. It will be appreciated that users of personal computer and or mobile device might use browsers to access content presented by websites and . Alternatively users of personal computer and or mobile device might use application programs or apps including hybrid apps that display HTML content to access content presented by websites and .

As depicted in this figure software on a content aggregation website ingests content e.g. using push and or pull technology as described above and adds the content to a content taxonomy based on data associated with the content in operation . The content might include audio or video podcasts. In an example embodiment the content taxonomy might have been generated at the content aggregation website using automated or semi automated operations. For example the content taxonomy might have been generated using supervised classifiers or unsupervised classifiers. Also in an example embodiment the content taxonomy might be maintained as a B tree data structure whose non leaf nodes are categories of content and whose leaf nodes are items of content e.g. text including web links images videos animations audio recordings games and other software etc. identified by identifiers in the content taxonomy and stored on the content aggregation website or by a third party content provider including a CDN as described above. In alternative example embodiments other hierarchical parent child data structures might be used for the content taxonomy.

When adding a podcast to the content taxonomy in operation the data associated with the podcast might include a data associated with the source of the podcast e.g. the entity publishing the podcast b data and metadata associated with the webpages for the podcast and or c analysis of the podcast itself. For example if the podcast is an audio podcast published by Car Talk a might include the URL www.cartalk.com b might include the HTML text for the podcast s webpages and HTML meta tags such as car repair or auto mechanic and c might include audio analysis of the podcast s audio file identifying terms such as carburetor and transmission . In an example embodiment the data associated with the podcast might then be matched to one or more content categories e.g. non leaf nodes in the taxonomy by calculating and applying a similarity measure. If the data associated with the podcast is a set of words or terms e.g. keywords and the content categories are a set of words terms or are associated with a set of words terms e.g. keywords the similarity measure might be Jaccard similarity in an example embodiment. If the data associated with the podcast is a vector of words terms e.g. keywords and the content categories are a vector of words terms or are associated with a vector of words terms e.g. keywords the similarity measure might be cosine similarity in an example embodiment. The podcast might then be added as a leaf node to the content category if the calculated value of the similarity measure is greater than a specified value or threshold .

In operation the software qualifies a user of the website as to specific content categories e.g. non leaf nodes in the content taxonomy based on explicit and or implicit relevance feedback from the user. Explicit relevance feedback might take the form of user input to a GUI dialog inquiring about the user s interests. Implicit relevance feedback might include the viewing listening history of the user e.g. click throughs and or other measures of time spent e.g. time spent viewing time spent listening time spent playing etc. by the user on categorized content. For example if a user clicks the web links for a sufficiently large e.g. greater than a specified value say 7 number of stories e.g. text and images and videos about politicians in the politics content category the user might be determined to be qualified as to that content category. One might think of the content categories as to which a user qualifies as a personalized content taxonomy for the user as indicated in . It will be appreciated that qualification for a content category might ordinarily precede personalization as described below since it would be inefficient to generate a personalization score for content items e.g. leaf nodes in content categories as to which the user does not qualify.

In operation the software calculates a personalization score for the specific content items e.g. leaf nodes in a user s personalized content taxonomy. In an example embodiment the personalization score might be based on a simple heuristic such as counting the number of content items served to a user in a particular content category. So for example if a user is served over 5 articles on Barack Obama a podcast on Barack Obama might receive a relatively high personalization score. Or the personalization score for a content item might be based on a user s click throughs and or other measures of time spent e.g. time spent viewing time spent listening time spent playing etc. on categorized content as noted in the preceding paragraph.

In another example embodiment the personalization score for a podcast might be the result of a parametric function with weighted e.g. as a result of performing a regression parameters that predicts the probability a user will listen or view a podcast. In this embodiment the parametric function might include a parameters that e.g. when weighted increase the personalization score or probability of listening or viewing a podcast and b parameters that e.g. when weighted decrease the personalization score or probability of listening or viewing a podcast . For example parameters that increase the personalization score or probability of listening or viewing a podcast might include a the number of click throughs or a measure of the time spent viewing listening playing etc. other content items e.g. stories with text and images or videos in the same content category and b a count of the number of times the user has qualified for a specific content category. Parameters that decrease the personalization score or probability of listening or viewing a podcast might include fatigue factors such as a the number of times the podcast has been served to the user and b the number of times the user has been served other content items e.g. stories with text and images or videos from the same source e.g. website in the same content category.

In another example embodiment the personalization score might be the result of objective based personalization. Objectives that might be used when determining a personalization score are revenue engagement diversification etc. Revenue sources for content aggregation websites such as Yahoo News Google News Facebook Twitter etc. include revenue from 1 revenue sharing e.g. from traffic acquisition costs or TAC paid by content publishers including podcasters 2 click based ads 3 view based or display ads 3 search based ads 4 subscriptions 5 deals and 6 premium services. So if the content aggregation website wants to increase revenue from revenue sharing and or subscriptions the content aggregation website might assign a relatively high personalization score to a podcast that is a paid podcast. Similarly if the objective is engagement rather than revenue the content aggregation website might also assign a relatively high score to a paid podcast since it can be served e.g. using an audio or video file and a media player from the content aggregation website. By contrast a free podcast might tend to decrease engagement since clicking on a hypertext link for the podcast takes the user away from the content aggregation website. If the objective is content diversification either a free podcast or a paid podcast might be used if it has a relatively high probability of being listened to or viewed in comparison to other podcasts in the same content category.

In another example embodiment revenue per user might be correlated with the number of podcasts shown to the user to determine a relatively optimal number of podcasts to serve to the user using machine learning technology.

Furthermore personalization scoring might include more than one of the above described approaches. For example parametric personalization might be combined with objective based personalization to create a hybrid approach for personalization scoring.

In operation in the software uses the personalization scores for the content items e.g. leaf nodes in the user s content taxonomy to determine which content items to serve to the user in a personalized content stream in a webpage e.g. rendered by a browser or in a view e.g. rendered by an app on a mobile device . In an example embodiment the personalized content stream might include a podcast. And as shown in an ad related to the podcast might be served to the user in the same webpage or view.

In operation the software creates a content stream to serve a guest or user. If the content stream is for a guest the software might apply an interestingness algorithm e.g. similar to Facebook s EdgeRank algorithm or the interestingness algorithm described in co owned U.S. Pat. No. 8 732 175 by Butterfield et al. entitled Interestingness ranking of media objects to create a ranking of the content items e.g. leaf nodes in the guest content taxonomy and then use this ranking to serve the content items e.g. with the highest ranked content item at the top of the content stream in a content stream in webpage in an example embodiment.

If the content stream is for a user the software might apply personalization scoring as described above with respect to to create a ranking of the content items e.g. leaf nodes in the user content taxonomy and then use this ranking to serve the content items e.g. with the highest ranked content item at the top of the content stream in a personalized content stream in webpage in an example embodiment. Or if the content stream is for a user the software might apply both personalization scoring and an interestingness algorithm to create a ranking of the content items e.g. leaf nodes in the user content taxonomy and then use this ranking to serve the content items e.g. with the highest ranked content item at the top of the content stream in a personalized content stream in webpage in an example embodiment.

As depicted in the software obtains e.g. through subscription or web scraping a uniform resource locator URL for a web feed for a free audio or video podcast from the website publishing the podcast in operation and stores the URL on the content aggregation website in operation . In operation the software adds the URL as a leaf node to a content taxonomy e.g. B tree generated e.g. using supervised classifiers by the content aggregation website. The non leaf nodes in the content taxonomy are content categories as described above. In an example embodiment the addition might be based on data associated with podcast e.g. data as to the source of the podcast data and metadata from the webpages at the website publishing the podcast analysis of the podcast s audio or video file etc. as also described above.

In operation the software determines that a user of the content aggregation website is qualified as to a content category that includes the URL as a leaf node. In an example embodiment the determination might be based on implicit relevance feedback from a user that includes a viewing listening history for the user. Then in operation the software serves the URL to the user in a content stream published by the content aggregation website based on personalization score for the URL as described above.

Though the operations in describe a URL for a web feed for a free audio or video podcast they might be applied to a URL for a web feed for a paid audio or video podcast in another example embodiment. Here it will be appreciated that use of a URL for a web feed for a free audio or video podcast might not implicate copyright laws and or other intellectual property laws and or regulations whereas the same might not be true of a URL for a web feed for a paid audio or video podcast.

As depicted in the software downloads an audio or video file for a paid podcast from the website publishing the podcast in operation and stores the audio or video file on the content aggregation website in operation . In operation the software adds the audio or video file as a leaf node to a content taxonomy e.g. B tree generated e.g. using supervised classifiers by the content aggregation website. The non leaf nodes in the content taxonomy are content categories as described above. In an example embodiment the addition might be based on data associated with the podcast e.g. data as to the source of the podcast data and metadata from the webpages at the website publishing podcast analysis of the audio or video file etc. as also described above.

In operation the software determines that a user of the content aggregation website is qualified as to a content category that includes the audio or video file as a leaf node. In an example embodiment the determination might be based on implicit relevance feedback from a user that includes a viewing listening history for the user. Then in operation the software serves the audio or video file to the user using a media player e.g. that employs JavaScript or ActionScript in a content stream published by content aggregation website based on a personalization score for the audio or video file as described above.

Though the operations in describe an audio or video file for a paid podcast they might be applied to an audio or video file for a free podcast in another example embodiment.
