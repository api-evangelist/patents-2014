title: Restrictions on transmissions of control plane data with carrier aggregation
abstract: The disclosure describes apparatus and methods for communicating control plane data with a mobile device in a Long Term Evolution (LTE) network employing carrier aggregation. A network apparatus, such as an enhanced NodeB (eNodeB) or a mobility management entity (MME), can be configured to evaluate a measurement report (MR) received from a mobile device for one or more radio frequency (RF) conditions associated with a primary network cell and one or more RF conditions associated with a secondary network cell. Then, based on the evaluation, the network apparatus can determine to communicate the control plane data with the mobile device via the primary network cell, the secondary network cell, or both. The control plane data can correspond to non-access stratum (NAS) information, radio resource control (RRC) information, or a hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) retransmission of previously transmitted control plane data.

This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 913 725 filed on Dec. 9 2013 and entitled RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSMISSIONS OF CONTROL PLANE DATA WITH CARRIER AGGREGATION which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety for all purposes.

The described embodiments generally relate to wireless communications and more particularly to procedures for effectively communicating control plane data between a network entity and a mobile device within different carrier aggregation scenarios.

Fourth generation 4G cellular networks employing newer radio access technology systems that implement the 3Generation Partnership Project 3GPP Long Term Evolution LTE and LTE Advanced LTE A standards are rapidly being developed and deployed within the United States and abroad. LTE A brings with it the aggregation of multiple component carriers CCs to enable this wireless communications standard to meet the bandwidth requirements of multi carrier systems that cumulatively achieve data rates not possible by predecessor LTE versions.

Within both LTE and LTE A telecommunication networks the mobility management entity MME and the enhanced NodeB eNodeB base station are independently responsible for implementing various control plane signaling procedures. For example the MME is responsible for establishing and releasing radio bearer connections for user equipment UE affecting UE transitions from idle mode to connected mode and vice versa by generating corresponding paging messages implementing various communication security features etc. This functionality is referred to as the Non Access Stratum NAS within the LTE protocol architecture which represents operations and communications between the evolved packet core EPC and the UE the Access Stratum AS represents operations and communications between the eNodeB and the UE within the LTE protocol architecture.

The eNodeB is responsible for various radio resource control RRC control plane activities including system information broadcasting transmitting paging messages emanating from MMEs RRC parameter configuration for UEs network cell selection and reselection procedures measurement and reporting configuration for UEs etc. In various implementations RRC control plane signaling may be performed in conjunction with one or more of the following LTE protocol entities or layers the packet data convergence protocol PDCP the radio link control RLC layer the medium access control MAC layer and the physical PHY layer. Further both control plane data and user plane data can be multiplexed within the MAC layer and communicated to an intended recipient via the PHY layer in the downlink DL or in the uplink UL during the same transmission time interval TTI .

Regardless of which network device e.g. an MME or an eNodeB in the DL or a UE in the UL is communicating LTE control plane data it is generally understood that control plane data consists of time sensitive information that must be communicated between or amongst various network devices in an efficient and predictable manner. Unfortunately in modern LTE A networks which employ carrier aggregation to increase cumulative communications bandwidth and improve communications throughput control plane signaling e.g. NAS or RRC communications is not always designated to the most appropriate DL or UL communication resource to ensure timely reception of sensitive control plane data by one or more intended recipients. In fact the present 3GPP LTE A standard i.e. relating to Releases 10 12 is silent with respect to identifying which network entity e.g. a primary carrier cell or a secondary carrier cell is designated to communicate control plane data corresponding to one or more component carrier network cells during various DL communications.

As such there exists a need for solutions that restrict control plane data communications to pre designated network entities or to dynamically designated network entities as changing network conditions may require particularly in view of various unanticipated radio link failure RLF scenarios. In this regard it would be beneficial to improve the likelihood of communicating control plane data in a timely manner within LTE A networks employing carrier aggregation.

This disclosure describes apparatus and procedures for communicating control plane data between a network apparatus and a mobile device within a Long Term Evolution LTE network employing carrier aggregation. In various embodiments a network apparatus e.g. an enhanced NodeB eNodeB base station or a mobility management entity MME can be configured to evaluate one or more network conditions associated with a primary network cell and one or more network conditions associated with a secondary network cell determine when to communicate control plane data e.g. corresponding to non access stratum NAS information or radio resource control RRC information with the mobile device via the primary network cell or the secondary network cell based at least in part on the evaluations of the network conditions. Thereafter the network apparatus can be configured to send the control plane data to the mobile device via the primary network cell or the secondary network cell or both.

In accordance with some aspects the primary network cell may be a primary carrier cell of the mobile device and the secondary network cell may be a secondary carrier cell of the mobile device where both the primary carrier cell PCC and secondary carrier cell SCC support carrier aggregation for the mobile device within the LTE network.

In various implementations the primary network cell and the secondary network cell can be configured as inter band non contiguous component carriers that respectively utilize different frequency resources within different radio frequency RF bands for communicating with the mobile device.

In other aspects the network apparatus can be configured to receive a measurement report MR from the mobile device where the MR includes information corresponding to the one or more network conditions associated with the primary network cell as well as information corresponding to the one or more network conditions associated with the secondary network cell.

In some scenarios the MR may comprise one or more of a channel quality indicator CQI a pre coding matrix indicator PMI and a rank indicator RI for the primary network cell and one or more of a CQI a PMI and a RI for the secondary network cell. Further the one or more network conditions associated with the primary network cell can be measured RF conditions of the primary network cell that comprise at least one of a reference signal received power RSRP a received signal strength indication RSSI and a signal to interference plus noise ratio SINR . Similarly the one or more network conditions associated with the secondary network cell can be measured RF conditions of the secondary network cell that comprise at least one of a RSRP a RSSI and a SINR.

In some aspects the network apparatus can be configured to evaluate at least one of a circuit switched fallback CSF condition for the mobile device and block error rate BLER information for instantaneous downlink hybrid automatic repeat request HARQ at the network apparatus or for instantaneous uplink HARQ at the mobile device and then determine to send the control plane data to the mobile device via the primary network cell or the secondary network cell based at least in part on evaluating at least one of the CSF condition for the mobile device and or the corresponding BLER information.

In other aspects the network apparatus can be configured to determine to send the control plane data to the mobile device via the primary network cell when the one or more network conditions associated with the primary network cell are better than the one or more network conditions associated with the secondary network cell determine to send the control plane data to the mobile device via the secondary network cell when the one or more network conditions associated with the secondary network cell are better than the one or more network conditions associated with the primary network cell or alternatively determine to send the control plane data to the mobile device via the primary network cell by default e.g. when the secondary network cell is assumed to be a less desirable option for communicating control plane data with the mobile device by the network .

In one embodiment the control plane data can be transmitted to the mobile device via the primary network cell or the secondary network cell during a network selected time interval alternatively the control plane may not be transmitted to the mobile device until a MR is received from the mobile device.

In various embodiments a network apparatus can comprise one or more processors and a storage device storing executable instructions that when executed by the one or more processors cause the network apparatus to receive a MR from a user equipment UE communicating within an LTE network evaluate the MR to determine to communicate control plane data with the UE using a PCC or a SCC wherein the PCC and the SCC support carrier aggregation for the UE within the LTE network and send the control plane data to the UE via the PCC or the SCC.

In some aspects execution of the executable instructions can further cause the network apparatus to determine to communicate the control plane data with the UE via the PCC and the SCC when the MR indicates that RF conditions are poor for the UE within the LTE network and send duplicate copies of the control plane data to the UE via the PCC and the SCC. In this regard the duplicate copies of the control plane data can be HARQ retransmissions of control plane data that was previously sent to the UE via the PCC or the SCC.

In other aspects execution of the executable instructions may further cause the network apparatus to determine to communicate the control plane data with the UE via the PCC when the MR indicates that RF conditions for the PCC are better than RF conditions for the SCC or alternatively determine to communicate the control plane data with the UE via the SCC when the MR indicates that RF conditions for the SCC are better than RF conditions for the PCC. In either scenario the control plane data sent to the UE via the PCC or the SCC may be a HARQ retransmission of control plane data that was previously sent to the UE via the PCC or the SCC.

In some embodiments a non transitory computer readable medium can store executable instructions that when executed by one or more processors of a network apparatus cause the network apparatus to receive a MR from a UE communicating within an LTE network evaluate the MR to determine to communicate control plane data with the UE using a PCC and a SCC when the MR indicates that RF conditions are poor for the UE within the LTE network where the PCC and the SCC support carrier aggregation for the UE and then send duplicate copies of the control plane data to the UE via the PCC and the SCC.

In various implementations the duplicate copies of the control plane data can be HARQ retransmissions of control plane data that was previously sent to the UE via the PCC or the SCC.

Accordingly it will be appreciated that the above described features are merely examples and should not be construed to narrow the scope or spirit of the subject matter described herein in any way. Other features aspects and advantages of the subject matter described herein will become apparent from the following Detailed Description Figures and Claims.

Representative examples for designating one or more network entities to transmit long term evolution LTE control plane data in the downlink DL and or in the uplink UL are described within this section. Further various examples for performing selective and dynamic LTE hybrid automatic repeat request HARQ retransmissions of control plane data are also described herein. These examples are provided to add context to and to aid in the understanding of the subject matter of this disclosure. It should be apparent that the present disclosure may be practiced with or without some of the specific details described herein. Further various modifications and or alterations can be made to the subject matter described herein and illustrated in the corresponding figures to achieve similar advantages and results without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure.

References are made in this section to the accompanying drawings which form a part of the disclosure and in which are shown by way of illustration various implementations corresponding to the described embodiments herein. Although the embodiments of this disclosure are described in sufficient detail to enable one having ordinary skill in the art to practice the described implementations it should be understood that these examples are not to be construed as being overly limiting or all inclusive.

In accordance with various embodiments described herein the terms wireless communication device wireless device mobile device mobile station and user equipment UE may be used interchangeably herein to describe one or more common consumer electronic devices that may be capable of performing procedures associated with various embodiments of the disclosure. In accordance with various implementations any one of these consumer electronic devices may relate to a cellular phone or a smart phone a tablet computer a laptop computer a notebook computer a personal computer a netbook computer a media player device an electronic book device a MiFi device a wearable computing device as well as any other type of electronic computing device having wireless communication capability that can include communication via one or more wireless communication protocols such as used for communication on a wireless wide area network WWAN a wireless metro area network WMAN a wireless local area network WLAN a wireless personal area network WPAN a near field communication NFC a cellular wireless network a fourth generation 4G LTE LTE Advanced LTE A and or 5G or other present or future developed advanced cellular wireless networks.

The wireless communication device in some embodiments can also operate as part of a wireless communication system which can include a set of client devices which can also be referred to as stations client wireless devices or client wireless communication devices interconnected to an access point AP e.g. as part of a WLAN and or to each other e.g. as part of a WPAN and or an ad hoc wireless network. In some embodiments the client device can be any wireless communication device that is capable of communicating via a WLAN technology e.g. in accordance with a wireless local area network communication protocol. In some embodiments the WLAN technology can include a Wi Fi or more generically a WLAN wireless communication subsystem or radio the Wi Fi radio can implement an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE 802.11 technology such as one or more of IEEE 802.11a IEEE 802.11b IEEE 802.11g IEEE 802.11 2007 IEEE 802.11n IEEE 802.11 2012 IEEE 802.11 ac or other present or future developed IEEE 802.11 technologies.

Additionally it should be understood that the UEs described herein may be configured as multi mode wireless communication devices that are also capable of communicating via different third generation 3G and or second generation 2G RATs. In these scenarios a multi mode UE can be configured to prefer attachment to LTE networks offering faster data rate throughput as compared to other 3G legacy networks offering lower data rate throughputs. For instance in some implementations a multi mode UE may be configured to fall back to a 3G legacy network e.g. an Evolved High Speed Packet Access HSPA network or a Code Division Multiple Access CDMA 2000 Evolution Data Only EV DO network when LTE and LTE A networks are otherwise unavailable.

By way of example a UE may be located within one or more LTE A cell s and in an LTE radio resource control RRC connected mode when it initiates a voice over LTE VoLTE application to establish a voice call. The UE running the VoLTE application can place a VoLTE voice call to an intended recipient by communicating voice data to a serving eNodeB which forwards the call through the EPC and and thereby connects to the Internet to transfer the VoLTE communications through an IP Multimedia Subsystem IMS network between the caller UE and a receiving device of the intended recipient which may be a part of a remote network. Alternatively the UE can initiate any number of different UE resident applications that may be respectively associated with a particular data type e.g. streaming audio data streaming audio video data website data text data etc. to attempt to transfer IP based application data via its serving LTE A network cell s over the Internet .

In various embodiments any of the MMEs and or any of the eNodeB base stations of the LTE A cells which are capable of supporting carrier aggregation can be configured to communicate control plane data to any of the UEs in the DL. Alternatively any of the UEs may be capable of communicating control plane data via any of the LTE A cells in the UL. In this regard it should be understood that the MMEs can perform Non Access Stratum NAS control plane signaling between the EPC and the UE via the eNodeB over the radio access network RAN portion of the network. In some scenarios NAS signaling can include but is not limited to including procedures for establishing and releasing radio bearer connections for user equipment UE affecting UE transitions from idle mode to connected mode and vice versa by generating corresponding paging messages implementing various communication security features etc.

Further the eNodeB base stations of the LTE A cells can be configured to perform various radio resource control RRC control plane signaling procedures including but not limited to including system information broadcasting transmitting paging messages emanating from MMEs RRC parameter configuration for UEs network cell selection and reselection procedures measurement and reporting configuration for UEs etc. In various implementations RRC control plane signaling may be performed in conjunction with one or more of the following LTE protocol entities or layers the packet data convergence protocol PDCP the radio link control RLC layer the medium access control MAC layer and the physical PHY layer. It should be understood that control plane data and user plane data can be multiplexed within the MAC layer and communicated to an intended recipient via the PHY layer in the downlink DL or in the uplink UL e.g. during the same transmission time interval TTI .

The communication network diagram also depicts two LTE compliant UEs and with reference to 3GPP LTE Releases 8 and 9 which are not capable of communicating using carrier aggregation. By way of example the LTE compliant UE can communicate control plane data with the eNodeB base station in the DL or the UL via a single frequency resource F and the LTE compliant UE may be configured to communicate control plane data with the eNodeB base station in the DL or the UL via a single frequency resource F. In the single carrier scenario LTE compliant UEs and employ individual standard designated system bandwidths that limit achievable data rate throughput to roughly 300 Mbits sec. in the DL and roughly 75 Mbits sec. in the UL real world implementations may vary .

For telecommunication networks employing LTE A interoperability with predecessor LTE versions requires an LTE A CCs to employ a system bandwidth equivalent to its earlier LTE version counterparts. As such the peak single CC LTE A system bandwidth is capped at 20 MHz for inter LTE RAT compatibility. However in various carrier aggregation scenarios an aggregate set of LTE A CCs may be able to achieve cumulative bandwidths of up to 100 MHz 5 CCs 20 MHz the maximum LTE standard system bandwidth using one or more allocated LTE spectrum bands. Generally UEs operating within LTE and or LTE A network cells employ operating bandwidths that mirror a serving cell s system bandwidth this implementation ensures that sufficient radio resources are allocated to support different UE data type communications having varying quality of service QOS requirements.

As is generally understood the PDCP layer may be responsible for header de compression of Internet Protocol IP data transfer of both control plane and user plane data maintenance of PDCP sequence numbers SNs in sequence delivery of upper layer protocol data units PDUs for lower layer reestablishments duplicate elimination of lower layer service data units SDUs for lower layer reestablishments of radio bearers mapped on the RLC layer de ciphering of control plane and user plane data integrity protection and verification of control plane data etc. The RLC layer may be responsible for transferring upper layer PDUs error correction signaling concatenation segmentation and reassembly of RLC SDUs re segmentation of RLC data PDUs reordering of RLC data PDUs duplicate detection RLC SDU discarding RLC reestablishment error detection etc.

The MAC layer may be responsible for mapping between logical channels and transport channels multiplexing of MAC SDUs from various logical channels onto transport blocks TBs to be delivered to the PHY layer on transport channels demultiplexing of MAC SDUs from various logical channels from TBs delivered from the PHY layer on transport channels scheduling information reporting error correction through HARQ signaling priority handling between and amongst UEs via dynamic scheduling priority handling between logical channels of a UE logical channel prioritization etc. The PHY layer may be responsible for transferring information from various MAC layer transport channels over the E UTRA air interface controlling adaptive modulation and coding AMC performing Tx power control procedures performing cell searching during synchronization and handover procedures communication channel measurements for the RRC layer etc.

When the network apparatus is representative of an eNodeB base station the network resource controller may be configured to utilize its DL radio resource assignment component to generate and or issue various DL radio resource assignments e.g. carrier DL RB grants to one or more UEs located within its corresponding network cells e.g. within LTE A PCC cell and or SCC cells and . Further the network resource controller may also be configured to utilize its UL radio resource assignment component to generate and or issue various UL radio resource assignments e.g. carrier UL RB grants to one or more UEs located within its corresponding network cells e.g. within LTE A PCC cell and SCC cells and . The network resource controller of the network apparatus may be able to employ its DL UL HARQ scheduler component to determine which UEs should receive various control plane data HARQ retransmissions and on what RBs these HARQ retransmissions should be communicated during a respective TTI in the DL or in the UL.

It should be appreciated that not all of the components device elements and hardware illustrated in and described with respect to the wireless communication device of may be essential to this disclosure and thus some of these items may be omitted consolidated or otherwise modified within reason.

In an embodiment all Level 1 L1 PHY layer control data transmissions may be designated for the PCC by default and the PCC may additionally communicate other IP packet data with the UE in the DL or in the UL via the LTE Uu interface. However the SCC may only communicate IP packet data without L1 control data with the UE in the DL or in the UL via the LTE Uu Interface. The SCC can coordinate its packet data transmissions including control plane data communications with the PCC via an inter cell coordination link via the LTE X2 interface to maximize communications throughput.

However in certain situations when time sensitive control plane data e.g. NAS and RRC signaling is communicated within packet data transmissions from the PCC to the UE and from the SCC to the UE independently negative outcomes may result. By way of example when communications between the SCC and the UE are deemed by the network to be volatile such as when RF conditions are poor and communications degrade to the point where a RLF could result on the communication link between the SCC and the UE it may be disadvantageous for the network to designate any control plane data communications for the SCC . In this scenario it is assumed that the PCC will typically have a stronger communication link with the UE as compared to a communication link between the SCC and the UE .

Accordingly it may be particularly beneficial for the network to pre designate all control plane data communications for the PCC as opposed to the SCC such that these time sensitive control plane communications are only scheduled to occur via a more reliable communications link between the PCC and the UE . In various embodiments this designation may be implemented by the network in an effort to prevent time sensitive control plane data from being lost in predicable scenarios where a communication link between the SCC and the UE may fail. This will improve the likelihood of the UE timely receiving sensitive control plane data from the network via the most reliable communication link available between PCC and the UE .

In some embodiments various network conditions associated with both a communications link between the PCC and the UE and a communications link between the SCC and the UE may be evaluated by a network entity associated with at least the PCC e.g. an MME and or an eNodeB base station to determine which of the two carrier cells the PCC or the SCC should be designated for control plane data communications.

For example in some implementations the PCC or a network entity associated therewith may receive either periodic or aperiodic network trigger initiated MRs that can include CQI PMI and or RI information relating to both RF conditions for the communications link between the PCC and the UE and RF conditions for the communications link between the SCC and the UE . In other embodiments the PCC or a network entity associated therewith may already be aware of the RF conditions for these respective communications links based on historical RF condition information stored by the network e.g. at a network entity such as an MME or an eNodeB base station.

In some embodiments a network entity associated with the PCC e.g. an eNodeB base station may evaluate respective RF conditions received in MRs or maintained within a network entity associated with the PCC and the SCC . In various scenarios this may be accomplished by comparing one or more common RF metrics of the LTE A communication standard to determine whether to dynamically designate the PCC or a SCC as the preferred carrier cell option for performing all subsequent control plane signaling operations and communications with the UE after a particular time or during a network selected time interval.

In one implementation a network entity associated with the PCC can select a first option based on comparing various RF conditions associated with one or more RF condition evaluations by instructing the PCC to handle all control plane signaling operations via a radio link between the PCC and the UE . This may occur when the radio link between the PCC and the UE is determined to be better than a radio link between the SCC and the UE . Alternatively in another implementation a network entity associated with the PCC or the SCC can select a second option based on comparing various RF conditions associated with one or more radio link evaluations by instructing the SCC to handle all control plane signaling operations via a radio link between the SCC and the UE . This may occur when the radio link between the SCC and the UE is determined to be better than a radio link between the PCC and the UE . It should be understood that in various configurations these control plane signaling allocations for the PCC or the SCC may be dynamically assigned for pre determined periods of time or for indefinite periods of time that may be changed in real time with the advent of various network condition triggers e.g. in response to one or more MR trigger events .

Initially at operation block a network apparatus e.g. an MME and or an eNodeB base station associated with a PCC and or a SCC may receive one or more periodic or aperiodic network event triggered MRs from a particular wireless communication device e.g. the UE of . Then at operation block the network apparatus and or the wireless communication device or another network entity associated therewith may compare various RF channel metrics e.g. RSRP RSRQ SINR etc. associated with both a communication link between a PCC and the UE and a communication link between a SCC and the UE to determine which of the two cells provides the most reliable RF conditions for subsequent control plane data communications with the UE .

In certain scenarios the network can utilize information from one or more MRs if and when they become available e.g. when they are transferred to the network apparatus from the wireless commutation device via the measurement and reporting component to make its determination of a preferred cell for handling control plane signaling communications. Alternatively circuit switched fallback CSF conditions at the network apparatus block error rate BLER information for instantaneous UL HARQ at the UE or for DL HARQ at the network apparatus may also be evaluated to determine which of the two cells provides the most reliable and predictable RF conditions for subsequent control plane data communications with the UE . At decision block a determination is made as to whether the PCC or the SCC is the preferred carrier cell for subsequent control plane data communications with the UE .

In a scenario where the PCC is determined to be the preferred carrier cell for control plane data communications at operation block the PCC can be designated by the network e.g. at an MME and or an eNodeB base station for handling future control plane data signaling operations and communications e.g. for NAS and RRC messaging . Alternatively in a scenario where the SCC is determined to be the preferred carrier cell for control plane data communications at operation block the SCC may be designated by the network e.g. at an MME and or an eNodeB base station for handling future control plane data signaling operations and communications e.g. for NAS and RRC messaging .

As would be understood by those skilled in the art the PDCCH may include downlink control information DCI e.g. emanating from an eNodeB that informs a UE of various DL resource allocations for the PDSCH HARQ information relating to the PDSCH various UL scheduling grants for the physical uplink shared channel PUSCH etc. The PUCCH can carry DL HARQ acknowledgements e.g. ACK NACKs that are transmitted by a UE to a network apparatus in response to the UE receiving or not receiving various DL data transmissions via the PDSCH .

In some situations a DL allocation may be transmitted from a network apparatus having DL HARQ scheduler e.g. an eNodeB having RRC functionality within the PDCCH to a UE to identify a particular set of designated DL resource blocks RBs where the UE should attempt to decode the PDSCH for DL information that may include control plane data. Upon acquiring or attempting to acquire the identified DL information that may include control plane data from the PDSCH corresponding to the DL allocation an intended recipient UE can send a positive DL HARQ acknowledgement ACK message or a negative DL HARQ acknowledgement NACK message to the network apparatus via the PUCCH .

The DL HARQ ACK NACK acknowledgements can indicate to the network apparatus e.g. an eNodeB having RRC functionality whether or not the DL information was received or acquired by the UE and or whether DL information that was acquired by the UE is free from errors e.g. according to a cyclic redundancy check CRC result. In some scenarios a DL CRC success result can indicate that DL information was acquired by a UE with or without error. Alternatively a DL CRC failure result may indicate that scheduled expected DL information was not acquired by a UE . As would be understood by those skilled in the art a UE will typically issue a DL HARQ ACK message to a network apparatus e.g. an eNodeB via the PUCCH in response to receiving a DL CRC success result . Likewise a UE will typically issue a DL HARQ NACK message to a network apparatus e.g. an eNodeB in response to receiving a DL CRC failure result .

In accordance with the DL HARQ SPS example an ongoing SPS DL resource allocation may be sent by a network apparatus employing the DL HARQ scheduler e.g. an eNodeB having RRC functionality to a UE to instruct the UE to attempt to decode the PDSCH for known recurring DL information on a periodic basis e.g. every 10 TTIs such that the UE is not required to further decode the PDCCH until a change to the ongoing SPS allocation is detected. Accordingly at every designated SPS interval e.g. every 10 ms. a UE can attempt to decode the PDSCH for prescheduled DL information. Depending on whether or not the DL information has been successfully acquired by the UE via the PDSCH and or whether or not the DL information was acquired without errors the UE can send a DL HARQ ACK message and or a DL HARQ NACK message to the network apparatus e.g. an eNodeB via the PUCCH .

In various implementations upon receiving a DL HARQ NACK message via the PUCCH that indicates a DL transmission failure or error e.g. corresponding to a CRC failure result a network apparatus employing the DL HARQ scheduler e.g. an eNodeB having RRC functionality can attempt to retransmit the DL information and or a portion of the DL information that may include control plane data to the UE at a later time in accordance with a designated retransmission interval duration e.g. 4 TTIs later 4 ms. . In various scenarios a total retransmission time or round trip time RTT for the UE to receive the correct and or complete DL information may be scheduled to occur within a particular number of TTIs to account for anticipated network communication and device processing delays e.g. a DL RTT of 8 TTIs 8 ms. .

In some scenarios a network apparatus employing the DL HARQ scheduler can evaluate a DL HARQ NACK received via the PUCCH to determine when to schedule a DL retransmission based on various network considerations including an application data type being communicated in the DL. The UE can thereafter be informed of the DL retransmission schedule by receiving a supplemental DL allocation for the retransmission within the PDCCH as designated by the network apparatus e.g. an eNodeB having RRC functionality . As would be understood by those skilled in the art this DL HARQ retransmission can occur on top of ongoing SPS operations such that the DL HARQ procedures requiring the UE to decode the PDCCH for retransmit control information will supersede SPS PDCCH do not decode durations.

In some embodiments an UL grant may be transmitted from a network apparatus employing an UL HARQ scheduler e.g. an eNodeB having RRC functionality within the PDCCH to a UE to identify a particular set of designated UL RBs where the UE should attempt to transmit UL information to the network apparatus in accordance with a predefined TTI interval e.g. every 4 TTIs 4 ms. . In this configuration there will be a TTI delay between a time when the UE receives the UL grant via the PDCCH and a time when the UL RBs allocated to UE for the UL transmission become available. The TTI delay is intended to give the UE sufficient time to process the UL data and determine how best to transmit a corresponding UL TB e.g. in accordance with various network designated quality of service QoS requirements.

Upon receiving or attempting to receive an UL transmission that may include control plane data via the PUSCH corresponding to an UL grant or a recipient network apparatus e.g. an eNodeB can transmit either a positive UL HARQ acknowledgement ACK message or a negative UL HARQ acknowledgement NACK message to the sending UE via the PHICH e.g. on the DL from the network apparatus . The UL HARQ ACK NACK acknowledgements and can indicate to the UE whether or not an UL TB was received or acquired by the network apparatus and or whether information of the UL TB that was acquired by the network apparatus is free from errors e.g. according to a corresponding cyclic redundancy check CRC result or . In various embodiments an UL CRC success result can indicate that the UL TB was received by the network apparatus without error. Alternatively an UL CRC failure result may indicate that the UL TB was erroneously received by the network apparatus .

As would be understood by those skilled in the art a network apparatus e.g. an eNodeB having RRC functionality will typically issue an UL HARQ ACK message to a corresponding UE via the PHICH in response to an UL CRC success result . Similarly a network apparatus e.g. an eNodeB having RRC functionality will typically issue an UL HARQ NACK message to a UE via the PHICH in response to an UL CRC failure result .

In some implementations upon receiving an UL HARQ NACK via the PHICH from a network apparatus that indicates an UL transmission failure or error e.g. corresponding to an UL CRC failure result a UE can attempt to retransmit the UL TB and or a portion of the UL TB information that may include control plane data to the network apparatus at a later time in accordance with a designated retransmission interval e.g. within 4 TTIs 4 ms. . In various scenarios a total retransmission time or round trip time RTT for the network apparatus to receive the correct and or complete UL TB from the UE may be scheduled to occur within a designated number of TTIs associated with an UL HARQ RTT to account for anticipated network communication and device processing delays e.g. an UL RTT of 8 TTIs 8 ms. .

In one scenario the RLC layer associated with the UE may determine that the Tx Data A with the initial control plane data was received in error. In response to this determination the RLC layer of the UE can transmit a HARQ NACK message to the PCC s corresponding HARQ entity which can then forward the NACK message to the RLC layer of network. In various implementations the NACK message may include bitmap information that identifies the network resource allocation associated with Tx Data A.

The RLC layer of the network may use this NACK bitmap information to coordinate with the PCC s HARQ entity and or the SCC s HARQ entity to schedule independent duplicate retransmissions of control plane Data A ReTx Data A and ReTx Data A from both the PCC and the SCC to the UE e.g. via separate communication links to ensure that the first control plane data transmission is received by the UE in a timely and efficient manner via a corresponding RLC layer retransmission. Alternatively in other embodiments the network can identify a situation where an expected ACK corresponding to Tx Data A is not received from the UE . In this scenario the RLC layer of the network can similarly coordinate with the PCC and the SCC to schedule independent duplicate retransmissions of the first control plane data.

Initially at operation block a NACK for an initial control plane data transmission may be received by a network apparatus e.g. an MME or an eNodeB base station associated with a PCC or an SCC . Alternatively the network apparatus may be able to identify a situation where an expected ACK corresponding to the initial control plane data transmission is not received from the UE . At decision block the network apparatus may employ it RLC layer functions to determine whether a NACK response is received for the initial control plane data transmission or whether a missing ACK scenario has occurred for the initial control plane data transmission.

In a scenario where the network apparatus receives an ACK response message for the initial control plane data transmission the procedure ends as no retransmission is required. However in a scenario where the network apparatus receives a NACK response message for the initial control plane data transmission or alternatively identifies a missing ACK scenario for the initial control plane data transmission the process proceeds to operation block where a duplicate HARQ retransmission for the initial control plane data transmission is scheduled for the PCC and for one or more SCCs . Next at operation block the initial control plane data can be retransmitted to the UE from both the PCC and the one or more SCCs to ensure that the initial control plane data is received by the UE in a timely manner.

In accordance with various embodiments the UE may be configured to employ its measurement and reporting component to transmit periodic or aperiodic network event triggered MRs to a network entity e.g. an MME and or an eNodeB base station associated with the PCC and or the SCC . Utilizing this information the network entity may be able to determine when RF signaling conditions are poor for the UE . When RF conditions experienced by the UE are determined to be poor the network entity may coordinate with the PPC and the SCC HARQ entities to schedule by default duplicate retransmissions for all control plane data communications transmitted to the UE while the RF signaling conditions remain poor.

In this scenario the PCC may transmit an initial Tx Data A including control plane data to the UE over a first communication link . The network may then employ the PCC s HARQ entity to retransmit a first copy of the ReTx Data A to the UE s first HARQ entity via a first communication link the network may similarly employ the SCC s HARQ entity to retransmit a second copy of the ReTx Data A to the UE s first HARQ entity via a second communication link . Upon receiving the first and second copies of the ReTx Data A and A by the UE s respective first and second HARQ entities the ReTx Data A and A can be passed through the MAC layer to the RLC layer which will utilize only one copy of the ReTx Data A or A for subsequent processing . The remainder of ReTx Data A or A that is not utilized can be discarded at the RLC layer of the UE .

Initially at operation block a network apparatus e.g. an MME or an eNodeB base station associated with a PCC or an SCC may receive MR information corresponding the RF conditions experienced by the UE for communications with the PCC and the SCC . Next at operation block the network apparatus can evaluate the MRs to determine whether network signaling conditions are poor e.g. from the perspective of the UE for the PCC and or the SCC . At decision block a determination can be made as to whether network signaling conditions are poor for the UE . In a scenario where network signaling conditions are determined not to be poor at operation block the network apparatus can schedule a single HARQ retransmission for control plane data e.g. when a corresponding NACK is received by the network. Then at operation block the single HARQ retransmission for the control plane data may be communicated to the UE from either the PCC or the SCC .

Alternatively in a scenario where network signaling conditions are determined to be poor at operation block the network apparatus can schedule a duplicate transmission i.e. the same RLC protocol data unit PDU containing control plane data for both the PCC and the SCC . Then at operation block the PCC and the SCC can retransmit respective duplicate copies of the control plane data to the UE to ensure that the time sensitive control plane data is received by the UE in a timely manner.
