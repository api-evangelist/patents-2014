title: Advising clients about certificate authority trust
abstract: In many information security scenarios, a certificate issued by a certificate authority may be presented to a client in order to assert a trust level of a certificated item, such as a message or a web page. However, due to a decentralized structure and incomplete coordination among certificate authorities, the presence and exploitation of security vulnerabilities to issue untrustworthy certificates may be difficult to determine, particularly for an individual client. Presented herein are techniques for advising clients of the reputations of respective certificate authorities by evaluating the certificates issued by such certificate authorities, such as the number and types of domains certified by the certificate; the number and pattern of certificates issued for the domain; and the certification techniques used to issue the certificates. Such evaluation enables a determination of a certificate authority trust level that may be distributed to the clients in a certificate authority trust set.

The present application claims priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 020 491 filed Sep. 6 2013 which in turn claims priority to U.S. Patent Application No. 61 830 121 filed Jun. 2 2013 the entirety of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

Within the field of computing many scenarios involve authentication using a certificate issued by a certificate authority. For example a user may connect to a website to perform a sensitive interaction such as a financial transaction using credentials that might be misused if intercepted by a third party. Accordingly the website may submit a certificate verifying its identity and signed by a certificate authority. The device of the user may examine the cryptographic signatures of the certificate to verify its authenticity that the identity of the issuer and the authenticity of the certificate before proceeding with the transaction and the provision of credentials.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

The certificate authority system is subject to exploitation due to a variety of technical and non technical aspects. As a first example vulnerabilities may be discovered and exploited in the mathematical models on which security techniques are based e.g. flaws in the MD5 hashing algorithm may permit the forgery of certificates or the alteration of signed content. As a second example under the current certification model a set of certificate authorities is identified and globally trusted such that any certificate authority may issue certificates for any domain as a result the exploitation coercion or malicious actions of any one certificate authority may result in the issuance of inauthentic certificates for any domain. As a third example it may be difficult to detect exploits of certificate authorities particular certificates and the security models involved therein because relevant information may be withheld e.g. certificate authorities often do not provide public records of issued certificates and or currently utilized security techniques and or may be unable to assess outside of a collective process that currently does not exist e.g. some types of exploits may be apparent from a collection of certificates submitted to a variety of users but may be undetectable from individual certificates .

In view of these limitations the present disclosure involves a collective model for evaluating certificates issued by certificate authorities for respective domains. In accordance with this model a certificate authority trust service may collect a set of certificates e.g. from the web browsers of individual users and or a trusted set of domain crawlers that crawl the internet and accept certificates that have been issued by certificate authorities for respective domains. The certificate authority trust service may evaluate the certificates using a variety of factors such as the number and pattern of times that the certificate has been received conflicts between the certificate and other certificates issued by the certificate authority for the domain the sequence of certificate authorities back to a root certificate authority the content type of the domain for which the certificate has been issued and the certification techniques utilized by the certificate authority to issue the certificate e.g. whether an encryption or hashing algorithm used for the certificate has known vulnerabilities that may enable forgery or alteration . Such factors may enable a determination of the trustworthiness of the certificate authority and or the exploitation of vulnerabilities in certificating security techniques. Based on these determinations the certificate authority trust service may generate a certificate authority trust set indicating the current trust level of various certificate authorities and may disseminate the certificate authority trust set to a set of devices such as a set of web browsers. The devices may then evaluate any subsequently received certificate issued by a certificate authority on behalf of a particular domain in view of the trust level of the certificate authority indicated by the certificate authority trust set. In this manner the techniques presented herein may enable the devices to evaluate the trust of certificates using collective information in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects advantages and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident however that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.

In order to provide such verification a first certificate authority may be provided that has established a level of trust with the first client . The first certificate authority may generate a first certificate identifying one or more aspects of the identity of the first domain and or the certificated item e.g. a hashcode of the content of a message and cryptographically signed with a credential of the first certificate authority e.g. using a cryptographic private key of an asymmetric encryption technique . The first certificate authority may then provide the first certificate for the certificated item to the first domain which may in turn provide the first certificate with the first certificated item to the first client . Upon receiving the certificate with the certificated item the first client may authenticate the first certificate with a credential of the first certificate authority e.g. verifying the signature of the first certificate with a cryptographic public key of the first certificate authority and may compare the first certificate with the certificated item e.g. comparing a hashcode of the content of the certificated item with the hashcode recorded in the first certificate . Verification of the first certificate with the credential of the first certificate authority establishes a trustworthiness of the first client in the authenticity of the first certificate e.g. that the first certificate was actually generated by the first certificate authority and not a third party and that the first certificate has not been altered subsequent to generation and an accurate comparison of the first certificate with the first certificated item enables a trustworthiness of the first client in the authenticity of the first certificated item e.g. that the first certificated item has not been altered since it was presented to the first certificate authority for certification . In this manner trustworthiness in certificated items may be established on behalf of clients by certificate authorities even if such certificated items and certificates are handled by untrusted intermediaries.

In view of these techniques a body of certificate authorities may be created according to a set of security practices. Occasionally exploits in the body of certificate authorities may prompt changes to the structure and underlying security techniques of such certificate authorities . For example vulnerabilities may be occasionally discovered in some of the mathematical techniques used in certificate generation that enable an attacker to alter the contents of the certificates issued by certificate authorities . For instance the hashing algorithm identified as MD5 was regarded as applicable to a particular set of content with a cryptographic private key resulting in a hashcode for the content of a certificated item that is verifiable with the corresponding cryptographic public key that enables the detection of alterations to the signed content and that cannot be generated without possessing the cryptographic private key corresponding to the cryptographic public key. However flaws discovered in the mathematical techniques comprising the MD5 hashing algorithm may be exploited to allow the generation of certificates without possession of the cryptographic private key and or the adjustment of a validly generated hashcode in a manner that verifies against altered content. While such exploits may be computationally very difficult the feasibility of generating hashcodes for forged or altered certificates has prompted a revocation of public trust in the MD5 hashing algorithm and has prompted certificate authorities to shift security practices in the generation of certificates from using the MD5 hashing algorithm to other hashing algorithms such as SHA 2 that are not currently known to present mathematical flaws or vulnerabilities.

However difficulties in this technique may arise from a decentralized body of certificate authorities . For example certificate authorities may operate independently and may not uniformly agree about the selection and implementation of security practices to be used in generating certificates . Accordingly a first certificate authority may use a security practice such as a particular hashing algorithm that a second certificate authority considers unsecure. Additionally incomplete disclosure by a particular certificate authority of the security practices utilized in generating certificates e.g. policies for rotating certificating credentials may cause difficulty in assessing the certificate authority trust level of the certificate authority according to the authenticity of its certificates . Accordingly a lack of collective evaluation of trust in certificate authorities may inhibit the evaluation of the certificate authority trust level . For example a particular client presented with a certificate may have limited access to information as to the certificate authority trust level to be ascribed to the certificate authority in view of the certificate and may therefore be unable to authenticate the certificate beyond the content thereof. Additionally diagnostic information pertaining to the certificate authority trust level of certificate authorities may be apparent in patterns of activity in the issuance of a variety certificates by the certificate authority to a variety of clients but the evaluation of such information may be inhibited by the unavailability of mechanisms for collecting and evaluating the certificates issued by the certificate authority and received by a variety of clients .

Accordingly the certificate authority trust level to be placed in certificate authorities may be subject to exploitation that may be difficult to detect. As a first such example in some certificate authority scenarios any certificate authority may issue a public certificate for any domain . The certificate authority trust level of the certificate authority system may thus be subject to exploitation e.g. certificates ostensibly representing a first entity such as a first company or a first national government may be issued by a certificate authority that is collaborating with an adverse second entity such as a competing company or a hostile second national government . As a second such example because certificate authorities may not provide public records of the certificates issued on behalf of various domains it may be difficult for a domain to detect the issuance of unauthorized certificates on its behalf. As a third such example it may be difficult to review the security practices utilized by a particular certificate authority e.g. some certificate authorities may be slow or reluctant to transition away from using security practice that is found to be unsecure. As a fourth such example some types of exploits may be detectable only by a collective evaluation of many certificates e.g. the issuance of certificates on behalf of a particular domain concurrently by two or more different certificate authorities may raise a security concern but the detection of this condition may be difficult to discern from the examination of any particular certificate in isolation. Moreover due to the absence of a collective process to gather examine reach a consensus on and disseminate information about the trust placed in respective certificate authorities makes it difficult for any particular client to determine whether or not to determine the certificate authority trust level of a particular certificate authority and the authenticity of a certificate issued by the certificate authority for a particular domain .

Such problems are further illustrated in the exemplary scenario of . As a first such example the first client may receive from a second domain a second certificate that is associated with a second certificated item and that indicates issuance by the first certificate authority . However the second certificate may not have been issued by the first certificate authority but may instead have been forged e.g. by the second domain or a third party through the exploitation of a security vulnerability e.g. the use of a compromised credential of the first certificate authority . Accordingly it may be desirable for the client to identify an untrustworthiness of the second certificate but the first client may not be able to determine such untrustworthiness simply by examining the second certificate . As a second example a second certificate authority that exhibits untrustworthiness e.g. a history of issuing improper certificates may issue a third certificate for a third certificated item and the third certificate may be submitted to the first client . However even if the first client is able to determine the untrustworthiness of the third certificate issued by the second certificate authority such determination of untrustworthiness may not be communicated to a second client which upon receiving the third certificate may incorrectly determine a certificate authority trust level of the second certificate authority . Due to these aspects illustrated in the exemplary scenario of and other aspects of a system of certificate authorities determinations of certificate authority trust level of respective certificate authorities may be difficult.

Presented herein are techniques that may enable a reduction or avoidance of exploitable vulnerabilities that may arise within a system of certificate authorities . In accordance with these techniques a certificate authority trust service may be devised that collects certificates that have been presented to clients for the authentication of various certificated items . For example the devices utilized by a set of users may automatically submit some received certificates to a certificate authority trust service. Alternatively or additionally a certificate authority trust service may utilize a set of trusted clients e.g. a trusted set of crawlers that automatically explore a set of domains and collect certificates submitted by the domains and apparently issued by a certificate authority . Based on the evaluation of the respective certificates the certificate authority trust service may generate a certificate authority trust set indicating a certificate authority trust level for respective certificate authorities and may distribute the certificate authority trust set to a set of clients . Each client may then evaluate subsequently received certificates based on the certificate authority trust level of the certificate authority issuing the certificate as indicated by the certificate authority trust set as well as various other heuristics for assessing the trust of a certificate . These and other techniques may be utilized to detect disseminate and utilize a collective certificate trust evaluation process in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

The certificates collected from various domains may be evaluated to evaluate a certificate authority trust level of the certificate authorities using a variety of heuristics. As a first such example the certificate authority trust service may consider the number and pattern of times that the certificate has been received from clients e.g. whether the certificate is new established or expired and whether the certificate has reappeared after a lapse in submissions by clients . As a second such example the certificate authority trust service may consider conflicts between the certificate and other certificates issued by the certificate authority for a particular domain such as a receipt of a second certificate for a domain while a prior certificate for the same domain remains in effect and unrevoked. As a third such example a sequence of certificate authorities back to a root certificate authority may be evaluated e.g. if any of the certificate authorities in the sequence by which a certificate was issued has been compromised the certificate may be regarded as suspicious even if the other certificate authorities have not been compromised. As a fourth such example the content type of the domain for which the certificate has been issued e.g. if the domain is from a particular geographic region that is unusual for the certificate authority or if the domain hosts content that is unusual for the certificate authority to certify e.g. malware the certificate may be regarded as suspicious. As a fourth such example if the certificate was generated using a certification technique such as an encryption or hashing algorithm that has a known vulnerability and that may enable forgery or alteration the certificate may be regarded as suspicious.

The certificate authority trust service also performs a certificate authority evaluation of the respective certificate authorities based on the certificate trust levels of the certificates that appear to have been issued by that certificate authority and determines a certificate authority trust level of the certificate authority . For example a first certificate authority issuing only certificates having a high certificate trust level e.g. certificates that present no indication of suspicion or forgery may be assigned a positive certificate authority trust level a second certificate authority issuing a second certificate having a high certificate trust level and a third certificate having a poor certificate trust level e.g. a detected forgery of the issuance of the third certificate may be assigned an intermediate certificate authority trust level and a third certificate authority associated with several certificates having a negative certificate trust level may be assigned a negative certificate authority trust level . The certificate authority trust service then generates a certificate authority trust set identifying for respective certificate authorities a certificate authority trust level . The certificate authority trust service sends the certificate authority trust set to the clients which may utilize the certificate authority trust set to determine a certificate authority trust level to be ascribed to the respective certificate authorities upon receiving a certificate for a certificated item a client may ascribe to the certificate and the certificated item a trust level proportional to a certificate authority trust level of the certificate authority apparently issuing the certificate . In this manner the clients and certificate authority trust service may interoperate to achieve a collaborative collection determination and dissemination of certificate authority trust levels of various certificate authorities and certificates issued thereby in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

The techniques presented herein enable a variety of technical effects that may benefit the operation of devices configured according to such techniques.

As a first such example a device utilizing the techniques presented herein may automatically advise other devices as to the reliability of certificates and certificate authorities . The use of a device such as a server to achieve such detection may alleviate humans such as security researchers from manually reviewing such certificates and making determinations of the certificate authority trust level of respective certificate authorities . Additionally using a device such as a server to perform such evaluation may promote the consistency of such determinations e.g. using a single device that consistently applies a set of heuristics to a large number of certificates enables more consistent security determinations than having a team of humans evaluate such certificates individually and subjectively and therefore possibly inconsistently perform such evaluation.

As a second such example a device utilizing the techniques presented herein may detect more subtle patterns among certificates domains and certificate authorities than a human reviewer may detect and observe. As a first such example an established certificate may present no apparent signs of suspicion to a human reviewer but an automated evaluation technique may detect that the certificate has not been received from any clients for an unusual amount of time e.g. heavy use by the domain a six month period wherein no clients submit the certificate to the certificate authority trust service followed by a sudden reappearance of the certificate . As a second such example a certificate by a certificate authority may represent a minor problem that raises only a low degree of suspicion but may be one of many such certificates issued by the same certificate authority that raise only a low degree of suspicion where a detected pattern of consistently low suspicion may indicate an aggregate greater level of suspicion of the certificate authority .

As a third such example a device utilizing the techniques presented herein may respond more rapidly to suspicious certificates and vulnerabilities than a human mediated review process. For example if a certificating authority begins issuing unambiguously forged certificates on behalf of a collection of domains an automated review technique may rapidly flag the certificate authority as having been compromised and may rapidly notify a large body of clients of a reduction of the certificate authority trust level of the certificate authority rather than waiting for a human to review the certificates and authorize the reduction of the certificate authority trust level . Such automated techniques therefore considerably reduce the window of opportunity for a compromised certificate authority to exploit forged certificates . These and other technical effects are achievable through the use of the techniques presented herein.

The exemplary first method begins at and involves executing the instructions on the processor of the device. In particular the execution of the instructions on the processor causes the device to responsive to receiving a certificate issued by the certificate authority for a domain evaluate the certificate to verify a certificate authenticity of the certificate . The result of the evaluation enables either upon verifying the certificate authenticity of the certificate raising the certificate authority trust level of the certificate authority in a certificate authority trust set and upon failing to verify the certificate authenticity of the certificate reducing the certificate authority trust level of the certificate authority in the certificate authority trust set . The exemplary method also involves distributing the certificate authority trust set to the clients . In this manner the exemplary first method causes the device to advise clients of the certificate authority trust levels of the various certificate authorities in accordance with the techniques presented herein and so ends at .

In particular the instructions stored in the memory device and executed on the processor implement a certificate evaluator which responsive to receiving a certificate issued by the certificate authority for a domain evaluate the certificate to verify a certificate authenticity of the certificate upon verifying the certificate authenticity of the certificate raises a certificate authority trust level of the certificate authority in a certificate authority trust set stored on by the certificate authority trust server and upon failing to verify the certificate authenticity of the certificate reduces the certificate authority trust level of the certificate authority in the certificate authority trust set . The instructions stored in the memory device and executed on the processor also implement a certificate authority trust distributor which distributes the certificate authority trust set to the clients . In this manner the exemplary certificate authority trust server advises the clients regarding the certificate authority trust levels of respective certificate authorities sin accordance with the techniques presented herein.

The techniques discussed herein may be devised with variations in many aspects and some variations may present additional advantages and or reduce disadvantages with respect to other variations of these and other techniques. Moreover some variations may be implemented in combination and some combinations may feature additional advantages and or reduced disadvantages through synergistic cooperation. The variations may be incorporated in various embodiments e.g. the exemplary first method of the exemplary system of the exemplary second method of and the exemplary computer readable storage device of to confer individual and or synergistic advantages upon such embodiments.

A first aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the scenarios wherein such techniques may be utilized.

As a first variation of this first aspect the techniques presented herein may be utilized with many types of clients such as devices operated by one or more users one or more applications executing on such devices and or online services provided on behalf of one or more users or other applications.

As a second variation of this first aspect the techniques presented herein may be utilized to determine a certificate authority trust level of a certificate authority and therefore to authenticate various types of certificated items presented to and or accessed by a client such as messages applications websites and or identifying credentials of one or more domains of a network.

As a third variation of this first aspect the techniques presented herein may be utilized to evaluate the determine a certificate authority trust level of various types of certificate authorities issuing certificates such as the X.509 certification based trust infrastructure.

As a fourth variation of this first aspect many types of certificate authority trust services may be provided to facilitate the evaluation by clients of determine a certificate authority trust level of various certificate authorities . Such certificate authority trust services may comprise a public service provided to any client or a semi private or private service provided to a specific set of clients . Alternatively or additionally a certificate authority trust service may identify the certificate authority trust levels of any certificate authority or of only a subset of certificate authorities such as those issuing particular types of certificates those issuing certificates only for a particular set of certificated items or those interoperating on behalf of a particular set of domains and or clients .

As a fifth variation of this first aspect one or more clients may utilize the certificate authority trust set in various ways. As a first such example a client may only permit access to certificated items that are associated with a certificate issued by a certificate authority having a high certificate authority trust level specified in the certificate authority trust set and may restrict access to other certificated items . As a second such example a client may permit access to certificated items certified by certificates issued by certificate authorities that are not associated with a high certificate authority trust level according to the certificate authority trust set but may do so only after warning a user of the certificate authority trust level of the certificate authority and or may provide access within tightened security credentials e.g. executing a first application certified by a first certificate issued by a first certificate authority having a high certificate authority trust level natively and with a high level of privileges and executing a second application certified by a second certificate executed by a second certificate authority having a low certificate authority trust level with a restricted set of privileges such as within an isolation construct such as a virtual machine having limited access to the device of the user . These and other scenarios may be compatible with the application of the techniques presented herein.

A second aspect that may vary among embodiments of the techniques presented herein relates to the generation use and content of the certificate authority trust set generated by the certificate authority trust service and distributed to the clients .

As a first variation of this second aspect the certificate authority trust set may identify the certificate authority trust levels assigned to the certificate authorities in various ways. For example the certificate authority trust set may identify that respective certificate authorities are trustworthy or untrustworthy or may indicate a degree of trustworthiness e.g. a percentage or letter score for the certificate authority . As another example the certificate authority trust set may identify a particular certificate authority trust level of the certificate authority for particular types of certificates and or certificated items .

As a second variation of this second aspect a certificate authority trust service may determine the certificate trust levels of various certificates and or the certificate authority trust levels of various certificate authorities in various ways. Many types of heuristics and rules may be utilized in such determinations based on an evaluation of factors such as the content of the certificate the certificated item certified by the certificate and the domain presenting the certificate .

As a third variation of this second aspect upon receiving a certificate issued by a selected certificate authority that does not yet have a certificate authority trust level in the certificate authority trust set such as a new newly participating or first observed certificate authority a device such as a certificate authority trust service or a client may store in the certificate authority trust set an untrusted certificate authority trust level for the selected certificate authority e.g. initially establishing a low determine a certificate authority trust level for the certificate authority until the certificate authority has consistently demonstrated verifiable trustworthiness .

As a fourth variation of this second aspect the certificate authority trust set may further identify the certificate trust levels of one or more certificates . For example the certificate authority trust set may specify that one or more certificates issued by a particular certificate authority are trustworthy or are untrustworthy e.g. a list of certificates that have been revoked by the certificate authority following the discovery of a security vulnerability affecting the determine a certificate authority trust level of those certificates . A client may upon receiving a certificate determine the certificate trust level of the certificate specified by the certificate authority trust set and evaluate the certificated item according to the certificate authority trust level of the certificate authority that issued the certificate for the certificated item and the certificate trust level of the certificate specified by the certificate authority trust set.

As a fifth variation of this second aspect one or more clients may also be configured to send to the certificate authority trust service only particular types of certificates . As a first such example where the certificate authority trust set specifies certificate trust levels for one or more certificates a client may be configured to submit to the certificate authority trust service only certificates that do not have a certificate trust level in the certificate authority trust set e.g. only certificates that the certificate authority trust service has not yet evaluated . As a second such example one or more clients may configured to send to the certificate authority trust service only certificates that are associated with a publicly accessible certificated item e.g. only for publicly accessible domains . These and other variations in the generation and distribution of the certificate authority trust set may be utilized in embodiments of the techniques presented herein.

A third aspect that may vary among embodiments of the techniques presented herein involves the heuristics used to evaluate the authenticity of the certificates received from the certificate authorities .

As a first variation of this third aspect a certificate may be evaluated by comparison with a second certificate issued by the certificate authority for the domain . For example two or more certificates may represent irregularities such as differently identifying the certificate authority in ways that may suggest a forgery or alteration of the certificate .

As a second variation of this third aspect the certificate is associated with a revocation by the certificate authority of the second certificate. As a first such example a certificate received by a client from a domain may have been issued by a certificate authority that has subsequently issued a superseding certificate for the same domain . As a second such example a second certificate may have been issued for a domain by a certificate authority while a prior first certificate issued for the same domain by the same or another certificate authority remains in effect and unrevoked.

As a third variation of this third aspect certificates may be received from at least one client to which the certificate was transmitted by a domain and may be evaluated according to a client count of clients that received the certificate from the domain . As a first such example a certificate may have been consistently received by a large body of clients over a long period and may be identified as an established certificate for which the certificate authority trust level is raised. As a second such example a certificate may be new and or may have been received only from a small number of clients which may have been targeted by a compromised certificate authority trust level and may therefore result in a reduction of the certificate authority trust level of the certificate authority .

As a fourth variation of this third aspect certificates are evaluated according to a historic submission rate of the certificate from the clients that received the certificate from the domain . For example the certificate authority trust service may consider the number and pattern of times that the certificate has been received from clients e.g. whether the certificate is new established or expired and whether the certificate has reappeared after a lapse in submissions by clients .

As a sixth variation of this third aspect a certificate evaluation may involve an evaluation of a certificate scope of the certificate . As a first such example the certificate scope of the certificate may involve a domain count of domains for which the certificate is issued by the certificate authority e.g. a certificate issued for an unusually large number and or unrelated set of domains may indicate a suspicious certificate . As a second such example the certificate scope of the certificate may involve a subdomain wildcard of the certificate that applies to all subdomains of a domain which may be unusual for a certificate authority that typically issues per subdomain certificates .

A fourth aspect that may vary among embodiments of the techniques presented herein involves the certification techniques whereby the certificates are issued by the certificate authorities .

As a first variation of this fourth aspect for a certificate that is issued by the certificate authority using a particular certification technique an evaluation of the certificate may involve evaluating a certification reliability of the certification technique used by the certificate authority of the certificate . Upon detecting a vulnerability of a compromised certification technique such as a detected vulnerability in a hashing algorithm or an encryption technique that some certificating authorities use for certificates a certificate authority trust service may advise at least one certificate authority not to use the compromised certification technique to issue certificates and or may notify clients not to trust any certificates using the compromised certification technique. Upon determining that a certificate using the compromised certification technique was issued by a selected certificate authority after the selected certificate authority has been advised not to use the compromised certification technique a certification authority trust service may reduce the certificate authority trust level of the certificate authority in the certificate authority trust set .

The techniques discussed herein may be devised with variations in many aspects and some variations may present additional advantages and or reduce disadvantages with respect to other variations of these and other techniques. Moreover some variations may be implemented in combination and some combinations may feature additional advantages and or reduced disadvantages through synergistic cooperation. The variations may be incorporated in various embodiments to confer individual and or synergistic advantages upon such embodiments.
