title: Dynamically controlling the presentation of a graphic feature based on location information
abstract: A system and method of operating a mobile device is described. The mobile device can determine its current location and determine whether a location-based service, which can be requested by a user operating the mobile device, is available for use at the current location. In response to determining that the location-based service is unavailable for use at the current location, the mobile device can cause a graphic icon, that would otherwise be displayed one of one or more home pages on a display of the mobile device, to be hidden so that the graphic icon is not displayed with any of the one or more home pages. The graphic icon can correspond to a service application for use with the location-based service.

An on demand service arrangement system can arrange an on demand service to be performed by a service provider for a requesting user through the use of computing devices. However due to a variety of different factors such an on demand service may only be available to be requested by users that are located in certain locations.

Examples described herein provide for a system to determine a current location of a mobile computing device and based on the current location dynamically control the presentation of a graphic icon of an application. Such a system for example can be implemented using hardware and processing resources of a mobile computing device such as a smartphone. The system can determine based on the current location of the mobile computing device and or other conditions that an application should not be made available for use by a user of the mobile computing device and in response can cause a corresponding graphic icon to be hidden from view of the user on the home page of the mobile computing device. In this manner the user can be prevented from launching or accessing the application when operating the mobile computing device at a particular location.

According to an example the system can determine the current location of the mobile computing device. The current location can be determined by using at least a global positioning system GPS receiver of the mobile computing device or a transceiver of the mobile computing device. Based on the current location the system can determine whether a location based service which can be requested by a user operating the mobile computing device is available for use at the current location. If the location based service is unavailable for use at the current location the system can cause a graphic icon that corresponds to a service application for use with the location based service and that would otherwise be displayed on or as part of a home page s on a display of the mobile computing device to be hidden from view so that the graphic icon is not displayed with any of the home page s . On the other hand if the location based service is available for use at the current location the system can cause the graphic icon corresponding to the service application to be displayed on the home page s so that the user may if he or she chooses to select the graphic icon to launch and access the service application. Accordingly the system can dynamically alter the graphical user interface that is to be displayed on a display of the mobile computing device based on location information.

As described herein a mobile computing device can store a service application in a memory resource of the mobile computing device. In one example the service application e.g. the set of instructions and data corresponding to the service application can be pre installed or pre stored in the mobile computing device during or after the manufacturing and device packaging process but before the mobile computing device is purchased by a user. In such an example the system can perform the operations described above in response to detecting a triggering event such as the mobile computing device being powered on from an off state or a power saving state or the mobile computing device changing operational states or modes. For example instructions stored as part of the set of instructions can cause the processor of the mobile computing device to perform the operations described above in response to the operating system of the mobile computing device being initiated as a result of a boot up process e.g. after the user powers on the device for the first time after purchasing the device or after the user resets the device .

In another example the system operating on the mobile computing device can execute the instructions in response to the operating system activating a transceiver of the mobile computing device. A mobile computing device can include one or more transceivers such as a cellular transceiver to exchange data with a cellular network s or a short range transceiver e.g. a Bluetooth radio a wireless local area network WLAN device etc. . In certain situations depending on whether a transceiver is turned off or depending on the availability or quality of service of a cellular or wireless e.g. Wi Fi network the mobile computing device may operate in different operational states or modes. When the system detects a change in the operational state or mode e.g. detects a triggering event the system can be triggered to perform the operations described above.

Still further depending on implementation the system can determine the current location of the mobile computing device using one or more different resources. In one example the system can determine the current location by receiving location information from the GPS receiver or a transceiver of the mobile computing device. In another example the system can determine the current location by receiving location information from another application that is operating on the mobile computing device. Because other applications may have previously determined the current location by receiving location information from the GPS receiver or the transceiver the system can leverage the information already determined by another application without again having to access the GPS receiver or the transceiver.

As used herein a client device a computing device and or a mobile computing device refer to devices corresponding to desktop computers cellular devices or smartphones personal digital assistants PDAs laptop computers tablet devices etc. that can provide network connectivity and processing resources for communicating with the system over one or more networks. Client devices and service provider devices can each operate a designated service application e.g. a client application and a service provider application respectively that is configured to communicate with a location based and or an on demand service arrangement system.

Still further examples described herein relate to a variety of location based and or on demand services such as a transport service a food truck service a delivery service an entertainment service etc. to be arranged between users and service providers. In other examples the system can be implemented by any entity that provides goods or services for purchase through the use of computing devices and network s . For purpose of simplicity in examples described herein the location based service arrangement system can correspond to a transport arrangement system that arranges transport services to be provided for users by drivers of vehicles.

One or more examples described herein provide that methods techniques and actions performed by a computing device are performed programmatically or as a computer implemented method. Programmatically as used herein means through the use of code or computer executable instructions. These instructions can be stored in one or more memory resources of the computing device. A programmatically performed step may or may not be automatic.

One or more examples described herein can be implemented using programmatic modules engines or components. A programmatic module engine or component can include a program a sub routine a portion of a program or a software component or a hardware component capable of performing one or more stated tasks or functions. As used herein a module or component can exist on a hardware component independently of other modules or components. Alternatively a module or component can be a shared element or process of other modules programs or machines.

some examples described herein can generally require the use of computing devices including processing and memory resources. For example one or more examples described herein may be implemented in whole or in part on computing devices such as servers desktop computers cellular or smartphones personal digital assistants e.g. PDAs laptop computers printers digital picture frames network equipment e.g. routers and tablet devices. Memory processing and network resources may all be used in connection with the establishment use or performance of any example described herein including with the performance of any method or with the implementation of any system .

Furthermore one or more examples described herein may be implemented through the use of instructions that are executable by one or more processors. These instructions may be carried on a computer readable medium. Machines shown or described with figures below provide examples of processing resources and computer readable mediums on which instructions for implementing examples described herein can be carried and or executed. In particular the numerous machines shown with examples described herein include processor s and various forms of memory for holding data and instructions. Examples of computer readable mediums include permanent memory storage devices such as hard drives on personal computers or servers. Other examples of computer storage mediums include portable storage units such as CD or DVD units flash memory such as carried on smartphones multifunctional devices or tablets and magnetic memory. Computers terminals network enabled devices e.g. mobile devices such as cell phones are all examples of machines and devices that utilize processors memory and instructions stored on computer readable mediums. Additionally examples may be implemented in the form of computer programs or a computer usable carrier medium capable of carrying such a program.

As described herein the service application can correspond to a program that is downloaded onto the mobile computing device. In one example the service application can be pre installed or pre stored on the mobile computing device before sale of the mobile computing device e.g. before the device is turned on for the first time by a user who purchased the device . In other examples the service application can be downloaded onto the mobile computing device in response to the user accessing an application source e.g. an online store from the mobile computing device. The service application can also be configured to communicate with a location based and or on demand service arrangement system such as the service arrangement system over one or more networks. Such a service arrangement system can be implemented on network side resources such as on one or more servers or data centers. The service arrangement system can also be implemented through other computer systems in alternative architectures e.g. peer to peer networks etc. .

When operated by a user of the mobile computing device the service application can enable the user to make a request for a location based service such as an on demand transport service or a food goods delivery service using the mobile computing device. The service arrangement system can receive a request for the location based service and arrange the location based service by selecting a service provider from a plurality of available service providers to provide the location based service for the requesting user based at least in part on location information e.g. a current location a pickup location a delivery location specified by a user etc. . The service arrangement system can then provide information about the arranged location based service to the service application and monitor the progress of the arranged location based service.

According to other examples the service application can correspond to an application that is operated by a service provider e.g. a driver a food delivery individual etc. . The service application can be configured to communicate with the service arrangement system and can enable the driver for example to receive an invitation to provide a location based service for a requesting user. The service application can be implemented on a mobile computing device that is in control and operated by the service provider. In another example the service application can be implemented on a vehicle computer such as one that is built in with a vehicle driven by the service provider.

In some examples the service application can include a location determination a service availability check a geography database and a service interface . The service application can also include other data such as content to be displayed as user interface features for the service application and a graphic icon corresponding to the service application to be displayed on a home page e.g. user interface or an application launch page of the mobile computing device. For purpose of simplicity other information and components of the service application are not illustrated in . The service interface enables the service application to exchange data between the service application and the service arrangement system . For example the service interface can use one or more network resources of the mobile computing device to exchange communications over a wireless network e.g. a cellular transceiver a WLAN transceiver etc. . The service interface can include or use an application programming interface API such as an externally facing API to communicate data with the service arrangement system . The externally facing API can provide access to the service arrangement system via secure access channels over the network through any number of methods such as web based forms programmatic access via restful APIs Simple Object Access Protocol SOAP remote procedure call RPC scripting access etc.

According to an example the system can be initiated or activated when the mobile computing device is powered on from an off state or a power saving state e.g. a suspended or sleep state . The system can correspond to can be a part of and or can include the operating system of the mobile computing device. For example when the mobile computing device is powered on a boot up process can be initiated in which a boot loader e.g. a boot up program launches and loads a kernel which can run and turn on device drivers and turn on the operating system of the mobile computing device. As referred to herein in one example a boot up process can correspond to the operations performed by the mobile computing device from a time when the device is powered on to a time the mobile computing device is ready for use by a user such as for example when the unlock user interface e.g. a user interface in which the user can unlock the mobile computing device via input and or the home page e.g. an application launch page is displayed on the display of the mobile computing device.

As part of the boot up process the system can identify one or more applications or portions of one or more applications that it is to automatically run or operate such as one or more pre installed applications or native applications e.g. applications that have been developed for use on the particular operating system or mobile computing device and can launch and operate the identified applications or portions of the identified applications . In the example of the system can determine that portions of the service application is to be automatically executed as part of the boot up process e.g. the location determination and the service availability check .

In one example in response to the operating system being initiated on the mobile computing device the system can automatically execute instructions corresponding to the location determination and or instructions corresponding to the service availability check e.g. as part of the boot up process . The location determination can determine the current location of the mobile computing device. Depending on implementation in one example the location determination can determine the current location by communicating with one or more other applications that are operated or being operated on the mobile computing device e.g. via an API to receive location information corresponding to the current location from the one or more other applications . For example as part of the boot up process the system may have run a second application e.g. a native weather application or a map application that determined the current location of the mobile computing device for use by that second application by receiving location information from the GPS receiver or the transceiver of the mobile computing device.

According to another example the location determination can determine the current location of the mobile computing device by communicating with one or more mobile computing device components e.g. a GPS receiver a cellular transceiver a short range transceiver via a corresponding device interface to receive location information corresponding to the current location. For example the cellular transceiver of the mobile computing device can determine the current location by communicating with a plurality of cellular towers or base stations e.g. through triangulation .

In another variation the short range transceiver of the mobile computing device e.g. in combination with processing resources of the mobile computing device can determine the current location by communicating with a network e.g. the internet a WLAN and using geolocation processes can determine the current location based on an internet protocol IP address of the network and or the device and or based on other information such as the media access control MAC address of the network and or the device . For example based on the IP address of the network the system can use a database provided by an internet registry to determine a zip code a city a county a state etc. Depending on implementation the current location of the mobile computing device can correspond to a latitude and a longitude coordinate or a less accurate general location such as a city block a city a county a state etc. Such a less accurate general location as opposed to a more accurate location data point can be sufficient for purpose of determining service availability.

The service availability check can determine whether a location based service e.g. one that can be requested by the user using the service application is available for use at the current location of the mobile computing device. Such a location based service may be available in certain geographic regions and may be unavailable in other geographic regions. For example with reference to an on demand transport service e.g. one that can be arranged by the service arrangement system service providers e.g. drivers of vehicles may only be available to provide transport services in certain cities counties or regions. In another example for a food delivery service users may only be able to request food delivery if the drop off location is in a particular city county or region.

According to an example the service availability check can access the geography database stored with the service application to determine whether the location based service is available at the current location. The geography database can store information about one or more predetermined geographic regions that correspond to an area where the location based service associated with the service application is available e.g. can be requested by the user by operating the mobile computing device . A predetermined geographic region can be identified by a city name a county name a state name etc. and or can be defined by three or more location data points e.g. a latitude and a longitude coordinate that make up a perimeter of the geographic region. If the current location is located within a geographic region in which the location based service is available the service availability check can determine that the location based service is available for use at the current location. On the other hand if the current location is not located within any of the geographic region s in which the location based service is available the service availability check can determine that the location based service is unavailable for use at the current location and thereby determine that the service application should not be made available for use by the user of the mobile computing device.

In such case the service availability check can communicate with the presentation component to cause a graphic icon corresponding to the service application that would otherwise be displayed on a home page or an application launch page to be hidden from the user s view. For example the presentation component can determine which applications are installed on the mobile computing device. For a set of applications that can be launched and operated by the user of the mobile computing device the presentation component can typically display a graphic icon for each of the set of applications to be presented on or as part of a user interface such as a home page or an application launch page. Each of the graphic icons can be individually selectable by the user to launch or open a corresponding application. In the example of however despite the service application being stored on the mobile computing device and having an associated graphic icon if the service availability check determines that the location based service is unavailable for use at the current location the service availability check can cause via an icon trigger command or message the graphic icon corresponding to the service application to be hidden from being displayed on the home page.

As an addition or an alternative in another example the service availability check can communicate with the service arrangement system via the service interface provided that the mobile computing device is network enabled and capable of communicating with the service arrangement system . In this example the service availability check can transmit a location query using the current location of the mobile computing device to the service arrangement system to determine if the location based service is available at the current location. The service arrangement system can provide availability information to the service availability check e.g. available or unavailable at the current location by accessing its database of predetermined geographic region s in which the location based service is available. Based on the availability information the service availability check can cause via an icon trigger command the presentation component from displaying or hiding the graphic icon corresponding to the service application on the home page. In this example the service arrangement system can connect or communicate with the service application to dynamically control the presentation of the graphic icon on the mobile computing device.

Although is described with the system executing the instructions for the location determination and the instructions for the service availability check in response to the mobile computing device being powered on or in response to the operating system being initiated on the mobile computing device in other examples the components of the service application can be run by the system in response to other triggering events. Other triggering events can include for example detecting a change in an operational state of the mobile computing device receiving a specific triggering communication from the service arrangement system over one or more networks or receiving a user input e.g. input when the user presses an input mechanism or turns on the display of the mobile device . For example a user can operate the mobile computing device in a particular operational state such as in a state where the cellular transceiver is operational but the short range transceiver s is turned off e.g. the Wi Fi transceiver and or Bluetooth transceiver is turned off or the programmatic components that communicate with such a transceiver are disabled in a state where the cellular transceiver is turned off e.g. also known as airplane mode in a state where the GPS receiver is turned off etc. When the mobile computing device changes operational states from a previous state to a current state e.g. the user changes the operational state by changing a setting on the mobile computing device the system can execute the instructions for the location determination and the instructions for the service availability check .

In another example the mobile computing device can operate in a particular operational state and automatically change states based on real time conditions e.g. without user input . Depending on cellular service provider settings signal quality or presence or lack thereof of cellular towers or base stations for example the mobile computing device can operate in any one of many different operational states e.g. a 4G cellular state a 3G cellular state an LTE cellular state a roaming state no cellular service state etc. . When the user moves and changes positions the mobile computing device may also change operational states. In such examples the system can detect the change in operational states and in response can execute the instructions for the location determination and the instructions for the service availability check .

Still further in one variation the triggering event can correspond to the system detecting a change from a first operational state to a second operational after the mobile computing device has operated in the first operational state for a predetermined amount of time e.g. thirty minutes one hour etc. . For example the user may be in a region where little or no cellular service is available for at least a predetermined amount of time. When the user travels to a different location and the mobile computing device changes operational states e.g. from a no cellular service state to a 4G or LTE cellular state the system can detect the change in operational states and in response execute the instructions for the location determination and the instructions for the service availability check . In the examples described depending on implementation in response to detecting a triggering event the system can dynamically cause the graphic icon corresponding to the service application to be displayed on or removed from the home page based on the current location of the mobile computing device e.g. the graphic icon can be hidden at a one instance in time while being displayed at another instance in time or vice versa .

As an addition or an alternative according to one example the service arrangement system can update the geography database of the service application by providing updated geography information via the service interface . An entity that operates the service arrangement system can expand the availability of the location based services to different locations e.g. make the location based service available for a user to request in a new city in which the location based service was previously unavailable and or remove location based services from previously available locations. The service arrangement system can manage update and store a master geography database of all locations and regions in which the location based service is available e.g. similar to the geography database of the service application . Because the information in the geography database may be outdated the service arrangement system can periodically or in response to updating its own master geography database provide updated geography information of locations where the location based service is available to the service application e.g. changes to the availability information between the master geography database and the geography database . In another example the service arrangement system can provide the updated geography information if any to the service application each time the service application or portions thereof is launched or executed.

In this manner if the user is in a location where the user would be unable to use the service application to request a location based service the system can automatically cause the graphic icon corresponding to the service application to be hidden so that the graphic icon is not displayed on a home page of the system . The user can be automatically made aware that the location based service is unavailable at the current location without the user having to launch or open the service application . On the other hand if the user is in a location where the user can use the service application to request a location based service the system can automatically cause the graphic icon to be displayed on the home page of the system .

The system can also include a plurality of applications such as Application Application Application N etc. one or more device interfaces such as described with respect to and a presentation component such as described with respect to . The plurality of applications can include native applications such as described with respect to and can include a designated service application that is used to communicate with a service arrangement system such as described in . For example Application can correspond to a service application that is configured to communicate with a location based service arrangement system such as the service arrangement system over one or more networks. Application when operated by a user of the mobile computing device can enable the user to request a location based service such as a transport service a delivery service a food ordering service etc. in connection with the service arrangement system provided that the location based service is available for use at a particular location or region.

The system can operate the location determination and then the service availability check in response to detecting one or more triggering events such as described with respect to . For example a triggering event can correspond to the mobile computing device being powered on from an off state or a power saving state or can correspond to the operating system being initiated on the mobile computing device. In response to detecting a triggering event the location determination can determine the current location of the mobile computing device by using or accessing one or more resources of the mobile computing device. Depending on implementation the location determination can receive location information corresponding to the current location from one or more transceivers of the mobile computing device and or from a GPS receiver of the mobile computing device via the one or more device interfaces . In another example an application e.g. Application which corresponds to a native location based application such as a weather application may have determined the current location of the mobile computing device by receiving the location information corresponding to the current location from a transceiver or a GPS receiver of the mobile computing device. The location determination can determine the current location by communicating with and receiving the location information from that application.

The location determination can provide the location information of the determined current location to the service availability check . The service availability check can use the location information to determine whether a location based service which can be requested by the user using Application is available for the user to request at the current location. According to one example the service availability check can access e.g. search the geography database of Application to determine if the current location corresponds to or is within a location or geographic region in which the location based service is available for use. Such a geography database can be identical or similar to the geography database as described in .

In another example the service availability check can use resources of Application to determine whether the location based service is available for the user to request at the current location. The service availability check can cause Application to communicate with the service arrangement system over one or more networks using preconfigured communication mechanisms. Application can transmit a location query using the location information of the current location. The location query can request the service arrangement system to check its internal or accessible geography database to determine whether the current location corresponds to or is within a location or geographic region in which the location based service is available for use. Application can receive availability information about whether the location based service is available or not from the service arrangement system and provide the availability information to the service availability check .

Depending on implementation the service availability check can be pre programmed to check one or more applications for location based service availability e.g. sequentially or concurrently . In one example the service availability check can be instructed to check any application that is identified or tagged as being a location based application e.g. one that uses location information or is identified as being an application whose operation is associated with a location or with a particular language associated with a geographic region. In another example the service availability check can include a list or database identifying one or more specific applications to check for service availability.

Based on the determination of whether the location based service is available or unavailable at the current location the service availability check can instruct the presentation component to display or hide the graphic icon of the corresponding application respectively. The service availability check can provide an icon trigger message to the presentation component to cause the presentation component to dynamically display or hide the graphic icon of Application . For example if the location based service is available for use at the current location the presentation component can be caused to display the graphic icon for Application . Such a graphic icon can be displayed with a home page user interface so that the user can select the graphic icon to run and operate Application . On the other hand if the location based service is unavailable for use at the current location the presentation component can be caused to hide the graphic icon so that the home page user interface can be displayed without the graphic icon.

While examples described with respect to refer to the system executing the instructions for the location determination and the instructions for the service availability check in response to detecting a triggering event in other examples as an addition or an alternative the system can execute the instructions for the location determination and the instructions for the service availability check periodically.

For illustrative purposes a variety of use case examples are described with respect to and or . In one example the system and or the system can also provide a notification that is displayed on the display of the mobile computing device when the graphic icon corresponding to the service application is to be displayed from a previous hidden state or hidden from a previous displayed state. Such a notification can inform the user that the location based service is unavailable or available when such a change is determined by the service application check or the service application check . According to some examples the notification that is displayed when the graphic icon is displayed or is to be displayed can also include promotional content that enables the user to receive a cost benefit with regards to the location based service e.g. a promotional code or text string .

In another example the service arrangement system can store information about individual different locations regions in which the location based service is available along with a time parameter in a geography database e.g. the master geography database and or the geography database in the service application . Such a time parameter can correspond to a starting instance in time e.g. a date and or a time or a duration of time e.g. six months in which a location based service is available at a particular location or geographic region. For example the location based service may not yet be available at a particular city at a current instance in time but may be available at a later time e.g. may be available three months later . The entity that implements and controls the service arrangement system may plan on the location based service to be available at different locations in the future. A geography database associated with the service application can include availability information about a particular location or region along with time information. In such an example the service application check or the service application check can determine if the current location is at an available location or within an available region and can also determine if the current time corresponds to a time when the location based service is available. If the user is operating in a location where the location based service is not yet available but will be available the system and or the system can hide the graphic icon corresponding to the service application until a time when the location based service becomes available. Once that time passes the next time the location determination and the service availability check is executed the system and or the system can cause the graphic icon to be displayed on the home page.

In an example in which the system and or the system is implemented on a service provider s mobile computing device or on a vehicle computer device and the service application is pre stored or pre installed on such device the system and or the system can operate to determine the current location of the mobile computing device and to determine whether the location based service is available at the current location. Availability for a service provider can be correspond to whether the service provider can receive invitations for providing location based services from the service arrangement system at the current location. For example due to regulations or due to business reasons a location based service may not be allowed or available in a particular city so that when a service provider is in the particular city the service provider may not receive invitations from the service arrangement system. In such case if the system and or the system determines that the location based service is unavailable for the service provider at the current location the system and or the system can cause the graphic icon corresponding to the service application to be hidden from being displayed on the home page of the device.

As an addition or an alternative the system and or the system can communicate with the service arrangement system and receive position information of those users operating the user service applications on their respective devices within a predetermined distance from the current location of the service provider. If no users are operating the user service applications within the predetermined distance the system and or the system can cause the graphic icon corresponding to the service application to be hidden from display or cause the graphic icon to be inoperable e.g. so that the service provider cannot select the graphic icon to launch the service application .

According to another use case example the service application can enable a user to order and purchase goods such as food or merchandise for pickup at or delivery from a particular restaurant or store. The service application can store a geography database that stores information about restaurant or store locations and or communicate with the corresponding service arrangement system that stores such information. The system and or the system can determine the current location of the mobile computing device e.g. periodically or in response to a triggering event and can determine whether a physical location of a restaurant or store associated with the service arrangement system is within a predetermined distance of or predetermined travel time from the current location. If there restaurant or store is not within the predetermined distance e.g. twenty miles of the current location of the user the system and or the system can hide the graphic icon corresponding to the service application.

Depending on implementation in other examples the service arrangement system can also dynamically cause the system and or the system to display or hide the graphic icon corresponding to the service application by transmitting control signals over the one or more networks. For example in some instances the service arrangement system may want to prevent a group of users such as a group of users in a particular location from being able to make a request for the location based system. In such case the service arrangement system can access a user database and identify users that last used the service application in a particular geographic region. Using the mobile device identifier ID or user ID of the individual identified users in the group the service arrangement system can transmit a command to cause the respective service applications to hide the corresponding graphic icon from being displayed on the home page of the mobile computing device.

Still further in one example a service application can interface with another application e.g. a native weather application stored on the mobile computing device or can be integrated with at least in part another application. As an addition or an alternative the native application can also interface with the service arrangement system e.g. via a software development kit or API . A native weather application for example can be launched or operated e.g. automatically launched as part of the boot up process by the system and or the system . After being launched or as part of the process of being launched the weather application can communicate with a GPS receiver or a transceiver to determine the current location of the mobile computing device. In one use case example the weather application can communicate information about the current location to the service arrangement system to determine whether the location based service is available at the current location. The weather application can then cause the system and or the system to hide the graphic icon corresponding to the service application from being displayed on the home page if the location based service is unavailable at the current location. In one variation the weather application can cause the system and or the system to uninstall or delete the service application. If the location based service is available at the current location the weather application can cause the graphic icon to be displayed on the home page.

In the example of a service application such as described with respect to can be stored e.g. pre stored or pre installed in a memory of the mobile computing device. Referring to a system that is implemented on a mobile computing device can detect a triggering event on the mobile computing device . The triggering event can correspond to for example the mobile computing device being powered on from an off state or a suspended state or being powered on from a suspended state after the device has been in the suspended state for a predetermined duration of time . In another example the triggering event can correspond to a change in an operational setting of the mobile computing device . The change can be an automatic change as a result of current conditions or can be a change in response to user input.

In response to detecting a triggering event the system can determine the current location of the mobile computing device . In the example in which the triggering event corresponds to the mobile computing device being powered on e.g. for the first time by the user after purchasing the device the system can be initiated as part of a boot up process. As part of the boot up process the operating system of the mobile computing device can be initiated. The system can execute instructions to determine the current location of the mobile computing device. Depending on implementation the instructions can be a part of a set of instructions corresponding to the operating system or can be a part of a set of instructions corresponding to a service application associated with a service arrangement system.

The system can determine the current location of the mobile computing device using one or more different resources or operations. For example the system can determine the current location by communicating with another application that is operated on the mobile computing device . In such an example a native application of the mobile computing device can be executed to determine the current location of the mobile computing device for use with the native application. The service application for example can interface with the native application to determine the current location without having to make a call to one or more resources of the mobile computing device. In another example the system can determine the current location by communicating with a GPS receiver of the mobile computing device by communicating with a cellular transceiver or radio of the mobile computing device or by communicating with another transceiver such as a short range wireless transceiver of the mobile computing device . For example a WLAN transceiver can determine the current location using Wi Fi triangulation methods. In another example the system can determine the current location using magnetic field data as fingerprints for localization e.g. in conjunction with using other resources of the mobile computing device . The current location can correspond to a location data point e.g. a latitude and a longitude coordinate a city block a city name a zip code a state a country etc. based on the means used to determine the current location.

The system can then determine if a location based service e.g. a transport service a delivery service a food service etc. which can be requested by a user operating the service application on the mobile computing device is available for use at the current location . In one example the system can access a geography database of the service application that stores information about locations or geographic regions in which the location based service is available. In another example the system can communicate with via the service application the corresponding service arrangement system to provide a location query using the current location and to receive availability information regarding the current location. If the location based service is unavailable at the current location the system can cause a graphic icon corresponding to the service application which would otherwise be displayed on a home page on a display of the mobile computing device to be hidden so that the graphic icon is not displayed with the home page . The home page can then be displayed accordingly .

For example referring to if the location based service is unavailable at the current location a home page or launch user interface is displayed on a display of the mobile computing device with the graphic icon corresponding to the service application being hidden from view e.g. the graphic icon with the star can correspond to the service application as seen in is not shown in . The home page can include a layout having a plurality of graphic icons corresponding to a plurality of other applications that are stored on the mobile computing device. The home page can also include a set of graphic icons in a separate region of the layout e.g. the application tray region that are always displayed in examples where individual home pages of multiple home pages can be displayed in response to user input e.g. a swipe gesture on a touch sensitive display of the mobile computing device .

On the other hand if the location based service is available at the current location the system can cause the graphic icon e.g. the graphic icon to be included in the home page and can display the home page on the display accordingly such as illustrated in . In the home page can include the graphic icon at the end or bottom of the group if displayed icons . However in another example the system can display the graphic icon at a different position such as shown in the home page of . Still further in other examples the system can cause the graphic icon to be displayed in the application tray region of the home page of the mobile computing device.

For example if the user was previously at a location in which the location based service was available at a first instance in time the graphic icon may have been included in the home page . The user may have positioned the graphic icon at the particular position as illustrated in . Such data about the position of the graphic icon specified by the user can be stored in the system e.g. the presentation component . If the user then moved to a location in which the location based service was unavailable at a second subsequent instance in time the system may have dynamically adjusted the content of the home page so that the graphic icon was no longer displayed such as the home page illustrated in . At a third subsequent instance in time if the user again moved to a location in which the location based service was available the system e.g. the presentation component may access the previously stored data about the positions of the graphic icons and display the graphic icon at the position previously specified by the user as illustrated in .

As an addition or an alternative in one example if the location based service is unavailable at the current location the system can display the graphic icon but make the graphic icon not selectable by the user e.g. make the graphic icon inoperable . Typically the graphic icon when displayed can be selectable so that selection of the icon by user input causes the system to launch or open and display the corresponding application. By making the graphic icon not selectable by user input the user can be prevented from launching or opening the service application when the location based service is unavailable at the user s current location.

Still further according to some examples the system can determine whether the user of the mobile computing device has previously used or operated the service application or has previously made a request for and or received a location based service using the service application . The service application and or the system can store data about the user such as a user profile that includes user and or device information and store data about whether the user has previously used the service application. In such an example when the system determines that a location based service is unavailable at the current location of the mobile computing device the system can also check the data in the service application to determine whether the user has previously used the service application. If the user has used the service application before the system can enable the graphic icon corresponding to the service application to be displayed on the home page despite the location based service being unavailable. As an addition or an alternative the system can cause the graphic icon to be inoperable. If the user has not used the service application before the system can cause the graphic icon to be hidden from view.

Referring to the system can determine the current location of a mobile computing device . The system can determine the current location in response to detecting a triggering event such as described with respect to . In one example the system can launch and run a weather application such as a native weather application which can determine the current location by receiving the location information from a GPS receiver or a transceiver of the mobile computing device. In the example described in the weather application can interface with a service application and or communicate with a service arrangement system such as described in or the service application can be integrated in part with the weather application.

The weather application can then determine the current weather at the current location and or the forecasted weather for a predetermined duration at the current location . For example the forecasted weather can be for a time period e.g. one hour three hours eight hours etc. starting from the current instance in time or a time period starting at a later instance in time. The weather application can communicate with a remote network source to determine the current weather and or the forecasted weather by making a query or call using the current location.

The weather application can determine whether the current weather and or the forecasted weather corresponds to one of a plurality of predetermined weather types . In this example a predetermined weather type may correspond to rain showers snow hail etc. or a threshold percentage chance of such weather types e.g. weather types that would require a user to use the location based service such as transport service food service delivery service etc. . If the current weather and or the forecasted weather corresponds to one of the predetermined weather types the weather application can display a notification or a message on a display of the mobile computing device .

The notification can instruct or notify the user to use the service application to request a location based service or to use the service application at a later time if the user plans to travel. In another example the notification can also instruct the user to download the service application if the service application is not yet downloaded or installed on the mobile computing device or provide promotional information that enables the user to receive a cost benefit with regards to ordering the location based service. In one example the weather application can display the notification provided that the location based service is available at the current location e.g. previously determined by the system . Referring back to if the current weather and or the forecasted weather does not correspond to one of the predetermined weather types the process can end until the next iteration of the method described in begins .

The processor can provide a variety of content to the display by executing instructions stored in the memory resources . The memory resources can store instructions for running the boot loader instructions corresponding to the operating system and one or more applications. For example the processor is configured with software and or other logic to perform one or more processes steps and other functions described with implementations such as described by and elsewhere in the application. In particular the processor can execute instructions and data stored in the memory resources in order to determine the current location of the mobile computing device and determine if a location based service is available for use at the current location as described in . Such instructions can be a part of a set of instructions corresponding to the operating system or can be a part of a set of instructions corresponding to a service application that can be used to make requests for location based services. The processor can also execute instructions for presenting a home page user interface user interface that includes a plurality of graphic icons corresponding to a plurality of stored application. Depending on whether the location based service is available for use at the current location the processor can cause the graphic icon corresponding to the service application to be displayed with or hidden from the user interface .

In one example the computing device can determine a location data point of the current location of the computing device from the GPS component . In another example the computing device can determine the current location by using one or more transceivers or a GPS receiver of the communications sub systems . While is illustrated for a mobile computing device one or more examples may be implemented on other types of devices including full functional computers such as laptops and desktops e.g. PC .
