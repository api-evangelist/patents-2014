title: Variable user interface based on document access privileges
abstract: Users may be presented with different viewing interfaces for a document based on a combination of factors relating to display rights possessed for the document and user specific information. In one implementation, the user's location is used to determine portions of the document that can be displayed to the user. More particularly, access privileges to a document for a user are determined based on geographical location information of the user and based on access rights possessed for the document. Portions of the document may then be formatted for display to the user based on the determined access privileges.

Systems and methods described herein relate to data formatting and presentation and more particularly to techniques for presenting textual and graphical material.

Modern computer networks and in particular the Internet have made large bodies of information widely and easily available. Free Internet search engines for instance index many millions of web documents that are linked to the Internet. A user connected to the Internet can enter a simple search query to quickly locate web documents relevant to the search query.

One category of content that is not widely available on the Internet however are the more traditional printed works of authorship such as books and magazines. Before presenting this type of digital content to users the content may first be scanned using an optical scanner. Once scanned optical character recognition OCR may be used to convert text in the scanned digital images of the pages of the content to a searchable digital form.

When transmitting the scanned OCR ed version of the content e.g. books or magazines to users the content provider may only be able to lawfully provide certain portions of the content to the users. For example the content provider may provide certain books that are in the public domain and other documents for which the content provider does not have full legal rights. Accordingly the portions of the book that the content provider chooses to provide to the users may vary.

According to one aspect a method includes determining access privileges to a document for a user based on geographical location information of the user and based on access rights possessed for the document. The method further includes formatting portions of the document for display to the user based on the determined access privileges and transmitting the formatted portions of the document to the user.

According to another aspect a method includes receiving a request for a document from a user receiving information relating to the user and determining viewable portions of the document as governed by copyright laws based on the information relating to the user. The method further includes making available the viewable portions of the document to the user.

According to yet another aspect a system includes a search engine configured to receive search queries and return links to documents relevant to the search queries. The system further includes a document browsing component configured to in response to requests for one or more of the documents relevant to the search query determine access privileges to the one or more of the documents on a per user basis based on geographical location information of the user. The document browsing component additionally transmits portions of the one or more of the documents permitted by the determined access privileges to the user.

The following detailed description of the invention refers to the accompanying drawings. The detailed description does not limit the invention.

The ability to make the documents in database available to the end users may be limited by the display rights possessed by the content provider i.e. the operator of database . Copyright laws business choices or contractual restrictions may limit what is desired to be provided to the end users. The portions of the documents in database that can be shown to a particular end user may be determined based on a number of factors such as 1 the location of the user e.g. users in different countries legal jurisdictions may be subject to different copyright requirements 2 the permissions that the content provider has for the document being requested 3 the type of content and 4 the user s security status or state e.g. whether the user is a registered user of a particular web site or a member of a particular group .

Consistent with aspects of the invention users may be presented with different viewing interfaces each designed to present the available portions of the document such as the portions determined based on the above listed factors. The intersection of these factors can be conceptualized as permission matrix . The output of permission matrix defines the spectrum of display rights available to the particular user. For a public domain document for example the display rights may be full display indicating that the entire document can be shown to the users. Other document end user combinations may correspond to a lower level of display rights down to as low as restricted viewing which may correspond to a minimum viewing permission.

A client may include a device such as a wireless telephone a personal computer a personal digital assistant PDA a lap top or another type of computation or communication device a thread or process running on one of these devices and or an object executable by one of these devices. Server may include a server device that processes searches and or maintains documents and images in a manner consistent with the principles of the invention. Clients and server may connect to network via wired wireless or optical connections.

Server may include a document browsing component that transmits images corresponding to documents such as image pages of books magazines or catalogs to clients . In addition to transmitting images of the pages of the documents document browsing component may provide information representing the text contained on the pages such as ASCII text characters corresponding to the documents pages. These documents may be gathered by document browsing component in a number of ways such as by optically scanning the documents or by receiving the documents from a third party etc.

In one implementation document browsing component may include or be coupled with a search engine that allows clients to search a database of the documents via textual search queries.

Processor may include conventional processors microprocessors or processing logic that interpret and execute instructions. Main memory may include a random access memory RAM or another type of dynamic storage device that stores information and instructions for execution by processor . ROM may include a conventional ROM device or another type of static storage device that stores static information and instructions for use by processor . Storage device may include a magnetic and or optical recording medium and its corresponding drive.

Input device may include one or more conventional mechanisms that permit a user to input information to client server such as a keyboard a mouse a pen voice recognition and or biometric mechanisms etc. Output device may include one or more conventional mechanisms that output information to the user including a display a printer a speaker etc. Communication interface may include any transceiver like mechanism that enables client server to communicate with other devices and or systems. For example communication interface may include mechanisms for communicating with another device or system via a network such as network .

Server consistent with the principles of the invention may implement additional document browsing component . Document browsing component may be stored in a computer readable medium such as memory . A computer readable medium may be defined as one or more physical or logical memory devices and or carrier waves.

The software instructions defining document browsing component may be read into memory from another computer readable medium such as data storage device or from another device via communication interface . The software instructions contained in memory may cause processor to perform processes that will be described later. Alternatively hardwired circuitry or other logic may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement processes consistent with the invention. Thus implementations consistent with the principles of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software. Additionally multiple computing devices may function together to implement the functionality of a single server or document browsing component .

As mentioned database may store documents and information related to the documents. is a diagram illustrating portions of an exemplary document stored in database . The information defining document may include images of pages of the document text of the document and metadata relating to the document. In some implementations images or text may not be present. That is a document may include either page images or text .

Images may include images of the pages of the document. By storing images users wishing to view the document can see the document in the form that the document was originally printed. The images may be obtained for example by optically scanning each page of the document or by obtaining the images from the publisher author or another source.

Text may include the text in document in a machine readable format. For example text may include an ASCII American Standard Code for Information Interchange representation of the text of document . Text may be obtained in a number of ways such as by performing OCR on images by manually typing the text of the document or by obtaining the text from the publisher author or another source.

Metadata may include additional information relating to document . For example metadata may include publisher information the ISBN of document when document is a document such as a book that has an ISBN summary information describing document links to additional information about document such as Web links etc. Consistent with an aspect of the invention metadata may include information relating to access rights associated with or possessed for document .

More generally metadata may include additional information relating to display rights granted from the publisher content source to the content provider. Examples of such additional information include an indication of whether images or photos should be blocked in documents a list of domains from which advertisements should not be used a reference to a logo or link that should be displayed with the document whether advertisements should be displayed information defining a buy the book link from which the user can purchase a copy of the document or information defining a link to promotional material. This additional information may be used when formatting the document for presentation to the user.

Additionally different display standards may be applied to readers in different geographies. For instance both readers in Canada and the United States may have display ability based on legal or other criteria but the limited display ability in the two countries may be different. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the various display types available to the users in different locations can be specified for a particular document or a group of documents in a number of different ways. Storing the access rights which translate into display types in fields and as described above is one exemplary technique.

User information may be determined act . In one implementation the user information may include the location of the user. The user s location may be determined based on the Internet Protocol IP address associated with the user. Alternately the domain that is being browsed may be used to determine the location. Information other than or in addition to the user location may also be used as user information. For example whether the user accepts cookies may be determined and included as part of the user information. Other user security or state information may also be used. For example registered users that have successfully logged on may be eligible to view different portions of a document than non registered users.

The access rights associated with the document may also be retrieved act . As previously discussed the access rights may be stored as metadata in database . Based on the user information and the access rights associated with the document decision component may determine what portions of the document are eligible to be shown to the particular user act . The user information and the access rights associated with the document may be thought of as forming permission matrix which defines the access privileges that can be granted to the user for the requested document. In some implementations the content of the document itself may be taken into consideration when determining the access privileges that can be granted to the user. For example fair use display for a book may be chosen to be a number of paragraphs or pages of text while the fair use display for a short poem may be chosen to be only a line or two from the poem.

The portions of the document that can be shown to the user may then be appropriately formatted and transmitted to the user acts and . This formatting can be performed in a number of ways. For example for a given document multiple versions of the document each including a select subset of the document may be pre formatted and stored. The appropriate version may then be selected and transmitted to the user in acts and . Alternatively the formatting can be performed on the fly. The formatting can for instance be a smart formatting in which portions of the document that are most relevant to the user such as portions that include terms of a search query are selected and formatted for presentation to the user.

In some implementations photographs contained in the documents may be given special attention when formatting and transmitting the documents to the user. For example the content source of the document may give permission to display the text of a document but not photographs in the document. The photographs may be individually obscured or deleted from the document.

One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that partial access for a document can be provided in numerous ways in addition to that shown in . For example in a specified time period e.g. 24 hours the user may only be permitted to view a certain portion e.g. 10 of the document only pre designated portions of the document may be viewable the document may be stamped or watermarked with lettering such as copyrighted etc. Different partial access interfaces may be presented to different users based on their location other user specific information and based on access privileges for the requested document.

The exemplary interfaces shown in illustrate an exemplary spectrum of possible document access privileges that may be granted to a user based on user specific information and general access rights of the document. Although three discrete steps in the spectrum were shown in general the spectrum of possible access rights can be conceptualized as a continuous one ranging from full access to restricted or no access.

The user may select one of the returned document links for viewing. In response document browsing component may perform the acts described with regard to to thus allow the user to view the requested document to the extent permitted by the user s information and by the access privileges corresponding to the requested document.

Various techniques as described above are used to present different user interfaces to documents based on the access privileges determined for the documents.

It will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that aspects of the invention as described above may be implemented in many different forms of software firmware and hardware in the implementations illustrated in the figures. The actual software code or specialized control hardware used to implement aspects consistent with the present invention is not limiting of the present invention. Thus the operation and behavior of the aspects were described without reference to the specific software code it being understood that a person of ordinary skill in the art would be able to design software and control hardware to implement the aspects based on the description herein.

The foregoing description of preferred embodiments of the present invention provides illustration and description but is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teachings or may be acquired from practice of the invention. For example although many of the operations described above were described in a particular order many of the operations are amenable to being performed simultaneously or in different orders. Also the graphical user interfaces shown above are exemplary. Other graphical designs or layouts could be used to accomplish same or like functionality.

No element act or instruction used in the present application should be construed as critical or essential to the invention unless explicitly described as such. Also as used herein the article a is intended to potentially allow for one or more items. Where only one item is intended the term one or similar language is used. Further the phrase based on is intended to mean based at least in part on unless explicitly stated otherwise. The scope of the invention is defined by the claims and their equivalents.
