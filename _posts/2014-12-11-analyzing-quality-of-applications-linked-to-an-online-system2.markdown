title: Analyzing quality of applications linked to an online system
abstract: An online system extracts features from an application linked to the online system. The application is used by users of the online system and posts content to the online system. A trained model is applied to the extracted features to generate a quality score for the application. The trained model is trained using features extracted from a set of training applications and quality scores manually assigned to the training applications, wherein the manually assigned quality scores indicate whether each training application satisfies a set of criteria and the generated quality score represents a probability of the application satisfying the set of criteria. Based on the quality score, content provided by the application is ranked for presentation to a user of the online system in relation to other content of the online system. The online system presents the content provided by the application to the user according to the ranking.

This disclosure relates generally to applications linked to online systems and in particular to determining quality of the applications and presenting content associated with the applications to users of the online system according to the quality of the applications.

Application providers often integrate their applications with larger online systems to leverage information of the online system and increase visibility of the application. Integration with an online system may also enable the application to provide additional services or functions that are not available in the application alone. The online systems benefit from the integrated applications as the applications may increase user traffic to the online systems and improve user engagement with the online system.

Users of the online system are more likely to engage with high quality content in the online system than low quality content. To improve the likelihood that a user will find high quality content associated with applications and continue to engage with both the online system and the applications integrated with the online system it is beneficial for the online system to verify that an application has a sufficiently high quality before allowing the application to post content to the online system.

An online system such as a social networking system generates quality scores for applications linked to the online system to present content associated with high quality applications to users of the online system. Applications linked to the online system are used by users of the online system and post content to the online system such as content identifying actions taken by the users when using the applications. To generate a quality score for an application linked to the online system the online system extracts features from the application. A trained model is applied to the extracted features which assigns a quality score to the application.

To obtain the trained model the online system receives quality scores manually assigned to a training set of applications by human reviewers. The human reviewers assign the quality scores to the applications by rating the applications across a plurality of dimensions defining criteria for a quality application. For example the reviewers rate the applications according to navigability non triviality novelty and quality of content generated by the applications. The online system trains the model using features extracted from the training applications and the manually assigned quality scores to predict a probability of an application satisfying the quality criteria. In one embodiment the manually assigned quality scores are binary and indicate whether an application satisfies all of the quality criteria. In this case the quality score generated by applying the trained model to features extracted from an application represents a probability that the application satisfies all of the quality criteria. The trained model may alternatively predict for each dimension a probability of the application satisfying the criteria associated with the dimension and generate a quality score for the application based on the determined probabilities.

The online system uses the quality score to rank content provided by the application in relation to other content of the online system for presentation to a user of the online system. The content provided by the application is presented to the user according to the ranking. In one embodiment the online system presents application content to the user as one or more stories in a newsfeed. The position of the application content in the newsfeed may depend on the quality score of the application. For example if an application has a quality score below a threshold the online system presents content associated with the application at a lower frequency in the newsfeed or at a lower position in the newsfeed than other content of the online system.

The figures depict various embodiments of the present invention for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention described herein.

The client devices are one or more computing devices capable of receiving user input as well as transmitting and or receiving data via the network . In one embodiment a client device is a conventional computer system such as a desktop or laptop computer. Alternatively a client device may be a device having computer functionality such as a personal digital assistant PDA a mobile telephone a smartphone or another suitable device. A client device is configured to communicate via the network . In one embodiment a client device executes an application allowing a user of the client device to interact with the social networking system . For example a client device executes a browser application to enable interaction between the client device and the social networking system via the network . In another embodiment a client device interacts with the social networking system through an application programming interface API running on a native operating system of the client device such as IOS or ANDROID .

The client devices are configured to communicate via the network which may comprise any combination of local area and or wide area networks using both wired and or wireless communication systems. In one embodiment the network uses standard communications technologies and or protocols. For example the network includes communication links using technologies such as Ethernet 802.11 worldwide interoperability for microwave access WiMAX 3G 4G code division multiple access CDMA digital subscriber line DSL etc. Examples of networking protocols used for communicating via the network include multiprotocol label switching MPLS transmission control protocol Internet protocol TCP IP hypertext transport protocol HTTP simple mail transfer protocol SMTP and file transfer protocol FTP . Data exchanged over the network may be represented using any suitable format such as hypertext markup language HTML or extensible markup language XML . In some embodiments all or some of the communication links of the network may be encrypted using any suitable technique or techniques.

One or more third party systems may be coupled to the network for communicating with the social networking system which is further described below in conjunction with . In one embodiment a third party system is an application provider communicating information describing applications for execution by a client device or communicating data to client devices for use by an application executing on the client device. In other embodiments a third party system provides content or other information for presentation via a client device . A third party website may also communicate information to the social networking system such as advertisements content or information about an application provided by the third party website .

Each user of the social networking system is associated with a user profile which is stored in the user profile store . A user profile includes declarative information about the user that was explicitly shared by the user and may also include profile information inferred by the social networking system . In one embodiment a user profile includes multiple data fields each describing one or more attributes of the corresponding user of the social networking system . Examples of information stored in a user profile include biographic demographic and other types of descriptive information such as work experience educational history gender hobbies or preferences location and the like. A user profile may also store other information provided by the user for example images or videos. In certain embodiments images of users may be tagged with identification information of users of the social networking system displayed in an image. A user profile in the user profile store may also maintain references to actions by the corresponding user performed on content items in the content store and stored in the action log .

While user profiles in the user profile store are frequently associated with individuals allowing individuals to interact with each other via the social networking system user profiles may also be stored for entities such as businesses or organizations. This allows an entity to establish a presence on the social networking system for connecting and exchanging content with other social networking system users. The entity may post information about itself about its products or provide other information to users of the social networking system using a brand page associated with the entity s user profile. Other users of the social networking system may connect to the brand page to receive information posted to the brand page or to receive information from the brand page. A user profile associated with the brand page may include information about the entity itself providing users with background or informational data about the entity.

The content store stores objects that each represent various types of content. Examples of content represented by an object include a page post a status update a photograph a video a link a shared content item a gaming application achievement a check in event at a local business a brand page or any other type of content. Social networking system users may create objects stored by the content store such as status updates photos tagged by users to be associated with other objects in the social networking system events groups or applications. In some embodiments objects are received from third party applications or third party applications separate from the social networking system . In one embodiment objects in the content store represent single pieces of content or content items. Hence users of the social networking system are encouraged to communicate with each other by posting text and content items of various types of media through various communication channels. This increases the amount of interaction of users with each other and increases the frequency with which users interact within the social networking system .

In one embodiment the content store also stores recommendation units. The social networking system provides one or more recommendation units to its users to increase user interaction with the social networking system. A recommendation unit suggests one or more actions a user viewing the recommendation unit a viewing user to increase the viewing user s interaction with the social networking system . For example a recommendation unit provides a suggestion for the viewing user to establish a connection with another user as well as a link enabling the user to do so. In other examples a recommendation unit encourages the viewing user to invite a friend to an event identify a friend in a photo join a group begin using an application or perform another suitable action with the social networking system. Each recommendation unit is associated with a score based on a value of the viewing user interacting with the recommendation unit i.e. converting the recommendation unit by performing the recommended action and or on the likelihood that the viewing user will convert the recommendation unit. The score may be based on prior interaction with recommendation units by the viewing user other users to whom the viewing user is connected a probability of the viewing user interacting with the recommendation unit or other criteria. Determination of a score for a recommendation unit is further described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 549 080 filed on Jul. 13 2012 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The social networking system selects one or more recommendation units to send to a user based at least in part on this score.

The action logger receives communications about user actions internal to and or external to the social networking system populating the action log with information about user actions. Examples of actions include adding a connection to another user sending a message to another user uploading an image reading a message from another user viewing content associated with another user attending an event posted by another user among others. In addition a number of actions may involve an object and one or more particular users so these actions are associated with those users as well and stored in the action log .

The action log may be used by the social networking system to track user actions on the social networking system as well as actions on third party systems that communicate information to the social networking system . Users may interact with various objects on the social networking system and information describing these interactions are stored in the action log . Examples of interactions with objects include commenting on posts sharing links and checking in to physical locations via a mobile device accessing content items and any other interactions. Additional examples of interactions with objects on the social networking system that are included in the action log include commenting on a photo album communicating with a user establishing a connection with an object joining an event to a calendar joining a group creating an event authorizing an application using an application expressing a preference for an object liking the object and engaging in a transaction. Additionally the action log may record a user s interactions with advertisements on the social networking system as well as with other applications operating on the social networking system . In some embodiments data from the action log is used to infer interests or preferences of a user augmenting the interests included in the user s user profile and allowing a more complete understanding of user preferences.

The action log may also store user actions taken on a third party system such as an external website and communicated to the social networking system . For example an e commerce website that primarily sells sporting equipment at bargain prices may recognize a user of a social networking system through a social plug in enabling the e commerce website to identify the user of the social networking system . Because users of the social networking system are uniquely identifiable e commerce websites such as this sporting equipment retailer may communicate information about a user s actions outside of the social networking system to the social networking system for association with the user. Hence the action log may record information about actions users perform on a third party system including webpage viewing histories advertisements that were engaged purchases made and other patterns from shopping and buying.

In one embodiment an edge store stores information describing connections between users and other objects on the social networking system as edges. Some edges may be defined by users allowing users to specify their relationships with other users. For example users may generate edges with other users that parallel the users real life relationships such as friends co workers partners and so forth. Other edges are generated when users interact with objects in the social networking system such as expressing interest in a page on the social networking system sharing a link with other users of the social networking system and commenting on posts made by other users of the social networking system.

In one embodiment an edge may include various features each representing characteristics of interactions between users interactions between users and object or interactions between objects. For example features included in an edge describe rate of interaction between two users how recently two users have interacted with each other the rate or amount of information retrieved by one user about an object or the number and types of comments posted by a user about an object. The features may also represent information describing a particular object or user. For example a feature may represent the level of interest that a user has in a particular topic the rate at which the user logs into the social networking system or information describing demographic information about a user. Each feature may be associated with a source object or user a target object or user and a feature value. A feature may be specified as an expression based on values describing the source object or user the target object or user or interactions between the source object or user and target object or user hence an edge may be represented as one or more feature expressions.

The edge store also stores information about edges such as affinity scores for objects interests and other users. Affinity scores or affinities may be computed by the social networking system over time to approximate a user s affinity for an object interest and other users in the social networking system based on the actions performed by the user. A user s affinity may be computed by the social networking system over time to approximate a user s affinity for an object interest and other users in the social networking system based on the actions performed by the user. Computation of affinity is further described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 978 265 filed on Dec. 23 2010 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 690 254 filed on Nov. 30 2012 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 689 969 filed on Nov. 30 2012 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 690 088 filed on Nov. 30 2012 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Multiple interactions between a user and a specific object may be stored as a single edge in the edge store in one embodiment. Alternatively each interaction between a user and a specific object is stored as a separate edge. In some embodiments connections between users may be stored in the user profile store or the user profile store may access the edge store to determine connections between users.

In one embodiment applications provided by the social networking system or the third party systems are made available to users through the social networking system . The applications may use information in the user profile store the action log and the edge store to provide a service or functionality to a user of the social networking system . For example an application is software that can be installed on a user s client device and uses data from the social networking system to provide a service or functionality to the user. Other applications are web based applications made available to the users of the social networking system over the network . To use some or all of the functions provided by the application the user may explicitly grant the application access to data of the social networking system . The applications may also post content to the social networking system describing actions performed by users of the social networking system in relation to the applications. In some cases applications may operate independently of the social networking system but provide additional functionality to users who allow the application access to the users respective user profiles or other data stored at the social networking system . For example providing an application with access to a user profile enables the user to share content from the application with the user s connections via the social networking system .

The application scoring module analyzes quality of applications linked to the social networking system . To assess the quality of an application the application scoring module extracts features from the application such as user feedback on the application number of users who viewed information about the application number of users who granted permissions to the application to access data from the social networking system profit value of the application and any information provided by the developer of the application e.g. a configuration of the application . A subset of the applications linked to the social networking system are selected as a training set of applications and quality scores are manually assigned to the applications in the training set.

Using features extracted from the applications in the training set and the manually assigned quality scores the application scoring module trains a model for assigning quality scores to applications linked to the social networking system . The trained model is then applied to features extracted from other applications linked to the social networking system to assign quality scores to the other applications. In one embodiment the application scoring module uses the quality score to rank content associated with the applications in relation to other content of the social networking system including content posted by other applications and content posted by users of the social networking system . By ranking the application content relative to other content the application scoring module enables the social networking system to select content associated with high quality applications for presentation to a user. The application scoring module or other modules of the social networking system may alternatively use the quality scores of applications to select applications to recommend to users of the social networking system select applications to appear in an application center or store featured in the social networking system or flag applications for policy compliance review. For example if an application has a quality score below a specified threshold the application is flagged as being likely to violate one or more policies of the social networking system and is sent to a policy compliance reviewer.

In one embodiment the social networking system identifies stories likely to be of interest to a user through a newsfeed presented to the user. A story presented to a user describes an action taken by an additional user connected to the user and identifies the additional user. For example some stories presented to users of the social networking system describe an action taken by an additional user using a third party application. In some embodiments a story describing an action performed by a user may be accessible to users not connected to the user that performed the action. The newsfeed manager may generate stories for presentation to a user based on information in the action log and in edge store or may select candidate stories included in content store . One or more of the candidate stories are selected and presented to a user by the newsfeed manager .

For example the newsfeed manager receives a request to present one or more stories to a social networking system user. The newsfeed manager accesses one or more of the user profile store the content store the action log and the edge store to retrieve information about the identified user. For example stories or other data associated with users connected to the identified user are retrieved. The retrieved stories or other data is analyzed by the newsfeed manager to identify content likely to be relevant to the identified user. For example stories associated with users not connected to the identified user or stories associated with users for which the identified user has less than a threshold affinity are discarded as candidate stories. Based on various criteria the newsfeed manager selects one or more of the candidate stories for presentation to the identified user.

In various embodiments the newsfeed manager presents stories to a user through a newsfeed which includes a plurality of stories selected for presentation to the user. The newsfeed may include a limited number of stories or may include a complete set of candidate stories. The number of stories included in a newsfeed may be determined in part by a user preference included in user profile store . The newsfeed manager may also determine the order in which selected stories are presented via the newsfeed. For example the newsfeed manager determines that a user has a highest affinity for a specific user and increases the number of stories in the newsfeed associated with the specific user or modifies the positions in the newsfeed where stories associated with the specific user are presented.

The newsfeed manager may also account for actions by a user indicating a preference for types of stories and selects stories having the same or similar types for inclusion in the newsfeed. Additionally newsfeed manager may analyze stories received by social networking system from various users and obtains information about user preferences or actions from the analyzed stories. This information may be used to refine subsequent selection of stories for newsfeeds presented to various users.

In one embodiment the newsfeed manager uses quality scores of applications linked to the social networking system to select stories associated with the applications for inclusion in the newsfeed. For example if the quality score of an application is below a specified threshold value the newsfeed manager presents a story associated with the application at a lower position in the newsfeed than stories associated with other content of the social networking system . As another example the newsfeed manager selects stories associated with an application having a below threshold quality score less frequently than stories associated with other content of the social networking system for inclusion in the newsfeed.

The web server links the social networking system via the network to the one or more client devices as well as to the one or more third party systems . The web server serves web pages as well as other web related content such as JAVA FLASH XML and so forth. The web server may receive and route messages between the social networking system and the client device for example instant messages queued messages e.g. email text messages short message service SMS messages or messages sent using any other suitable messaging technique. A user may send a request to the web server to upload information e.g. images or videos that are stored in the content store . Additionally the web server may provide application programming interface API functionality to send data directly to native client device operating systems such as IOS ANDROID WEBOS or RIM .

The social networking system extracts features from the applications linked to the social networking system . In one embodiment the features extracted from an application include usage and response to the application from the users of the application or the social networking system users a business value of the application and a configuration of the application. For example the social networking system extracts explicit feedback provided by users of the application such as a star rating of the application and implicit user feedback such as a number of users who viewed information about the application and a number of users who installed the application or granted permission to the application. As an example business value feature the social networking system determines a profit value of the application. Example configuration features of an application include the number of platforms supported by the application and a layout of the application. The business value and configuration features of an application may be provided by the developer of the application or the social networking system may retrieve the features from one or more external sources.

The social networking system receives quality scores manually assigned to a training set of applications. The training set of applications includes a random sample of applications associated with the social networking system or a random sample of applications meeting the eligibility criteria. In one embodiment the manually assigned quality scores are scores of 1 or 0 and are assigned to the applications in the training set by human reviewers rating the applications across a plurality of dimensions defining criteria for a quality application. For example a score of 1 indicates an application meets all of the criteria for a quality application and a score of 0 indicates the application does not meet one or more of the criteria. The quality scores assigned to the applications in the training set may alternatively have different values than 1 and 0 and the applications may not be scored on a binary scale. For example the training applications may be assigned separate scores for each dimension over which the applications are evaluated. Example dimensions over which the training set of applications are evaluated include navigability e.g. does the application have an intuitive layout non triviality e.g. does the application provide a useful and stable functionality and novelty of the application as well as quality of the content posted by the application to the social networking system .

The social networking system trains a model using the manually assigned quality scores and features extracted from the applications in the training set. In one embodiment the model uses features extracted from an application to assign a score to the application where the score represents a probability of the application satisfying the quality criteria for the applications linked to the social networking system . In one embodiment the model is trained to generate a single score representing the probability of an application satisfying all of the quality criteria. However other embodiments of the social networking system train the model to predict distinct probabilities of the application satisfying each of several quality criteria and generate the quality score for the application based on the probabilities. For example the social networking system may train a model for each dimension across which the training applications were evaluated. In one embodiment the model assigns the scores based on a degree of similarity of the features to the feature of the training applications assigned a score of 0 or the features of the training applications assigned a score of 1. For example the model assigns a score to a test application using cosine similarity between the features of the test application and the features of the training applications assigned a score of 1 to represent the probability of the test application satisfying the quality criteria. In another embodiment the model classifies an application as either a high quality application e.g. receiving a score of 1 or a low quality application e.g. receiving a score of 0 depending on whether the features extracted from the application are more similar to the features of the training applications assigned a score of 1 or the features of the training applications assigned a score of 0. The social networking system applies the model to the features extracted from applications associated with the social networking system to assign quality scores to the applications.

Based on the quality scores assigned to the applications the social networking system ranks content associated with the applications for presentation to a user of the social networking system . Content associated with an application may include any of a variety of types of content items presented to users via the social networking system including notifying a user or connections of the user of actions taken by the user in relation to the application notifying a user of the application of changes to the application or special promotions related to the application and recommendation units generated by the social networking system to recommend the application to users of the social networking system . In one embodiment the social networking system ranks content associated with an application in relation to other content in the social networking system . For example if an application has a low quality score e.g. zero or close to zero the social networking system applies a penalty to the content associated with the application such that other content in the social networking system will be presented to a user before the application content is presented to the user. In another embodiment the social networking system ranks content associated with a first application relative to content associated with each of a plurality of other applications. For example if the first application is assigned a lower quality score than the other applications the content associated with the first application is ranked lower than the content associated with the other applications and is therefore presented to a user of the social networking system after the content associated with the other applications is presented.

The social networking system uses the ranking of content associated with an application to present the application content to a user of the social networking system . In one embodiment the social networking system presents application content to a user as stories in a newsfeed. The stories containing application content may be selected or presented to a user in an ordering determined based on the ranking of the application content. For example higher ranked application content is more likely to be included in a newsfeed of a user than lower ranked application content. Similarly higher ranked application content may appear higher in a user s newsfeed than lower ranked application content.
