The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 924 194 filed Jan. 6 2014 the entire specification of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

The growth of multimedia services including streaming and conversational services is one of the key drivers of the evolution to new mobile broadband technologies and standards. Digital video content is increasingly consumed in mobile devices. There are many video applications extensively used on mobile devices in daily life. For example online video streaming include popular services such as YouTube and Hulu. Video recording and video conferencing include services such as Skype and Google Hangout. In 2011 YouTube had more than 1 trillion global views. Ten percent of the views were accessed via mobile phones or tablets. As more smart phones tablets and other mobile computing devices are purchased their use for video recording and video conferencing will increase dramatically. With such high consumer demand for multimedia services coupled with developments in media compression and wireless network infrastructures it is of interest to enhance the multimedia service capabilities of future cellular and mobile broadband systems and deliver high quality of experience QoE to the consumers thereby ensuring ubiquitous access to video content and services from any location at any time with any device and technology.

Reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments illustrated and specific language will be used herein to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended.

Before the present invention is disclosed and described it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular structures process steps or materials disclosed herein but is extended to equivalents thereof as would be recognized by those ordinarily skilled in the relevant arts. It should also be understood that terminology employed herein is used for the purpose of describing particular examples only and is not intended to be limiting. The same reference numerals in different drawings represent the same element. Numbers provided in flow charts and processes are provided for clarity in illustrating steps and operations and do not necessarily indicate a particular order or sequence.

An initial overview of technology embodiments is provided below and then specific technology embodiments are described in further detail later. This initial summary is intended to aid readers in understanding the technology more quickly but is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the technology nor is it intended to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

A technology is described for operating a video conferencing application at a local user equipment UE that supports an interactive zooming feature. A local user at the local UE can communicate with a remote user at a remote UE by using the video conferencing application. The local user viewing a scene via the video conferencing application on a display screen of the local UE can select an area within the scene. This area can be referred to as a region of interest ROI within a field of view at the remote UE. The local user may select the ROI when the local user desires a more detailed representation of contents within the ROI. The local user can dynamically switch a video feed of the scene to the selected area of the scene i.e. the ROI using the interactive zooming feature. The ROI can be communicated from the local UE to the remote UE via a real time transport control protocol RTCP feedback message. Upon receiving the RTCP feedback message the remote UE can capture video within the ROI. In addition the remote UE can encode the video within the ROI. The encoded video can include regions within the ROI and exclude regions outside the ROI. The remote UE can transmit the encoded video to the local UE. The encoded video can include the regions within the ROI at an increased zoom level while substantially maintaining a defined quality level. In other words the remote UE can provide the encoded video within the ROI in order to enable playback of the encoded video at the local UE. By the remote UE transmitting only the selected area of the scene i.e. the ROI to the local UE and excluding the non selected area of the scene from transmission the video conferencing application can more efficiently use the available bandwidth.

There have been a number of multimedia standards that have been developed to enable multimedia to be communicated to from or between mobile computing devices. For instance in streaming video the third generation partnership project 3GPP has developed technical specification TS 26.234 e.g. Release 11.0.0 that describes packet switched streaming services PSS that are based on the real time streaming protocol RTSP for unicast streaming of on demand or live content. In addition hyper text transfer protocol HTTP based streaming services including progressive download and dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP DASH are described in 3GPP TS 26.247 e.g. Release 11.0.0 . 3GPP based multimedia broadcast and multicast services MBMS specification TS 26.346 e.g. Release 11.0.0 specifies streaming and download techniques for multicast broadcast content distribution. As such DASH PSS MBMS based mobile computing devices such as user equipment UEs decode and render streamed videos at the UE devices. Support for the 3GP file format in 3GPP TS 26.244 e.g. Release 11.0.0 is mandated in all of these specifications to support file download and HTTP based streaming use cases.

One example of a standard for conversational video communication such as video conferencing is provided in 3GPP TS 26.114 e.g. 11.0.0 . The standard describes the multimedia telephony services over IMS MTSI that allows delivery of advanced multimedia conversational services and content over internet protocol IP multimedia subsystems IMS based networks. IMS is standardized in 3GPP TS 26.140 e.g. Rel. 11.0.0 . The 3GPP TS 26.140 describes media handling and interaction which includes media control media codecs and the transport of media and control data. The 3GPP TS 26.140 also enables video sharing using multimedia sharing services MMS in which support for the 3GP file format is provided.

As described in further detail below a MTSI call can use call session control function CSCF mechanisms to reroute control plane signaling between the UEs involved in the call e.g. the video conference application . In the control plane application servers AS can be present and provide supplementary services such as call hold or resume call forwarding and multi party calls etc.

An MTSI based transmitter UE terminal can capture and record video and then transfer the video to an MTSI based receiver UE terminal over a 3GPP network. The receiver UE terminal can then decode and render the video. In MTSI the session initiation protocol SIP can serve as the application layer control protocol to establish modify and terminate conversational multimedia sessions such as video conferences Internet telephony calls and others. Session description protocol SDP based signaling between the sending and receiving terminals can allow for offer answer considerations in the media related capability negotiation including codecs bitrates resolutions etc. The transport of media in MTSI is based on the real time transport protocol RTP specified by IETF RFC 3550 over UDP IP.

The resolutions of capture devices and therefore compressed videos are rapidly increasing. For example using the recent High Efficiency Video Coding HEVC standard 4K content can be transported and stored as part of an operational product. Cameras having 4 k by 2 k resolution are now widely available. Live streaming video has been demonstrated with resolutions of 8 k by 4 k. Resolutions in terms of numbers of pixels are likely to increase in the future. With these very high resolution contents new usages in video streaming are now possible such as interactive zooming features.

Conversational video services that are currently present in the marketplace such as MTSI enable dynamic adaptation of video in terms of bandwidth spatial resolution orientation etc. However these conversational video services do not enable users to dynamically switch to a user selected area in the video being streamed and optimize encodings for this user selected area. As a result the achievable video resolution during the usage of interactive zoom features in video calls can be limited. Although a receiver application can zoom in to the region of interest ROI and crop out the unwanted parts of the video e.g. in response to the commands from a user interface one limitation of current systems is that the sending terminal would still encode and transmit the entire video frame in the absence of any ROI signaling from the receiving terminal.

In one example the video conferencing application can be over an MTSI based conversational video system. In other words the video conferencing application can operate over 3GPP based multimedia telephony services which connect the remote UE and the local UE to each other and to the telephone network.

The remote UE can connect to the core network through a radio access network RAN a serving general packet radio service GPRS support node SGSN and or a gateway GPRS support node GGSN . The remote UE can send and receive data through a proxy call session control function P CSCF . The P CSCF can send and receive data with a serving call session control function S CSCF . In some examples the S CSCF can send and receive data from an application server AS which can provide supplementary services such as call hold resume call forwarding and multi party calls etc. In this example the RAN the SGSN the GGSN the P CSCF the S CSCF and the AS can be associated with an operator A . The S CSCF can send and receive data from other parts of the core network. For example the S CSCF that is associated with Operator A can communicate with an interrogating CSCF I CSCF that is associated with an operator B .

The local UE can connect to the core network through its own radio access network RAN serving general packet radio service GPRS support node SGSN and gateway GPRS support node GGSN . The local UE can send and receive data through a proxy call session control function P CSCF . The P CSCF can send and receive data with a serving call session control function S CSCF . In some examples the S CSCF can send and receive data from an application server AS which can provide supplementary services such as call hold resume call forwarding and multi party calls etc. The S CSCF and the S CSCF can each communicate with an interrogating CSCF I CSCF . In other words operator A can communicate with operator B via communications between the S CSCF and the I CSCF . The I CSCF can read and write to a home subscriber server HSS and or a subscriber location function SLF . In this example the RAN the SGSN the GGSN the P CSCF the HSS SLF the I CSCF the S CSCF and the AS can be associated with the operator B .

In one configuration the video conferencing application can support a zooming feature. For example the local UE can zoom into a particular feature or location in the field of view of the remote camera i.e. the camera associated with the remote UE . At the local UE user B can define a region of interest ROI within a field of view at the remote UE . As a non limiting example at the remote UE the user A may view the user B s head on the display screen of the remote UE . At the local UE the user B may view the user A s head and torso on the display screen of the local UE . The user B may desire an enhanced view of the user A e.g. the user B may desire to zoom into user A s face . User B can define the ROI at the local UE such that the ROI includes user A s face. The ROI can be defined at the local UE using for example a graphical user interface. In other words the user B may select the region using an input device such as a computer mouse or a touch screen. The ROI can include other suitable regions within the field of view of the remote camera. For example the user B can define the ROI to include user A s torso a tree behind user A etc. As other examples the ROI can include a top right region of the display screen of the local UE which corresponds to an appropriate field of view of the remote camera a lower left region of the display screen of the local UE etc.

In one example the ROI can be defined using at least two attributes. One attribute is position which can specify an upper left corner of the area covered in the original content or can specify another suitable location. The other attribute is size which can specify the size of the area covered in the original content in relative values. For instance a non limiting example of position can be 0 0 and a non limiting example of size can be 0.33 0.33 .

In one example the user B can define the ROI to have an arbitrary size and location within the field of view of the remote camera. In another example the remote UE can remain stationary when the ROI is defined so that selecting an ROI does not move or change the field of view of the remote camera. In yet another example the user B can select a new ROI at will. In addition the user A at the remote UE can also select an analogous ROI to zoom in on the user B at the local UE .

Once the ROI is defined at the local UE the ROI can be sent from the local UE to the remote UE . As discussed in further detail below the ROI can be communicated using a real time transport protocol RTP message or a real time transport control protocol RTCP feedback message. The RTP message or the RTCP feedback message can direct the remote UE to capture video within the ROI .

In some examples the remote UE can capture video that includes only the ROI and excludes regions outside the ROI . As a non limiting example the RTP message or the RTCP feedback message that includes the ROI can instruct the remote UE to capture a wound on the user A s chin. In other words the remote UE s camera can capture only the wound on the user A s chin and no other regions that surround the user A s chin.

Upon capturing the video in accordance with the ROI the remote UE can encode the video for example using an encoding scheme with relatively low compression. Therefore the video can provide a relatively close up and detailed view of the ROI while substantially maintaining a defined level of quality. The remote UE can encode the video with the ROI with the less lossy encoding scheme because the resources that were previously used to encode the entire field of view are now only used to encode the ROI . The remote UE can transmit the encoded video with only the ROI to the local UE . Since the remote UE may consume substantially the same amount of bandwidth when transmitting the encoded video with only the ROI as opposed to the full field of view of the remote camera associated with the remote UE the encoded video can be of substantially high quality. In other words the encoded video of the ROI can be relatively clear and not grainy or blurry. In this regard the technique described herein is superior to previous technologies where a user e.g. the user B manually zooms into the frame displayed on the display screen which can lead to a reduced quality level. In the current solution the remote UE can encode only the ROI with a negotiated resolution rather than the whole captured frame and this would lead to a higher overall resolution and better user experience at the local UE .

As a non limiting example the remote UE can encode a video of the wound on the user A s chin. The remote UE can use an encoding scheme with relatively low compression such that the user A s chin is viewable with a relatively large resolution and clarity level. In other words the encoded video can be a zoomed in representation of the user A s chin but still maintains a relatively high quality level e.g. not grainy . In addition an entire bandwidth can be used for sending the encoded video of the user A s chin which can result in a relatively clear and detailed representation of the user A s chin. This representation can provide additional details of the user A s face as opposed to if all of the user A s face was included as part of the encoded video.

In an alternative configuration the remote UE can capture video that includes the full field of view of the remote camera associated with the remote UE . However the remote UE can only encode a portion of the video that includes the ROI . In addition the remote UE can transmit the encoded video that includes only the ROI and excludes regions outside the ROI .

The local UE can receive the encoded video from the remote UE where the encoded video includes regions within the ROI and excludes regions outside the ROI . The local UE can render and display the encoded video on the display screen associated with the local UE . As a non limiting example the user B sitting in front of the local UE can view a detailed and close up representation of the wound on the user A s chin. The user B can always revert back to a previous view of the user A e.g. the user B can un zoom and revert back to viewing the user A s entire face and torso on the display screen of the local UE .

As described herein novel media handling and session management features are targeted for conversational video services. These novel features may provide an enhanced resolution for an interactive zoom feature in a video conferencing application. Information on the user s ROI can be signaled from the receiving terminal to the sending terminal e.g. as part of the RTCP feedback signaling or RTP header extension. As a result this enhanced zooming feature can provide improved image quality for the selected region as compared to a simple graphical zoom since the sending device can use all of the available bandwidth for encoding and transmitting the ROI. Since the sending device can use all of the available bandwidth for this limited purpose video with higher bitrates and quality can be delivered to the receiving terminal.

The remote UE can send an SDP offer message to the local UE . The SDP offer message can indicate that the remote UE supports ROI based video delivery. In other words the SDP offer message can indicate a ROI based streaming capability at the remote UE . The remote UE can be configured to support ROI based video capturing ROI based video encoding and ROI based video transmissions. The local UE can receive the SDP offer message from the remote UE and in response send an SDP answer message that accepts the ROI based video delivery capability.

In one configuration the local UE can define the ROI and send ROI information to the remote UE . As previously explained the ROI information can define a region of interest ROI within a field of view at the remote UE . The ROI can be defined using at least two attributes. One attribute is position which can specify an upper left corner of the area covered in the original content or can specify another suitable location. The other attribute is size which can specify the size of the area covered in the original content in relative values. In one example the ROI information can be communicated from the local UE to the remote UE using a real time transport control protocol RTCP feedback message. In an alternative example the ROI information can be communicated from the local UE to the remote UE using a real time transport protocol RTP header extension message. In particular the local UE can communicate the ROI information to the remote UE using the RTP header extension message for reverse direction video streams.

The remote UE can receive the ROI information and capture video that includes only the ROI and excludes regions outside the ROI. The remote UE can encode the video that includes only the ROI. The remote UE can send the encoded video to the local UE . In one example the remote UE can also indicate an actual transmitted ROI in an RTP header extension message for forward direction video streams. The local UE can receive the encoded video that includes the ROI and play the video at the local UE .

When the ROI information is signaled from the local UE to the remote UE using the RTP header extension message an MTSI client that supports the ROI zooming feature can offer ROI zooming in SDP messages for all media streams containing video. The ROI zooming feature can be offered by including the a extmap attribute indicating the ROI Zoom uniform resource name URN under the relevant media line scope. For instance the ROI Zoom URN can be set as urn 3gpp roi zoom. An example of a media line that includes this URN is a extmap 7 urn 3gpp roi zoom. In the above example of a media line the number 7 can be replaced with any number in the range of 1 and 14.

When the ROI information is signaled from the local UE to the remote UE using the RTCP message an MTSI client that supports the ROI zooming feature can offer ROI zooming in SDP messages for all media streams containing video. The ROI zooming feature can be offered by including the a rtcp fb attribute with a novel ROI Zoom type under the relevant media line scope. For instance the ROI Zoom type in conjunction with the RTCP feedback technique can be expressed with the following parameter 3gpp roi zoom. A wildcard payload type can be used to indicate that the RTCP feedback attribute for ROI signaling applies to all payload types. If several types of ROI feedback are supported and or the same ROI feedback shall be specified for a subset of the payload types then several a rtcp fb lines can be used. An example usage of this attribute to signal the ROI zoom feature relative to a media line based on the RTCP feedback technique is a rtcp fb 3gpp roi zoom.

The RTCP feedback technique can involve signaling of ROI information in both of the immediate feedback and early RTCP modes. The novel RTCP feedback type for ROI Zoom can include a value name of 3gpp roi zoom a long name of Region of interest ROI information and a reference of 3GPP TS 26.114. In the Augmented Backus Naur Form ABNF for the value of rtcp fb val as defined in Internet Engineering Task Force IETF request for comments RFC 4585 there is a placeholder called rtcp fb id to define new feedback types. 3gpp roi zoom is defined as a new feedback type for ROI information signaling and the ABNF can be given as follows rtcp fb val 3gpp roi zoom .

The ROI Zoom capability can be supported bi directionally or uni directionally depending on how clients negotiate to support the feature during SDP capability negotiations. For terminals with asymmetric capability e.g. the ability to process ROI information but not detect signal ROI information the sendonly and recvonly attributes can be used. Terminals are to express their capability in each direction sufficiently clearly such that signals are only sent in each direction to the extent that they both express useful information and can be processed by the recipient.

The ROI zooming feature includes signaling of the current ROI of the receiving user to the sender so that the sending UE can optimally encode and transmit the captured video. When ROI Zoom is successfully negotiated it can be signaled by the MTSI client. The signaling of the ROI Zoom can use RTCP feedback reporting or RTP Header Extensions.

When using RTCP feedback reports the receiving terminal includes the current ROI information of the user in the RTCP reports it is transmitting to the sending terminal. When using RTP header extensions the receiving terminal includes the current ROI information of the user in the RTP packets it is transmitting to the sending terminal. These RTP packets carry video streams in the reverse direction which can be used for bi directional video communications in MTSI.

These different ROI signaling capabilities can be indicated in the SDP offer via different uniform resource names URNs . In some examples one can pick one of these and use a single URN in the SDP capability negotiations. Since RTCP is not always used in video calls and can be turned off this is also part of the SDP negotiation it can be safest to deliver the ROI information as part of the RTP header extensions of the reverse direction video streams for broadest support of the ROI Zoom feature. However if the reverse link is not actively sending RTP streams then the RTCP feedback technique is a preferred.

The presence of ROI Zoom should not impact the negotiated resolutions based on SDP imageattr attribute between the sending and receiving terminals. The only difference is that the sending terminal would encode only the ROI with the negotiated resolution rather than the whole captured frame and this would lead to a higher overall resolution and better user experience than having the receiving terminal zoom in on the ROI and crop out the rest of the frame. The sending terminal can potentially indicate ROI as part of the RTP header extension in RTP packets for its forward direction video streams.

In the case of program code execution on programmable computers the computing device can include a processor a storage medium readable by the processor including volatile and non volatile memory and or storage elements at least one input device and at least one output device. The volatile and non volatile memory and or storage elements can be a random access memory RAM erasable programmable read only memory EPROM flash drive optical drive magnetic hard drive solid state drive or other medium for storing electronic data. The node and wireless device can also include a transceiver module i.e. transceiver a counter module i.e. counter a processing module i.e. processor and or a clock module i.e. clock or timer module i.e. timer . One or more programs that can implement or utilize the various techniques described herein can use an application programming interface API reusable controls and the like. Such programs can be implemented in a high level procedural or object oriented programming language to communicate with a computer system. However the program s can be implemented in assembly or machine language if desired. In any case the language can be a compiled or interpreted language and combined with hardware implementations.

It should be understood that many of the functional units described in this specification have been labeled as modules in order to more particularly emphasize their implementation independence. For example a module can be implemented as a hardware circuit comprising custom very large scale integration VLSI circuits or gate arrays off the shelf semiconductors such as logic chips transistors or other discrete components. A module can also be implemented in programmable hardware devices such as field programmable gate arrays programmable array logic programmable logic devices or the like.

In one example multiple hardware circuits can be used to implement the functional units described in this specification. For example a first hardware circuit can be used to perform processing operations and a second hardware circuit e.g. a transceiver can be used to communicate with other entities. The first hardware circuit and the second hardware circuit can be integrated into a single hardware circuit or alternatively the first hardware circuit and the second hardware circuit can be separate hardware circuits.

Modules can also be implemented in software for execution by various types of processors. An identified module of executable code can for instance comprise one or more physical or logical blocks of computer instructions which can for instance be organized as an object procedure or function. Nevertheless the executables of an identified module need not be physically located together but can comprise disparate instructions stored in different locations which when joined logically together comprise the module and achieve the stated purpose for the module.

Indeed a module of executable code can be a single instruction or many instructions and can even be distributed over several different code segments among different programs and across several memory devices. Similarly operational data can be identified and illustrated herein within modules and can be embodied in any suitable form and organized within any suitable type of data structure. The operational data can be collected as a single data set or can be distributed over different locations including over different storage devices and can exist at least partially merely as electronic signals on a system or network. The modules can be passive or active including agents operable to perform desired functions.
