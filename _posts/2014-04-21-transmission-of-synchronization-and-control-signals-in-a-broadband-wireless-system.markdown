title: Transmission of synchronization and control signals in a broadband wireless system
abstract: In a broadband wireless communication system, a primary control signal may be relocated within the operation band for transmission while avoiding interference. For example, if the primary control signal employs P contiguous subcarriers, the primary control signal can be placed in any section of the band that has P contiguous subcarriers. If a narrow-band interferer appears at one end of the band, the primary control signals can be placed at the other end. If the interferer appears in the middle, the primary can be relocated to either end of the band. The placement of primary control signals can be changed as the interference environment changes.

This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 393 159 filed Feb. 28 2012 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 705 399 issued Apr. 22 2014 which is the National Stage of International Application No. PCT US2011 058476 filed Oct. 28 2011 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 455 986 filed Oct. 29 2010 the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.

The disclosed embodiments relate in general to wireless or wire line communications and include methods and apparatus for transmission of synchronization and control signals although these are merely exemplary and non limiting fields.

In an LTE system the synchronization SYNC signals and the broadcasting signals on the physical broadcast channel PBCH occupy a relatively narrow bandwidth 1.08 MHz and are fixed at the center of the operation channel of a much wider bandwidth. The SYNC signals and information carried on the PBCH are crucial to system operation. The SYNC signals generated based on Zadoff Chu sequences enable a mobile station to find the base station of the cell that the mobile station is in and to synchronize with the network. The PBCH carries critical system control information that a mobile needs to access the network. Since LTE is designed for use on a licensed spectrum there is no need to consider interference originated from other systems i.e. no inter system interference . In this case the fixed location design of SYNC signals and PBCH is sufficient for the operation of the system.

Recently the premium spectrum bands have been opened up by regulators for unlicensed use especially TV channels that are now available due to switching from analogue to digital TV broadcasting. In an unlicensed environment there may be considerably more interference from various sources. When used in such an environment the fixed location design of SYNC signals and PBCH such as in an LTE system may not cope well with interference. The SYNC signals and PBCH may be vulnerable in cases where a narrow band interferer is present where the SYNC signals and PBCH are in frequency as depicted in . As a result performance of the system may be greatly degraded.

In accordance with various embodiments of the present invention in a broadband wireless communication system a primary control signal can be relocated within the operation band for transmission while avoiding interference. For example if the primary control signal employs P contiguous subcarriers the primary control signal can be placed in any section of the band that has P contiguous subcarriers. If a narrow band interferer appears at one end of the band the primary control signals can be placed at the other end. If the interferer appears in the middle the primary can be relocated to either end of the band. The placement of primary control signals can be changed as the interference environment changes that is the relocation of a primary control signal can be adaptive to interference environment.

The geographic region serviced by the system may be divided into a plurality of cells and wireless coverage may be provided in each cell by a base station. One or more mobile devices may be fixed or may roam within the geographic region. The mobile devices may be used as an interface between users and the network. A base station may serve as a focal point to transmit information to and receive information from the mobile devices within the cell that it serves by radio signals. A base station may be a macro station that covers a large geographical area or a macro cell a micro or pico station that covers a small area or a micro pico cell or a femto station that typically covers an indoor area or a femtocell. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that if a cell is divided into sectors each sector can be considered a cell. In this context the terms cell and sector are interchangeable.

The transmission from a base station to a mobile station may be called a downlink DL and the transmission from a mobile station to a base station may be called an uplink UL . The transmission may take place within a frequency range extending between two limiting frequencies. This range of frequency resource may be defined as an operating frequency band channel or simply band in this text. The center of the frequency range is typically the center frequency or carrier frequency and the span of the frequency range is normally referred to as the bandwidth. For example the frequency band for Broadcast Channel 36 in the United States is centered at 605 MHz with a bandwidth of 6 MHz. In another example a 3GPP WCDMA system may use a 5 MHz DL band and a 5 MHz UL band.

The transmission from a base station to a mobile station is called a downlink DL and the transmission from a mobile station to a base station is called an uplink UL . The transmission takes place within a frequency range extending between two limiting frequencies. This range of frequency resource is defined as an operating frequency band channel or simply band in this text. The center of the frequency range is usually called the center frequency or carrier frequency and the span of the frequency range is normally referred to as the bandwidth.

The wireless communication system may use a certain radio frame structure to facilitate the transmission. For example a radio frame may consist of multiple L subframes and each subframe may comprise multiple M OFDM symbols as shown in . In some embodiments multiple K frames may form a super frame. In other embodiments a subframe may be further divided into multiple time slots and each slot may comprise multiple OFDM symbols. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the division of radio frames and its granularity are to facilitate radio transmission. Other forms of division or other nomenclature may of course be used depending on the requirements of the communication system.

The OFDM time domain waveform is generated by applying the inverse fast Fourier transform IFFT to the OFDM signals in the frequency domain. A basic structure of a multi carrier signal in the frequency domain is made up of subcarriers which can be modulated to carry information data and reference signals. A copy of the last portion of the time waveform known as the cyclic prefix CP is inserted at the beginning of the waveform itself to form an OFDM symbol.

The basic structure of an OFDM signal in the frequency domain is made up of subcarriers. For a given bandwidth of a spectral band or channel the number of usable subcarriers is finite and limited the value of which depends on the size of the FFT and the sampling frequency and the effective bandwidth. OFDM symbols and subcarriers can be arranged into time frequency resource blocks each of which consists of multiple subcarriers in multiple consecutive symbols as shown in to support scalability and multiple access. One or more resource blocks may be used to form a subchannel dedicated for control information or and data information.

In one embodiment the same structure of the transmission frame may be used by all the cells within the system and frames may be transmitted in synchronization among the cells. Primary control signals such as synchronization signals and broadcasting signals on physical broadcast channels may be transmitted using one or more OFDM symbols in a frame or subframe.

In a broadband wireless communication system a primary control signal is broadcasted from a base station to mobile stations. A primary control signal may be referred to as a preamble synchronization signal reference signal header broadcast control channel or other terms in the industry. Notwithstanding the nomenclature its purpose is crucial to system operation. The primary control signal carries timing frequency cell identity system parameter information which enables a mobile station to find the base station of the cell it is in to synchronize with the network and to access to the network. In the following the terms control signal and control channel may be used interchangeably whereas a control channel is used to carry the so mentioned control signal and a control signal is carried in the so mentioned control channel.

In some embodiments the primary control signal comprises a synchronization signal SYNC which may be used by mobile stations for functions such as time synchronization frequency synchronization and cell identification. A SYNC may further comprise a primary synchronization signal PSS and a secondary synchronization signal SSS for multi step execution of the mobile functions. A SYNC can be realized using a direct sequence in the time or frequency domain. It is sometimes transmitted in the beginning of a frame and hence it is also known as a preamble. A SYNC may occupy only a fraction of the operation bandwidth. A SYNC can be placed at any frequency location within the operating bandwidth to facilitate the system operation. In some cases it may be fixed at a center subband or occupy another subband within the operation bandwidth as detailed in ensuing descriptions. In one embodiment a SYNC signal has small autocorrelation sidelobes relative to the peak of its autocorrelation and has small cross correlation with other SYNC signals.

In other embodiments the primary control signal further comprises a broadcasting signal that carries critical system information e.g. system operating bandwidth system frame number control channel structure and indication of usable frequency resources over a physical broadcast channel PBCH . A PBCH may consist of a set of contiguous subcarriers occupying only a fraction of the operation bandwidth. A PBCH can be placed in any frequency location with the operating bandwidth to facilitate the system operation. In some cases it may be fixed at a center subband or occupy another subband within the operation bandwidth as detailed in ensuing descriptions. Furthermore a PBCH may occupy one or more consecutive symbols within a subframe frame.

In further embodiments a regular control channel comprises a plurality of subcarriers which can be located anywhere within the operating bandwidth in the first few OFDM symbols within a subframe frame. A regular control channel is exclusively dedicated for carrying control information. In contrast a data channel comprises one or more time frequency resource blocks. The resource blocks are not necessarily contiguous and can be located anywhere within the operating bandwidth. A data channel is primarily used for carrying information data however it may be sometimes used to carry control information.

A typical mobile detection process in a broadband wireless communication system is depicted by the block diagram in . To start with a mobile station scans for the signature and frequency location of a PSS over potential frequency bands. A mobile station synchronizes in time and frequency with the system by detecting the primary and secondary synchronization signals and derives essential information such as cell identity. One way to detect whether there is a synchronization signal is to correlate the signal received at the mobile with a sequence stored at the mobile station. A high peak relative to the sidelobe level in the correlation result indicates the presence of the synchronization signal. If the cell identity is embedded in the sequence the correlation result may also reveal the cell identity. Subsequent to the detection the mobile station may obtain critical system information such as the operating bandwidth frame number control channel structures and information of usable frequency resources subcarriers resource blocks macro blocks or subbands by decoding the signals carried in the physical broadcast channel. It then extracts control information by decoding the data carried in the regular control channels. Once the mobile station has all the necessary control information it is enabled to carry out normal communication with its serving bastion station. In an embodiment when a mobile station enters the network it locks onto a frequency band according to design criteria such as high signal power level high signal to interference noise ratio SINR low traffic load or large available capacity usable frequency resources indicated by PBCH bit map or a combination thereof.

In a handoff process which is used by a mobile station to transfer an ongoing connection session from a serving cell to a target cell a mobile station may receive a neighbor advertisement message providing proper handoff information. Such information may reduce unnecessary overhead for scanning. If a handoff decision is made the mobile station performs functions such as time and frequency synchronization cell identity detection and decoding the PBCH for critical system information such as the operating bandwidth frame number control channel structures and information of usable frequency resources subcarriers resource blocks macro blocks or subbands . Subsequently the mobile station establishes the link with the target base station and then terminates the service by the original base station.

A control server may comprise components such as processors memory banks switches routers and interfaces. Together these components enable the server to perform necessary functions such as compressing and decompressing packet headers removing and adding packet headers segmenting and concatenating packets and managing databases.

A controller coupled with memory controls the operation of the transmitter. In particular the controller also controls the configuration of the set of subcarriers used for SYNC or PBCH for transmission. The configuration may include frequencies and power levels.

A controller coupled with memory controls the operation of the receiver. In particular the controller also controls the configuration of the set of subcarriers used for SYNC or PBCH for reception.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that these components construct transmit and receive a communication signal containing the data. Other forms of transmitters or receivers may of course be used depending on the requirements of the communication system.

In accordance with aspects of certain embodiments of the present invention in a broadband wireless communication system a primary control signal can be relocated within the operation band for transmission while avoiding interference. For example if the primary control signal employs P contiguous subcarriers it can be placed in any section of the band that has P contiguous subcarriers. If a narrow band interferer appears at one end of the band the primary control signals can be placed at the other end. If the interferer appears in the middle the primary control signals can be relocated to either end of the band or each of the primary control signals can be divided into two portions each portion relocated at one end of the band. The placement of primary control signals can be changed as the interference environment changes that is the relocation of a primary control signal can be adaptive to interference environment.

In one embodiment the frequency location of the channel that carries a primary control signal varies within the operating bandwidth in different cells or geo locations in the system. In another embodiment such position variation of primary control channels depends at least in part on the variation of interference such as the strength and frequency location in the cells. The interference may comprise inter system interference from e.g. TV broadcasting signals or intra system interference from other cells.

In some embodiments a primary control signal can be relocated in such a way that its center subcarrier can be placed at any point within the operation band to avoid interference as depicted in . For example in a system with a total of Q usable subcarriers within its bandwidth which are labeled by

where represents the floor function or greatest integer operator. Guard subcarriers zero energy may be placed on both sides of the primary control signal. In this case if a total of S guard subcarriers are used then

In one embodiment the center subcarrier of a primary control signal may only be placed at a frequency location that is related to the system parameters e.g. clock rate sampling rate and subcarrier spacing or simply a predetermined frequency location. For example the center subcarrier of a primary control channel is placed at a position in the frequency grids that are positive and negative multiples of a system sampling rate clock rate a positive and negative fraction of the sampling rate clock rate or positive and negative multiples of a subcarrier spacing. For instance the center frequency of a primary control channel can be placed at 3.84n MHz where n is an integer. For further example the center subcarrier of a SYNC is placed at one of the frequency locations f 0 L 2L 3L . . . where Ldenotes the length of the SYNC sequence.

In other embodiments multiple primary control signals may occupy the same frequency section in different OFDM symbols that is their center subcarrier corresponds to the same subcarrier index. In an example shown in PSS SSS and PBCH are aligned in frequency but placed in different OFDM symbols.

In further embodiments a primary control signal may be relocated at a frequency location with a sufficient level of channel quality e.g. sufficiently high mean SNR or sufficiently low average level of interference for mobile station to detect the primary control signal. The channel quality can be determined using various methods. In one embodiment mobile stations may survey the channel quality based in part on DL signals from their serving base stations and feed the relevant information back to their serving base stations which then aggregate the information to determine the frequency location with a sufficient level of channel quality. In another embodiment base stations may survey the channel quality based in part on UL signals from their mobile stations and determine the frequency location with sufficient channel quality.

In other embodiments the transmission of primary control signals may hop in frequency from one subframe slot or frame to the next. The hopping pattern can be pseudo random. The hopping pattern in frequency can be predetermined and made known to both base stations and mobile stations explicitly or implicitly. The information about the hopping pattern can also be embedded in the primary control signals. For example information embedded in the current SYNC indicates the subcarrier index q for the SYNC in next subframe slot or frame.

In some embodiments the OFDM symbol that is used to transmit a primary control signal or primary control signals may be divided into multiple N non overlapping subbands in frequency as depicted in . The width of each subband is not necessarily equal but may be sufficiently wide for a primary control signal. A primary control signal may occupy the entire subband or a section of the subband. In the latter case the primary control signal is not necessarily centered on the subband. Guard subcarriers zero energy may be placed on both sides of the primary control signal.

In other embodiments multiple primary control signals can be transmitted in different subbands at the same time or in the same OFDM symbol. In the example depicted in multiple PSS may be transmitted using a set of subbands. In the next OFDM symbol multiple SSS may be transmitted using the same set of subbands. Furthermore multiple PBCH may be transmitted using the same set of subbands in other OFDM symbols. In the event that the same primary control signals are transmitted using multiple subbands in the same OFDM symbols the received signals over these subbands can be combined in the frequency domain at the receiver using a specific combining technique e.g. Maximum Ratio Combining to process primary control signal.

Various subband configurations can be employed for transmission. In some embodiments subbands may be assigned a priority for transmission of primary control signals so that a mobile may carry out search over the high priority subbands first. The priority order can be predetermined and made known to both base stations and mobile stations. The priority order can be pseudo random or follow a natural pattern. For example subband priority may descend from center to either end of the operation band. A mobile station may search a primary control signal over the center subband first and if it fails to find the primary control signal it may then search over the subbands next to the center subband.

In other embodiments a subband with a sufficient level of channel quality e.g. sufficiently high mean SNR or sufficiently low average level of interference may be selected for primary control signal transmission. Subband channel quality can be determined using various methods. For example in a FDD system mobile stations may survey the channel quality of different subbands based on DL signals from their serving base stations and feed the relevant information back to their serving base stations which then aggregate the information to determine the subbands with a sufficient level of channel quality. In a TDD system base stations may survey the channel quality of different subbands based on UL signals from their mobile stations and determine the subbands with the a sufficient level of channel quality.

In further embodiments primary control signals may be transmitted over subband i in a subframe or slot or frame and over subband j in the next subframe slot or frame that is the transmission of primary control signals hops from one subband to the other over time. The hopping pattern can be pseudo random or follow a natural pattern e.g. round robin . The hopping pattern can be predetermined and made known to both base stations and mobile stations explicitly or implicitly. The information about the hopping pattern can also be embedded in the primary control signals. For example information embedded in the current SYNC indicates which subband the next SYNC will be transmitted over. Alternatively a mobile station can carry out blind detection of the primary control signal.

A SYNC is a sequence in either time or frequency domain. System information can be embedded in the sequence. In particular the nelement of the sequence can be expressed as a function of 

where Idenotes the cell identity Idenotes the subframe index and q denotes the subcarrier index for the center subcarrier of the SYNC.

A PBCH carries system control information. In some embodiments PBCH may also used to carry information to indicate usable or unusable frequency resources within the operation band. Frequency resources may be organized as subcarriers Resource Blocks RB of subcarriers macro RB s or subbands. In an embodiment a PBCH may contain a bitmap that is used to indicate which frequency resources are usable or unusable with bit value 1 signifying usable and 0 signifying unusable as depicted in . Such a bitmap can be further compressed using a particular compressing method e.g. run length coding . Two bitmaps may be used one for DL and the other for UL. In another embodiment the PBCH may contain two bit fields that are used to indicate the unusable frequency resources one denoting the starting subcarrier or block index and the other denoting the ending subcarrier or block .

To reduce overhead for indicating frequency resources within an operating bandwidth the system may define a frequency resource unit of large granularity e.g. a macro RB MRB that contains a plurality of consecutive frequency resource units of smaller granularity e.g. RB s and a message bitmap in the PBCH may indicate the usable unusable units of large granularity instead of units of smaller granularity.

In other embodiments regular control channels may be used to carry information to indicate usable or unusable frequency resources within the operating band. A regular control channel may contain downlink control information indicating the scheduled frequency resources for downlink data transmission. Another regular control channel may contain additional control information indicating the scheduled frequency resources for uplink data transmission. In the control signals messages the scheduled frequency resources subcarriers RB s MRB s or subbands for downlink or uplink transmission may only include the usable the usable frequency resources which may be addressed or indexed as if the operation band is contiguous with only usable frequency resources.

An indication of usable unusable frequency resources allow mobile stations to measure channel quality indications such as power level or signal to interference plus noise ratio SINR over the usable frequency resources. In addition mobile stations may use the received signals within usable frequency resources for signal processing such as frequency offset estimation. However a base station or the system may signal via a PBCH a regular control channel or a control message in a data channel a mobile station to monitor and measure the channel quality of the unusable frequency resources. A mobile station may also elect to monitor and measure the channel quality of unused frequency resources as indicated by PBCH. The mobile station may then feed the channel quality information back to the base station so that the base station or system can make further decisions on the quality usability of these frequency resources.

In some embodiments the control server may determine center frequencies or assigns subband for primary control signals based on the available interference information. The interference information can be obtained using different methods. In an embodiment mobile stations may detect and measure interference that they experience and send the interference information e.g. its relative or absolute strength its location in frequency and its bandwidth to their serving base stations. In another embodiment the interference information may be derived from a database that is maintained by the system. The database may contain geo locations frequencies and power levels of broadcast transmitters e.g. high power TV stations . The database may also contain interference information including frequency location and the strength of the interference in one or more cells and in the vicinity of the network generating through site surveys. A control server or a base station may consult with the database so that it can determine a center frequency or subband for transmitting a primary control signal in order to avoid strong interference from inter system interferers. In addition the server may coordinate the use of center frequencies or subbands by allocating a set of center frequencies or subbands to a cell for primary control signals and a different set to its neighboring cell. Alternatively base stations of neighboring cells exchange via a backbone network e.g. X2 Interface the information on center frequencies or subbands they intend to use for their primary control signals. For example base stations of neighboring cells exchange the SYNC and PBCH information e.g. the time and or frequency locations and or channels and information about usable unusable frequency resources e.g. subcarriers RB s MRB s or subbands for data or control channels signals within the operation bandwidth through backbone network e.g. X2 Interface . In addition to exchanging aforementioned information base stations of neighboring cells may send advertisement messages about part or all of the aforementioned information to each other which then advertise the information regarding their neighbors to expedite mobile station handoff thereby reducing unnecessary overhead for scanning in cell reselection.

In other embodiments a base station may avoid using frequency resources under severe interference for transmission of DL control channels e.g. Physical Control Format Indicator Channel Physical Dedicated Control Channel and Physical Hybrid ARQ Indicator Channel and data channels. Similarly mobile stations based on the information disseminated on the PBCH e.g. the bitmaps or bit fields indicating the usable or unusable frequency resources may carry out detection of DL regular control channels and data channels over the usable frequency resources. A base station may make a determination to transmit reference signals in unused frequency resources. For example the base station may choose to transmit reference signals within unused frequency resources for the use by mobiles e.g. SNR estimation or not to transmit reference signals within unused frequency resources. Similarly a mobile station may choose to use the reference signals within unused frequency resources or not to. Furthermore base stations may make frequency resources under severe interference unavailable for the use of random access by mobile stations.

In further embodiments base stations of cells in a single frequency network SFN may only transmit SFN signals using the usable frequency resources that are common to these cells. These base stations may send via a backbone network the information on the usable frequency resources in their own cells to a server and the server may determine the commonly usable frequency resources for SFN transmission among these cells. The base stations may also exchange via a backbone network the information on the usable frequency resources in their own cells and determine among themselves the commonly usable frequency resources for SFN transmission. The frequency resources usable in a specific cell but not usable in other SFN cells may be used for cell specific transmission in that cell such as cell specific retransmission of the SFN signal. A base station may use a signaling method e.g. a bitmap on a PBCH or other regular control channels to indicate unusable frequency resources cell specific frequency resources or SFN frequency resources. Correspondingly mobile stations may use the appropriate signal detection and processing method to deal with the SFN frequency resources and cell specific frequency resources.

A primary control signal may carry timing frequency location system parameter information which enables a mobile station to find the base station of the cell it is in to synchronize with the network and to access the network. In cell search procedures or cell reselection procedures for handoff one of the steps is to detect the SYNC. In the event that there are PSS and SSS a mobile station may detect PSS first and then SSS.

In some embodiments the signal processor may process the received signals with the following process as shown in 

In other embodiments the signal processor may process the received signals with the following process as shown in 

If fis known to the mobile station either process may be repeated until a SYNC is detected. If fis unknown to the mobile either process can be repeated sequentially for each possible center subcarrier location funtil a SYNC is detected. Alternatively either process can be carried out concurrently for all possible center subcarrier locations that is there are multiple N parallel paths for detecting the SYNC each one for a possible center subcarrier location f n as shown in .

In one embodiment this is done by searching over multiple primary control channels at distinct center frequency locations within the operating frequency channel. In one embodiment each of the multiple primary control channels is characterized as having a number of contiguous subcarriers and a bandwidth substantially narrower than a bandwidth of the operating frequency channel. In another embodiment the primary control signal comprises a sequence modulating on subcarriers of a primary control channel. Furthermore the sequence may have an autocorrelation with a large correlation peak with respect to sidelobes. Additionally and optionally the sequence may contain cell identity information. In some embodiments the primary control signal may have a small peak to average power ratio.

In operation time or frequency synchronization is performed based on the detected primary control signal.

In one embodiment a correlation is performed between the received signal and a sequence stored at the mobile device. In an embodiment symbol time acquisition is performed. In another embodiment cell identity detection is performed. In another embodiment frame boundary detection is performed. In another embodiment information decoding is performed on a physical broadcasting channel PBCH .

In one embodiment an interference measurement is performed. In another embodiment a neighbor advertisement message is received containing information on center frequency locations of primary control channels used in neighboring cells. In another embodiment a handover procedure is performed.

Any of the above mentioned aspects can be implemented in methods systems computer readable media or any type of manufacture. For example a computer readable medium can store thereon computer executable instructions for communicating in a wireless communications system.
