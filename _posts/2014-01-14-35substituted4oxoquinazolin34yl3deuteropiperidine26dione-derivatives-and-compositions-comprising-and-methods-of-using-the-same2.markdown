This application claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 752 055 filed Jan. 14 2013 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 786 024 filed Mar. 14 2013 the contents of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

Compounds such as 3 5 amino 2 methyl 4 oxoquinazolin 3 4H yl piperidine 2 6 dione Formula A and 3 2 5 di methyl 4 oxoquinazolin 3 4H yl piperidine 2 6 dione Formula B and other derivatives in this family are currently being studied as anti proliferative immunomodulatory and anti angiogenic agents.

The compounds of Formula A and B because of the asymmetric carbon on the glutarimide ring i.e. the piperidine 2 6 dione ring are a racemic mixture of R and S stereoisomers. The hydrogen at the 3 position is acidic due to the presence of the adjacent carbonyl moiety thereby making it difficult to prevent racemization of the two stereoisomers and difficult to determine if one of the stereoisomers is superior to the other.

The present invention provides new compounds that are resistant to racemization at their stereogenic center and are useful in the treatment of various medical disorders.

Accordingly described herein are 3 deuterium enriched 3 5 substituted 4 oxoquinazolin 3 4H yl piperidine 2 6 diones e.g. 3 5 substituted 4 oxoquinazolin 3 4H yl 3 deutero piperidine 2 6 diones and stereoisomers solvates and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.

Another aspect provided herein is a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and at least one of the deuterium enriched compounds of the invention or a stereoisomer solvate or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.

Another aspect is a method for treating preventing and or managing angiogenesis and or a cytokine related disorder comprising administering to a host in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amount of at least one of the deutero compounds of the invention or a stereoisomer solvate or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.

Another aspect is a method for treating preventing and or managing a cancer comprising administering to a host in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amount of at least one of the deutero compounds of the invention or a stereoisomer solvate or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.

Another aspect is a method for treating preventing and or managing a disease associated with lymphocytic activity including activity of B cells and or T cells e.g. immune related diseases or inflammatory diseases comprising administering to a host in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amount of at least one of the deutero compounds of the invention or a stereoisomer solvate or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.

Also provided are novel 3 deuterium enriched 3 5 substituted 4 oxoquinazolin 3 4H yl piperidine 2 6 diones or a stereoisomer solvate or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for use in therapy.

Another aspect is the use of novel 3 deuterium enriched 3 5 substituted 4 oxoquinazolin 3 4H yl piperidine 2 6 diones or a stereoisomer solvate or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for the manufacture of a medicament e.g. for the treatment of angiogenesis and or a cytokine related disorder . In certain instances the treatment is for cancer an immune related disease or an inflammatory disease.

These and other aspects which will become apparent during the following detailed description have been achieved by the inventor s discovery of 3 deuterium enriched 3 5 substituted 4 oxoquinazolin 3 4H yl piperidine 2 6 diones.

Deuterium D or H is a stable non radioactive isotope of hydrogen and has an atomic weight of 2.014. Hydrogen naturally occurs as a mixture of the isotopes H hydrogen or protium D H or deuterium and T H or tritium . The natural abundance of deuterium is 0.015 . One of ordinary skill in the art recognizes that in all chemical compounds with a H atom the H atom actually represents a mixture of H and D with about 0.015 being D. Thus compounds with a level of deuterium that has been enriched to be greater than its natural abundance of 0.015 should be considered unnatural and as a result novel over their non enriched counterparts. Thus the present invention relates to a deuterium enriched compound or compounds whose enrichment is greater than naturally occurring deuterated molecules.

All percentages given for the amount of deuterium present are mole percentages. Further when a variable is not accompanied by a definition the previous definition of the variable controls.

Unless indicated otherwise when a D is specifically recited at a position or is shown in a formula this D represents a mixture of hydrogen and deuterium where the amount of deuterium is about 100 i.e. the abundance of deuterium is from 90 to 100 . In certain aspects the abundance of deuterium is from 97 to 100 .

The 3 deuterium group i.e. the Z group in the present compounds means that the compounds have been isotopically enriched at the 3 position and are different and distinct from the corresponding non enriched compound.

Compound refers to a quantity of molecules that is sufficient to be weighed tested for its structural identity and to have a demonstrable use e.g. a quantity that can be shown to be active in an assay an in vitro test or in vivo test or a quantity that can be administered to a patient and provide a therapeutic benefit .

 Pharmaceutically acceptable salts refer to derivatives of the disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by making acid or base salts thereof. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include but are not limited to mineral or organic acid salts of the basic residues. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the conventional quaternary ammonium salts of the parent compound formed for example from non toxic inorganic or organic acids. These salts can be prepared in situ in the administration vehicle or the dosage form manufacturing process or by separately reacting a purified compound of the invention in its free base form with a suitable organic or inorganic acid and isolating the salt thus formed during subsequent purification. For example such conventional non toxic salts include but are not limited to those derived from inorganic and organic acids selected from 1 2 ethanedisulfonic 2 acetoxybenzoic 2 hydroxyethanesulfonic acetic ascorbic benzenesulfonic benzoic bicarbonic bisulfonic carbonic citric edetic ethanedisulfonic ethanesulfonic fumaric glucoheptonic gluconic glutamic glycolic glycollyarsanilic hexylresorcinic hydrobromic hydrochloric hydroiodic hydroxymaleic hydroxynaphthoic isethionic lactic lactobionic lauric laurylsulfonic maleic malic mandelic methanesulfonic napsylic naphthylic nitric oleic oxalic palmitic pamoic pantothenic phenylacetic phosphoric polygalacturonic propionic salicylic stearic succinic sulfamic sulfanilic sulfuric tannic tartaric toluenesulfonic and valeric. See for example Berge et al. 1977 Pharmaceutical Salts J. Pharm. Sci. 66 1 19. 

 Treat treating and treatment refer to the eradication or amelioration of a disease or disorder or of one or more symptoms associated with the disease or disorder. In certain embodiments the terms refer to minimizing the spread or worsening of the disease or disorder resulting from the administration of one or more prophylactic or therapeutic agents to a subject with such a disease or disorder.

 Prevent preventing and prevention refer to the prevention of the onset recurrence or spread of a disease or disorder or of one or more symptoms thereof.

 Manage managing and management refer to preventing or slowing the progression spread or worsening of a disease or disorder or of one or more symptoms thereof. In certain cases the beneficial effects that a subject derives from a prophylactic or therapeutic agent do not result in a cure of the disease or disorder.

 Prophylactically effective amount of a compound is an amount sufficient to prevent a disease or disorder or prevent its recurrence. A prophylactically effective amount of a compound means an amount of therapeutic agent alone or in combination with other agents which provides a prophylactic benefit in the prevention of the disease. The term prophylactically effective amount can encompass an amount that improves overall prophylaxis or enhances the prophylactic efficacy of another prophylactic agent.

The hydrogens present on the 3 5 substituted 4 oxoquinazolin 3 4H yl 3 deutero piperidine 2 6 diones have different capacities for exchange with deuterium. For example hydrogen atom Ris exchangeable in HO DO. Hydrogen atoms R Rand the 3 deuterium can be exchanged under basic conditions. The remaining hydrogen atoms are not easily exchangeable for deuterium atoms though some may be depending on the specific moieties selected for Rand R. Deuterium atoms at the remaining positions may be incorporated by the use of deuterated starting materials or intermediates via the known synthetic methods for the synthesis of 3 5 substituted 4 oxoquinazolin 3 4H yl piperidine 2 6 diones as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 635 700 US 700 e.g. see section 6 starting in Column 41 the contents of which are incorporated in its entirety herein by reference. It is contemplated that the presently described deuteriated 3 5 substituted 4 oxoquinazolin 3 4H yl 3 deutero piperidine 2 6 diones can be prepared by incorporating deuterated starting materials into the synthetic route of US 700. Alternatively deuterium is expected to be incorporated at the exchangeable and acidic positions of the final compound e.g. Ror the 3 position .

Scheme 1 below provides an exemplary synthetic route for preparing deuterated 3 5 substituted 4 oxoquinazolin 3 4H yl 3 deutero piperidine 2 6 diones.

The compounds of the present invention can be obtained starting with amino benzoic acid A e.g. 2 amino 6 methyl benzoic acid which can be optionally deuterated. When R H one can react compound A with CDI 1 1 carbonyldiimidazole followed by the introduction of compound B which is at least partially deuterated at Z to yield compound D. Depending on the chosen R compound D could be further modified.

When Z H in B deuterium can be introduced into C or D by contacting either C or D with a base e.g. NaOD in the presence of DO. Chiral chromatography or other known chiral isolation techniques can then be used to resolve the stereoisomers.

Alternatively when Ris desired to be other than H amide C can be formed by reacting A and B. Intermediate C then allows for various Rgroups to be introduced into compound D. For example triethyl orthoacetate can be used to form compound D providing R CH. Using triethyl orthoformate dshould result in R D.

A number of deuterated glutamines Compound B have previously been made including 2 3 4 trideutero glutamine i.e. R D R D and Z D which was made via the deuterium reduction of 6 carboxy 3 2H pyridazone see Stogniew J. Labelled Compounds and Radiopharmaceuticals 1981 18 6 897 903 and 2 2 3 3 4 pentadeutero glutamine i.e. R R D and Z D which was obtained in a multi step synthesis see Blomquist J. Org. Chem. 1966 12 4121 27 . Stogniew also notes that the 5 mono deutero glutamine could be obtained through deuterium reduction of 4 5 dihydro 6 carboxy 3 2H pyridazone.

If non stereospecific glutamine is used or if the stereospecificity is lost during the reaction it is expected that the resulting deuterated racemic mixture will be separable using known isolation techniques e.g. chiral chromatography .

Scheme 2 below provides an exemplary synthetic route for preparing stereospecific deuterated 3 5 substituted 4 oxoquinazolin 3 4H yl 3 deutero piperidine 2 6 diones.

When Ris an amino group or amino derivative one can arrive at deuterated 3 5 substituted 4 oxoquinazolin 3 4H yl 3 deutero piperidine 2 6 diones by starting with a benzo d 1 3 oxazin 4 one as shown in Scheme 3.

The 5 nitro 2 methyl benzo d 1 3 oxazin 4 one E can be prepared from 2 amino 6 nitrobenzoic acid and acetic anhydride. Reacting the oxazin 4 one with compound B should provide the nitro derivative of D. The amine R NH should be obtained through hydrogenation. Further modification of the amino group can then be made.

2 amino 6 tert butoxycarbonylamino methyl benzoic acid F can be made as described in US 700 columns 61 62. F can then be reacted with a carbonyl compound e.g. acetyl chloride and the resulting compound reacted with B to arrive at D. The amino protecting group can be removed and further modification of the amine can be performed.

Dosages of a compound provided herein or stereoisomer or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof vary depending on factors such as specific indication to be treated and or managed age and condition of a patient and amount of second active agent used if any. Generally a compound provided herein or stereoisomer or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be used in an amount of from about 0.1 mg to about 500 mg per day and can be adjusted in a conventional fashion e.g. the same amount administered each day of the treatment and or management period in cycles e.g. one week on one week off or in an amount that increases or decreases over the course of treatment and or management. In other aspects the dose can be from about 1 mg to about 300 mg from about 0.1 mg to about 150 mg from about 1 mg to about 200 mg from about 10 mg to about 100 mg from about 0.1 mg to about 50 mg from about 1 mg to about 50 mg from about 10 mg to about 50 mg from about 20 mg to about 30 mg or from about 1 mg to about 20 mg.

Pharmaceutical compositions can be used in the preparation of individual single unit dosage forms. Pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms provided herein comprise a compound provided herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt solvate or stereoisomer thereof. Pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms can further comprise one or more excipients.

Pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms provided herein can comprise one or more additional active ingredients. Examples of optional second or additional active ingredients are described above.

Single unit dosage forms provided herein are suitable for oral mucosal e.g. nasal sublingual vaginal buccal or rectal parenteral e.g. subcutaneous intravenous bolus injection intramuscular or intraarterial topical e.g. eye drops or other ophthalmic preparations transdermal or transcutaneous administration to a patient. Examples of dosage forms include but are not limited to tablets caplets capsules such as soft elastic gelatin capsules cachets troches lozenges dispersions suppositories powders aerosols e.g. nasal sprays or inhalers gels liquid dosage forms suitable for oral or mucosal administration to a patient including suspensions e.g. aqueous or non aqueous liquid suspensions oil in water emulsions or a water in oil liquid emulsions solutions and elixirs liquid dosage forms suitable for parenteral administration to a patient eye drops or other ophthalmic preparations suitable for topical administration and sterile solids e.g. crystalline or amorphous solids that can be reconstituted to provide liquid dosage forms suitable for parenteral administration to a patient.

The composition shape and type of dosage forms will typically vary depending on their use. For example a dosage form used in the acute treatment of a disease may contain larger amounts of one or more of the active ingredients it comprises than a dosage form used in the chronic treatment of the same disease. Similarly a parenteral dosage form may contain smaller amounts of one or more of the active ingredients it comprises than an oral dosage form used to treat the same disease. These and other ways in which specific dosage forms are used will vary from one another will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. See e.g. Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences 18th ed. Mack Publishing Easton Pa. 1990 .

In another aspect of the present invention the pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprise one or more excipients. Suitable excipients are well known to those skilled in the art of pharmacy and non limiting examples of suitable excipients are provided herein. Whether a particular excipient is suitable for incorporation into a pharmaceutical composition or dosage form depends on a variety of factors well known in the art including but are not limited to the way in which the dosage form will be administered to a patient. For example oral dosage forms such as tablets may contain excipients not suited for use in parenteral dosage forms. The suitability of a particular excipient may also depend on the specific active ingredients in the dosage form. For example the decomposition of some active ingredients may be accelerated by some excipients such as lactose or when exposed to water. Active ingredients that comprise primary or secondary amines are particularly susceptible to such accelerated decomposition. Consequently provided are pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms that contain little if any lactose other mono or di saccharides. As used herein the term lactose free means that the amount of lactose present if any is insufficient to substantially increase the degradation rate of an active ingredient.

Lactose free compositions can comprise excipients that are well known in the art and are listed for example in the U.S. Pharmacopeia USP 25 NF20 2002 . In general lactose free compositions comprise active ingredients a binder filler and a lubricant in pharmaceutically compatible and pharmaceutically acceptable amounts. In another aspect lactose free dosage forms comprise active ingredients microcrystalline cellulose pre gelatinized starch and magnesium stearate.

Also provided are anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprising active ingredients since water can facilitate the degradation of some compounds. For example the addition of water e.g. 5 is widely accepted in the pharmaceutical arts as a means of simulating long term storage in order to determine characteristics such as shelf life or the stability of formulations over time. See e.g. Jens T. Carstensen Drug Stability Principles Practice 2d. Ed. Marcel Dekker NY N.Y. 1995 pp. 379 80. In effect water and heat accelerate the decomposition of some compounds. Thus the effect of water on a formulation can be of great significance since moisture and or humidity are commonly encountered during manufacture handling packaging storage shipment and use of formulations.

Anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms can be prepared using anhydrous or low moisture containing ingredients and low moisture or low humidity conditions. Pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms that comprise lactose and at least one active ingredient that comprises a primary or secondary amine are preferably anhydrous if substantial contact with moisture and or humidity during manufacturing packaging and or storage is expected.

An anhydrous pharmaceutical composition should be prepared and stored such that its anhydrous nature is maintained. Accordingly anhydrous compositions are in another aspect packaged using materials known to prevent exposure to water such that they can be included in suitable formulary kits. Examples of suitable packaging include but are not limited to hermetically sealed foils plastics dose containers e.g. vials blister packs and strip packs.

Also provided are pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms that comprise one or more compounds that reduce the rate by which an active ingredient will decompose. Such compounds which are referred to herein as stabilizers include but are not limited to antioxidants such as ascorbic acid pH buffers or salt buffers.

Like the amounts and types of excipients the amounts and specific types of active ingredients in a dosage form may differ depending on factors such as but are not limited to the route by which it is to be administered to patients. In another aspect dosage forms comprise a compound provided herein in an amount of from about 0.10 to about 500 mg. Examples of dosages include but are not limited to 0.1 1 2 5 7.5 10 12.5 15 17.5 20 25 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 or 500 mg.

In another aspect dosage forms comprise the second active ingredient in an amount of 1 to about 1000 mg from about 5 to about 500 mg from about 10 to about 350 mg or from about 50 to about 200 mg. Of course the specific amount of the second active agent will depend on the specific agent used the diseases or disorders being treated or managed and the amount s of a compound provided herein and any optional additional active agents concurrently administered to the patient.

Pharmaceutical compositions that are suitable for oral administration can be provided as discrete dosage forms such as but are not limited to tablets e.g. chewable tablets caplets capsules and liquids e.g. flavored syrups . Such dosage forms contain predetermined amounts of active ingredients and may be prepared by methods of pharmacy well known to those skilled in the art. See generally Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences 18th ed. Mack Publishing Easton Pa. 1990 .

Oral dosage forms provided herein are prepared by combining the active ingredients in an intimate admixture with at least one excipient according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. Excipients can take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. For example excipients suitable for use in oral liquid or aerosol dosage forms include but are not limited to water glycols oils alcohols flavoring agents preservatives and coloring agents. Examples of excipients suitable for use in solid oral dosage forms e.g. powders tablets capsules and caplets include but are not limited to starches sugars micro crystalline cellulose diluents granulating agents lubricants binders and disintegrating agents.

In another aspect the present invention provides oral dosage forms that are tablets or capsules in which case solid excipients are employed. In another aspect the tablets can be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques. Such dosage forms can be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy. In general pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredients with liquid carriers finely divided solid carriers or both and then shaping the product into the desired presentation if necessary.

For example a tablet can be prepared by compression or molding. Compressed tablets can be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredients in a free flowing form such as powder or granules optionally mixed with an excipient. Molded tablets can be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.

Examples of excipients that can be used in oral dosage forms provided herein include but are not limited to binders fillers disintegrants and lubricants. Binders suitable for use in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include but are not limited to corn starch potato starch or other starches gelatin natural and synthetic gums such as acacia sodium alginate alginic acid other alginates powdered tragacanth guar gum cellulose and its derivatives e.g. ethyl cellulose cellulose acetate carboxymethyl cellulose calcium sodium carboxymethyl cellulose polyvinyl pyrrolidone methyl cellulose pre gelatinized starch hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose e.g. Nos. 2208 2906 2910 microcrystalline cellulose and mixtures thereof.

Suitable forms of microcrystalline cellulose include but are not limited to the materials sold as AVICEL PH 101 AVICEL PH 103 AVICEL RC 581 AVICEL PH 105 available from FMC Corporation American Viscose Division Avicel Sales Marcus Hook Pa. and mixtures thereof. An specific binder is a mixture of microcrystalline cellulose and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose sold as AVICEL RC 581. Suitable anhydrous or low moisture excipients or additives include AVICEL PH 103 and Starch 1500 LM.

Examples of fillers suitable for use in the pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms provided herein include but are not limited to talc calcium carbonate e.g. granules or powder microcrystalline cellulose powdered cellulose dextrates kaolin mannitol silicic acid sorbitol starch pre gelatinized starch and mixtures thereof. The binder or filler in pharmaceutical compositions is in another aspect present in from about 50 to about 99 weight percent of the pharmaceutical composition or dosage form.

Disintegrants may be used in the compositions to provide tablets that disintegrate when exposed to an aqueous environment. Tablets that contain too much disintegrant may disintegrate in storage while those that contain too little may not disintegrate at a desired rate or under the desired conditions. Thus a sufficient amount of disintegrant that is neither too much nor too little to detrimentally alter the release of the active ingredients may be used to form solid oral dosage forms. The amount of disintegrant used varies based upon the type of formulation and is readily discernible to those of ordinary skill in the art. In another aspect pharmaceutical compositions comprise from about 0.5 to about 15 weight percent of disintegrant or from about 1 to about 5 weight percent of disintegrant.

Disintegrants that can be used in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include but are not limited to agar agar alginic acid calcium carbonate microcrystalline cellulose croscarmellose sodium crospovidone polacrilin potassium sodium starch glycolate potato or tapioca starch other starches pre gelatinized starch other starches clays other algins other celluloses gums and mixtures thereof

Lubricants that can be used in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include but are not limited to calcium stearate magnesium stearate mineral oil light mineral oil glycerin sorbitol mannitol polyethylene glycol other glycols stearic acid sodium lauryl sulfate talc hydrogenated vegetable oil e.g. peanut oil cottonseed oil sunflower oil sesame oil olive oil corn oil and soybean oil zinc stearate ethyl oleate ethyl laureate agar and mixtures thereof. Additional lubricants include for example a Syloid silica gel AEROSIL200 manufactured by W.R. Grace Co. of Baltimore Md. a coagulated aerosol of synthetic silica marketed by Degussa Co. of Piano Tex. CAB O SIL a pyrogenic silicon dioxide product sold by Cabot Co. of Boston Mass. and mixtures thereof. If used at all lubricants may be used in an amount of less than about 1 weight percent of the pharmaceutical compositions or dosage forms into which they are incorporated.

In another aspect the present invention provides a solid oral dosage form comprising a compound provided herein anhydrous lactose microcrystalline cellulose polyvinylpyrrolidone stearic acid colloidal anhydrous silica and gelatin.

Active ingredients provided herein can also be administered by controlled release means or by delivery devices that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Examples include but are not limited to those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3 845 770 3 916 899 3 536 809 3 598 123 and 4 008 719 5 674 533 5 059 595 5 591 767 5 120 548 5 073 543 5 639 476 5 354 556 and 5 733 566 each of which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference. Such dosage forms can be used to provide slow or controlled release of one or more active ingredients using for example hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose other polymer matrices gels permeable membranes osmotic systems multilayer coatings microparticles liposomes microspheres or a combination thereof to provide the desired release profile in varying proportions. Suitable controlled release formulations known to those of ordinary skill in the art including those described herein can be readily selected for use with the active agents provided herein. In another aspect the present invention procies single unit dosage forms suitable for oral administration such as but are not limited to tablets capsules gelcaps and caplets that are adapted for controlled release.

Controlled release pharmaceutical products improve drug therapy over that achieved by their non controlled counterparts. In another aspect the present invention provides the use of a controlled release preparation in medical treatment characterized by a minimum of drug substance being employed to cure or control the condition in a minimum amount of time. Advantages of controlled release formulations include extended activity of the drug reduced dosage frequency and increased patient compliance. In addition controlled release formulations can be used to affect the time of onset of action or other characteristics such as blood levels of the drug and can thus affect the occurrence of side e.g. adverse effects.

In another aspect the controlled release formulations are designed to initially release an amount of drug active ingredient that promptly produces the desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect and gradually and continually release of other amounts of drug to maintain this level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. In another aspect in order to maintain a constant level of drug in the body the drug can be released from the dosage form at a rate that will replace the amount of drug being metabolized and excreted from the body. Controlle release of an active ingredient can be stimulated by various conditions including but are not limited to pH temperature enzymes water or other physiological conditions or compounds.

Parenteral dosage forms can be administered to patients by various routes including but are not limited to subcutaneous intravenous including bolus injection intramuscular and intraarterial. Administration of a parenteral dosage form bypasses patients natural defenses against contaminants and thus in these aspects parenteral dosage forms are sterile or capable of being sterilized prior to administration to a patient. Examples of parenteral dosage forms include but are not limited to solutions ready for injection dry products ready to be dissolved or suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle for injection suspensions ready for injection and emulsions.

Suitable vehicles that can be used to provide parenteral dosage forms are well known to those skilled in the art. Examples include but are not limited to Water for Injection USP aqueous vehicles such as but are not limited to Sodium Chloride Injection Ringer s Injection Dextrose Injection Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection and Lactated Ringer s Injection water miscible vehicles such as but are not limited to ethyl alcohol polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol and nonaqueous vehicles such as but are not limited to corn oil cottonseed oil peanut oil sesame oil ethyl oleate isopropyl myristate and benzyl benzoate.

Compounds that increase the solubility of one or more of the active ingredients disclosed herein can also be incorporated into the parenteral dosage forms. For example cyclodextrin and its derivatives can be used to increase the solubility of a compound provided herein. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 134 127 which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference.

Topical and mucosal dosage forms provided herein include but are v limited to sprays aerosols solutions emulsions suspensions eye drops or other ophthalmic preparations or other forms known to one of skill in the art. See e.g. Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th and 18th eds. Mack Publishing Easton Pa. 1980 1990 and Introduction to Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms 4th ed. Lea Febiger Philadelphia 1985 . Dosage forms suitable for treating mucosal tissues within the oral cavity can be formulated as mouthwashes or as oral gels.

Suitable excipients e.g. carriers and diluents and other materials that can be used to provide topical and mucosal dosage forms encompassed herein are well known to those skilled in the pharmaceutical arts and depend on the particular tissue to which a given pharmaceutical composition or dosage form will be applied. In another aspect excipients include but are not limited to water acetone ethanol ethylene glycol propylene glycol butane 1 3 diol isopropyl myristate isopropyl palmitate mineral oil and mixtures thereof to form solutions emulsions or gels which are nontoxic and pharmaceutically acceptable. Moisturizers or humectants can also be added to pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms. Examples of additional ingredients are well known in the art. See e.g. Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th and 18th eds. Mack Publishing Easton Pa. 1980 1990 .

The pH of a pharmaceutical composition or dosage form may also be adjusted to improve delivery of one or more active ingredients. Also the polarity of a solvent carrier its ionic strength or tonicity can be adjusted to improve delivery. Compounds such as stearates can also be added to pharmaceutical compositions or dosage forms to alter the hydrophilicity or lipophilicity of one or more active ingredients so as to improve delivery. In other aspects stearates can serve as a lipid vehicle for the formulation as an emulsifying agent or surfactant or as a delivery enhancing or penetration enhancing agent. In other aspects salts solvates prodrugs or stereoisomers of the active ingredients can be used to further adjust the properties of the resulting composition.

In another aspect the active ingredients provided herein are not administered to a patient at the same time or by the same route of administration. In another aspect provided are kits which can simplify the administration of appropriate amounts of active ingredients.

In another aspect the present invention provides a kit comprising a dosage form of a compound provided herein. Kits can further comprise additional active ingredients such as oblimersen Genasense melphalan G CSF GM CSF EPO topotecan dacarbazine irinotecan taxotere IFN COX 2 inhibitor pentoxifylline ciprofloxacin dexamethasone IL 2 IL 8 IL 18 Ara C vinorelbine isotretinoin 13 cis retinoic acid or a pharmacologically active mutant or derivative thereof or a combination thereof. Examples of the additional active ingredients include but are not limited to those disclosed herein.

In other aspects the kits can further comprise devices that are used to administer the active ingredients. Examples of such devices include but are not limited to syringes drip bags patches and inhalers.

Kits can further comprise cells or blood for transplantation as well as pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles that can be used to administer one or more active ingredients. For example if an active ingredient is provided in a solid form that must be reconstituted for parenteral administration the kit can comprise a sealed container of a suitable vehicle in which the active ingredient can be dissolved to form a particulate free sterile solution that is suitable for parenteral administration. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles include but are not limited to Water for Injection USP aqueous vehicles such as but are not limited to Sodium Chloride Injection Ringer s Injection Dextrose Injection Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection and Lactated Ringer s Injection water miscible vehicles such as but are not limited to ethyl alcohol polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol and non aqueous vehicles such as but are not limited to corn oil cottonseed oil peanut oil sesame oil ethyl oleate isopropyl myristate and benzyl benzoate.

Plasma proteins were precipitated by addition of acetonitrile containing internal standard ISTD tolbutamide and the supernatants were analyzed semi quantitatively by LC MS MS with elution on a chiral column Daicel ChiralPak IE 3 for the separation of enantiomers isocratic method of 20 80 v v 0.1 acetic acid in water and acetonitrile . Peak areas for the deuterated enantiomers and 3 5 amino 2 methyl 4 oxoquinazolin 3 4H yl 3 H piperidine 2 6 dione were normalized to the ISTD and corrected for the isotopic peak of the corresponding protonated enantiomer and 3 5 amino 2 methyl 4 oxoquinazolin 3 4H yl piperidine 2 6 dione respectively if present. Corrected data were analyzed and plotted using Microsoft Excel 2013 Microsoft Corp Redmond Wash. and the Excel Solver.

Scheme 1 below illustrates the possible reactions in a solution of deuterated racemate. The deuterium in both enantiomers d and d can be lost by D H exchange to give both protonated enantiomers h and h with rate constants k k k k. At the same time the protonated enantiomers h and h can exchange with enantiomerization rate constants kand k. All four compounds can also degrade with potentially different degradation rate constants k k k k.

Human and mouse plasma data were analyzed independently. Independent analyses of the data for h and h were performed first and the average rate constants kand k from these two fits were calculated and used as constants in the fitting of the stability data of the deuterated racemate. Calculated concentrations were obtained through numerical approximation of differential equations 1 and 2 for the stability studies of h and h and equations 3 to 6 for the stability study of deuterated racemate 50 50 d d by the Euler method equation 7 . The step between calculated time points was minimized in order to minimize the local error proportional to the square of the step size and the global error proportional to the step size .

To limit the complexity of calculations the assumption was made that degradation was not affected by the isotopic substitution or the chirality hence k k h k k. The average degradation rate constant obtained by fitting the data for h and h was used in the fit of the stability data of the deuterated racemate. Data analysis was performed in Microsoft Excel 2013 using the Solver Generalized Reduced Gradient Nonlinear method with central derivatives to minimize the sum of sums of weighted square of difference between ISTD normalized experimental data and calculated value divided by the experimental data.

The observed and fitted data are shown in for human plasma. The observed and fitted data are shown in for mouse plasma. Fitted parameters are presented in Table 1.

Female CB.17 SCID mice 8 12 weeks of age were administered a single dose of protonated racemate h rac 30 mg kg d 15 mg kg or d 15 mg kg by oral gavage. Deuterated enantiomers i.e. d and d used in this study contain 10 of the corresponding protonated enantiomer. Blood was collected into potassium EDTA KEDTA containers by terminal cardiac puncture under carbon dioxide anesthesia from N 3 per group per time point at 0.25 0.5 1 2 4 8 and 24 h post dose. Plasma was isolated frozen and stored until ready for analysis.

Samples were prepared for quantitative analysis by liquid liquid extraction in methyl t butylether MTBE with ondansetron as internal standard ISTD . MTBE was evaporated under nitrogen flow and samples were reconstituted in 1 acetic acid in water acetonitrile 20 80 . Analysis was performed by chiral LC MS MS on a Daicel ChiralPak IE 3 column using an isocratic LC method of 0.1 acetic acid in water and acetonitrile 20 80 v v . ISTD normalized peak areas for deuterated enantiomers d and d were corrected from interference from naturally occurring isotopes of the protonated analytes. Concentrations were obtained by interpolation on standard curves prepared in mouse plasma using standard solutions of the analytes.

Data was plotted in Excel 2013 Microsoft Corp Redmond Wash. and analyzed within Excel using the PKSolver add in version 2.0 as described in Zhang Y. et at Comput. Methods Programs Biomed. 99 2010 306 314 to determine pharmacokinetic parameters including exposure as area under the curve AUC and elimination half life t . Pharmacokinetic profiles are shown in and selected pharmacokinetic parameters are presented in Table 1 below.

The experimental results indicate that elimination is fast t 1 2 h for both protonated and deuterated enantiomers of 3 5 amino 2 methyl 4 oxoquinazolin 3 4H yl piperidine 2 6 dione irrespective of chirality. Exposure to the enantiomers of the protonated molecule is stereoselective with h representing 39 of the total exposure. Exposure to the deuterated enantiomers shows the same stereoselectivity. Exposure to the protonated enantiomers h and h upon administration of the deuterated enantiomers represents about 10 14 of the total exposure corresponding to the amount of protonated compound in the dosed material. Little to no D H exchange is evidenced in the pharmacokinetic parameters and exposure to the dosed enantiomer protonated and deuterated represents 96 98 of the total exposure.

Female CB.17 SCID mice 8 12 weeks of age N 60 were administered 1 10H929 tumor cells in 50 Matrigel subcutaneously in their flank 0.2 mL mouse . Animals were returned to their cages and tumor growth was monitored. Tumor size was reported as tumor volume Vol calculated as Vol L W where L and W are the length and width of the tumor as measured by caliper L W . A pair match was performed when tumors reached an average size of 100 150 mmand the animals were divided into 6 treatment groups of N 10 animals each.

Animals were treated daily by oral gavage 10 mL kg with vehicle d 1.5 or 15 mg kg d 1.5 or 15 mg kg or h rac racemic mixture of protonated enantiomers h and h 3 mg kg . The compound h rac was administered at twice the dose of the deuterated enantiomers since it contains 50 i.e. 1.5 mg kg of each enantiomer. Body weight measurements were taken daily for the first week then biweekly. Tumor sizes were measured by caliper biweekly. The study was terminated after 23 days of dosing then all animals were euthanized.

Tumor volume as a function of time is shown in . As the results in show deuterated enantiomer d was more potent at limiting tumor growth at both doses than h rac i.e. the racemic mixture of compound not enriched in deuterium . The other deuterated enantiomer i.e. d was less efficacious than d and efficacy for d was observed only at the highest dose of d .
