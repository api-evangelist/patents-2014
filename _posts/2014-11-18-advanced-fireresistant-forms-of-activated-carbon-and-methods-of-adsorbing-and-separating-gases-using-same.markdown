The present invention is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 896 096 filed Oct. 1 2010 entitled ADVANCED FIRE RESISTANT FORMS OF ACTIVATED CARBON AND METHODS OF ADSORBING AND SEPARATING GASES USING SAME which is incorporated by reference herein.

This invention was developed under Contract DE AC04 94AL85000 between Sandia Corporation and the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. Government has certain rights in the invention.

The invention relates to advanced fire resistant forms of activated carbon that contain hydrated and or carbonate containing minerals e.g. hydrated magnesium carbonates hydrated magnesium chloride hydroxides hydrated magnesium silicates hydrated calcium and sodium citrates calcium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate and methods of using such advanced activated carbon formulations to adsorb and or to separate gases in a gas stream.

Reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel e.g. PUREX reprocessing generates nuclear off gas that contains several radioactive isotopes including gaseous I and noble gases Kr and Xe. Entrapping noble gas nuclides for permanent disposal is technically challenging because they are chemically inert. Only very aggressive agents such as fluorine can form compounds with noble gas nuclides. The half lives of Kr and Xe are 10.7 years and 5.3 days respectively. As the half life of Xe is sufficiently short the Xe activity would be negligible if the spent fuel were stored for several months before reprocessing. Therefore the separation and capture of Kr becomes a key issue in trapping radioactive noble gases.

Several methods have been proposed for trapping radioactive noble gas streams from the off gas. These methods include cryogenic distillation and membrane separation. The cryogenic distillation process is well understood. However the drawbacks include higher operating cost and the potential for fire hazard because of ozone accumulation. The membrane separation process also has high operating cost and low throughput or efficiency.

Activated carbon is one known adsorbent which has a high capacity to adsorb noble gases. In addition activated carbon is relatively inexpensive in comparison to the cryogenic and membrane separation methods. Activated carbon however poses a significant fire hazard. For trapping of noble gases and particularly trapping of radioactive Kr an activated carbon adsorbent that does not pose a significant fire hazard would provide economical and efficient permanent disposal or long term storage options. Such an activated carbon would therefore be desirable.

In addition activated carbon adsorbents that do not pose a significant fire risk would be desirable in other industries. For instance in the chemical and petrochemical industries activated carbon adsorbers are used to control emissions of solvents and other volatile organic compounds VOC s from process streams off gases and tank ventings. The volatile organic compounds associated with petrochemical industries include for example and not limited to benzene toluene xylene o p m isomers petroleum distillate fractions naphtha 2 butoxyethanol and ethyl benzene.

In the fields of environmental engineering nuclear military and specialist extraction activated carbon is also used to remove VOC s and other chemicals. For example aliphatic aromatic unsaturates and alicyclics hydrocarbons and other pollutants are present in the atmosphere of submarines and are removed by activated carbon beds. Despite their use in these industries the fire risk posed by the activated carbon is of great concern and there have been a number of fire accidents related to activated carbon ignition. Thus an advanced fire resistant activated carbon material would be desirable in such other industries as well.

The term one or more hydrated and or carbonate containing mineral as used herein means one or more hydrated minerals one or more carbonate containing minerals or a combination of one or more hydrated minerals and one or more carbonate containing minerals.

Some advanced forms of activated carbon according to the invention comprise a mixture of activated carbon and a fire suppressing additive or agent. The fire suppressing additive or agent can be a material that releases water or carbon dioxide or both water and carbon dioxide when heated. The fire suppressing additive or agent can be mechanically mixed with combined with incorporated into impregnated into adsorbed onto and or bonded or joined to the activated carbon material.

In one embodiment the ingredients the activated carbon and the one or more fire suppressing additives for making up an advanced activated carbon composition are first manually mixed. Then the manually mixed material is loaded into a McCrone Micronising Mill mixer mill Glen Creston Limited and ground to a sub micron size. This produces a homogeneous mixture agglomeration of sub micron size particles without any observable phase separation between the activated carbon and fire suppressing additive s . Visually the homogeneous mixture of sub micron size particles typically appears uniformly black. Some advanced forms of activated carbon according to the invention comprise an activated carbon and a nano structured hydrated metal carbonate or metal silicate solid phase additive or agent wherein the hydrated metal carbonate or metal silicate solid is capable of releasing structural water at elevated temperatures e.g. less than or equal to 500 C. and can also be capable of producing other endothermic reactions e.g. up to 900 C. e.g. carbon dioxide.

The fire suppressing agents or additives according to the invention may be a hydrated metal carbonate and or a hydrated metal silicate.

In some embodiments the advanced activated carbon composition can comprise a mixture of activated carbon and at least one carbon dioxide evolvable additive wherein the carbon dioxide evolvable additive evolves i.e. releases carbon dioxide gas when the composition is heated above 300 C. The carbon dioxide evolvable additive can additionally comprise structural water e.g. in a hydrated structural form wherein water vapor is released when the composition is heated above 100 C.

Some examples of carbon dioxide evolvable additives according to the invention include hydromagnesite hydrated nesquehonite hydrated calcium citrate tribasic sodium citrate dihydrate magnesium chloride hydroxide hydrate sodium bicarbonate and calcium carbonate and combinations thereof.

Hydrated metal carbonates useful in some embodiments of the invention may be hydromagnesite e.g. Mg CO OH .4HO hydrated nesquehonite e.g. MgCO.3HO hydrated calcium citrate tribasic e.g. Ca CHO .4HO sodium citrate dihydrate e.g. Na CHO .2HO magnesium chloride hydroxide hydrate e.g. Mg OH Cl.4HO or e.g. Mg OH Cl.4HO or any combination thereof.

Activated carbons useful in embodiments of the invention include without limitation commercially available activated carbon for example activated carbon available from Alfar Aesar .

The chemical formulas shown in Table 1 and elsewhere show specific examples of a specific amount i.e. degree of hydration. For example an example of the formula for hydromagnesite is shown as Mg CO OH .4HO in Inventive Example 1. However in real minerals the degree of hydration is variable depending on the processing conditions amount of impurities etc. Therefore when we state a particular mineral e.g. hydromagnesite we define that term to include a realistic range in the degree amount of hydration. For example we define the term hydromagnesite to include a range in hydration states Mg CO OH .NHO where N can range from 0.5 to 11. In other words the term hydromagnesite is broadly defined herein to include similar phases and their solid solutions with other degrees of hydration than just N 4.

Other examples of suitable hydrated carbonate containing minerals which can be combined with activated carbon to make an advanced activated carbon composition according to the present invention include dypingite e.g. Mg CO OH .5HO giorgiosite e.g. Mg CO OH .5HO widgiemoolthalite e.g. Ni Mg CO OH .4.5HO pokrovskite e.g. Mg CO OH .0.5HO coalingite e.g. MgFe CO OH .2HO brugnatellite e.g. MgFe CO OH .4HO artinite e.g. Mg CO OH .3HO hydrotalcite e.g. MgAl CO OH .4HO manasseite e.g. MgAl CO OH .4HO chlorartinite e.g. Mg CO Cl OH 3HO barbertonite e.g. MgCr CO OH .4HO stichtite e.g. MgCr CO OH .4HO desautelsite e.g. MgMn CO OH .4HO pyroaurite e.g. MgFe CO OH .4HO sjogrenite e.g. MgFe CO OH .4HO sergeevite e.g. MgCa CO HCO OH .6HO mountkeithite e.g. Mg Ni Fe Cr SO CO OH .11HO and baylissite e.g. KMg CO .4HO and combinations thereof.

In some embodiments of the invention the hydrated magnesite hydromagnesite is present in the advanced activated carbon in an amount in the range of 15 to 40 wt alternatively between 20 and 36 wt alternatively between 22 and 30 wt alternatively between 30 and 37 wt or alternatively between 33 and 35 wt .

In some embodiments of the invention the hydrated nesquehonite is present in the advanced activated carbon in an amount in the range of 30 to 50 wt alternatively between 35 and 48 wt alternatively between 38 and 40 wt alternatively between 40 and 46 wt or alternatively between 44 and 46 wt .

Hydromagnesite can be synthesized by first mixing a 1.0 M NaCOsolution with a 1 M MgClsolution at 21 C. Then after one day the precipitates were filtered out with vacuum filtration. The filtered material was then dried at 60 C. for one day. In a similar fashion hydrated nesquehonite can be synthesized by first mixing a 1.4 M NHHCOsolution with a 2.0 M MgClsolution at 50 C. on a hot plate with stirring for 2 hours. Then the solution was put on a lab bench at 21 C. for two days. The precipitates were then filtered out with vacuum filtration. The filtered precipitates were dried at 21 C. for one day. The synthesized hydromagnesite and nesquehonite have well defined XRD patterns as shown in . The top curve in is for nesquehonite and the bottom curve is for hydromagnesite.

The final composition especially for the mixing product produced during the synthesizing hydromagnesite in the presence of activated carbon can be described as an agglomerate or agglomeration.

In another embodiment of a method of making the inventive compositions the method steps can comprise the following. First 100 mL of 1 M NaCOwas prepared and placed into a beaker with a stir bar. Then desired amounts of activated carbon were put into the beaker to make a slurry. After that 100 mL of 1 m MgClsolution was added into the beaker and hydromagnesite started to precipitate. The stir bar continuously stirred the solution slurry for the entire period of synthesis. Then the solids are filtered out from the liquid and the solids dried. Finally the solids are mechanically ground milled to a sub micron size which produces the final advanced activated carbon composition. In this embodiment the activated carbon is added to the beaker before the hydromagnesite is precipitated out. In this case we call this process as a chemical precipitation mixing method. In contrast if this activated carbon was added to the beaker after the hydromagnesite had been precipitated out then we would call that process a simple mechanical mixing process.

A preferred process is to add the activated carbon to the beaker before the MgClsolution is added into the beaker to precipitate hydromagnesite or other hydrated mineral .

The chemical precipitation mixing method described above can be used to prepare any of the inventive examples and embodiments listed in Table 1 as well as for any of the other hydrated and or carbonate minerals listed in this application.

In some embodiments of the invention the hydrated sepiolite is present in the advanced activated carbon in an amount in the range of 30 to 50 wt alternatively between 35 and 48 wt alternatively between 40 and 47 wt or alternatively between 44 and 46 wt .

In some embodiments of the invention the hydrated calcium citrate tribasic is present in the advanced activated carbon in an amount in the range of 45 to 60 wt alternatively between 48 and 58 wt alternatively between 50 and 56 wt or alternatively between 53 and 55 wt .

In some embodiments of the invention the sodium bicarbonate is present in the advanced activated carbon in an amount in the range of 40 to 75 wt alternatively between 45 and 70 wt or alternatively between 48 and 68 wt .

Some advanced activated carbons of the invention can have a Krypton adsorption rate constant at 25 C. of equal to or greater than 0.35 mg g min alternatively greater than 0.48 mg g min alternatively greater than 0.65 mg g min or alternatively greater than 0.73 mg g min.

The method of removing a target gas from a gas stream of the invention comprises contacting the gas stream with one or more of the advanced activated carbon described herein. By way of example but not by way of limitation such advanced activated carbon may be selected from the group consisting of an advanced activated carbon comprising between 15 and 40 wt hydrated magnesite an advanced activated carbon comprising between 30 and 50 wt hydrated sepiolite an advanced activated carbon comprising between 30 and 45 wt hydrated nesquehonite an advanced activated carbon comprising between 45 and 60 wt hydrated calcium citrate tribasic an advanced activated carbon comprising between 40 and 70 wt sodium bicarbonate and any combination thereof.

In some embodiments of the inventive method the contacting with a gas stream occurs at a temperatures between room temperature and a measured ignition temperature alternatively between 15 and 30 C. alternatively between 20 and 27 C. alternatively between 25 and 250 C. alternatively between 20 and 200 C. or alternatively between 50 and 150 C.

In some embodiments of the inventive method structural water and or COare released from the advanced activated carbon when heated.

In some embodiments the hydrated magnesium carbonate is hydrated nesquehonite and up to 40 wt water based on the total weight of the hydrated nesquehonite is released during the contacting alternatively up to 30 wt water is released alternatively up to 35 wt water is released.

In some embodiments the hydrated magnesium carbonate is hydromagnesite and up to 16 wt water based on the total weight of the hydromagnesite is released during the contacting alternatively up to 15 wt water is released alternatively up to 13 wt water is released.

In some embodiments the hydrated magnesium silicate is hydrated sepiolite and up to 18 wt water based on the total weight of the hydrated sepiolite is released during the contacting alternatively up to 17 wt water is released alternatively up to 15 wt water is released.

In some embodiments the advanced activated carbon comprises hydrated calcium citrate tribasic and up to 13 wt water based on the total weight of the hydrated calcium citrate tribasic is released during the contacting alternatively up to 12 wt water is released alternatively up to 10 wt water is released.

In some embodiments of the inventive method the target gas is selected from the group of noble gases I gas volatile organic compounds and combinations thereof.

Without being bound by any particular theory it is believed that the inventive advanced forms of activated carbon substantially decrease or eliminate the risk of fire due to the ability to release structural water when heated. As the ignition temperature of standard activated carbon is 250 C. and exothermic oxidative reactions of activated carbon occur at temperature as low as 200 C. the advanced forms of activated carbon contain fire suppressing agents or additives that can release structural water well below 200 C. the exothermic oxidative reaction temperature of activated carbon if they are heated during adsorption or separation processes or during material storage. The released water then can capture heat released because water has a large heat capacity thereby preventing the temperature from reaching the temperature required for the oxidative reactions of the activated carbon. At higher temperatures the inert gas COis released which acts as a diluent to lower the partial pressure of oxygen in the surrounding environment acting further to suppress the process of fire ignition and burning.

Any numerical range recited herein includes all values from the lower value and the upper value in increments of one unit provided that there is a separation of at least two units between any lower value and any higher value. As an example if it is stated that a compositional physical or other property such as for example molecular weight is from 100 to 1 000 it is intended that all individual values such as 100 101 102 etc. and sub ranges such as 100 to 144 155 to 170 197 to 200 etc. are expressly enumerated in this specification. For ranges containing values which are less than one or containing fractional numbers greater than one e.g. 1.1 1.5 etc. one unit is considered to be 0.0001 0.001 0.01 or 0.1 as appropriate. For ranges containing single digit numbers less than ten e.g. 1 to 5 one unit is typically considered to be 0.1. These are only examples of what is specifically intended and all possible combinations of numerical values between the lowest value and the highest value enumerated are to be considered to be expressly stated in this application.

The above description and examples that follow illustrate but do not limit various aspects or embodiments of this invention.

Each of the advanced activated carbons of embodiments of the invention were prepared by first separately weighing out the desired masses of the one or more hydrated and or carbonated containing minerals and activated carbon and then mixing such amounts by mechanical mixing e.g. by using a mortar and pestle to grind the ingredients by hand .

Gas adsorption measurements were made gravimetrically using the vacuum microbalance in a Netzsch STA 409 thermal gravimetric analyzer TGA with differential scanning calorimeter DSC and Differential Thermal Analyzer DTA . The masses of each advanced activated carbon sample were first measured with a Mettler Toledo AT 261 Delta Range balance with a precision to 0.0001 g 0.1 mg . The advanced activated carbon sample mass was usually about 100 mg. The advanced activated carbon sample was then loaded into a small crucible in the TGA the system purged to vacuum followed by a backfill of a noble gas to the desired pressure. Specifically the advanced activated carbon samples were analyzed for adsorption of Ar and Kr gases each at 0.2 to 0.9 atmospheric pressures. The advanced activated carbon samples were then analyzed to determine the amount of noble gas adsorption by using an automated time temperature profile. The time temperature profile was as follows 1 heating to 90 C. 2 maintaining at 90 C. for two hours desorption step in which desorbed gas was purged out of the system via an exhaust tube 3 cooling to room temperature with noble gas being backfilled and 4 maintaining at room temperature for two hours adsorption step . The amount of adsorbed noble gas on an advanced activated carbon sample was determined by the weight difference between an activated carbon sample analysis from an instrumental blank. The instrumental blank was made by employing the same but empty crucible which was used for the activated carbon sample analyses. The time temperature profile for the instrumental blank and a sample analysis were the same. The amounts of absorbed noble gas are calculated based on the mass of noble gas absorbed in the adsorption step as the desorption step serves as a zero background. The TGA was subjected to the same time temperature profile and the weight gain subtracted from the instrumental blank in order to eliminate any effect of weight gain by the TGA itself.

The advanced activated carbon compositions were characterized using X ray diffractometer XRD Burker D8 Advance .

Table 1 provides the chemical composition of Inventive Examples 1 6. Table 2 provides the chemical composition of Comparative Examples 1 2.

Table 3 provides the results of analyses of adsorption amounts of Ar and Kr gases on each of the Inventive and Comparative Examples and commercial activated carbon. It is clear that the gas adsorption capacities of the inventive advanced forms of activated carbon are comparable to those of commercially available activated carbon and are superior to those of Na mordenite and to NH mordenite.

Table 4 provides the weight percentage of structural water released from the hydrated solid phase additives as a function of temperature. Notice that the hydromagnesite and hydrated nesquehonite additives release more than 15 wt of structural water below 300 C. In addition these two agents release COabove 350 C. see e.g. . Notice also that the total amount of water released measured experimentally agrees well with the theoretical water content in 3 out of the 4 additives tested in Table 4.

Table 5 provides the gas adsorption rate constants at 680 torr and 25 C. for each of the Inventive and Comparative Examples and DARCO activated carbon. The results in Table 5 indicate that the inventive advanced forms of fire resistant activated carbon have gas adsorption rate constants higher than those of both the Na mordenite and to NH mordenites which have been considered for adsorption of radioactive noble gases and are comparable to those of activated carbon .

The K Kgas adsorption selectivity ratio is defined as the ratio of the gas adsorption rate constant for krypton divided by the gas adsorption rate constant for argon. In particular Inventive Example 5 has a K Kgas adsorption selectivity ratio greater than 8.

Flammability tests were also performed as described herein. Activated carbon was obtained from Alfar Aesar AAAC and was used to prepare all Inventive and Comparative Examples. All flammability tests were performed in air at a flow rate of 60 cubic centimeter per minute 60 cm min with a heating rate of 20 C. min up to 1200 C. Flammability tests are focused on determination of spontaneous ignition temperatures SIT . The SITs are graphically determined based on the differential scanning calorimetry DSC curves or thermogravimetric analysis TGA curves as discussed below and in by Y. Suzin et al Carbon vol. 37 pp. 335 346 1999 .

In the DSC analysis the SIT is defined as the intersection of the baseline and the slope at the inflection point of the sample power density mW mg in the plot of power density versus temperature. Similarly in the TGA the SIT is defined as the intersection of the baseline and the slope at the inflection point of the sample mass in the plot of mass change versus temperature. In the SIT of AAAC is determined as 300 10 C. based on the DSC curve. The graphical determination method results in an uncertainty of 10 C. In Table 6 the SITs for Inventive Examples 1 9 as well as for the pure AAAC are listed. As the Inventive Examples have strong endothermic reactions all SITs for the Inventive Examples are determined based on the TGA curves. The baselines of mass retained are constructed after consideration of mass changes associated with endothermic reactions See .

Each of the Inventive Examples has much higher SITs in comparison with the AAAC reference material. For instance the SIT of Inventive Example 7 is 560 C. higher than that of AAAC. In addition a portion of the activated carbon survives in the Inventive Examples even after heating to 1200 C. as residual activated carbon was observed after the advanced forms of activated were heated to 1200 C. Thus the fire hazard is eliminated when using the advanced forms of activated carbon of the invention.

In summary the Inventive Examples outperform the Comparative Examples in both adsorption capacities and kinetics for adsorption of noble gases. Moreover the Inventive Examples have adsorption capacities and kinetics comparable to those of commercially available activated carbon. As can be seen by the very high structural ignition temperatures of Table 6 the inventive use of one or more carbon dioxide evolving additives with or without structural water contained in the additives by the compositions of the Inventive Examples the Inventive Examples do not pose a fire hazard.

The advanced fire resistant forms of activated carbon according to the present invention have high gas adsorption capacities and rapid adsorption kinetics comparable to commercially available activated carbon without having any intrinsic fire hazard.

They also have superior performance to Mordenites in both adsorption capacities and kinetics. In addition the Inventive Examples do not pose the fibrous inhalation hazard that exists with use of Mordenites.
