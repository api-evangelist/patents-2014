The present in relates to compositions of matter for the prevention of and or treatment of a spinal disorder and or spinal pain e.g. caused by and or associated with intervertebral disc degeneration and methods of treatment of a spinal disorder and or spinal pain.

The following publications provide conventional techniques of molecular biology. Such procedures are described for example in the following texts that are incorporated by reference 

Persistent back pain poses a significant economic burden to society mainly in terms of the large number of work days lost by patients who develop chronic back pain. The major cause of persistent back pain is intervertebral disc IVD degeneration. In this respect in USA alone approximately 5.7 million people are diagnosed with IVD degeneration each year.

An IVD is a specialized connective tissue composed of a pad of fibrocartilage found between the bony vertebrae of the spine. IVDs act as a shock absorber to cushion the compressive rotational and tensile forces applied to the vertebral column. An IVD comprises at least three elements a tough outer tissue called the annulus fibrosus AF comprising concentric layers of intertwined annular bands comprising primarily collagen type I fibers a nucleus pulposus NP within the AF comprising a viscous gel containing proteoglycan and water held loosely together by an irregular network of collagen type II and elastin fibers and flat circular plates of cartilage that connect the vertebrae above and below the disc to the AF. The major proteoglycan found in the NP is the glucosaminoglycan aggrecan which is high in chondroitin sulfate and keratin sulfate. This proteoglycan provides osmotic properties needed to resist compression in the disc Adams and Roughley 31 2151 2161 2006 . Cells of the NP are initially notochord cells that are gradually replaced during childhood by rounded cells resembling the chondrocytes of articular cartilage. Cells of the AF are fibroblast like elongated parallel to the collagen fibers in the AF. Cell density declines with age and is extremely low in adults especially in the NP.

Fibrocartilage found in an IVD differs to other forms of cartilage e.g. hyaline cartilage or elastic cartilage. For example the fibrocartilage found in IVDs contain cartilage 1 or type 1 cartilage whereas this form of cartilage does not occur in hyaline cartilage or elastic cartilage. Moreover the extracellular matrix within an IVD differs from that found in other cartilage e.g. hyaline cartilage in so far as it contains a high proteoglycan to collagen ratio e.g. extracellular matrix of IVD has a ratio of proteoglycan to collagen of about 27 1 whereas hyaline cartilage has a ratio of about 2 1 Mwale et al. 8 58 64 2004 . The increased level of proteoglycan relative to collagen in an IVD explains to some degree the gelatinous nature of an IVD which is required for transmitting load applied to the IVD and providing the shock absorbing nature of these organs. In contrast to IVD other forms of cartilage e.g. hyaline cartilage or articular cartilage operate in isolation and must retain their own shape and as a consequence a higher concentration of collagen to proteoglycan is desired to provide such a firm and resilient nature Mwale et al. supra .

At the microscopic level proteoglycans of IVD extracellular matrix also differ from those of other forms of cartilage including articular cartilage nasal cartilage growth plate cartilage and menesci. For example articular cartilage nasal cartilage growth plate cartilage and menesci contain large aggregates of proteoglycan formed from hyaluronic acid central filaments in addition to large nonaggregated monomers. In contrast to these cartilages IVDs contain short non aggregated proteoglycan monomers and clusters of monomers without central filaments Buckwalter et al. 7 146 151 1989 . These differences in composition of IVDs and other forms of cartilage are indicative of significant differences in collagen and or proteoglycan metabolism between these tissues.

IVD degeneration is associated with a series of biochemical and morphologic changes that combine to alter the biomechanical properties of the disc. During IVD degeneration the concentration of proteoglycans in the NP and the water retaining potential of the disc decrease dramatically. There are also changes in the collagen content of the NP as the synthesis of type II collagen declines and the synthesis of less tensile type I collagen increases. Mother change is a shift in phenotype of the differentiated chondrocyte of the NP into a more fibrotic type.

In adult life events unfolding as a consequence of injury to the disc may mimic some of the molecular events that control the development of the disc. Development of the disc is under tight molecular control both temporally and spatially. Notochordal cells are involved in the development of the spinal cord and vertebra and they also contribute towards the patterning and differentiation of the IVDs. During gastrulation the axial mesoderm gives rise to the notochord and somites develop into two parts a schlerotome and a dermomyotome. The cells of the schlerotome are responsible for the formation of the spine and the IVD as the schlerotomes migrate toward and around the notochord and neural tube and later separate into areas of loosely packed cells which go on to form the NP and a densely packed cells which form the AF.

Kippel Feil Syndrome KFS is a congenital condition characterized by the fusion of two or more cervical vertebrae Type I III Kaplan et al. The Spine Journal 2005 5 564 576 . This abnormality is the result of a failure of proper segmentation of vertebrae in the cervical region during embryonic development Clark et al. 1998 Pediatr Radiol 28 967 974 . In KFS the IVD s are not developed hypo oligogenesis or there is an agenesis of the disc s . Notwithstanding that a number of de novo PAX1 missense mutations as well as PAX1 haploinsufficiency i.e. reduced expression of PAX1 have been associated with KFS no definitive genetic basis for KFS has yet been identified.

Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressive FOP is a rare autosomal dominant disorder of connective tissue whereby patients also present with cervical spine abnormalities. FOP a condition where there is excessive bone formation is often misdiagnosed for KFS which has been identified by the present inventor as being an hypo oligogenesis of the disc. Knockout mice which do not express the bone morphogenetic protein BMP antagonist noggin exhibit a phenotype almost identical to FOP patients. Whilst the noggin gene NOG is not mutated in FOP overactivity of the BMP pathway i.e. enhanced BMP signaling has been suggested as the molecular pathogenesis of FOP e.g. in incorrect development of IVDs Schaffer et al. Spine 2005 30 12 1379 1385 .

BMPs are low molecular weight glycoproteins that control many developmental processes. BMPs are multi functional growth factors that belong to a larger family of related secreted factors the transforming growth factor TGF superfamily. To date around 20 BMP family members have been identified and characterized. Members of the BMP family include for example BMP 2 BMP 4 BMP 5 BMP 6 the osteogenic proteins OP 1 BMP 7 and OP 2 BMP 8 osteogenin BMP 3 and BMP 9 to BMP 12. Other names for BMPs include growth and differentiation factors GDF and cartilage derived morphogenetic proteins e.g. CDMP 1 and 2 also known as GDF 5 and GDF 6 GDF 6 respectively. Notwithstanding that BMPs were first identified by virtue of their ability to promote ectopic cartilage and bone formation BMP signaling plays a critical role in heart limb kidney and skeletal development and control many key steps in the formation and differentiation of the vertebrate nervous system.

BMPs signal through a molecular pathway which is initiated by contact of extracellular BMPs with a high affinity complex of heteromeric type II and type I serine threonine kinase receptors. The receptor complexes in turn phosphorylate receptor regulated R Smads 1 5 and 8 which induces them to bind Smad4 Co Smad and accumulate in the nucleus where they regulate transcription. The heteromeric BMP regulated Smad complex can bind directly or through other transcriptional partners to BMP response elements of gene promoters of xVent2 xVent2B Msx1 Msx2 Hex Smad7 and Id1. The pathway is further controlled by the action of inhibitory Smads 6 and 7 and by soluble antagonists that bind extracellular BMPs inhibiting binding to heteromeric complexes such as Noggin Chordin and Dan.

The manner in which BMPs regulate such diverse processes is largely determined by the cellular and tissue context in which the BMP signals are received. For example although the molecular components of BMP signaling may be highly conserved tissue and cell type specificity ultimately determine which BMP and combinations of receptors intracellular mediators and extracellular antagonists control a particular process. BMP regulated gene expression is further controlled by interaction of Smads with tissue specific transcription factors and cross talk with other signalling pathways to mediate the diverse transcriptional programs associated with BMP regulated processes.

Notwithstanding our increased understanding of the molecular events involved in development of an IVD this understanding has yet to lead to the development of an effective treatment for a spinal disorder and or spinal pain. Rather current treatment options for a spinal disorder and or spinal pain require surgical intervention to replace a degenerated IVD and or remove the IVD and fuse vertebrae. In this respect spinal fusion is expensive because it requires prolonged hospitalisation and specialist surgical expertise. Furthermore studies suggest that in the long term spinal fusion actually promotes degeneration at sites adjacent to the lumbar fusion. Furthermore replacement of the disc is a major operation and despite potential benefits many sufferers of repeated chronic neck pain and or back pain avoid major spinal reconstruction. It is clear from the foregoing that there remains a need for compositions and methods for the treatment of spinal disorders and or spinal pain e.g. a spinal disorder associated with IVD degeneration that does not require a prolonged period of hospitalization and or that does not aggravate the spinal disorder and or spinal pain. Ideally this treatment should have the potential of regenerating disc tissue and or preventing or slowing spinal degeneration.

In work leading up to the present invention the inventors sought to identify biochemical pathway s that is are involved in the development of and or causative of Klippel Feil Syndrome KFS . The inventors reasoned that because subjects suffering from KFS do not form one or more IVD s modulation of biochemical pathway s involved in pathogenesis of this disease is are likely to be useful for the treatment of disorders associated with IVD degeneration. By mutational analysis of a panel of subjects suffering from KFS a number of alleles of the gene encoding growth differentiation factor 6 GDF 6 also known as bone morphogenetic protein 13 BMP 13 or cartilage derived morphogenic protein 2 CDMP 2 associated with development of KFS were identified. Using KFS as a model of abnormal IVD development and or maintenance in vivo evidence that GDF 6 signaling is involved in IVD development and or maintenance has been provided Tassabeji et al. Accepted 6 Feb. 2008 .

The inventors then demonstrated that recombinant GDF 6 reduced delayed or prevented IVD degeneration and or enhanced IVD regeneration in an accepted animal model of IVD degeneration i.e. a sheep annular tear model of IVD degeneration.

Recombinant GDF 6 was also shown by the inventors to induce production of extracellular matrix proteins in cells of an IVD e.g. collagen type 1 and collagen type 2 and of a transcription factor involved in extracellular matrix synthesis i.e. SOX 9. These results indicate that GDF 6 induces biological changes within IVD cells associated with IVD regeneration.

The inventors extended these studies by modulating the level of proteins involved in GDF 6 signaling e.g. a transcription factor such as MSX 1 and or MSX 2 in primary cells isolated from an IVD. As exemplified herein over expression of MSX 1 and or MSX 2 in a cell isolated from an IVD e.g. an annulus fibrosus cell or a nucleus pulposus cell results in increased collagen production and increased extra cellular matrix production by the cell. Both increased collagen production and increased extra cellular matrix production by cells of the IVD are associated with IVD regeneration. Accordingly a composition that modulates GDF 6 signaling is an attractive therapeutic for treating a spinal disorder and or spinal pain e.g. a spinal disorder and or spinal pain associated with IVD degeneration.

In this respect as discussed herein the present inventors have demonstrated that modulation of various components of a GDF 6 signaling pathway in an IVD or a cell or tissue thereof is useful for treating a spinal disorder and or spinal pain. Without limiting the invention in any manner such modulation may comprise increasing the level and or activity of GDF 6 in an IVD or a cell or tissue thereof and or increasing the level and or activity of MSX 1 in an IVD or a cell or tissue thereof and or increasing the level and or activity of MSX 2 in an IVD or a cell or tissue thereof. However the present invention also encompasses the modulation of any component of GDF 6 signaling in an IVD or a cell or tissue thereof. In this respect GDF 6 binds to a dimeric receptor comprising BMP receptor BMPR 1A also known as ALK3 and or a BMPR 1B also known as ALK 6 and or a BMPR II. Following binding of GDF 6 to the receptor the activated receptor phosphorylates a receptor mediated Smad e.g. Smad 1 and or Smad 5 and or Smad 8 which then forms a complex with Smad 4. The complex comprising a receptor mediated Smad and Smad 4 then translocates to the nucleus and activates expression of a GDF 6 regulated gene such as for example MSX 1 and or MSX 2.

Accordingly a modulator of GDF 6 signaling is to be understood to mean a compound that modulates any component of a GDF 6 signal transduction pathway in an IVD or a cell or tissue thereof e.g. as described in the previous paragraph including GDF 6 itself and or a GDF 6 regulated gene e.g. MSX 1 or MSX 1. This term also encompasses a compound that modulates for example activation of BMPR 1A and or BMPR IB and or BMPR II and or Smad 1 and or Smad 5 and or Smad 8 and or Smad 4. Similarly the term modulating GDF 6 signaling shall be taken to mean modulating any component of a GDF 6 signal transduction pathway in an IVD or a cell or tissue thereof e.g. GDF 6 and or MSX 1 and or MSX 2 and or BMPR 1A and or BMPR IB and or BMPR II and or Smad 1 and or Smad 5 and or Smad 8 and or Smad 4.

As used herein the term modulator shall be taken to mean a compound that enhances or reduces the activity or amount of GDF 6 signaling in an IVD or a cell or tissue thereof. In one example the modulator enhances GDF 6 signaling in an IVD or a cell or tissue thereof.

The inventors have also produced methods and devices for administering a modulator of GDF 6 signaling to an IVD in such a manner that it is applied to a plurality of sites within the IVD and or within a nucleus pulposus and or within a region of the IVD defined by an annulus fibrosus and or adjacent to at least a portion of a nucleus puplosus. In this respect the viscous nature of the IVD e.g. the nucleus pulposus means that a composition of matter administered by a single bolus injection may not disperse or may not be distributed within the IVD or nucleus pulposus and as a consequence may not exert sufficient biological effect to provide a therapeutic benefit. By administering a modulator of GDF 6 signaling the inventors facilitate dispersion or distribution of the modulator within the IVD preferably within the nucleus pulposus thereby enhancing the therapeutic benefit provided by the modulator.

Notwithstanding that several of the characteristics discussed in the previous paragraph may be determined by comparing the level of a characteristic to the same characteristic in an IVD in a normal and or healthy subject such a direct comparison need not necessarily be performed. Rather the level of the characteristic may be compared to for example a data set containing information pertaining to that characteristic derived from a population of normal and or healthy individuals.

As used herein the term IVD regeneration shall be taken to mean that one or more characteristics of IVD degeneration e.g. as described supra is partially or completely reversed.

Functionally equivalent products compositions and methods are clearly within the scope of the invention as described herein.

A composition as described herein comprises any one or more modulators of GDF 6 signaling in an IVD or cell or tissue thereof in a subject. For example a modulator enhances GDF 6 signaling in an IVD or cell or tissue thereof in a subject. Such a modulator is also referred to as a GDF 6 signaling enhancer or a GDF 6 signaling agonist.

The present invention contemplates any modulator of GDF 6 signaling. For example the modulator is a peptide a polypeptide a nucleic acid an antibody an antibody fragment or a small molecule.

In one example a modulator of GDF 6 signaling in an IVD or cell or tissue thereof is a peptide or polypeptide.

For example a modulator is a polypeptide individually or collectively selected from the group consisting of 

 i a polypeptide selected from the group consisting of GDF 6 MSX 1 MSX 2 BMPR 1A BMPR IB Smad 1 Smad 5 Smad 8 and Smad 4 

By individually is meant that the invention encompasses the recited polypeptides or groups of polypeptides separately and that notwithstanding that individual polypeptides or groups of polypeptides may not be separately listed herein the accompanying claims may define such polypeptides or groups of polypeptides separately and divisibly from each other.

By collectively is meant that the invention encompasses any number or combination of the recited polypeptides or groups of polypeptides and that notwithstanding that such numbers or combinations of polypeptides or groups of peptides may not be specifically listed herein the accompanying claims may define such combinations or sub combinations separately and divisibly from any other combination of polypeptides or groups of polypeptides.

By active fragment is meant a portion of a polypeptide that retains the ability of that polypeptide to modulate GDF 6 signaling. An active fragment may have the same level of activity as the original protein or an enhanced or reduced level of activity compared to the level of activity of the original protein. Methods for determining GDF 6 activity will be apparent to the skilled artisan and or described herein.

In one preferred example of the invention the modulator of GDF 6 signaling in an IVD or cell or tissue thereof is a GDF 6 polypeptide or an active fragment thereof.

Such a GDF 6 polypeptide is useful because it binds to a transmembrane receptor and enhances GDF 6 signaling in an IVD or cell or tissue thereof. Accordingly it is not necessary for the polypeptide to enter a cell to induce GDF 6 signaling.

Preferably the polypeptide has at least about 90 identity or 95 identity or 98 identity or 99 identity to the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO 2 or 3 or encoded by a nucleic acid comprising the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO 1 wherein said polypeptide is capable of modulating GDF 6 signaling in an IVD or cell or tissue thereof.

In determining whether or not two sequences fall within these defined percentage identity limits those skilled in the art will be aware that it is possible to conduct a side by side comparison of the sequences. In such comparisons or alignments differences will arise in the positioning of non identical residues depending upon the algorithm used to perform the alignment. In the present context references to percentage identities and similarities between two or more sequences shall be taken to refer to the number of identical and similar residues respectively between said sequences as determined using any standard algorithm known to those skilled in the art. For example nucleotide identities and similarities are calculated using software of the Computer Genetics Group Inc. University Research Park Maddison Wis. United States of America e.g. using the GAP program of Devereaux et al. 12 387 395 1984 which utilizes the algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch 48 443 453 1970. Alternatively the CLUSTAL W algorithm of Thompson et al. 22 4673 4680 1994 is used to obtain an alignment of multiple sequences wherein it is necessary or desirable to maximize the number of identical similar residues and to minimize the number and or length of sequence gaps in the alignment. Sequence alignments can also be performed using a variety of other commercially available sequence analysis programs such as for example the BLAST program available at NCBI.

As used herein the term MSX 1 shall be taken to mean a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence at least about 80 identical to the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO 5 or encoded by a nucleic acid comprising the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO 4 wherein said polypeptide is capable of modulating GDF 6 signaling in an IVD or cell or tissue thereof.

Preferably the polypeptide has at least about 90 identity or 95 identity or 98 identity or 99 identity to the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO 5 or encoded by a nucleic acid comprising the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO 4 wherein said polypeptide is capable of modulating GDF 6 signaling in an IVD or cell or tissue thereof.

In one example a MSX1 polypeptide or active fragment thereof or analog or derivative thereof comprises a pair of MSX1 subunits bound to one another to produce a dimer. In this respect the dimer can contain two MSX1 polypeptides or two active fragments or two analogs or two derivatives or mixtures of a MSX1 polypeptide and or active fragment and or analog and or derivative. For example the dimer comprises a MSX1 polypeptide and an active fragment or a MSX1 polypeptide and an analog and or an active fragment and an analog or a MSX1 polypeptide and a derivative or an active fragment and a derivative or an analog and a derivative.

In another example the MSX1 polypeptide or active fragment thereof or analog or derivative thereof is dimerized with a Dlx1 protein e.g. as described in Zhang et al. 17 2920 2932 1997.

In another example the polypeptide is a MSX 2 polypeptide or an active fragment thereof.

The sequence of additional peptide or polypeptide modulators of GDF 6 signaling are readily derivable from publicly available databases such as for example the Genbank database available from NCBI. Moreover methods for determining a peptide or polypeptide having GDF 6 modulatory activity will be apparent to the skilled artisan e.g. based on the description herein.

The present invention also clearly extends to variants of a GDF 6 modulatory peptide or polypeptide described herein such as derivatives and or analogs by modification to the sequences provided herein. The invention also extends to homologs i.e. functionally equivalent peptides or polypeptide having related sequences to the sequences provided herein.

It is understood by the skilled artisan that inherent in the definition of a biologically functional equivalent protein or peptide is the concept that there is a limit to the number of changes that may be made within a defined portion of the molecule and still result in a molecule with an acceptable level of equivalent biological activity. Biologically functional equivalent peptides are thus defined herein as those peptides in which specific amino acids may be substituted or deleted. Particular embodiments encompass variants that have one two three four five or more variations in the amino acid sequence relative to a base peptide subject to the retention of an ability to modulate GDF 6 signaling and preferably reduce or prevent or delay IVD degeneration and or enhance or induce IVD regeneration. Of course a plurality of variants may be made and used in accordance with the invention.

A modulator of GDF 6 signaling e.g. a GDF 6 polypeptide or functional fragment thereof may also be glycosylated. Glycosylation is the modification of a protein by addition of one or more oligosaccharide groups. There are usually two types of glycosylation O linked oligosaccharides are attached to serine or threonine residues while N linked oligosaccharides are attached to asparagine residues when they are part of the sequence Asn X Ser Thr where X can be any amino acid except proline. Glycosylation can dramatically affect the physical properties of proteins and can also be important in protein stability secretion half life and subcellular localization. In some embodiments the modulator of GDF 6 signaling comprise N linked oligosaccharides. In other embodiments the modulator of GDF 6 signaling comprise O linked oligosaccharides. In yet other embodiments the modulator of GDF 6 signaling of this inventions comprise both N linked and O linked oligosaccharides. In some embodiments the glycosylation pattern of the modulator of GDF 6 signaling may be modified to control the carbohydrate composition of the glycoprotein.

Based on the definition of modulator of GDF 6 signaling herein above the skilled artisan will be aware that a bone morphogenetic protein BMP 2 BMP 4 BMP 7 syn. osteogenic protein OP 1 and or BMP 14 is not a modulator of GDF 6 signaling. Accordingly the term modulator of GDF 6 signaling does not encompass BMP 2 BMP 4 BMP 7 OP 1 or BMP 14.

As used herein the term derivative shall be taken to mean a peptide or polypeptide that is derived from a peptide or polypeptide modulator of GDF 6 signaling as described herein e.g. a fragment or processed form of the peptide or polypeptide or a molecule comprising one or more amino acid substitutions or comprising additional amino acid residues or non amino acid substituents relative to the base peptide or polypeptide from which it is derived. The term derivative also encompasses fusion proteins comprising a peptide of the invention.

Exemplary fusion protein comprises a label such as for example an epitope e.g. a FLAG epitope or a V5 epitope or an HA epitope. Such a tag is useful for for example purifying the fusion protein. Preferably the label is a FLAG epitope.

A conservative amino acid substitution is one in which an amino acid residue is replaced with another amino acid residue without disturbing the overall structure of the peptide. Such changes tend to rely on similarity in hydrophilicity and or polarity of the substituent. The size and or charge of the side chains also are relevant factors in determining which substitutions are conservative. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art including basic side chains e.g. lysine arginine histidine acidic side chains e.g. aspartic acid glutamic acid uncharged polar side chains e.g. glycine asparagine glutamine serine threonine tyrosine cysteine nonpolar side chains e.g. alanine valine leucine isoleucine proline phenylalanine methionine tryptophan n branched side chains e.g. threonine valine isoleucine and aromatic side chains e.g. tyrosine phenylalanine tryptophan histidine .

Those skilled in the art are well aware that the following substitutions are permissible conservative substitutions i substitutions involving arginine lysine and histidine ii substitutions involving alanine glycine and serine and iii substitutions involving phenylalanine tryptophan and tyrosine.

The importance of the hydropathic amino acid index in conferring interactive biological function on a protein is generally understood in the art Kyte Doolittle 157 105 132 1982 . It is known that certain amino acids may be substituted for other amino acids having a similar hydropathic index or score and still retain a similar biological activity. The hydropathic index of amino acids also may be considered in determining a conservative substitution that produces a functionally equivalent molecule. Each amino acid has been assigned a hydropathic index on the basis of their hydrophobicity and charge characteristics as follows isoleucine 4.5 valine 4.2 leucine 3.8 phenylalanine 2.8 cysteine cystine 2.5 methionine 1.9 alanine 1.8 glycine 0.4 threonine 0.7 serine 0.8 tryptophan 0.9 tyrosine 1.3 proline 1.6 histidine 3.2 glutamate 3.5 glutamine 3.5 aspartate 3.5 asparagine 3.5 lysine 3.9 and arginine 4.5 . In making changes based upon the hydropathic index the substitution of amino acids whose hydropathic indices are within . 0.2 is preferred. More preferably the substitution will involve amino acids having hydropathic indices within . 0.1 and more preferably within about 0.05.

Non amino acid substituents may be linked covalently to a peptide e.g. via an amino terminal amino acid residue a carboxy terminal amino acid residue or at an internal amino acid residue. Such modifications include the addition of a protective or capping group on a reactive moiety in the peptide addition of a detectable label and other changes that do not adversely destroy the activity of the peptide compound. For example particular amino acid residues may be derivatized or chemically modified in order to enhance the stability of the peptide or to permit coupling of the peptide to other agents particularly lipids.

Chemical moieties may be linked covalently to a peptide or polypeptide e.g. via an amino terminal amino acid residue a carboxy terminal amino acid residue or at an internal amino acid residue. Such modifications include the addition of a protective or capping group on a reactive moiety in the peptide addition of a detectable label and other changes that do not adversely destroy the activity of the peptide compound.

An amino terminal capping group of a peptide or polypeptide described herein is any chemical compound or moiety that is covalently linked or conjugated to the amino terminal amino acid residue of a peptide compound. An amino terminal capping group may be useful to inhibit or prevent intramolecular cyclization or intermolecular polymerization to protect the amino terminus from an undesirable reaction with other molecules to provide additional antioxidative activity or to provide a combination of these properties. A peptide or polypeptide that possesses an amino terminal capping group may possess other beneficial activities as compared with the uncapped peptide such as enhanced efficacy or reduced side effects. Examples of amino terminal capping groups that are useful in preparing a peptide or polypeptide include but are not limited to 1 to 6 naturally occurring L amino acid residues preferably 1 6 lysine residues 1 6 arginine residues or a combination of lysine and arginine residues urethanes urea compounds lipoic acid Lip glucose 3 O glycolic acid moiety Gga or an acyl group that is covalently linked to the amino terminal amino acid residue of a peptide wherein such acyl groups useful in the compositions of the invention may have a carbonyl group and a hydrocarbon chain that ranges from one carbon atom e.g. as in an acetyl moiety to up to 25 carbons e.g. palmitoyl group Palm 16 0 and docosahexaenoyl group DHA C22 6 3 . Furthermore the carbon chain of the acyl group may be saturated as in Palm or unsaturated as in DHA. It is understood that when an acid such as docosahexaenoic acid palmitic acid or lipoic acid is designated as an amino terminal capping group the resultant peptide compound is the condensed product of the uncapped peptide and the acid.

A carboxy terminal capping group of a peptide or polypeptide is any chemical compound or moiety that is covalently linked or conjugated to the carboxy terminal amino acid residue of the peptide or polypeptide. A peptide or polypeptide possessing a carboxy terminal capping group may also possess other beneficial activities as compared with the uncapped peptide such as enhanced efficacy reduced side effects enhanced hydrophilicity enhanced hydrophobicity. Carboxy terminal capping groups that are particularly useful include primary or secondary amines that are linked by an amide bond to the carboxyl group of the carboxy terminal amino acid of the peptide or polypeptide. Other carboxy terminal capping groups useful in the invention include aliphatic primary and secondary alcohols and aromatic phenolic derivatives including flavonoids with 1 to 26 carbon atoms which form esters when linked to the carboxylic acid group of the carboxy terminal amino acid residue of a peptide or polypeptide described herein.

Other chemical modifications of a peptide or polypeptide include for example glycosylation acetylation including N terminal acetylation carboxylation carbonylation phosphorylation PEGylation amidation addition of trans olefin substitution of hydrogens with methyl groups derivatization by known protecting blocking groups circularization inhibition of proteolytic cleavage e.g. using D amino acids linkage to an antibody molecule or other cellular ligand etc. Any of numerous chemical modifications may be carried out by known techniques including but not limited to specific chemical cleavage by cyanogen bromide trypsin chymotrypsin papain V8 protease NaBH acetylation formylation oxidation reduction etc.

In another example of the invention a peptide or polypeptide analog having GDF 6 signaling modulatory activity is prepared. As used herein the term analog shall be taken to mean a peptide or polypeptide that is modified to comprise one or more non naturally occurring amino acids.

Analogs may also comprise sterically similar compounds that mimic critical subdomains of a peptide or polypeptide. Such peptidomimetics are produced by modeling and chemical design processes known to those of skill in the art.

Preferred analogs of a GDF 6 signaling modulatory peptides or polypeptides comprise one or more non naturally occurring amino acids or amino acid analogs. For example a peptide or polypeptide modulator comprises one or more naturally occurring non genetically encoded L amino acids synthetic L amino acids or D enantiomers of an amino acid. For example the peptide comprises only D amino acids. For example the analog comprises one or more residues selected from the group consisting of hydroxyproline alanine 2 3 diaminopropionic acid aminoisobutyric acid N methylglycine sarcosine ornithine citrulline t butylalanine t butylglycine N methylisoleucine phenylglycine cyclohexylalanine norleucine naphthylalanine pyridylananine 3 benzothienyl alanine 4 chlorophenylalanine 2 fluorophenylalanine 3 fluorophenylalanine 4 fluorophenylalanine penicillamine 1 2 3 4 tetrahydro tic isoquinoline 3 carboxylic acid 2 thienylalanine methionine sulfoxide homoarginine N acetyl lysine 2 4 diamino butyric acid aminophenylalanine N methylvaline homocysteine homoserine amino hexanoic acid amino valeric acid 2 3 diaminobutyric acid and mixtures thereof.

Other amino acid residues that are useful for making the peptides or polypeptides or analogs thereof can be found e.g. in Fasman 1989 CRC Practical Handbook of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology CRC Press Inc. and the references cited therein.

The present invention additionally encompasses an isostere of a peptide or polypeptide described herein. The term isostere as used herein is intended to include a chemical structure that can be substituted for a second chemical structure because the steric conformation of the first structure fits a binding site specific for the second structure. The term specifically includes peptide back bone modifications i.e. amide bond mimetics known to those skilled in the art. Such modifications include modifications of the amide nitrogen the carbon amide carbonyl complete replacement of the amide bond extensions deletions or backbone crosslinks. Several peptide backbone modifications are known including CHS CHNH CSNH NHCO COCH and E or Z CH CH . In the nomenclature used above indicates the absence of an amide bond. The structure that replaces the amide group is specified within the brackets.

Other modifications include for example an N alkyl or aryl substitution CONR or backbone crosslinking to construct lactams and other cyclic structures. Other derivatives of the modulator compounds of the invention include C terminal hydroxymethyl derivatives O modified derivatives e.g. C terminal hydroxymethyl benzyl ether N terminally modified derivatives including substituted amides such as alkylamides and hydrazides.

In another example a peptide analog is a retro peptide or polypeptide see for example Goodman et al. 12 1 7 1979 . A retro peptide or polypeptide comprises a reversed amino acid sequence of a peptide modulator described herein. For example the retro peptide comprises a sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO 34 or 35.

In a further example an analog of a peptide described herein is a retro inverso peptide or polypeptide Sela and Zisman 11 449 1997 . Evolution has ensured the almost exclusive occurrence of L amino acids in naturally occurring proteins. As a consequence virtually all proteases cleave peptide bonds between adjacent L amino acids. Accordingly artificial proteins or peptides composed of D amino acids are preferably resistant to proteolytic breakdown. Retro inverso peptide or polypeptide analogs are isomers of linear peptides in which the direction of the amino acid sequence is reversed retro and the chirality D or L of one or more amino acids therein is inverted inverso e.g. using D amino acids rather than L amino acids e.g. Jameson et al. 368 744 746 1994 Brady et al. 368 692 693 1994 . The net result of combining D enantiomers and reverse synthesis is that the positions of carbonyl and amino groups in each amide bond are exchanged while the position of the side chain groups at each alpha carbon is preserved. An advantage of retro inverso peptides is their enhanced activity in vivo due to improved resistance to proteolytic degradation i.e. the peptide has enhanced stability. e.g. Chorev et al. Trends Biotech. 13 438 445 1995 .

Retro inverso or retroinverso peptide or polypeptide analogs may be complete or partial. Complete retro inverso peptides or polypeptides are those in which a complete sequence of a peptide described herein is reversed and the chirality of each amino acid other than glycine in a sequence is inverted. The exclusion of glycine is based on the fact that glycine does not have a chiral analog. Partial retro inverso peptide or polypeptide analogs are those in which only some of the peptide bonds are reversed and the chirality of only those amino acid residues in the reversed portion is inverted. In one example a retro inverso peptide analog comprises a sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO 36 or 37.

Some peptides or polypeptides must enter a cell to exert their biological activity. To facilitate peptide entry into a cell the peptide or polypeptide may be conjugated to e.g. expressed as a fusion with a protein transduction domain. As used herein the term protein transduction domain shall be taken to mean a peptide or protein that is capable of enhancing increasing or assisting penetration or uptake of a compound conjugated to the protein transduction domain into a cell either in vitro or in vivo. Those skilled in the art will be aware that synthetic or recombinant peptides can be delivered into cells through association with a protein transduction domain such as the TAT sequence from HIV or the Penetratin sequence from the Antennapaedia homeodomain protein see for example Temsamani and Vidal 9 1012 1019 2004 for review .

A suitable protein transduction domain will be apparent to the skilled artisan and includes for example HIV 1 TAT basic region e.g. SEQ ID NO 8 or polyarginine e.g. SEQ ID NO 9 .

For example a HIV 1 TAT basic region has been shown to be capable of delivering a polypeptide into an IVD cell e.g. US Patent Publication No. 20040197867.

Additional suitable protein transduction domains are described for example by Zhao and Weisledder 24 1 12 2004 or by Wagstaff and Jans 13 1371 1387 2006 or in US Patent Publication No. 20040197867.

A peptide or polypeptide modulator of GDF 6 signaling may be linked to another peptidyl moiety e.g. for immunodetection such as a FLAG epitope or for targeting such as a protein transduction domain albeit separated there from by a linker.

Preferred linkers facilitate the independent folding of each peptidyl moiety in the assembled peptide or polypeptide thereby reducing steric hindrance of one moiety by another moiety. The amino acid composition of a linker peptide is important for stability and folding of a fusion protein rather than a specific sequence Robinson and Sauer 95 5929 5934 1998 .

Suitable linkers will be apparent to the skilled artisan and are predominantly hydrophilic i.e. the residues in the linker are hydrophilic.

It is also often unfavorable to utilize a linker sequence having a high propensity to adopt helix or strand structures which could limit the flexibility of the peptidyl moieties and reduce functionality. Accordingly preferred linkers may have a preference to adopt extended conformations.

Preferred linkers comprise a high content of glycine and or serine residues. Linkers comprising glycine and or serine have a high freedom degree for linking of two proteins i.e. they enable the fused proteins to fold and produce functional proteins.

Glycine rich linkers are particularly preferred because they force the linker to adopt a loop conformation. The absence of a carbon from glycine also permits the polypeptide backbone to access dihedral angles that are energetically forbidden for other amino acids. A particularly preferred linker in the present context consists of polyglycine i.e. between about 2 and 6 glycine residues or a single glycine residue.

GDF 6 modulatory peptides or polypeptides and any derivatives analogs or homologs thereof are readily synthesized from their determined amino acid sequences using standard techniques e.g. using BOC or FMOC chemistry. Synthetic peptides and polypeptides are prepared using known techniques of solid phase liquid phase or peptide condensation or any combination thereof and can include natural and or unnatural amino acids. Amino acids used for peptide synthesis may be standard Boc N amino protected N t butyloxycarbonyl amino acid resin with the deprotecting neutralization coupling and wash protocols of the original solid phase procedure of Merrifield 85 2149 2154 1963 or the base labile N amino protected 9 fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl Fmoc amino acids described by Carpino and Han 37 3403 3409 1972. Both Fmoc and Boc N amino protected amino acids can be obtained from various commercial sources such as for example Fluka Bachem Advanced Chemtech Sigma Cambridge Research Biochemical Bachem or Peninsula Labs.

The Merrifield method of synthesis Merrifield 85 2149 2154 1963 and the myriad of available improvements on that technology are described in the art see e.g. Synthetic Peptides A User s Guide Grant ed. 1992 W.H.

Generally chemical synthesis methods comprise the sequential addition of one or more amino acids to a growing peptide chain. Normally either the amino or carboxyl group of the first amino acid is protected by a suitable protecting group. The protected or derivatized amino acid can then be either attached to an inert solid support or utilized in solution by adding the next amino acid in the sequence having the complementary amino or carboxyl group suitably protected under conditions that allow for the formation of an amide linkage. The protecting group is then removed from the newly added amino acid residue and the next amino acid suitably protected is then added and so forth. After the desired amino acids have been linked in the proper sequence any remaining protecting groups and any solid support if solid phase synthesis techniques are used are removed sequentially or concurrently to render the final polypeptide. By simple modification of this general procedure it is possible to add more than one amino acid at a time to a growing chain for example by coupling under conditions which do not racemize chiral centers a protected tripeptide with a properly protected dipeptide to form after deprotection a pentapeptide. See e.g. J. M. Stewart and J. D. Young Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis Pierce Chemical Co. Rockford Ill. 1984 and G. Barany and R. B. Merrifield The Peptides Analysis Synthesis Biology editors E.

Gross and J. Meienhofer Eds. The Peptides Analysis. Synthesis. Biology Vol. 1 for classical solution synthesis. These methods are suitable for synthesis of a peptide of the present invention or an analog or derivative thereof.

Typical solid supports are cross linked polymeric supports. These can include divinylbenzene cross linked styrene based polymers for example divinylbenzene hydroxymethylstyrene copolymers divinylbenzene chloromethylstyrene copolymers and divinylbenzene benzhydrylaminopolystyrene copolymers.

A peptide polypeptide analog or derivative as described herein can also be chemically prepared by other methods such as by the method of simultaneous multiple peptide synthesis. See e.g. Houghten 82 5131 5135 1985 or U.S. Pat. No. 4 631 211.

Synthetic peptides may also be produced using techniques known in the art and described for example in Stewart and Young In Solid Phase Synthesis Second Edition Pierce Chemical Co. Rockford Ill. 1984 and or Fields and Noble 35 161 214 1990 or using automated synthesizers.

Alternatively or in addition a peptide or polypeptide or analogue or derivative thereof or fusion protein comprising same is produced as a recombinant protein. To facilitate the production of a recombinant peptide or fusion protein nucleic acid encoding same is preferably isolated or synthesized. Typically the nucleic acid encoding the recombinant protein is are isolated using a known method such as for example amplification e.g. using PCR or splice overlap extension or isolated from nucleic acid from an organism using one or more restriction enzymes or isolated from a library of nucleic acids. Methods for such isolation will be apparent to the ordinary skilled artisan and or described in Ausubel et al In Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience ISBN 047 150338 1987 Sambrook et al. In Molecular Cloning Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories New York Third Edition 2001 .

For expressing protein by recombinant means a protein encoding nucleic acid is placed in operable connection with a promoter or other regulatory sequence capable of regulating expression in a cell free system or cellular system. For example nucleic acid comprising a sequence that encodes a peptide is placed in operable connection with a suitable promoter and maintained in a suitable cell for a time and under conditions sufficient for expression to occur. Nucleic acid encoding a peptide or polypeptide modulator of GDF 6 signaling is described herein or is derived from the publicly available amino acid sequence or the publicly available nucleotide sequence.

As used herein the term promoter is to be taken in its broadest context and includes the transcriptional regulatory sequences of a genomic gene including the TATA box or initiator element which is required for accurate transcription initiation with or without additional regulatory elements e.g. upstream activating sequences transcription factor binding sites enhancers and silencers that alter expression of a nucleic acid e.g. in response to a developmental and or external stimulus or in a tissue specific manner. In the present context the term promoter is also used to describe a recombinant synthetic or fusion nucleic acid or derivative which confers activates or enhances the expression of a nucleic acid to which it is operably linked. Preferred promoters can contain additional copies of one or more specific regulatory elements to further enhance expression and or alter the spatial expression and or temporal expression of said nucleic acid.

As used herein the term in operable connection with in connection with or operably linked to means positioning a promoter relative to a nucleic acid such that expression of the nucleic acid is controlled by the promoter. For example a promoter is generally positioned 5 upstream to the nucleic acid the expression of which it controls. To construct heterologous promoter nucleic acid combinations e.g. promoter nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide it is generally preferred to position the promoter at a distance from the gene transcription start site that is approximately the same as the distance between that promoter and the nucleic acid it controls in its natural setting i.e. the gene from which the promoter is derived. As is known in the art some variation in this distance can be accommodated without loss of promoter function.

Should it be preferred that a peptide or polypeptide of the invention is expressed in vitro a suitable promoter includes but is not limited to a T3 or a T7 bacteriophage promoter Hanes and Pl ckthun 94 4937 4942 1997 .

Typical promoters suitable for expression in bacterial cells include but are not limited to the lacz promoter the Ipp promoter temperature sensitive L or R promoters T7 promoter T3 promoter SP6 promoter or semi artificial promoters such as the IPTG inducible tac promoter or lacUV5 promoter. A number of other gene construct systems for expressing the nucleic acid fragment of the invention in bacterial cells are well known in the art and are described for example in Ausubel et al In Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.

Numerous expression vectors for expression of recombinant polypeptides in bacterial cells and efficient ribosome binding sites have been described and include for example PKC30 Shimatake and Rosenberg 292 128 1981 pKK173 3 Amann and Brosius 40 183 1985 pET 3 Studier and Moffat 189 113 1986 the pCR vector suite Invitrogen pGEM T Easy vectors Promega the pL expression vector suite Invitrogen the pBAD TOPO or pBAD thio TOPO series of vectors containing an arabinose inducible promoter Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. the latter of which is designed to also produce fusion proteins with a Trx loop for conformational constraint of the expressed protein the pFLEX series of expression vectors Pfizer Inc.

Typical promoters suitable for expression in eukaryotic cells include the SV40 late promoter SV40 early promoter and cytomegalovirus CMV promoter CMV IE cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter amongst others. Preferred vectors for expression in mammalian cells e.g. 293 COS CHO 10T cells 293T cells include but are not limited to the pcDNA vector suite supplied by Invitrogen in particular pcDNA 3.1 myc His tag comprising the CMV promoter and encoding a C terminal 6 His and MYC tag and the retrovirus vector pSR tkneo Muller et al. 11 1785 1991 .

Means for introducing the isolated nucleic acid molecule or a gene construct comprising same into a cell for expression are well known to those skilled in the art. The technique used for a given organism depends on the known successful techniques. Means for introducing recombinant DNA into cells include microinjection transfection mediated by DEAE dextran transfection mediated by liposomes such as by using lipofectamine Gibco MD USA and or cellfectin Gibco MD USA PEG mediated DNA uptake electroporation and microparticle bombardment such as by using DNA coated tungsten or gold particles Agracetus Inc. WI USA amongst others.

In another example a modulator is a nucleic acid. For example the modulator is a nucleic acid that encodes a polypeptide modulator as described herein above.

 i a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide selected from the group consisting of GDF 6 MSX 1 MSX 2 BMPR 1A BMPR IB BMPR II Smad 1 Smad 5 Smad 8 and Smad 4 and

 ii a nucleic acid encoding an active fragment of a polypeptide selected from the group consisting of GDF 6 MSX 1 MSX 2 BMPR 1A BMPR IB BMPR II Smad 1 Smad 5 Smad 8 and Smad 4.

In one preferred example of the invention a modulator of GDF 6 signaling in an IVD or cell or tissue thereof is a nucleic acid encoding a GDF 6 polypeptide or an active fragment thereof. For example the nucleic acid comprises a sequence at least about 80 identical to the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO 1 wherein said nucleic acid encodes a polypeptide capable of modulating GDF 6 signaling in an IVD or cell or tissue thereof. Preferably the nucleic acid has at least about 90 identity or 95 identity or 98 identity or 99 identity to the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO 1 wherein said nucleic acid encodes a polypeptide capable of modulating GDF 6 signaling in an IVD or cell or tissue thereof.

In another example a modulator of GDF 6 signaling in an IVD or cell or tissue thereof is a nucleic acid that encodes a MSX 1 polypeptide or an active fragment thereof. For example a sequence at least about 80 identical to the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO 4 wherein said nucleic acid encodes a polypeptide capable of modulating GDF 6 signaling in an IVD or cell or tissue thereof. Preferably the nucleic acid has at least about 90 identity or 95 identity or 98 identity or 99 identity to the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO 4 wherein said nucleic acid encodes a polypeptide capable of modulating GDF 6 signaling in an IVD or cell or tissue thereof.

In another example a modulator of GDF 6 signaling in an IVD or cell or tissue thereof is a nucleic acid that encodes a MSX 2 polypeptide or an active fragment thereof. For example the nucleic acid comprises a sequence at least about 80 identical to the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO 6 wherein said nucleic acid encodes a polypeptide capable of modulating GDF 6 signaling in an IVD or cell or tissue thereof. Preferably the nucleic acid has at least about 90 identity or 95 identity or 98 identity or 99 identity to the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO 6 wherein said nucleic acid encodes a polypeptide capable of modulating GDF 6 signaling in an IVD or cell or tissue thereof.

The nucleotide sequence of additional nucleic acids capable of encoding a peptide or polypeptide modulator of GDF 6 signaling are readily derivable from publicly available databases such as for example the Genbank database available from NCBI. Moreover methods for determining a peptide or polypeptide having GDF 6 modulatory activity will be apparent to the skilled artisan e.g. based on the description herein.

For example the nucleic acid modulator is a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide modulator described herein above operably linked to a promoter for inducing expression in an IVD or a cell or tissue thereof. For example the nucleic acid is linked to a promoter operable in a variety of cells of a subject such as for example a viral promoter e.g. a CMV promoter e.g. a CMV IE promoter or a SV 40 promoter. The nucleic acid may also be linked to a promoter that expresses a nucleic acid in an IVD or cell or tissue thereof in nature such as for example a collagen promoter or a matrix metalloproteinase promoter. Additional suitable promoters are described herein and shall be taken to apply mutatis mutandis to the present embodiment of the invention.

Preferably the nucleic acid modulator of GDF 6 signaling in an IVD or cell or tissue thereof is provided in the form of an expression construct. As used herein the term expression construct refers to a nucleic acid that has the ability to confer expression on a nucleic acid e.g. a reporter gene and or a counter selectable reporter gene to which it is operably connected in a cell. Within the context of the present invention it is to be understood that an expression construct may comprise or be a plasmid bacteriophage phagemid cosmid virus sub genomic or genomic fragment or other nucleic acid capable of maintaining and or replicating heterologous DNA in an expressible format.

Methods for the construction of a suitable expression construct for performance of the invention will be apparent to the skilled artisan and are described for example in Ausubel et al In Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience ISBN 047 150338 1987 or Sambrook et al In Molecular Cloning Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories New York Third Edition 2001 .

For example each of the components of the expression construct is amplified from a suitable template nucleic acid using for example PCR and subsequently cloned into a suitable expression construct such as for example a plasmid or a phagemid. Alternatively the nucleic acid required for the assay is for example excised from a suitable source for example using a restriction endonuclease and cloned into a suitable expression construct.

Vectors suitable for such an expression construct are known in the art and or described herein. For example an expression vector suitable for the method of the present invention in a mammalian cell is for example a vector of the pcDNA vector suite supplied by Invitrogen a vector of the pCI vector suite Promega a vector of the pCMV vector suite Clontech a pM vector Clontech a pSI vector Promega a VP16 vector Clontech or a vector of the pcDNA vector suite Invitrogen .

The skilled artisan will be aware of additional vectors and sources of such vectors such as for example Invitrogen Corporation Clontech or Promega.

Alternatively an expression construct of the invention is a viral vector. Suitable viral vectors are known in the art and commercially available. Conventional viral based systems for the delivery of a nucleic acid and integration of that nucleic acid into a host cell genome include for example a retroviral vector a lentiviral vector or an adeno associated viral vector. Alternatively an adenoviral vector is useful for introducing a nucleic acid that remains episomal into a host cell. Viral vectors are an efficient and versatile method of gene transfer in target cells and tissues. Additionally high transduction efficiencies have been observed in many different cell types and target tissues.

For example a retroviral vector generally comprises cis acting long terminal repeats LTRs with packaging capacity for up to 6 10 kb of foreign sequence. The minimum cis acting LTRs are sufficient for replication and packaging of a vector which is then used to integrate the expression construct into the target cell to provide long term expression. Widely used retroviral vectors include those based upon murine leukemia virus MuLV gibbon ape leukemia virus GaLV simian immunodeficiency virus SIV human immunodeficiency virus HIV and combinations thereof see e.g. Buchscher et al. 66 2731 2739 1992 Johann et al. 66 1635 1640 1992 Sommerfelt et al. 176 58 59 1990 Wilson et al. 63 274 2378 1989 Miller et al. 65 2220 2224 1991 PCT US94 05700 Miller and Rosman 7 980 990 1989 Miller A. D. 1 5 14 1990 Scarpa et al 180 849 852 1991 Burns et al. 90 8033 8037 1993. .

Various adeno associated virus AAV vector systems have also been developed for nucleic acid delivery. AAV vectors can be readily constructed using techniques known in the art. See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 173 414 and 5 139 941 International Publication Nos. WO 92 01070 and WO 93 03769 Lebkowski et al. 8 3988 3996 1988 Vincent et al. 1990 Vaccines 90 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Carter 3 533 539 1992 Muzyczka. 158 97 129 1992 Kotin 5 793 801 1994 Shelling and Smith 1 165 169 1994 and Zhou et al. 179 1867 1875 1994.

Additional viral vectors useful for delivering an expression construct of the invention include for example those derived from the pox family of viruses such as vaccinia virus and avian poxvirus or an alphavirus or a conjugate virus vector e.g. that described in Fisher Hoch et al. 86 317 321 1989 .

The skilled artisan will be aware based on the foregoing description that the present invention also provides a composition comprising i a virus comprising a nucleic acid encoding a modulator of GDF 6 signaling in an IVD or a cell or tissue thereof sufficient to reduce delay or prevent IVD degeneration in a subject and or to induce and or enhance IVD regeneration in a subject and a suitable carrier or excipient.

The present invention also encompasses a composition comprising a cell e.g. a stem cell comprising and or expressing a modulator of GDF 6 signaling in an IVD or cell or tissue thereof. For example the cell is transformed transfected or transduced with a nucleic acid capable of expressing a peptide or polypeptide modulator of GDF 6 signaling e.g. as described supra.

In one example the cell is isolated from an IVD. For example the cell is a nucleus pulposus cell or an annulus fibrosus cell. For example the cell is isolated from a subject to be treated. For example an IVD cell is isolated from a subject e.g. using a syringe or by surgery. The cell is then transfected transduced or transformed with a nucleic acid e.g. an expression construct capable of expressing a peptide or polypeptide modulator of GDF 6 signaling in said cell. Such a cell may then be introduced into a subject suffering from a spinal disorder and or spinal pain.

In a preferred example a cell is a stem cell. For example a cell is a stem cell capable of differentiating into a cell in an IVD. Such a cell is useful for populating an IVD to which it is administered and reduce prevent or delay IVD degeneration and or enhance or induce IVD regeneration. Suitable stem cells will be apparent to the skilled artisan and include a mesenchymal stem cell or a bone marrow stromal cell.

A suitable cell includes for example multipotent cells such as those described by Jiang et al. Nature Vol. 418 p. 41 49 2002 .

Alternatively a bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell is isolated from a subject e.g. a subject in need of treatment and transformed transfected or transduced with a nucleic acid capable of expressing a peptide or polypeptide modulator of GDF 6 signaling. Methods for isolating and or administering a bone marrow stromal cell will be apparent to the skilled artisan and or described for example in Richardson et al. 24 707 716 2006.

For example a natural source of mesenchymal stem cells include bone marrow e.g. with and without previous bleeding peripheral blood e.g. with and without enhancement from marrow umbilical cord fat muscle blood vessels periosteum and perichondrium. Stem cells may be isolated from such a source by any suitable method typically involving cell fractionation and concentration. Suitable methods are known in the art and include Ficoll Paque methodology or concentration of mesenchymal stem cells using antibodies directed to mesenchymal stem cell markers which are immobilized for example in an affinity chromatography column or to a substratum in a panning scheme.

Preferably a stem cell is allogenic i.e. from the same species as a subject to be treated and preferably from the subject to be treated as opposed to xenogenic i.e. from a different species . If the cells are allogenic but not autologous it is preferred if the cells are of a similar tissue type e.g. have similar MHC HLA haplotypes . It is particularly preferred if the cells are autologous i.e. are derived from the subject to which they are administered . Such autologous cells have the advantage of being less prone to rejection compared to other allogenic or xenogenic cells. Also the use of autologous cells avoids any issue of doping e.g. with foreign DNA . Accordingly one example of the invention comprises obtaining a mesenchymal stem cell from a subject transforming or transfecting the stem cell with a nucleic acid encoding a peptide or polypeptide modulator of GDF 6 signaling. It will be appreciated that some of the cells may be saved for use at a later date and typically such cells are frozen under conditions that retains their viability. It will be appreciated that the cells may be obtained and enriched expanded if necessary before IVD degeneration in a subject and kept for immediate administration when necessary.

Alternatively or in addition a bone marrow stem cell comprising or expressing a modulator of GDF 6 signaling is cultured with a cell isolated from an IVD e.g. a nucleus pulposus cell prior to administration to a subject. Such co cultivation induces differentiation of the stem cell into a cell similar to an IVD cell Richardson et al. supra .

In one example the cell is a chondrocyte e.g. a progenitor cell capable of differentiating into an IVD cell e.g. a nucleus pulposus cell or an annulus fibrosus cell. Chondrocytes generally express a marker such as for example Type II Collagen Collagen IX Aggrecan Link Protein S100 or Biglycan. The skilled artisan will be aware of methods for producing or isolating such a chondrocyte. For example as exemplified herein contacting a mesenchymal stem cell e.g. a bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell with GDF 6 for a time and under conditions sufficient for differentiation to occur causes the cell to differentiate into a chondrocyte. Such a chondrocyte is then suitable for administration to a subject to treat IVD degeneration and or spinal pain and or to induce IVD regeneration. Preferably the chondrocyte has been modified to comprise or express a modulator of GDF 6 signaling.

In another example an isolated stem cell e.g. a bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell is contacted with a transforming growth factor TGF 3 protein and or a BMP 2 protein and or a GDF 6 protein to induce differentiation into a chondrocyte cell preferably a nucleus pulposus like cell. Suitable methods for inducing differentiation are exemplified herein.

In one example the composition described herein according to any embodiment comprises a liquid suspension of cells comprising or expressing a modulator of GDF 6 signaling. For example the liquid suspension is a suspension of cells in a medium that contains appropriate biological signals to encourage the differentiation of the mesenchymal stem cells into an IVD type cell and or to discourage the differentiation of the cells into cell types that are not useful e.g. bone tissue . The liquid suspension may be one which gels in situ for example because of the temperature at the injury site of the patient or because it is mixed with another agent that causes gelling.

In one example of the present invention the cell additionally expresses a catalytic subunit of telomerase e.g. encoded by a TERT gene or transcript. For example the cell is genetically modified to express a catalytic subunit of telomerase. Such cells produce increased levels of collagen e.g. collagen type 1 and or collagen type 2. Suitable cells and methods for producing those cells are described for example in applicant s co pending International Patent Application No. PCT AU2006 000550.

In one example a cell is isolated from a subject e.g. an IVD cell and is transfected with an expression vector or expression construct comprising a nucleic acid encoding TERT operably linked to a promoter active in said cell. In one example the cell is additionally transfected with a nucleic acid encoding a modulator of GDF 6 signaling. Methods for transfecting cells e.g. IVD cells will be apparent to the skilled artisan and or described herein and or described in International Patent Application No. PCT AU2006 000550. The resulting recombinant cell is then administered to a subject using a method described herein.

As will be apparent to the skilled artisan based on the foregoing description the present invention also provides a method additionally comprising isolating or obtaining a stem cell. Such a method may additionally comprise producing a stem cell comprising or expressing a modulator of GDF 6 signaling e.g. by performing a process comprising transforming or transfecting a stem cell with a nucleic acid that encodes a peptide or polypeptide modulator of GDF 6 signaling.

The present invention also provides a method for obtaining a chondrocyte or chondrocyte like cell or a nucleus pulposus like cell said method comprising contacting a stem cell or a progenitor cell or a multipotent cell or a totipotent cell with an inducer of GDF 6 signaling preferably a GDF 6 polypeptide or active fragment thereof for a time and under conditions for the cell to differentiate wherein following differentiation the cell is a chondrocyte or chondrocyte like cell or a nucleus pulposus like cell.

In one example the stem cell or the progenitor cell or the multipotent cell is a mesenchymal stem cell preferably a bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell.

In another example the method additionally comprises contacting the stem cell or a progenitor cell or a multipotent cell or totipotent cell with a TGF 3 polypeptide and or a BMP2 polypeptide.

The present invention also provides a chondrocyte or chondrocyte like cell or a nucleus pulposus like cell produced by a method described herein according to any embodiment.

The present invention also provides a method of treating preventing or delaying or treating a spinal disorder and or spinal pain in a subject said method comprising administering a chondrocyte or chondrocyte like cell or a nucleus pulposus like cell produced by a method described herein according to any embodiment to a subject suffering from a spinal disorder and or spinal pain for a time and under conditions sufficient to reduce delay or prevent intervertebral disc IVD degeneration in the subject and or to induce and or enhance intervertebral disc regeneration in the subject.

The skilled artisan will be aware of suitable methods for determining a compound capable of modulating GDF 6 signaling.

For example a cell expressing a reporter gene e.g. galactosidase or a fluorescent protein e.g. green fluorescent protein is placed under control of a BRE promoter which is induced in the presence of GDF 6 signaling. The cell is then contacted with a test compound and the level of reporter gene expression is determined. A compound that enhances or reduces GDF 6 signaling compared to a cell that has not been contacted with a compound is considered a modulator of GDF 6 signaling. Such a method is described for example in Mazerbourgh et al. 280 32122 32132 2005.

Alternatively or in addition a cell is contacted with a test compound for a time and under conditions sufficient for GDF 6 signaling to occur and protein isolated from said cell. The level of phosphorylated Smad 1 Smad 5 and or Smad 8 is then determined e.g. by Western blotting using an anti phospho Smad 1 Smad 5 or Smad 8 antibody e.g. as available from Amersham Pharmacia . A compound that enhances or reduces the level of phosphorylated Smad 1 Smad 5 and or Smad 8 in a cell compared to a cell that is not contacted with the compound is then considered a modulator of GDF 6 signaling. Such an assay is described for example in Mazerbourgh et al. supra.

In one example the method described in either of the previous two paragraphs is performed in a cell from an IVD e.g. a nucleus pulposus cell or an annulus fibrosus cell or in a cell in an IVD organ culture. Such an assay is useful for identifying a compound that modulated GDF 6 signaling in an IVD or cell or tissue thereof.

For example GDF 6 signaling modulators may be identified by their ability to enhance or reduce the binding of two or more members of the GDF 6 signaling pathway to one another e.g. a GDF 6 polypeptide to a GDF 6 receptor. For example an assay is performed in which a labeled GDF 6 is contacted to a GDF 6 receptor in the presence or absence of a test compound. Following washing the level of bound label is detected. A compound that enhances or reduces the level of label bound to the GDF 6 receptor is considered a modulator of GDF 6 signaling. Alternatively or in addition a GDF 6 signaling modulator is identified by their ability to enhance or inhibit protein interactions in the GDF 6 signaling cascade. For example a reverse hybrid assay or forward hybrid assay is employed to identify a test compound inhibits or reduces or enhances an interaction between any of the following proteins GDF 6 and or MSX 1 and or MSX 2 and or BMPR 1A and or BMPR IB and or BMPR II and or Smad 1 and or Smad 5 and or Smad 8 and or Smad 4. Reverse hybrid methods will be apparent to the skilled artisan and or described in Watt et al. U.S. Ser. No. 09 227 652 or Erickson et al. WO95 26400 .

The skilled artisan will also be aware of a suitable method to determine a compound and or an amount of a compound that reduces prevents or delays IVD degeneration and or enhances IVD regeneration.

For example an assay is performed in a cultured cell e.g. a cell from an IVD e.g. a nucleus pulposus cell or an annulus fibrosus cell or a similar cell or cell line or a stem cell. For example a cell is contacted with a test compound for a time and under conditions sufficient to modulate GDF 6 signaling and the level of a marker of IVD degeneration and or regeneration e.g. proteoglycan content and or collagen content or production is determined. For example a compound that enhances proteoglycan content of a cell and or collagen content or production of a cell compare to a cell that is not contacted with the compound is considered reduces prevents or delays IVD degeneration and or enhances IVD regeneration.

Methods for determining the level of proteoglycan in a cell will be apparent to the skilled artisan and includes for example an assay to detect sulphated glycosaminoglycan using the metachromatic dye 1 9 dimethylmethylene blue e.g. as described in Melrose et al. 10 665 676 1992 and Melrose et al. 14 61 75 1994 .

An assay for detecting collagen content of a cell includes for example an assay to detect hydroxyproline e.g. essentially as described in Melrose et al. 10 665 676 1992 and Melrose et al. 14 61 75 1994 . Alternatively or in addition immunohistochemistry and or immunofluorescence is used to detect the level of a collagen in a cell e.g. Collagen Type I Collagen Type II Collagen Type IV Collagen Type VI and Collagen Type X. Alternatively or in addition uptake of H proline by a cell is indicative of the level of collagen synthesis by the cell.

Alternatively or in addition a compound is administered to an animal model of IVD degeneration such as for example an animal model described herein. The effect of the compound is then determined e.g. the water content of an IVD and or the height of an IVD to which a compound has been administered is compared to the same parameter of an IVD to which the compound has not been administered. Improvement of the parameter indicates that the compound reduces prevents or delays IVD degeneration and or enhances IVD regeneration. Alternatively the parameter in a treated IVD is compared to the same parameter in a non degenerating IVD and a similar level is indicative of a compound that reduces prevents or delays IVD degeneration and or enhances IVD regeneration.

The GDF 6 signaling modulatory composition as described herein according to any embodiment can be formulated readily for administration to a subject in need thereof e.g. by admixing the composition with a suitable carrier and or excipient.

The terms carrier and excipient refer to carriers and excipients that are conventionally used in the art to facilitate the storage administration and or the biological activity of an active compound see e.g. Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th Ed. Mac Publishing Company 1980 . A carrier may also reduce any undesirable side effects of the active compound. A suitable carrier is for example stable e.g. incapable of reacting with other ingredients in the formulation. In one example the carrier does not produce significant local or systemic adverse effect in recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed for treatment.

Suitable carriers for this invention include those conventionally used e.g. water saline aqueous dextrose lactose Ringer s solution a buffered solution hyaluronan and glycols are preferred liquid carriers particularly when isotonic for solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers and excipients include starch cellulose glucose lactose sucrose gelatin malt rice flour chalk silica gel magnesium stearate sodium stearate glycerol monostearate sodium chloride glycerol propylene glycol water ethanol and the like.

Preferred carriers and excipients do not adversely affect the ability of a GDF 6 signaling modulator to reduce prevent or delay IVD degeneration and or adversely affect the ability of a GDF 6 signaling modulator to enhance or induce IVD regeneration.

In one example the carrier or excipient provides a buffering activity to maintain the compound at a suitable pH to thereby exert its biological activity e.g. the carrier or excipient is phosphate buffered saline PBS . PBS represents an attractive carrier or excipient because it interacts with compounds minimally and permits rapid release of the compound. In such a case the composition of the invention may be produced as a liquid or direct application to an IVD or a region surrounding or adjacent to an IVD e.g. by injection.

In another example the composition of the invention is formulated with a co polymer. For example Puolakkainen et al. 58 321 329 describe a poly ethylene oxide poly propylene oxide block copolymer designated Pluronic F 127. Pluronic F 127 has been used as a carrier for a variety of peptides and proteins in addition to nucleic acid based compounds. This carrier exhibits thermoreversability relative inertness toward protein and nucleic acid and low toxicity.

In a further example the carrier is a hydrogel. In this respect a hydrogel is a three dimensional network of cross linked hydrophilic polymers in the form of a gel substantially composed of water preferably but not limited to gels being greater than 90 water. Hydrogel can carry a net positive or net negative charge or may be neutral. A typical net negative charged hydrogel is alginate. Hydrogels carrying a net positive charge may be typified by extracellular matrix components such as collagen and laminin. Examples of commercially available extracellular matrix components include Matrigel and Vitrogen . An example of a net neutral hydrogel is highly crosslinked polyethylene oxide or polyvinyalcohol. For example biopol hydrogel is a poly ethylene oxide cross linked hydrogel that interacts with aqueous solutions and swells to an equilibrium value retaining a significant portion of the aqueous solution within its structure. Hydrogels have been shown to be suitable for delivery of a number of compounds including proteins or peptides Pitt et al. 59 173 1990.

In a further example the carrier is a hydroxypropyl methylcellulose HPMC or a hydroxypropyl cellulose HPC . Such carriers may be formulated as a liquid a gel or a cream. Optionally the carrier additionally comprises n methyl 2 pyrrolidine NMP to enhance uptake of a topical composition therein.

In the case of a cell based therapeutic a preferred carrier includes a hyaluronan gel. Alternatively or in addition a suitable hydrogel for administration of a cell or peptide or nucleic acid is described in US Patent Publication No. 20060115457.

In a further example a GDF 6 signaling modulator is formulated with polyethylene glycol PEG as a delivery material. The PEG group s may be of any convenient molecular weight and may be linear or branched. For example the composition comprises PEG. Alternatively or in addition the GDF 6 signaling modulator is covalently linked to the PEG group s . Methods for PEGylating proteins are known in the art.

In another example the clearance of a GDF 6 signaling modulator is delayed to extend the effective half life of the GDF 6 modulator at the site of action i.e. within an IVD e.g. within a nucleus pulposus and or within a region of an IVD defined by an annulus fibrosus by appropriate formulation e.g. for sustained release of the GDF 6 signaling modulator and or for slow delivery of the GDF 6 signaling modulator. Formulations comprising gels hydrogels microspheres or biocompatible polymers including bioresorbable polymers are particularly suited to such applications. Suitable formulations for such applications may comprise for example polylactic polyglycolic acid polymers liposomes collagen polyethylene glycol PEG hyaluronic acid fibrin matrices hyaluronic acid fibrin chitosan gelatin SABER System sucrose acetate isobutyrate SAIB DURIN biodegradabale polymer for drug loaded implants MICRODUR biodegradable polymers microencapsulation and DUROS mini osmotic pump . Biocompatible polymeric materials include elastic or elastomeric materials hydrogels or other hydrophilic polymers or composites thereof. Suitable elastomers include silicone polyurethane copolymers of silicone and polyurethane polyolefins such as polyisobutylene and polyisoprene neoprene nitrile vulcanized rubber and combinations thereof. Suitable hydrogels include natural hydrogels and those formed from polyvinyl alcohol acrylamides such as polyacrylic acid and poly acrylonitrile acrylic acid polyurethanes polyethylene glycol poly N vinyl 2 pyrrolidone acrylates such as poly 2 hydroxy ethyl methacrylate and copolymers of acrylates with N vinyl pyrrolidone N vinyl lactams acrylamide polyurethanes and polyacrylonitrile or may be other similar materials that form a hydrogel. The hydrogel materials may further be cross linked to provide further strength to the implant. Examples of polyurethanes include thermoplastic polyurethanes aliphatic polyurethanes segmented polyurethanes hydrophilic polyurethanes polyetherurethane polycarbonate urethane and silicone polyetherurethane. Other suitable hydrophilic polymers include naturally occurring materials such as glucomannan gel hyaluronic acid polysaccharides such as cross linked carboxyl containing polysaccharides and combinations thereof.

Formulations of the present invention can be subjected to conventional pharmaceutical expedients such as sterilization and can contain a conventional pharmaceutical additive such as a preservative and or a stabilizing agent and or a wetting agent and or an emulsifying agent and or a salt for adjusting osmotic pressure and or a buffer and or other additives known in the art. Other acceptable components in the composition of the invention include but are not limited to isotonicity modifying agents such as water and or saline and or a buffer including phosphate citrate succinate acetic acid or other organic acids or their salts.

In one example a formulation of the invention includes one or more stabilizers reducing agents anti oxidants and or anti oxidant chelating agents. The use of buffers stabilizers reducing agents anti oxidants and chelating agents in the preparation of compositions is known in the art and described for example in Wang et al. 34 452 462 1980 Wang et al. 42 S4 S26 Supplement 1988. Suitable buffers include acetate adipate benzoate citrate lactate maleate phosphate tartarate borate tri hydroxymethyl aminomethane succinate glycine histidine the salts of various amino acids or the like or combinations thereof. Suitable salts and isotonicifiers include sodium chloride dextrose mannitol sucrose trehalose or the like. Where the carrier is a liquid it is preferred that the carrier is hypotonic or isotonic with oral conjunctival or dermal fluids and has a pH within the range of 4.5 8.5. Where the carrier is in powdered form it is preferred that the carrier is also within an acceptable non toxic pH range.

In another example a formulation as described herein according to any embodiment additionally comprises a liposome carrier or excipient to facilitate uptake of a GDF 6 signaling modulator into a cell. Liposomes are considered to interact with a cell by stable absorption endocytosis lipid transfer and or fusion Egerdie et al. 142 390 1989 . For example liposomes comprise molecular films which fuse with cells and provide optimal conditions for wound healing K. Reimer et al. 195 2 93 1999 . Generally liposomes have low antigenicity and can be used to encapsulate and deliver components that cause undesirable immune responses in patients Natsume et al. 91 363 367 2000 

For example anionic or neutral liposomes often possess excellent colloidal stability since substantially no aggregation occurs between the carrier and the environment. Consequently their biodistribution is excellent and their potential for irritation and cytotoxicity is low.

Alternatively cationic liposomal systems e.g. as described in Mauer et al. 16 129 140 1999 or Maeidan et al. 1464 251 261 2000 are useful for delivering compounds into a cell. Such cationic systems provide high loading efficiencies. Moreover PEGylated cationic liposomes show enhanced circulation times in vivo Semple 1510 152 166 2001 .

Amphoteric liposomes are a recently described class of liposomes having an anionic or neutral charge at pH 7.4 and a cationic charge at pH 4. Examples of these liposomes are described for example in WO 02 066490 WO 02 066012 and WO 03 070735. Amphoteric liposomes have been found to have a good biodistribution and to be well tolerated in animals and they can encapsulate nucleic acid molecules with high efficiency.

U.S. Ser. No. 09 738 046 and U.S. Ser. No. 10 218 797 describe liposome formulations suitable for the delivery of peptides or proteins into a cell.

In one example a carrier or excipient comprises poly methyl methacrylate PMMA optionally chondroitin sulphate CS an amphiphilic macromonomer MT 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate HEMA and optionally acrylic acid AA as described in Larraz et al. 1 120 127 2007.

In the case of a nucleic acid based modulator of GDF 6 signaling a carrier or excipient preferably comprises a lipid based agent e.g. a cationic lipid. For example the carrier or excipient comprises a cationic lipid such as 2 3 dioleyloxy N 2 sperminecarboxyamido ethyl N N dimethyl 1 propanaminium trifluoroacetate Lipofectin Lipofectace DOTAP DOTMA N 1 2 3 dioleyloxy propyl N N N trimethylammonium chloride CDAB cetyldimethylethylammonium bromide CTAB cetyltrimethylethylammonium bromide DDAB dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide MBC methylbenzethonium chloride FuGENE Roche or stearylamine. Other suitable lipids are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 855 910 International Patent Publication No. WO 02 072068 and International Patent Publication No. WO 00 30444.

The present invention also provides a medical device comprising an amount of a modulator of GDF 6 signaling in an IVD or a cell or tissue thereof sufficient to reduce delay or prevent IVD degeneration in a subject and or to induce and or enhance IVD regeneration in a subject or comprising a composition as described herein according to any embodiment.

For example the medical device is a syringe comprising a composition described herein according to any embodiment.

In one example the medical device comprising the modulator of GDF 6 signaling is a device comprising a delivery conduit having a proximal end attachable to a source of the GDF 6 signaling modulator and an emitter structure at a distal end of the delivery conduit wherein the emitter structure defines a plurality of spaced discharge apertures through which the GDF 6 signaling modulator is delivered to a plurality of sites or in a patterned manner within the IVD and or within a nucleus pulposus and or adjacent to a nucleus pulposus and or within a region of an IVD defined by an annulus fibrosus and wherein the emitter structure is configured to promote diffuse distribution of the GDF 6 signaling modulator within or throughout the IVD e.g. within a nucleus pulposus and or adjacent to a nucleus pulposus and or within a region of an IVD defined by an annulus fibrosus. Preferably the apertures are dimensioned to achieve a substantially uniform discharge rate of the GDF 6 signaling modulator or composition of the invention through all of the apertures.

The emitter structure of such a device may be steerable. Thus the emitter structure may include a pull wire attached to the emitter structure either within a lumen of the emitter structure or embedded in a wall of the emitter structure. Instead the device may include a guide element for guiding the emitter structure into an operative position at the site in which diffuse distribution of the GDF 6 signaling modulator or composition of the invention is promoted. The guide element may be a guide wire of a preformed shape extending through a lumen of the emitter structure. The guide wire may for example be of a shape memory alloy such as Nitinol .

A wall of the emitter structure in such a device may be reinforced to maintain the integrity of the emitter structure in situ. More particularly the emitter structure may be reinforced to inhibit collapsing of the lumen of the emitter structure as a result of pressure applied to the IVD or to the nucleus pulposus of an IVD or pressure applied adjacent to or surrounding the IVD.

For example the emitter structure of such a device may be shaped to form a loop at the site of the IVD or the nucleus pulposus or a region of the IVD defined by an annulus fibrosus in the patient s body. In another embodiment the emitter structure may be substantially annular. In still a further embodiment the emitter structure may be forked into a plurality of branches. By forked is meant more than two branches.

The emitter structure of such a device may also be formed integrally with the delivery conduit as a one piece unit. The device may include a working cannula via which the unit is able to be delivered into an IVD and or into a nucleus puplosus and or into a region of an IVD defined by an annulus fibrosus percutaneously in a minimally invasive manner.

Each aperture of such a device may include a flow control device for inhibiting back flow of the GDF 6 signaling modulator or composition of the invention into the emitter structure. The flow control device may be a one way valve. The flow control device may be adjusted to improve the flow of formulations of higher viscosity.

The present invention clearly encompasses a system for the delivery of a GDF 6 signaling modulator or a composition of the present invention into an IVD and or into a nucleus puplosus and or into a region of an IVD defined by an annulus fibrosus and or adjacent to at least a portion of a nucleus pulposus said system comprising a device as described according to any embodiment hereof for example with reference to any one or more of and a source of the GDF 6 signaling modulator or composition of the present invention attached to the proximal end of the delivery conduit of the device. The source of the GDF 6 signaling modulator or composition can be a fluid dispenser such as a syringe.

In a further example the present invention provides a medical device for the delivery of a GDF 6 signaling modulator or composition of the present invention into an IVD and or into a nucleus puplosus and or into a region of an IVD defined by an annulus fibrosus and or adjacent to at least a portion of a nucleus pulposus wherein the medical device comprises a delivery conduit having a proximal end attachable to a source of the GDF 6 signaling modulator or composition of the present invention and an emitter structure at a distal end of the delivery conduit wherein the emitter structure is at least partially receivable within an interior of the IVD preferably within a nucleus pulposus and or within a region of an IVD defined by an annulus fibrosus and or adjacent to at least a portion of a nucleus pulposus and defining a plurality of spaced discharge apertures through which the GDF 6 signaling modulator or composition is delivered into the IVD and or into the nucleus puplosus and or into the region of an IVD defined by an annulus fibrosus and or adjacent to at least a portion of a nucleus pulposus and wherein the emitter structure is configured to extend about a part of the IVD e.g. a nucleus pulposus or a region of an IVD defined by an annulus fibrosus and or adjacent to at least a portion of a nucleus pulposus to thereby promote administration of the GDF 6 modulator or composition to a plurality of sites or in a patterned manner within the IVD and or nucleus puplosus and or region of an IVD defined by an annulus fibrosus and or adjacent to at least a portion of a nucleus pulposus e.g. to promote diffuse or substantially uniform distribution of the GDF 6 signaling modulator or composition throughout the IVD and or nucleus puplosus and or region of an IVD defined by an annulus fibrosus.

In another example the medical device comprises a synthetic or natural sourced matrix configured in size and shape to fit the defect site to be repaired e.g. an IVD or a nucleus pulposus or a region of an IVD defined by an annulus fibrosus.

In another example the medical device comprises a spinal implant. For example the spinal implant is for treating an IVD while retaining an intact annulus fibrosus the device including a compressible fibrous body configurable to a compressed state for passage through an opening in the annulus fibrosus and into a disc cavity defined by the annulus fibrosus. The body is also configurable to an expanded state to reside within the disc cavity and have a dimension greater than the opening so as to resist expulsion from the opening. The body incorporates an effective amount of a modulator of GDF 6 signaling or a cell e.g. a stem cell a nucleus pulposus cell or an annulus fibrosus cell comprising or expressing said modulator of GDF 6 signaling or a composition of the present invention. Such a device is described for example in US Patent Publication No. 20020173851.

Alternatively the device comprises a fibrous body sized for passage through an opening in the annulus fibrosus and into a disc cavity defined by the annulus fibrosus. The body is formed of fibers having coated thereon a solid carrier matrix incorporating a modulator of GDF 6 signaling or a composition of the present invention.

A medical device encompassed by the present invention especially any implant may be partially or completely bioresorbable. In addition the body may be sized and configured to provide temporary or permanent prosthetic function by being dimensioned to participate in the distribution of compressive loads between adjacent vertebral bodies. For example the body may be adapted to physically maintain a space in the disc as new tissue is generated and provide a substrate for tissue ingrowth which locks the implant in place and reinforces regenerated tissues to help maintain disc space height. Alternatively the body may be non prosthetic while delivering a modulator of GDF 6 signaling. In such non prosthetic applications the device can be dimensioned or can be formed of a material having compressive properties such that it does not participate in the distribution of loads between the adjacent vertebral bodies.

A spinal disc implant contemplated by the present invention is fabricated in any of a variety of shapes as desired for a particular application. Whilst the implant may assume a variety of shapes it is typically shaped to conform to the shape of the natural nucleus pulposus at least when in its hydrated and or relaxed configuration. Thus the implant is preferably substantially elliptical when in its hydrated and or relaxed configuration. In other forms of the invention the shape of the implant in its hydrated and or relaxed configuration is generally annular shaped cylindrical shaped or otherwise shaped as required to conform to a cavity in an IVD.

Suitable spinal disc implants are also shaped in a manner to allow easy implantation into a spinal disc nucleus space. Accordingly the implant may have a narrow tubular shape when in its dehydrated and or straightened configuration and may include at least one narrow or pointed end to facilitate implantation through a small annulus hole.

A spinal disc implant for use in the invention may be formed from a wide variety of biocompatible polymeric materials including elastic materials such as elastomeric materials hydrogels or other hydrophilic polymers or composites thereof. Suitable elastomers include silicone polyurethane copolymers of silicone and polyurethane polyolefins such as polyisobutylene and polyisoprene neoprene nitrile vulcanized rubber and combinations thereof. Suitable hydrogels include natural hydrogels and those formed from polyvinyl alcohol acrylamides such as polyacrylic acid and poly acrylonitrile acrylic acid polyurethanes polyethylene glycol poly N vinyl 2 pyrrolidone acrylates such as poly 2 hydroxy ethyl methacrylate and copolymers of acrylates with N vinyl pyrrolidone N vinyl lactams acrylamide polyurethanes and polyacrylonitrile or may be other similar materials that form a hydrogel. The hydrogel materials may further be cross linked to provide further strength to the implant. Examples of polyurethanes include thermoplastic polyurethanes aliphatic polyurethanes segmented polyurethanes hydrophilic polyurethanes polyetherurethane polycarbonate urethane and silicone polyetherurethane. Other suitable hydrophilic polymers include naturally occurring materials such as glucomannan gel hyaluronic acid polysaccharides such as cross linked carboxyl containing polysaccharides and combinations thereof. The nature of the materials employed to form the elastic body should be selected so the formed implants have sufficient load bearing capacity. In preferred embodiments a compressive strength of at least about 0.1 Mpa is desired however compressive strengths in the range of about 1 Mpa to about 20 Mpa are more preferred.

Additional suitable implants will be apparent to the skilled artisan and are described for example in International Application No. PCT AU2006 000267.

The present invention contemplates any mode of administration of a modulator of GDF 6 signaling or a composition as described herein according to any embodiment in a method of treatment. For example the present invention contemplates administration surgically or by injection or a combination thereof. Those skilled in the art will recognize that notwithstanding implants and stents may be delivered readily by surgical means and injectable formulations are generally delivered to the IVD region by injection these modes of administration are not mutually exclusive. For example an implant or stent may be amenable by virtue of its small size flexibility or other physicochemical properties to be administered by injection.

Preferred means for injection of a GDF 6 modulatory composition include intravenous subcutaneous percutaneous intramuscular and intradiscal routes. e.g. intradiscal injection or intradiscal implant the only requirement being that the GDF 6 modulatory compound is delivered to the region of the IVD in an amount effective to modulate the GDF 6 signaling pathway therein. Preferably the composition or GDF 6 modulator is delivered into an IVD more preferably into a nucleus puplosus and or a region of an IVD defined by an annulus fibrosus.

For example a polypeptide or protein modulator or cell expressing same is injected into an IVD preferably into a nucleus pulposus and or adjacent to at least a portion of a nucleus pulposus and or into a region of an IVD defined by an annulus fibrosus or into a region surrounding or adjacent to an IVD. Preferably a polypeptide or protein modulator or cell expressing same or composition as described herein according to any embodiment is administered to a plurality of sites or locations or positions within an IVD preferably within a nucleus pulposus and or within a region of an IVD defined by an annulus fibrosus. Preferably following a period of time sufficient to diffusion of the composition or modulator the modulator or composition is distributed substantially uniformly or uniformly within an IVD and or within a nucleus pulposus and or within a region of an IVD defined by an annulus fibrosus. For example a suitable route of administration is intradiscal administration intrathecal administration or intraganglionic administration see e.g. TEXTBOOK OF PAIN Wall and Melzack Eds. Harcourt Brace 4th Ed 1999 . One particularly useful method involves administering by discography as generally described by Carragee et al. 24 2542 2547 1999.

In another example a modulator of GDF 6 signaling or a composition as described herein according to any embodiment is administered by intradiscal injection or intradiscal implant.

In another example a modulator of GDF 6 signaling is administered to or within an IVD and or to or within a nucleus pulposus and or adjacent to at least a portion of a nucleus pulposus and or to or within a region of an IVD defined by an annulus fibrosus using a medical device as according to any embodiment hereof that comprises the GDF 6 signaling modulator or composition of the present invention such as for example in accordance with Example 9. For example the GDF 6 signaling modulator can be administered to or within an IVD or to or within a nucleus pulposus and or adjacent to at least a portion of a nucleus pulposus and or to or within a region of an IVD defined by an annulus fibrosus by a process comprising 

For example the GDF 6 signaling modulator or composition of the present invention can be administered to or within an IVD or to or within a nucleus pulposus and or to or within a region of an IVD defined by an annulus fibrosus and or adjacent to at least a portion of a nucleus pulposus by a process comprising 

In use it is preferred to guide an emitter structure supra to the site of the IVD in an inoperative configuration and when positioned at the site to configure the emitter structure in an operative configuration to thereby at least partially surround or be positioned within a nucleus pulposus and or region of the IVD defined by the annulus fibrosus. Thus the emitter structure can be guided into its operative configuration.

It is also preferred to apply a substantially uniform flow rate of the GDF 6 modulator or composition through all of the apertures of the emitter structure.

The present invention further encompasses the performing of an annulotomy in an annulus of the IVD and distributing the GDF 6 modulator or composition to a plurality of sites or in a patterned manner within the disc and or the implanting a medical device comprising the GDF 6 modulator or composition. Implantations may be performed following a nucleotomy or without the need for a nucleotomy depending on the state of degeneration of the disc.

Preferred means for deploying the emitter structure include endoscopic visualization means and or by fluoroscopic guidance techniques. As will be known to the skilled artisan such techniques may require formulations of the GDF 6 signaling modulator that include at least one radio opaque marker.

It is also preferred to substantially prevent back flow of the GDF 6 signaling modulator or composition through the apertures in the emitter structure when delivery of the composition has been completed.

In the case of a nucleic acid modulator of GDF 6 signaling the modulator or composition may be administered by particle bombardment or by liposome mediated delivery. Alternative methods for the delivery of nucleic acid modulators include for example microseeding Erikkson et al. 78 85 91 1998 microfabricated needles Henry et al. 87 922 925 1998 puncture mediated DNA transfer Ciernik et al. 7 893 899 1996 lipid or liposome mediated delivery Li et al. 29A 258 260 1993 or Alexander et al. 4 2279 2285 1995 .

Alternatively or in addition a nucleic acid modulator is delivered by a viral mediated process e.g. an adenovirus or a retrovirus.

Selecting an administration regimen for a therapeutic composition depends on several factors including the serum or tissue turnover rate of the entity the level of symptoms the immunogenicity of a modulator of GDF 6 signaling and the accessibility of the target cells in the biological matrix. Preferably an administration regimen maximizes the amount of therapeutic compound delivered to the patient consistent with an acceptable level of side effects. Accordingly the amount of composition delivered depends in part on the particular entity and the severity of the condition being treated. Guidance in selecting appropriate doses of peptides are available see e.g. Milgrom et al. 341 1966 1973 1999 Slamon et al. 344 783 792 2001 Beniaminovitz et al. 342 613 619 2000 Ghosh et al. 348 24 32 2003 or Lipsky et al. 343 1594 1602 2000 .

In one example a modulator of GDF 6 signaling is administered in a single bolus dosage. Alternatively a peptide or polypeptide is provided for example by continuous infusion or by doses at intervals of e.g. one day one week or 1 7 times per week. Preferably a modulator of GDF 6 signaling or a composition comprising said modulator is administered to a plurality of sites or in a patterned manner within an IVD preferably within a nucleus pulposus or within a region of an IVD defined by an annulus fibrosus and or adjacent to at least a portion of a nucleus pulposus. A preferred dose protocol is one involving the maximal dose or dose frequency that avoids significant undesirable side effects. A total weekly dose depends on the type and activity of the compound being used. For example such a dose is at least about 0.05 g kg body weight or at least about 0.2 g kg or at least about 0.5 g kg or at least about 1 g kg or at least about 10 g kg or at least about 100 g kg or at least about 0.2 mg kg or at least about 1.0 mg kg or at least about 2.0 mg kg or at least about 10 mg kg or at least about 25 mg kg or at least about 50 mg kg see e.g. Yang et al. 349 427 434 2003 or Herold et al. 346 1692 1698 2002 .

An effective amount of a modulator of GDF 6 signaling for a particular patient may vary depending on factors such as the condition being treated the overall health of the patient the method route and dose of administration and the severity of side affects see e.g. Maynard et al. 1996 A Handbook of SOPs for Good Clinical Practice Interpharm Press Boca Raton Fla. or Dent 2001 Good Laboratory and Good Clinical Practice Urch Publ. London UK.

Determination of the appropriate dose is made by a clinician e.g. using parameters or factors known or suspected in the art to affect treatment or predicted to affect treatment. Generally the dose begins with an amount somewhat less than the optimum dose and is increased by small increments thereafter until the desired or optimum effect is achieved relative to any negative side effects. Important diagnostic measures include those of symptoms of the disease and or disorder being treated. Preferably a compound that will be used is derived from or adapted for use in the same species as the subject targeted for treatment thereby minimizing a humoral response to the reagent.

An effective amount of therapeutic will decrease disease symptoms for example as described supra typically by at least about 10 usually by at least about 20 preferably at least about 30 more preferably at least about 40 and more preferably by at least about 50 .

A large family of subjects suffering from an autosomal dominant form of Klippel Feil Syndrome KFS was identified designated KF2 01 . The affected subjects had large block fusions of vertebrae within in the spine or isolated cervical fusions or fusions of cervical thoracic and lumbar vertebrae indicating that these subjects had aberrant IVD development.

Cytogenetic analyses of the KF2 01 family indicated the presence of inversion breakpoints located on 8q22.2 and 8q23.316. From the National Center for Biotechnology Information NCBI database a contiguous array of bacterial artificial chromosome BAC clones from the genomic regions flanking the inversion were selected. FISH chromosome analysis was performed as follows metaphase spreads were prepared from PHA stimulated lymphocytes cultured at 37 C. for 72 hr. High resolution analysis of elongated chromosomes was carried out using dual colour fluorescence. Total DNA isolated from BAC clones Invitrogen Australia was nick translated using fluorescent labelled dUTP spectrum green and spectrum red Vysis Inc. . Hybridization to metaphase chromosomes was performed essentially as described in Pinkel et al 83 2934 2938 1986. For each slide 400 ng of fluorescent labelled DNA was used. Before hybridization the labelled probe was annealed with a 400 fold excess amount of Cot DNA Immunodiagnostics Pty Ltd Australia at 37 C. for 45 min. Chromosomes were counterstained with DAPI or propidium iodide diluted in anti fade solution pH8. Fifty metaphases were analysed for each hybridization. Images were captured and merged using an Imstar digital FISH imaging system Immunodiagnostics Australia .

The FISH screening strategy was based on the principle that any BAC clone probe which spanned a breakpoint would display a split dual hybridization signal. Two BAC clones AC026561 and AC012238 were identified from either end of the inversion that gave split signals. To clone the proximal inversion breakpoint a set of forward PCR primers were designed at 5 kb intervals across the region of interest in each breakpoint BAC AC026561 and AC012238 respectively. The forward primers from both BACs were combined to yield a unique PCR amplification product from patient DNA which contained the proximal inversion breakpoint. Primers used to amplify the proximal inversion breakpoint from affected KF2 01 family members were 1F primer 5 ATCCCTTAGTTGAACACAAAAAGCACAAGC 3 from BAC AC026561 SEQ ID NO 10 and the 2F primer 5 TTCTATAAAGATCATCCATGCTAAACACTG 3 from BAC AC012238 SEQ ID NO 11 . To clone the distal inversion breakpoint this PCR protocol was repeated using a mixed reverse primer set comprising 1R primer 5 TGTATGAGAGTTTTGGTGGTTCCACATC 3 SEQ ID NO 12 and 2R 5 GATAAGGACTGAGATATGCCCTGGT 3 SEQ ID NO 13 .

Long range breakpoint PCR was performed in a 25 l reaction mixture containing 50 ng of genomic DNA 0.2 M of each primer 200 M dNTPs and 1 U Elongase enzyme Life Technologies . An initial 3 min denaturation step at 95 C. 32 cycles of denaturation at 95 C. for 30 s annealing at 60 C. for 30 s and extension at 72 C. for 7 min followed by a final extension at 68 C. for 3 min. PCR products were purified using QIAquick Spin PCR purification kit QIAGEN before sequencing.

DNA sequencing was performed using the ABI Big Dye Terminator version 3.1 cycle sequencing kit essentially according to manufacturer s instructions i.e. 5 ng 5 L purified PCR amplicon 4 L reaction pre mix 2 L 5 sequencing buffer 3.2 pmol 2 L appropriate primer and 7 L deionized water were added in a 96 well microtiter plate. The plate was transferred to a PCR thermocycler MJ Research PTC 200 and cycled at 96 C. for 1 min 25 cycles at 96 C. for 10 s 50 C. for 5 s and 60 C. for 4 min. Sequencing products were purified using ABI Centri Sep spin columns. Resuspended samples were resolved on an ABI 377 DNA sequencer essentially according to the manufacturer s instructions and sequences analyzed using the BioEdit biological sequence alignment editor v 5.0.9.1 Tom Hall Isis Pharmaceuticals .

The 2 exons of GDF6 were screened by automated sequencing including at least 50 bp into the intron boundaries. The transcription start codon resides in exon 1. Primers were designed using the Primer3 program and were synthesised by Invitrogen Australia. PCR was performed in a 25 l reaction mixture containing 50 ng genomic DNA 0.2 M of each primer 200 M dNTPs in 1 PCR buffer with 5 DMSO and 0.25 U Taq polymerase Promega . Before thermal cycling samples were denatured at 95 C. for 4 min followed by five touch down cycles of 95 C. for 40 s denaturation 65 C. for 40 s annealing and 72 C. for 50 s extension then 28 cycles of 95 C. for 40 s denaturation 60 C. for 40 s annealing and 72 C. for 50 s extension with a final extension at 72 C. for min Corbett Research CG1 96 . PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis in 1.4 agarose gels and purified using the Promega Wizard gel purification system before bi directional sequencing.

Sequence alignments were carried out using ClustalW software. Proteins from aligned species included and . GDF6 secondary structure was predicted for GDF6 using PROF 19. The cysteine knot was prepared in comparison with GDF520 using PyMOL graphics system Delano Scientific USA .

To determine if any conserved DNA elements were located in the breakpoint region a comparative analysis of genomic sequences from multiple species was performed. The breakpoint occurs between GDF6 630 kb 3 and C8orf37 hypothetical protein LOC157657 180 kb 5 . The genomic sequence in the interval between GDF6 and C8orf37 were extracted from the Ensembl and NCBI GenBank databases for human chimpanzee dog mouse rat chicken and opossum and analysis for CNSs using VISTA software with the human sequence as the reference sequence Frazer et al. 32 W273 279 2004 .

A CNS was defined to be 100 bp ungapped alignment with at least 70 identity. The human gene annotation was obtained from the Ensembl database and the repeat information was obtained from RepeatMasker.

The nucleus pulposus NP and out region of the annulus fibrosus AF were collected fresh from 1 subject age 16 undergoing a lumbar total disc replacement surgery.

One normal Spraugue Dawley male rat weighting 380 g was anesthetised and humanly sacrificed before the lumbar spinal disc and vertebrae were immediately dissected.

All tissue specimens were immediately fixed in 10 neutral buffered formalin for 5 hour and washed with PBS followed by embedding in paraffin. Animal disc tissue was decalcified RDO solution Lomb Scientific Australia for 24 h. 4 M mid sagittal serial sections were cut and mounted on Super Plus slides Lomb Scientific . Hematoxylin eosin H E staining was performed for general histological examinations. For Alcian blue staining proteoglycan and Safranin O staining newly deposited matrix serial sections were de waxed in xylene and re hydrated through graded ethanol and stained in Alcian blue solution 1 W V pH 4.2 or Safranin O for 15 min. Nuclei were counter stained with nuclear red solution.

For immunohistochemical staining slides were deparaffinized and hydrated through graded ethanol and equilibrated in Tris HCl pH 7.6 buffer. Antigen retrieval was achieved using DAKA Target Retrieval Solution. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with 3 v v HOand nonspecific binding blocked with 10 skimmed milk powder in Tris buffered HCl. Primary rabbit anti human GDF 6 polyclonal GDF6 1 500 dilution Alpha Diagnostic Int. was incubated on the slides for 1 hour at room temperature washed and treated with MULTILINK solution DAKO Australia followed by incubation with streptavidin conjugated peroxidase. The sections were visualized with 3 3 diaminobenzidine hydrochloride solution DAB DAKO and counterstained with Haematoxylin. Negative controls were treated in a similar manner.

To identify the location of breakpoints on 8q22.2 and 8q23.316 in KFS subjects FISH chromosome analysis using chromosome 8 specific BAC probes was performed. Two BACs AC026561 and AC012238 were identified that spanned the respective breakpoints which gave unique split hybridization signals on chromosome 8q confirmed in twenty metaphases . Breakpoint specific PCR screening verified cosegregation of the inversion with the disease phenotype in twenty affected and four unaffected KF2 01 family members. Breakpoint PCR amplicons were sequenced and the proximal and distal breakpoints identified at nucleotide position 96544749 and 116078713 respectively on chromosome 8q. The full length of the inverted segment was 19 533 963 bp. No additional rearrangement or DNA loss was associated with either breakpoint. Both inversion breakpoints were localized within extensive intergenic regions significant distances from neighbouring genes.

The distal breakpoint occurred within an intergenic region 1.6 Mb 5 from CSMD3 and 400 kb 3 from the TRPS1 human disease gene. CSMD3 is expressed predominantly in fetal brain24 and TRPS1 mutations are causative in trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type I. The TRPS1 gene was not disrupted by the inversion. TRPS1 patients with previously characterized deletions in this same region 3 of the TRPS1 gene did not present with KFS like phenotypes Ludecke et al. 68 81 91 2001 .

The proximal KF2 01 inversion breakpoint also occurred within an intergenic region 180 kb 5 of transcript C8orf37 hypothetical protein LOC157657 and 630 kb 3 of GDF6. C8orf37 is a transcription unit of unknown function and GDF6 a member of the BMP family of secreted signalling molecules is implicated in skeletal development. This genomic region between GDF6 and C8 orf37 is known to harbor GDF6 long range enhancer elements Mortlock et al. 13 2069 2081 2003 . Regions rich in conserved non coding sequences adjacent to the breakpoint were identified. With the exception of GDF6 no other genes located adjacent to the KF2 01 inversion breakpoints have recognised developmental or biological roles or known expression patterns which overlap with the KF2 01 familial phenotype.

GDF6 expression was also observed within nucleus pulposus cells of both rat and human adult IVDs . As a strong candidate for KFS GDF6 was subsequently screened for mutations in our large cohort of patients.

GDF6 coding regions and associated exon splice sites were sequenced in 105 patients with de novo or inherited cases of KFS. Two new polymorphisms were identified in both the KFS and control populations screened c.506 28C A and c.1036G C p.SER312SER at a frequency of approximately 4 of the population tested. Two different missense mutations were identified in three unrelated cases of KFS. In each case the mutation was not detected in 174 controls i.e. 348 chromosomes tested giving 95 power to distinguish a normal sequence variant from a mutation Collins et al. 71 1251 1252 2002. None of the base substitutions found was present in the NCBI dbSNP database.

A heterozygous c.846C A missense mutation segregating with KFS patterns of vertebral fusion always inclusive of the C2 3 fusion was also identified. The mutation c.846C A in exon 2 resulted in the substitution of glutamic acid for alanine 249 GDF6A249E within the GDF6 prodomain. The GDF6A249E missense variant segregated with the KFS phenotype in the family and was absent from unaffected family members and ethnically matched normal controls.

A recurrent heterozygous missense mutation c.966T C was identified in two unrelated patients with sporadic KFS. Sequencing identified a recurrent missense mutation c.966T C in exon 2 which resulted in the substitution of leucine for proline at position 289 GDF6L289P.

The missense mutations identified in the present study both cause amino acid changes in a region of GDF6 that is predicted to be required for GDF6 homodimerization and or heterodimerization and as a consequence GDF 6 signaling. Accordingly these results indicate that disruption of GDF 6 signaling results in KFS syndrome and as a consequence aberrant IVD development and or maintenance. This is supported by the persistence of GDF6 expression in the nucleus pulposus cells of the adult vertebral disc may indicate an extended role for GDF6 in disc maintenance.

Nucleus pulposus tissue were visually separated from annulus fibrosus and aseptically procured from a cadaveric sheep spine 2 years of age into sterile saline. Tissues were cut into 1 mmpieces and then digested overnight with 0.025 collagenase solution in a shaking incubator at 37 C. Isolated cells were grown in 10 fetal calf serum FCS with 1 antibiotics P S F in DMEM Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. culture media until confluency.

Transfection was performed with either 80 ng or 240 ng of an expression vector including a nucleic acid encoding MSX1 or MSX2 with an empty expression vector premixed with 18 l Lipofectamine 2000 in Opti MEM Invitrogen using 6 well plates 3 10cells per well for six wells essentially according to manufacturer s instructions. At two days post transfection cells were selected and maintained with 600 g G 418 Sulfate Invitrogen per ml of culture media.

Cell survival was measured with MTS Cell Proliferation Assay kit Promega Madison Wis. using cells 1 10 well plated in 96 well plates. Assays were performed as specified by the manufacturer where only viable cells are able to metabolically reduce tetrazolium salts to formazan salts detected directly on a spectrophotometer at 490 nm

Collagen synthesis was assessed by 3H proline incorporation. L 2 3 3H Proline Perkin Elmer Sydney Australia was added to culture medium at a concentration of 2 Ci 200 L media. Cells were incubated for 24 hours. Cells were then harvested after washing with 95 ethanol and PBS. Radioactivity of cells was counted in a liquid scintillation counter.

Proteoglycan synthesis was assessed by 35S sulfate incorporation. 35S sulfate Perkin Elmer Sydney Australia was added to cell cultures at 2 Ci per well and allowed to incubate for 24 hours. Cells washed with 95 ethanol and PBS and harvested. Radioactivity of the cells was counted in a liquid scintillation counter as a representative of proteoglycan synthesis.

Anulus fibrosus cells or nucleus pulposus cells were isolated from sheep IVDs and cultured for three passages. Following this period cells were transfected with an expression vector expressing MSX 1 or MSX 2 under control of the CMV promoter or a control vector empty expression vector . Cells were transfected with two different concentrations of expression vector i.e. 80 ng or 240 ng .

Following a suitable period for the introduced nucleic acids to be expressed cells were assayed for collagen production by determining the level of incorporation of H proline into cells. As shown in at the 80 ng dosage level MSX 1 induced a significant increase in collagen synthesis in annulus fibrosus cells. At the 240 ng dosage both MSX 1 and MSX 2 induced a significant increase in collagen synthesis in annulus fibrosus cells compared to control cells .

Cells were also assayed to determine the level of extracellular matrix production be determining the level of S incorporation into a culture. As shown in 80 ng of nucleic acid encoding MSX 1 significantly increased extracellular matrix production compared to control cells. Moreover 240 ng of nucleic acid encoding MSX 2 significantly increased the level of extracellular matrix production above control cells .

As shown in ectopic expression of MSX 1 or MSX 2 did not significantly alter the incorporation of H thymidine by transformed cells i.e. did not increase cell proliferation in annulus fibrosus cells.

These results indicate that MSX 1 and or MSX 2 are capable of inducing changes in IVD cells associated with IVD regeneration.

A skin incision is made on the left side immediately anterior to the transverse processes of the spine and the lumbar spine exposed by blunt dissection using an anterior muscle splitting technique. Sheep will receive controlled annular lesions in their L1 L2 L3 L4 and L5 L6 discs by incision through the left anterolateral annulus fibrosus parallel and adjacent to the cranial endplate using a scalpel blade to create a lesion measuring approximately 4 mm long and approximately 5 mm deep. The intervening lumbar discs L2 L3 L4 L5 will not be incised. A non operated disc remains between treated discs to allow for adequate anchorage of FSUs in subsequent mechanical testing. A wire suture will be used to identify the craniad operated level for later identification purposes both in X rays and for morphological identification.

Three months after induction of the annular lesions the sheep will be killed and the lumbar spines will be radiographed to evaluate disc calcification excised and processed for biomechanical and histochemical analyses and after the biomechanical testing the same discs zonally dissected for compositional analyses.

Recombinant human GDF 6 is obtained from a commercial source such as for example US Biological MA USA.

Animal models as described in Example 4 are treated with recombinant GDF 6. For example incised discs receive one of three therapies administered using a standard needle or essentially as described in Example 9 hereof I no treatment II lactose solution or III lactose containing GDF 6. In all animals the L3 L4 disc receives an annular lesion with no treatment. In one group of animals the L1 L2 discs are treated with lactose solution only and the L5 L6 disc are treated with lactose plus GDF 6. In another group of animals the treatments in the L1 L2 and L5 L6 discs are reversed to avoid any potential outcome bias associated with spinal level.

Disc height is radiographically monitored biweekly from the day of administration of the above treatment to 24 weeks post administration. Intervertebral height is expressed as the disc height index DHI Percent DHI DHI postoperative DHI preoperative DHI 100 . At 4 8 12 and 24 weeks after injection an MRI of the spinal column is taken to grade the level of degeneration based on modified Thompson grade MRI 1 normal 4 severely degenerated Masuda et al. 30 5 2004 

Samples of annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposis are diced over ice and representative portions of each tissue zone of known wet weight is freeze dried to a constant weight. The difference between the starting and final weights of the tissues is indicative of water content of the tissue. Triplicate portions 1 2 mg of the dried tissues are hydrolyzed in 6M HCl at 110 C. for 16 h and aliquots of the neutralized digests assayed for hydroxyproline as a measure of the tissue collagen content essentially as described in Melrose et al. 10 665 676 1992 and Melrose et al. 14 61 75 1994. Triplicate portions of dried tissues are digested with papain and aliquots of the solubilized tissue assayed for sulphated glycosaminoglycan using the metachromatic dye 1 9 dimethylmethylene blue as a measure of tissue proteoglycan see Melrose et al. 1992 and 1994 supra .

Spinal motion segments that are designated for histochemical analysis are isolated by cutting through the cranial and caudal vertebral bodies close to the cartilaginous endplates. Entire disc specimens including the adjacent vertebral body segments are fixed en bloc in either 10 neutral buffered formalin or Histochoice for 56 h and decalcified in several changes of 10 formic acid in 5 NBF for 2 weeks with constant agitation until complete decalcification is confirmed using a Faxitron HP43855A X ray cabinet Hewlett Packard McMinnville USA .

Sagittal slices 5 mm thick of the decalcified disc vertebral body specimens are dehydrated through graded ethanol solutions by standard histological methods and embedded in paraffin wax. Paraffin sections 4 m thick are prepared for histochemical staining and mounted on Superfrost Plus glass microscope slides Menzel Glaser and dried.

Sections are deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through graded ethanol washes 100 70 v v to water.

Sections from all blocks are stained with haematoxylin and eosin. These sections are examined by a histopathologist who compares the histological characteristics of those levels that receive annular incision only with those that are incised and receive GDF 6. A four point semi quantitative grading system is used to assess the microscopic features. Collagen architecture is also examined in sections stained with Masson s trichrome and picro sirius red using polarized light microscopy.

For immunohistochemistry endogenous peroxidase activity is blocked by incubating the tissue sections with 3 HO. Tissue sections are then treated with combinations of chondroitinase ABC 0.25 U ml in 20 mM Tris acetate buffer pH 8.0 for 1 h at 37 C. bovine testicular hyaluronidase 1000 U ml for 1 h at 37 C. in phosphate buffer pH 5.0 followed by washes in 20 mM Tris HCl pH 7.2 0.5M NaCl TBS or proteinase K DAKO S3020 for 6 min at room temperature to expose antigenic epitopes. The tissues are then blocked for 1 h in 20 normal swine serum and probed with a number of primary antibodies to large and small proteoglycans and collagens Aggrecan Perlecan Versican Decorin Biglycan Fibromodulin Collagen Type I Collagen Type II Collagen Type IV Collagen Type VI and Collagen Type X. Negative control sections are also processed either omitting primary antibody or substituting an irrelevant isotype matched primary antibody for the authentic primary antibody of interest. Horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase conjugated secondary antibodies are used for detection using 0.05 3 3 diaminobenzidene dihydrochloride and 0.03 HOin TBS or Nova RED substrates. The stained slides are examined by bright field microscopy and photographed using a Leica MPS 60 photomicroscope digital camera system.

Non destructive biomechanical range of motion ROM analysis is conducted on each functional spinal unit FSU in various planes of motion flexion extension lateral bending compression and torsion . Each FSU comprises two adjacent vertebrae the intervening disc and associated ligaments.

Four FSUs are tested non operated control levels levels that are incised levels that are incised and treated with GDF 6 and carrier and levels that are incised and treated with carrier alone. Each FSU is mounted in two aluminum alloy cups and secured with cold cure dental cement. Care is taken to ensure that the IVD is aligned with the cups. Prior to the commencement of testing each FSU is preloaded to a constant until a reproducible state of hydration is achieved. This constant stress is used as the baseline prior to each test. The constant stress simulates relaxed standing and is based on in vivo measurement of intradiscal pressure Wilke H J et al. 24 755 62 1999 . A torsional load and flexion extension lateral bending load is applied over 10 cycles whilst under a constant axial load. A cyclic axial load is applied to investigate the axial compression response of the IVD.

MSX 1 or MSX 2 polypeptide fused to a HIV 1 tat protein transduction domain and a hexa histidine tag is produced by recombinant means. As a control a beta galactosidase protein fused to a HIV 1 tat protein transduction domain and a hexahistidine tag is produced. Recombinant protein is isolated using a nickel NTA column.

Sprague Dawley rats aged 11 months are euthanized and IVD tissue from the lumbar spine and tail harvested under sterile conditions. Annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus are separately dissected and diced. The IVD tissue is placed in Dulbecco s modified Eagle s medium and Ham s F12 medium DMEM F 12 GIBCO BRL Grand Island N.Y. U.S.A. containing 100 unit ml penicillin and 100 mg ml streptomycin. The IVD tissue is treated with 0.2 pronase Sigma Chemical St. Louis Mo. U.S.A. in the medium for 1 hour at 37 C. and then treated with 0.025 collagenase Sigma Chemical St. Louis Mo. U.S.A. for 6 hours at 37 C. Isolated cells are washed and filtered through a 70 mm mesh Falcon Franklin Lakes N.J. U.S.A. into 75 cmflasks with 12 ml DMEM F 12 medium containing 10 fetal bovine serum FBS 100 unit ml penicillin 100 mg ml streptomycin 2 mM L glutamine and 50 mg ml ascorbate. The cells are grown at 37 C. in 5 COwith humidification. The culture media is changed every 2 days for approximately 8 days.

When the primary culture of IVD cells become confluent the cells are subcultured into 6 well plates at 400 000 cells per well. Three days later the cells are treated with either the MSX 1 fusion protein or a MSX 2 fusion protein or both fusion proteins or the LacZ fusion protein. Cell number is determined at day 0 by counting a control well using a hemocytometer. Cells are maintained in the presence of the peptide for two weeks. The medium is changed every 3 days during the experiment.

The sulfated glycosaminoglycan sGAG content of the culture media is assayed using the 1 9 dimethylmethylene blue DMMB method. The culture media 2 ml is centrifuged 5000 G for 30 minutes to concentrate the sGAG using the Centricon YM 50 centrifugal filter Millipore Co. Bedford Mass. U.S.A. . The sample solution 20 ml is mixed gently with 200 ml DMMB dye solution in a 96 well microtiter plate and the optical density OD was checked immediately at 520 nm wavelength filter. A standard curve is constructed using serial dilutions of chondroitin sulfate Sigma Chemical St. Louis Mo. U.S.A. . Total sGAG in the media is normalized by DNA content and presented as a ratio to the untreated control.

The cell number is determined by the DNA content of each well and DNA content is measured with a Hoechst dye 33258 Polysciences Warrington Pa. U.S.A. method. Cultured cells are removed from the plate by exposure to papain 10 units ml . Cells are pelleted and incubated at 60 C. for 3 hours. A twenty microliter aliquot of the papain digest is mixed with 200 ml of Hoechst dye 33258 solution in a 96 well fluoroplate. Emission and excitation spectra are measured in Luminescence Spectrometer LS 50B Perkin Elmer Wellesly Mass. U.S.A. at 456 nm and 365 nm respectively. Standard curves are generated at the time of each measurement using known concentrations of calf thymus DNA Sigma Chemical St. Louis Mo. U.S.A. .

Recombinant peptides are administered to an animal model e.g. as described in Example 4 using a standard needle or as described in Example 9 hereof. The effect of the peptides on the animals is determined essentially as described in Example 5.

Recombinant type 5 human adenoviral vectors with complete deletion of the E1A and E1B regions and a partial deletion of the E3 region of the viral genome are used in this study Bett et al. 91 8802 8806 1994 . A therapeutic vector contains a cDNA encoding MSX 1 or MSX 2 gene under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter AD MSX at a concentration of 5 10pfu ml. Control adenoviral vector contains the beta galactosidase gene under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter Ad beta gal also at a concentration of 5 10pfu ml.

Rabbits treated as described in Example 4 are anesthetized. Viral solution comprising therapeutic vector or control vector 7.5 l of a solution comprising 3.75 10pfu as described above under section 7.1 is administered to a punctured disc that has been induced to undergo disc degeneration or alternatively a control disc. Therapeutic vector is administered into one disc in each animal and control vector is administered into a separate disc in each animal. Administration is achieved using a standard needle e.g. a 19 gauge needle and a Hamilton microsyringe or essentially as described in Example 9 hereof.

Nucleic acid encoding GDF 6 or MSX 1 or MSX 2 under control of a CMV promoter is inserted into an HIV 1 based self inactivating SIN lentiviral vector pHRSINcPPT SEW . As a control a vector expressing the eGFP reporter gene under the control of the spleen focus forming virus SFFV LTR is used.

Bone marrow cells are collected by flushing the femurs tibias and iliac crests from New Zealand white rabbits with PBS supplemented with 2 fetal bovine serum FBS Gibco Paisley UK . Red blood cell depleted bone marrow mononuclear cells BMMNCs are plated at a density of 10cells cmin mesenchymal medium with mesenchymal supplements Stem Cell Technologies Vancouver Canada further supplemented with 100 IU ml penicillin and 100 g ml streptomycin Gibco . Non adherent cells are eliminated by a half medium change at day 3 and the whole medium is replaced weekly with fresh medium. The cells are grown for 2 3 weeks until attaining near confluence. The whole adherent fraction is then detached by trypsinization and re plated using a 1 3 dilution factor. Subsequent passing and seeding of the cells is performed at a density of 5000 cells cm. To enrich MSCs adherent cells from passage 2 P2 and 3 P3 are stained with anti CD45 CyChrome and CD11b PE BD Biosciences Oxford UK or a combination of CD45 and biotin conjugated lineage Lin cocktail antibodies Stem Cell Technologies followed by streptavidin PE. The negative fraction from both cell surface antigens is sorted using the flow activated sorter Vantage Becton Dickinson Oxford UK . Enriched MSC populations are cultured under the same conditions as described above.

Transduction of MSCs is performed with the expression constructs as described above under section 8.1. For transduction 1 10purified MSCs from passage 4 purP4 are seeded into individual wells of a 12 well plate. The following day virus particles are added at multiplicity of infection m.o.i. of 5 10 30 or 50 and transduction is performed for 20 hours. Cells transduced with an eGFP expressing vector are harvested on day 1 3 and 5 after virus removal and analyzed for eGFP expression by flow cytometry.

Rabbits treated as described in Example 4 to induce IVD degeneration are treated with the transduced stem cells prepared as described above under section 8.3. Transduced stem cells 2 10 that are obtained a few days post viral removal to minimize further expansion are administered directly into the treated IVD of the rabbits using a standard needle or as described in Example 9 hereof. Rabbits are analyzed essentially as described in Example 4 and 5 to determine the effect of stem cell infusion i.e. re population and repair of the degenerated IVD.

To determine the survival of stem cells cells expressing eGFP in control administrations are stained for eGFP expressions. Tissues are fixed in 10 neutral buffered formaldehyde NBF embedded in paraffin and in some cases the other half of each tissue is cryo embedded. Each embedded tissue is sectioned between 10 to 15 levels with a 70 to 100 m gap between each one. Each level is serially sectioned at least 4 times. Sections 4 m thick are screened for the presence of eGFP either by staining with an eGFP antibody Santa Cruz Biotechnology or by direct visualization using a fluorescent microscope Zeiss AxioVision2 Zeiss Welwyn Garden City UK .

Recombinant GDF 6 Example 5 and or recombinant MSX 1 Example 6 and or recombinant MSX 2 Example 6 is administered to the animal models described in Example 4 hereof essentially following the protocols described in Examples 5 and 6 with the exception that the GF6 modulatory composition is formulated in lactose solution and in a hydrogel or co polymer for administration to an IVD or a region adjacent or surrounding an IVD using the device exemplified in .

Referring to the delivery device includes a delivery conduit having a proximal end attachable to a source of the compositions of the invention to be administered the device and the source forming a system for the delivery of the compositions to an IVD or a region adjacent or surrounding an IVD in a subject in need thereof. The source is typically a syringe for dispensing the compositions through the delivery conduit .

An emitter structure is arranged at the distal end of the delivery conduit . The emitter structure defines as shown in greater detail in of the drawings a plurality of discharge apertures arranged at longitudinally spaced intervals. The discharge apertures are configured to effect uniform diffuse distribution of a composition of the invention throughout an IVD nucleus of an IVD . To effect the uniform diffuse distribution of the composition the apertures closer to the distal end of the delivery conduit are of smaller diameter than the apertures distally arranged on the emitter structure . In such a fashion there is a substantially uniform discharge of the agent through the apertures of the emitter structure to facilitate the diffuse distribution of the agent throughout the nucleus of the IVD or a region adjacent or surrounding an IVD.

The emitter structure may have a diameter in a range from about 0.1 mm to about 3.5 mm and may be formed of a reinforced suitable plastics material for example. The reinforcing may be in the form of bands not shown arranged at longitudinally spaced intervals to retain the emitter structure in an open condition against pressure exerted by the tissue of the nucleus in use.

The emitter structure may be steerable to adopt a loop shape in the nucleus as shown in . To achieve this the emitter structure may have a steering wire or pull wire not shown for example embedded in its wall. Manipulation of the steering wire is carried out by a clinician with the assistance of for example fluoroscopy to ensure that the emitter structure adopts a spread out configuration within the nucleus of the IVD .

The emitter structure may have alternative configurations such as a preformed guide wire instead of a steering wire such that the emitter structure adopts a similar loop shape or it may be forked having a plurality of branches to effect distribution of the composition through the nucleus of the IVD .

To introduce the emitter structure into the nucleus of the disc an annulotomy is formed on an annulus of the IVD . The annulotomy results in an access opening being formed in the annulus of the disc . A working cannula is inserted percutaneously through the subject s skin in a minimally invasive manner. The working cannula may also be used for performing the annulotomy on the annulus . Thus a tip of the working cannula is sharpened or beveled for effecting perforation of the annulus .

Once a tip of the working cannula has been inserted into the nucleus through the opening the emitter structure of the delivery device is extended through the end of the working cannula to adopt the position shown for example in of the drawings and enabling a diffuse substantially uniform distribution of the composition of the invention throughout the nucleus to be effected.

Once delivery of the composition has been completed a positive pressure is maintained in the envelope to inhibit back flow of the composition through the apertures into the interior of the emitter structure . This is done in one of a number of ways such as a having a non return valve in each aperture b maintaining a continuous pressure for example by a motorized pneumatic device not shown while withdrawing the emitter structure into the working cannula or c pumping air into the emitter structure behind the agent.

Use of the device targets the composition to the nucleus of an IVD and facilitates diffuse substantially uniform distribution of a composition of the invention to the IVD such that the composition is more evenly distributed throughout the tissue i.e. from the nucleus or to a region adjacent or surrounding an IVD.

Approximately 2.5 105 CHO cells maintained in serum free medium were transfected with an expression vector comprising full length GDF 6 cDNA fused to a FLAG tag or an expression vector comprising a cDNA encoding an active domain of GDF 6 fused to a FLAG tag SEQ ID NO 25 in 6 well plates using Lipofectamine 2000 Invitrogen according to manufacturer s instructions. Briefly 12.5 l of Lipofectamine 2000 was mixed with 5 g vector in a total volume of 250 L 20 minutes before addition to CHO cell cultures. Lipofectamine vector mixtures are then added to CHO cells and incubated for 5 hours. Proteins secreted into the supernatant were harvested and analyzed by Western blotting and Alkaline Phosphatase activity.

Concentrated supernatants from one well of a 6 well plate were separated using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis PAGE under either reducing conditions. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and detected with antisera specific for GDF 6 or for the FLAG tag secondary antibodies and detection system.

Cells were incubated with GDF 6 or the active fragment for varying periods of time then lysed with 0.1 TritonX 100 in PBS buffer. Lysates were then incubated for 30 minutes at 37 C. with the alkaline phosphatase substrate p nitrophenylphosphate Sigma Aldrich at 2.5 g ml. The levels of p nitrophenol PNP production were measured by a spectrophotometer and concentrations were determined by comparison with a standard curve created with known amounts of p nitrophenol. Alkaline phosphatase activity was expressed as nanomoles of PNP generated per microgram of total cellular protein per minute.

As shown in Western blotting of supernatant from cells transfected with full length GDF 6 or active fragment of GDF 6 using anti GDF 6 antisera detected a band of approximately 12 14 kDa similar to the positive control. This band was not detected in supernatants from mock transfected cells. The identified GDF 6 bands are also recognised by the FLAG tag specific mAb Sigma however control protein was not as expected since the control protein does not comprise a FLAG tag. These data indicate that the GDF 6 protein detected was a product derived from the transfected cDNA.

When protein isolated from CHO cells expression either full length GDF 6 or active domain of GDF 6 is analyzed using non reducing PAGE the size of the protein detected is indicative of a homodimer formation.

In addition the protein purified from the supernatant of transfected cells possessed equivalent greater alkaline phosphatase activity than commercially obtained protein produced in

These results indicate that a truncated GDF 6 with a FLAG peptide attached was produced in CHO cells and secreted into the culture media. The protein forms homodimer reminiscent of normal GDF 6 homodimers and possessed levels of alkaline phosphatase activity comparable to that of full length GDF 6.

Sheep are be purchased from the University farm Arthursleigh Australia and transported to a veterinary centre a minimum of 2 weeks prior to first experimental procedure and housed in a paddock. Each sheep is premedicated with 0.3 mg kg diazepam and individually taken to the anesthesia induction area immediately prior to the surgical procedure. The jugular vein is catheterized using a 16 G 3.25 cm catheter after local anesthetic is placed under skin using a syringe and 25 gauge needle. Sheep are anaesthetized with 10 mg kg ketamine given to effect. The sheep are placed in right lateral recumbency and the right caudal quarter of the sheep clipped and aseptically prepared. A straight incision a few fingerbreadths below the costal margin and parallel to lateral border of the erector spinae muscles is made to allow exposure of the lower lumbar vertebrae L2 to L6 . The approach is made retroperitoneally using electrocautery to divide the subcutaneous tissue fascia and thoracolumbar aponeurosis and transversalis fascia in line with the skin incision the peritoneum is protected and reflected anteriorly by blunt dissection. A retractor is placed between rostral and the iliac crest to aid exposure. The vertebral bodies from L3 to L5 are identified and with a Deaver retractor the vessels lying anterior to the spine are protected. Once the appropriate involved vertebra is identified the psoas muscle is elevated bluntly off the lumbar vertebrae and retracted laterally to the level of the transverse process with a Richardson retractor. Bipolar coagulation of vessels around the vertebrae is also performed. The fibrosus annuli of anterolateral discs of L2 to L5 are identified. Annular fibrosus of two non contiguous lumbar discs per animal. The incision of fibrous annulus is made to a 6 mm depth using a 9 B P knife blade. The IVD located between the two punctured IVDs is used as a control. A 27 mm 10 mm titanium screw is implanted into the vertebral body at one level for later identification of levels. One of the punctured levels will is treated with 300 ug of full length GDF 6 or an active domain thereof produced essentially as described in Example 10 in saline solution and the other punctured disc treated with saline control. In both cases the treatment is injected into the nucleus pulposus of punctured discs. After completion of procedure the wound is closed in layers.

Radiographs lateral only are taken prior to waking of animals. Two weeks after surgery and monthly thereafter radiography are performed on the assigned sheep using 0.3 mg kg diazepam and 0.2 mg kg butorphanol intravenously for sedation. The remaining radiographs and CT scans are performed after euthanasia on the assigned days 4 8 and 18 months . Disc height is also raidographically determined on a monthly basis lateral view only and following euthanasia. IVD height is expressed as a disc height index DHI . The level of degeneration based on the Thompson grade 1 normal 4 severely degenerated is also assessed using MRI.

Following four eight or eighteen months sheep are euthanized using an overdose of pentobarbitone administered intravenously. After euthanasia the sheep spines are removed for analysis and subjected to CT and MRI scans.

Lumbar vertebral joints are biomechanically tested using an Instron 8874 in 4 modes. Range of motion constraint to motion and hysteresis will be quantified for the treated joints and compared to controls. Annular tissue samples from treated joint levels and controls are to be isolated and tested in tension to determine ultimate strength and tensile modulus.

Disc tissue collected post mortem is subject to histological analysis to assess the level of disc degeneration. Spines are removed surgically and muscle tissue removed before being submerged in working formalin solution 10 in 0.1M Phosphate buffer . Spines are labeled according to head tail orientation. After initial fixation spines are segmented into individual discs labeled 2 1 1 2 in relation to the position of the titanium screw inserted at surgery and thus identifiable in respect of the treatment administered. Discs are then de calcified. Individual discs are sectioned into pieces of tissue no more than 5 mm thick placed in cassettes for paraffin embedding and thin sectioning. Tissues are then stained with haematoxylin eosin for tissue architecture analysis.

Sheep n 7 underwent left retroperitoneal exposure of their lumbar spine and three discs were exposed. Two discs were injured with a No 15 bard Parker Blade to a 6 mm depth and one injected with 70 l of saline and the other injected with 70 ul of recombinant human GDF 6 rhGDF 6 . The remaining disc was left uninjured and untreated. To mark the level of the discs a titanium screw was implanted into a marker vertebral body. Sheep were sacrificed at 4 months or 8 months. To evaluate early degeneration and its treatment highly sensitive MRI scans were used. Exemplary results are shown in . Degeneration grading was based on visual inspection evaluating predominantly nucleus pulposus hydration end plate changes and disc height and blinded scoring was performed by two observers. Discs were graded as follows Good disc 1 somewhat good disc 2 bad disc 3 Very bad disc 4 and finally extremely disc 5 .

At the 4 month mark early degenerative changes were appreciated by both observers. All un injured controls were Good 1 saline controls were generally graded as very bad 4 and the majority of rhGDF 6 treated discs graded some what good 2 . These results indicate that rhGDF 6 can reduce or delay IVD degeneration and or enhance IVD regeneration in a sheep annular tear model.

Surgically discarded human disc tissues were collected in sterile saline 0.9 NaCl Baxter International Inc. Deerfield Ill. USA following patient consent. Tissues were repeatedly washed in sterile phosphate buffered saline Invitrogen until the solution was clear then cut into approximately 1 mmpieces prior to overnight digestion with 0.025 collagenase Sigma Aldrich St Louis Mo. USA . Following digestion with collagenase cell suspensions were suspended in 0.02 M HEPES 2 antibiotic antimycotic penicillin streptomycin fungizone P S F and Hank s balanced salt solution HBSS Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. USA in a shaking incubator at 37 C. The cells were then harvested with a 1000 rpm centrifugation step for 10 minutes with the resultant cellular pellet resuspended into fresh culture media 10 fetal calf serum FCS HyClone Tauranga New Zealand with 1 antibiotic antimycotic P S F in DMEM Invitrogen and cultured in monolayers within a 37 C. cell culture incubator with 5 CO.

Cells were grown to confluency and passaged by trypsinisation and re seeded at a lower density for further culturing or experimentation. Specifically adherent cultures were washed twice with sterile pre warmed phosphate buffered saline for complete removal of existing culture media prior to incubation with trypsinisation solution 0.05 Trypsin EDTA 4 Na 0.02 M HEPES in HBSS Invitrogen completely covering the cellular surface in the 37 C. cell culture incubator with 5 COuntil the cells were in suspension. Trypsin was then inactivated by addition 10 FCS containing culture media with the entire contents subjected to a 5 minutes centrifugation step at 1000 rpm for the collection of trypsinised cells. The cells were then resuspended in fresh culture media with an aliquot removed to determine the viable cellular density by visual counting of non trypan blue stained cells as described below and subsequently seeded at an appropriate density into new culture flasks for continued culturing or experimentation.

Equal volumes of cell suspension to 0.4 trypan blue stain Invitrogen suspended in HBSS was mixed together and stained for 5 minutes at room temperature prior to applying a small sample under a freshly placed coverslip on top of a hemacytometer Bright Line hemacytometer Sigma Aldrich until the chamber was full. The counting chamber 3 3 mm grid was visualized microscopically with the four corner 1 mm grid counted for the number of viable non stained cells. The calculation used to determine cell numbers per milliliter and total cells in suspension was as follows cells ml average count per square 1 mm grid dilution factor 10and total cells cells ml total original volume of cell suspension from which the sample was taken.

Human disc cell cultures from either the annular nuclear or endplate region were seeded into 60 mmplates at a density of 1.6 10cells per plate. On day three post seeding cells were stimulated with either media alone or containing 200 ng of GDF 6 Peprotec Asia Israel and left to culture for a period of seven days. Culture media containing the stimulant was changed every three days. Upon the seventh day the cultures were harvested for either western blotting analysis or real time RT PCR analysis.

Confluent cells cultured in 75 cmflasks were washed twice with PBS and 500 l of homogenization buffer 50 mM Tris pH 7.4 0.1 mM EDTA Leupeptin 1 g ml Pepstatin 5 AEBSF 200 g ml Sigma Aldrich was added directly to the cultures and incubated for 20 minutes on ice prior to the removal of cells with a cell scraper. Cellular lysates were then briefly sonicated and stored in 70 C. with individual aliquots for subsequent determination of protein concentration using the Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit Pierce Rockford Ill. USA as well as Western blotting procedures.

For Western blotting thawed lysates were suspended in an equal volume of 2 sample buffer 4 SDS 20 glycerol 25 0.5 M Tris HCl pH 6.8 2 5 of 2 mercaptoethanol and 0.1 Bromophenol blue NuSep . Approximately 12.5 g of protein extracts were loaded onto and separated by 8 SDS polyacrylamide gels LongLife Gels NuSep . Proteins were then transferred to PolyScreen PVDF hybridization membranes PerkinElmer . Membranes were then incubated in blocking solution 5 skim milk in TTBS overnight in a 4 C. refrigerator. The TTBS solution consisted of TBS 20 mM Tris 137 mM NaCl at pH 7.6 with 0.1 Tween20 and was always freshly prepared. For the detection of protein expression membranes were probed with either goat anti collagen 2 antibodies Santa Cruz Calif. USA rabbit anti collagen 1 antibodies Research Diagnostic INC NJ USA rabbit anti Sox 9 antibodies Santa Cruz Calif. USA as primary antibody with 15 l of antibody resuspended in 3 ml of 1 BSA in TTBS for each membrane placed at room temperature for an hour in a hybridization oven rotating at 7 rpm. The membrane was then washed three times in TTBS for 10 minutes each and labeled with an anti goat or anti rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody 1.5 l of antibody in 3 ml of 1 BSA TTBS Chemicon Temecula Calif. for an hour at room temperature within a hybridization oven rotating at 7 rpm. Three consecutive 15 minute washes in TTBS was then performed followed by another two 10 minute washes in TBS. The complexes were then detected by the Super Signal Chemilumnescent Substrate system Pierce as per manufacturer s instructions.

Following the initial probing of the membrane blot for matrix proteins antibodies bound to the membrane were stripped to permit subsequent detection of actin protein expression for the normalization of protein loading in each lane. The membrane was submerged in 20 ml of stripping buffer Pierce for 20 minutes in a shaking 37 C. incubator at 3.5 rpm. This was followed by a 10 minute wash in TTBS for a total of three washes prior to incubation with the mouse monoclonal anti actin primary antibody Sigma Aldrich 1.5 l of antibody with 10 ml of 1 BSA TTBS for 1 hour at room temperature in a hybridization oven rotating at 7 rpm. The membrane was then washed three times in TTBS at 10 minutes each and labeled with an anti mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody 1 l of antibody added to 4.999 ml of 1 BSA TTBS Chemicon Temecula Calif. for 30 minutes at room temperature within a hybridization oven rotating at 7 rpm. Two consecutive 10 minute washes in TTBS was then performed followed by another two 10 minute washes in TBS. The complexes were then detected by the Super Signal Chemilumnescent Substrate System Pierce as per manufacturer s instructions. Expression levels of collagen 1 collagen 2 or SOX9 were then normalized with respect to actin levels to permit comparison of expression levels between samples.

Western blotting of cultured annulus fibrosus cells with GDF 6 demonstrated an increase in the production of collagen I collagen II and SOX9 proteins by Western blot compared to the level observed in unstimulated cells as shown in . Accordingly these results indicate that treatment of primary annulus fibrosus cells with GDF 6 increases expression of extracellular matrix proteins e.g. collagen 1 and collagen 2 and a transcription factor that enhances expression of proteins involved in extracellular matrix synthesis SOX9 . In this respect GDF 6 enhances production of the most common form of collagen in the annulus fibrosus collagen 1.

As shown in GDF 6 enhances the level of expression of collagen 1 collagen 2 and SOX9 in primary nucleus pulposus cells. Accordingly these results indicate that GDF 6 induces expression of extracellular matrix proteins e.g. collagen 1 and collagen 2 and proteins involved in enhancing expression of extracellular matrix proteins e.g. SOX9 in nucleus pulposus cells. As will be apparent from the foregoing description the extracellular matrix of nucleus pulposus is reduced in a nucleus pulposus of a degenerating or degenerated IVD. Accordingly these results indicate that GDF 6 is capable of inducing expression of proteins that can slow reduce or prevent IVD degeneration and or induce IVD regeneration.

The results described herein above and shown in demonstrate that GDF 6 increases expression of proteins involved in extracellular matrix production which are also markers of intervertebral disc cells and chondrocytes.

As shown in GDF 6 induces expression of chondrogenic genes collagen II Aggrecan and Sox9. These data indicate that GDF 6 is capable of inducing BM MSCs to differentiate into chondrogenic like cells. For example a concentration of 100 ng ml of GDF 6 GDF 6 increases expression of Aggrecan and a concentration of at least 100 ng ml increases expression of Sox9.

BM MSC were cultured in expansion media and harvested at passage 2 and mRNA prepared for analysis of gene expression levels using real time PCR. BMP2 7 and 13 were detected at day 1 3 5 and 7 of culture and expressed relative to the house keeping genes GAPDH and HPRT.

Cultured human BM MSC were harvested from flasks by trypsin digestion and resuspended in DMEM 0.1 FBS before seeding 2 104 cells well in collagen IV Sigma coated transwells Costor 3422 . Cells were allowed to settle incubation 30 minutes then 600 l of media containing 0 100 300 or 500 ng mL rhGDF 6 Peprotech was added to the lower chambers of the transwells. Following overnight 12 16 h incubation transwell membranes were washed cells were fixed and stained and the total number of migrated cells on the bottom face of the membrane was determined.

Human BM MSCs were seeded in culture flasks duplicates at 2000 cells cm2 and treated with 0 100 300 and 500 ng ml of recombinant human GDF 6 for 3 or 6 days. Following treatment cells were trypsinized collected at each time point and counted by trypan blue exclusion method under a hemocytometer. The total cell number was used for comparison between GDF 6 treated and untreated BM MSCs.

Expression of BMPs 2 and 7 and GDF 6 genes were detected in cultured human BM MSC at day 1 3 5 and 7 as shown in . At all time points GDF 6 was expressed at higher levels than the other BMPs peaking at day 5.

Culture of MSC in the presence of human BMP13 at all concentrations tested resulted in greater cell numbers than media alone . Cell numbers did not appear to be greater with increasing dose in the range 100 500 ng mL. Thus BMP13 can stimulate increased growth of mesenchymal progenitor cells.

The presence of GDF 6 in the lower chamber of BM MSC transwell cultures induced the migration of MSC towards the source of the GDF 6 . This indicates that GDF 6 acts as a chemoattractive agent for BM MSC cells. The number of cells migrating towards the GDF 6 appear to follow a dose response with 300 ng mL inducing maximum migration.

These results indicate that GDF 6 is expressed in BM MSC cultures at a higher level than BMP2 or BMP7 perhaps indicating increased importance in progenitor cell function. GDF 6 also appears to stimulate cell growth in BM MSC cultures at 100 ng mL and to act as a chemottractive agent for BM MSC cells. Chemoattraction was dose dependent peaking at 300 ng mL.

The cell function of differentiated MSCs is investigated in vitro by detecting the biosynthesis of proteoglycans using 35S sulfate incorporation assay essentially as described in Collier et al. 48 37 381 1989. Briefly the alginate beads containing differentiated MSCs are incubated with 20 Ci well of S sulfate GE Healthcare at 37 C. for 24 h. Following release from alginate beads the cells are harvested and resuspended in papain digestion buffer containing 2 l of papain suspension per 1 ml of PBS pH 6.2 5 mM L cysteine and 10 mM EDTA at 60 C. for 3 h to release glycosaminoglycans. An aliquot is separated for DNA determination. Newly synthesized sulfated glycosaminoglycans are separated from free SOby a precipitation procedure. Samples are then counted in an automated Scintillation Analyzer and normalized by DNA concentration. The fold change of relative counts represents the change in proteoglycan synthesis.

Results showing that cells incubated in the presence of GDF 6 or an active fragment thereof express increased levels of collagen 2 and aggrecan and Sox9 compared to undifferentiated MSCs indicate that GDF 6 or the active fragment thereof induce MSCs to differentiate into a nucleus pulposus chondrocytic lineage.

Results showing increased production of proteoglycans e.g. increased SOproduction and or increased collagen 2 and or Sox9 protein expression indicate that GDF 6 or the active fragment thereof induce MSCs to differentiate into a nucleus pulposus chondrocytic lineage.

Moreover results indicating similar levels of expression of transcripts in isolated nucleus pulposus cells and in treated cells indicate that GDF 6 or the active fragment thereof induce MSCs to differentiate into a nucleus pulposus chondrocytic lineage.

Sheep are be purchased from the University farm Arthursleigh Australia and transported to a veterinary centre a minimum of 2 weeks prior to first experimental procedure and housed in a paddock. Each sheep is premedicated with 0.3 mg kg diazepam and individually taken to the anesthesia induction area immediately prior to the surgical procedure. The jugular vein is catheterized using a 16 G 3.25 cm catheter after local anesthetic is placed under skin using a syringe and 25 gauge needle. Sheep are anaesthetized with 10 mg kg ketamine given to effect. The sheep are placed in right lateral recumbency and the right caudal quarter of the sheep clipped and aseptically prepared. A straight incision a few fingerbreadths below the costal margin and parallel to lateral border of the erector spinae muscles is made to allow exposure of the lower lumbar vertebrae L2 to L6 . The approach is made retroperitoneally using electrocautery to divide the subcutaneous tissue fascia and thoracolumbar aponeurosis and transversalis fascia in line with the skin incision the peritoneum is protected and reflected anteriorly by blunt dissection. A retractor is placed between rostral and the iliac crest to aid exposure. The vertebral bodies from L3 to L5 are identified and with a Deaver retractor the vessels lying anterior to the spine are protected. Once the appropriate involved vertebra is identified the psoas muscle is elevated bluntly off the lumbar vertebrae and retracted laterally to the level of the transverse process with a Richardson retractor. Bipolar coagulation of vessels around the vertebrae is also performed. The fibrosus annuli of anterolateral discs of L2 to L5 are identified. Annular fibrosus of two non contiguous lumbar discs per animal. The incision of fibrous annulus is made to a 6 mm depth using a 9 B P knife blade. The IVD located between the two punctured IVDs is used as a control. A 27 mm 10 mm titanium screw is implanted into the vertebral body at one level for later identification of levels. One of the punctured levels will is treated with stem cells produced according to Example 18 optionally transfected with a nucleic acid encoding full length GDF 6 or an active domain thereof produced essentially as described in Example 10 and the other punctured disc treated with saline control. In both cases the treatment is injected into the nucleus pulposus of punctured discs. After completion of procedure the wound is closed in layers.

Radiographs lateral only are taken prior to waking of animals. Two weeks after surgery and monthly thereafter radiography are performed on the assigned sheep using 0.3 mg kg diazepam and 0.2 mg kg butorphanol intravenously for sedation. The remaining radiographs and CT scans are performed after euthanasia on the assigned days 3 month 6 months and 18 months . Disc height is also raidographically determined on a monthly basis lateral view only and following euthanasia. IVD height is expressed as a disc height index DHI . The level of degeneration based on the Thompson grade 1 normal 4 severely degenerated is also assessed using MRI.

Following three six or eighteen months sheep are euthanized using an overdose of pentobarbitone administered intravenously. After euthanasia the sheep undergo a post mortem examination and IVDs.

Lumbar vertebral joints are biomechanically tested using an Instron 8874 in 4 modes. Range of motion constraint to motion and hysteresis will be quantified for the treated joints and compared to controls. Annular tissue samples from treated joint levels and controls are be isolated and tested in tension to determine ultimate strength and tensile modulus.

Disc tissue collected post mortem is subject to histological analysis to assess the level of disc degeneration. Spines are removed surgically and muscle tissue removed before being submerged in working formalin solution 10 in 0.1M Phosphate buffer . Spines are labeled according to head tail orientation. After initial fixation spines are segmented into individual discs labeled 2 1 1 2 in relation to the position of the titanium screw inserted at surgery and thus identifiable in respect of the treatment administered. Discs are then submerged in de calcifying solution overnight with agitation to soften bone tissue. Individual discs are sectioned into pieces of tissue no more than 5 mm thick placed in cassettes for paraffin embedding and thin sectioning. Tissues are then stained with haematoxylin eosin for tissue architecture analysis.
