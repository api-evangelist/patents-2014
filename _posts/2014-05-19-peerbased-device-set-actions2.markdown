title: Peer-based device set actions
abstract: A device set may interoperate to perform an action, such as providing a message to a user or storing photos taken by a user. Performing the action on all available devices may cause redundancy (e.g., presenting the same message to the user on each device), and depending on user selection (e.g., the user requesting to play music and specifically designating a device) may become onerous. A centralized, server-driven selection of the device to perform the action may be problematic if the server is inaccessible and/or inaccurate if not currently informed of the current state of each device. In accordance with the techniques presented herein, a requesting device broadcasts an action invitation to the device set. Each device provides a suitability report indicating its suitability to perform the action. The requesting device identifies one or more suitable devices, and sends an action request to identified devices to perform the action.

Within the field of computing many scenarios involve a device set operated by a user and a request for at least one device of the device set to perform an action. As a first example a user may utilize a variety of portable and wearable devices such as a mobile phone a tablet and a head mounted display and a messaging service may request the device set to present to the user a message or an invitation to engage in a communication session with another user such as an incoming voice call. As a second example a user may request a presentation of media such as the playing of an audio recording on one or more of the devices. As a third example a user may generate some data on a device such as capturing a photo with a camera which may be stored on one or more of the devices of the device set.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

In various computing scenarios including those provided above the performance of the action by the devices of the device set may be achieved in a variety of ways. As a first such example an incoming message or communication session invitation for the user may be transmitted to all of the devices and all devices receiving the message may present it to the user e.g. a pop up notification on each device . However this technique may cause a redundant presentation to the user on a variety of devices which may present an irritation to the user. Additionally in some scenarios the presentation of a message may be inappropriate e.g. an audio capable device presenting an audio alert when the user is present at a meeting inapplicable e.g. a message referring to a picture presented by a device that is incapable of displaying pictures such as an earpiece and or dangerous e.g. a mobile phone presenting a message to a user who is operating a vehicle .

As a second such example the user may interact with various devices and may indicate a particular device on which respective actions are to be performed. For example a user may request not only the presentation of media such as music but may select a desired device to render the media such as submitting a request to play music specifically through a headset or specifically through the speaker of a tablet device. However reliance on explicit user selection of the device s on which the action is to be performed may become onerous for the user particularly where such actions are frequent.

As a third such example in a centralized message distribution model a server that is informed of the status of each device may evaluate the options for performing an action may select a particular device from the device set and may command the device to perform the action. However such centralization depends on the server having up to date information about the status of every device on which the action may be performed. Such notification may be inefficient e.g. providing frequent status updates from devices to the server even where no such actions are requested to be performed and or inaccurate e.g. device status may change more rapidly than the server may be notified and a device may be selected by the server based on outdated information . Moreover if the server is inaccessible e.g. when the server is typically accessed over the internet but is temporarily inaccessible to a personal area devices the device set becomes unable to perform any such actions.

Presented herein are techniques for enabling the devices of a device set to perform an action. In accordance with such techniques upon receiving from a requesting device an action invitation broadcast to the device set and specifying an action to be performed send to the requesting device a suitability report indicating a suitability of the first device for performing the action and upon receiving from the requesting device and responsive to the suitability report an action request to perform the action perform the action on behalf of the requesting device. The techniques may further include upon receiving from a local application a request to perform a second action broadcasting to the device set an action invitation specifying the second action and upon receiving from at least one responding device of the device set a suitability report indicating the suitability of the responding device to perform the second action evaluating the respective suitability reports of the respective responding devices to identify a selected device and sending to the selected device a second action request to perform the action on behalf of the first device. In this manner the devices of the device set may interoperate to achieve the performance of the action according to the techniques presented herein.

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects advantages and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident however that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.

In a first exemplary scenario each of the devices of the device set receives the message and attempts to present the message to the user . For example a text message may be delivered via the simple message service to each device and each device may present the message to the user . While this broadcasting of the message from multiple devices may ensure the receipt of the message by the user the redundant presentation of the message by a multitude of devices may irritate the user . For example the user may frequently utilize the mobile phone and the workstation and may receive the message promptly from both devices but may only occasionally use the tablet form factor device and may receive a third copy of the message via the tablet device several days later. The irritation of the redundant presentation may increase proportionally with the number of devices in the device set . As an example a set of telephones may be provided within a building and an incoming call causes all of the telephones to ring even if the call is intended for a user who is located near a particular telephone and even if the user is not even present in the building.

In a second exemplary scenario a server may continuously or periodically track the status of the devices of the device set . Upon receiving a message to be sent to the user the server may perform a selection of a particular device based on the status of each device and may send the message to the selected device for presentation to the user . While this second exemplary scenario may reduce the redundant presentation of the message to the user this architecture may exhibit significant inefficiency. As a first example the devices may have to keep the server frequently informed of the status even if messages are infrequent because the server is unable to perform a selection without comparatively current information about the status of each device . However such informing of the server may reduce the available power of each device . Conversely if the devices do not keep the server currently informed of the status of each device then the server may perform an undesirable selection of a device upon receiving the message e.g. the server may make a selection in view of out of date information and may miss opportunities to have the message presented by a device that is currently in communication with the user .

Other exemplary scenarios may be utilized to enable the device set to perform the action. For example the user may explicitly specify which device is to be used to perform a particular type of action. For example the user may explicitly request the execution of an application on a particular device when intending to receive particular types of messages on the device such as email messages. The device set may accordingly present the messages to the user only through the selected device . However a dependency on explicit user selection may rapidly become onerous e.g. if the device set frequently performs actions and or if the user becomes tired of frequently designating devices for particular actions . Additionally in some scenarios the user may forget to select a particular device e.g. forgetting to place a mobile phone in an airplane or privacy mode thus causing the mobile phone to rung while the user is in an inappropriate situation such as attending a meeting . Some scenarios may also be incompatible with the user selection e.g. the user may designate that an audio only earpiece devices is the primary interface for the user but the earpiece device may be unable to render a particular image for the user through a visual multimedia based message e.g. an MMS text message . Additionally in some scenarios it may be dangerous to present the message to the user e.g. enticing the user to view a text message presented on a display of a device while the user is operating a vehicle. These and other disadvantages may arise in some techniques for presenting messages to the user through a device set .

In this exemplary scenario at a first time a first device of the device set such as a mobile phone initiates a request to have the device set perform an action . The request to perform the action may be initiated by the requesting device and or may be received by the requesting device from an outside source e.g. an incoming call . The requesting device generates an action invitation specifying the action and broadcasts the action invitation to the other devices of the device set . For example the other devices of the device set may be accessible over a network such as a WiFi network a wired local area network LAN a cellular communication network a wide area network WAN such as the internet and or a personal area network PAN such as a Bluetooth device mesh. Alternatively the other devices may be accessible to the requesting device over a broadcast based medium such as a radio broadcast that is receivable by any device with a receiver or a light transmission such as light in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that encodes information specifying the action invitation and the action .

At a second time each device of the device set that has received the action invitation may evaluate its suitability for performing the action . For example a device may identify the parameters of the action and may compare such parameters with the resources and capabilities of the device e.g. computational capacity volatile and or nonvolatile memory network bandwidth and input output capabilities the appropriateness of the device for performing the requested action and the accessibility of the user to the device . The respective other device responds to the action invitation by providing to the requesting device a sustainability report that indicates the suitability of the responding device for performing the action . For example in handling an incoming call a workstation device may indicate low suitability e.g. reflecting a lower quality microphone and speakers while a portable device such as a tablet may indicate high suitability e.g. reflecting a microphone and speakers that are well suited for voice communication sessions. The suitability reports may be returned to the requesting device using the same communication medium as used to provide the action invitation to the devices e.g. using the same network and or using a different communication medium.

At a third time the requesting device may identify and select a responding device having the highest suitability report of the responding devices in the device set . The requesting device may therefore transmit to the selected device an action request that requests the selected device to perform the action . The action request may be transmitted over the same network as the earlier communication or may be transmitted over a different communication medium. Upon receiving the action request the selected device performs the action on behalf of the requesting device e.g. accepting an incoming call and attempting to initiate a communication session between a caller and the user . In this manner the devices of the device set interoperate to achieve the performance of the action by an appropriate device in accordance with the techniques presented herein while reducing or avoiding the various costs and or disadvantages of other such techniques including those provided in the exemplary scenario of .

The techniques presented herein may provide a variety of technical advantages with respect to other techniques for enabling a device set to perform an action .

As a first such example a device set configured as provided herein may reduce the redundant execution for the action by a plurality of devices . For example rather than presenting the same message to the user on a variety of devices and or rather than causing every device to notify the user of a particular event e.g. an incoming call causing every telephone in a building to ring the presented techniques enable a contextually sensitive performance of the action . Such performance may reduce the inefficiency and potential irritation of redundantly performed actions .

As a second such example a device set configured as provided herein may reduce or avoid the involvement of a user in specifying which device is to perform which action . The capability of performing such selection automatically may provide a comparatively low maintenance and automated device selection.

As a third such example a device set configured as provided herein may reduce reliance on a centralized server which may become inaccessible e.g. due to a network outage or a failure of the server . The avoidance of a server may reduce the costs such as subscription fees and equipment involved in server mediated scenarios. Additionally the resolution of the selection among the devices of a user may promote the privacy of the user by retaining information about the performance of various actions within the device set e.g. within the personal area network of the user rather than transmitting such information to an outside server.

As a fourth such example a device set configured as provided herein may provide a more accurate and nuanced selection of devices to perform respective actions . Rather than configuring the devices to inform a server of the respective state of such devices the techniques presented herein enable each device to determine its current suitability for performing the action based on any criteria that the device is configured to evaluate such as the hardware and or software capabilities of the device the current task load of the device the physical location of the device and or the proximity of the device to the user and or other devices and the current and predicted future circumstances of the device . That is the determination of the suitability of each device for performing the action is delegated to the respective devices and may be handled by the respective devices based on any criteria that the device is configured to evaluate. Moreover the state of the device may change rapidly and allocating the determination of suitability for a particular action to the respective devices enables determinations based on more up to date information than is achievable by information distributed to a server .

As a fifth such example in some embodiments of the presented techniques the peer based architecture of the device set enables any device to request the performance of an action and any other device to respond with a high suitability report as an offer to perform the activity . This architecture therefore promotes the robustness and extensibility of the device set as many numbers and types of devices may join or leave the device set without diminishing the capability of the device set to perform the requested actions . These and other technical effects may be achievable through the configuration of a device set in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

The exemplary method begins at and involves executing the instructions on the processor of the first device . Specifically the instructions cause the first device to upon receiving from a requesting device an action invitation broadcast to the device set and specifying an action to be performed send to the requesting device a suitability report indicating a suitability of the first device for performing the action . The instructions also cause the first device to upon receiving from the requesting device and responsive to the suitability report an action request to perform the action perform the action on behalf of the requesting device . Having achieved the performance of the action on behalf of the requesting device the exemplary method achieves the implementation of the techniques presented herein on the first device and so ends at .

The exemplary system includes an action performer that upon receiving a broadcast within the device set indicating an action to be performed e.g. an action invitation broadcast by a requesting device returns a suitability report indicating a suitability of the first device for performing the action and upon receiving responsive to the suitability report an action request for the first device to perform the action performs the action on behalf of the requesting device . The exemplary system also includes an action requester that upon receiving from a local application executing on the processor of the first device a second request to perform a second action broadcasts the second request to the device set e.g. as an action invitation specifying the action requested by the local application and upon receiving from at least two responding devices of the device set a suitability report respectively indicating the suitability of the responding device for performing the second action identifies a selected device among the at least two responding devices and requests the selected device to perform the second action . In this manner the exemplary system causes the device first to participate in the performance of the actions by the device set in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

Still another embodiment involves a computer readable medium comprising processor executable instructions configured to apply the techniques presented herein. Such computer readable media may include e.g. computer readable storage devices involving a tangible device such as a memory semiconductor e.g. a semiconductor utilizing static random access memory SRAM dynamic random access memory DRAM and or synchronous dynamic random access memory SDRAM technologies a platter of a hard disk drive a flash memory device or a magnetic or optical disc such as a CD R DVD R or floppy disc encoding a set of computer readable instructions that when executed by a processor of a device cause the device to implement the techniques presented herein. Such computer readable media may also include as a class of technologies that exclude computer readable storage devices various types of communications media such as a signal that may be propagated through various physical phenomena e.g. an electromagnetic signal a sound wave signal or an optical signal and in various wired scenarios e.g. via an Ethernet or fiber optic cable and or wireless scenarios e.g. a wireless local area network WLAN such as WiFi a personal area network PAN such as Bluetooth or a cellular or radio network and which encodes a set of computer readable instructions that when executed by a processor of a device cause the device to implement the techniques presented herein.

An exemplary computer readable medium that may be devised in these ways is illustrated in wherein the implementation comprises a computer readable memory device e.g. a CD R DVD R or a platter of a hard disk drive on which is encoded computer readable data . This computer readable data in turn comprises a set of computer instructions that when executed on a processor of a computing device cause the computing device to operate according to the principles set forth herein. In a first such embodiment the processor executable instructions may be configured to perform a method of enabling a first device to perform an action on behalf of a device set such as the exemplary method of . In a second such embodiment the processor executable instructions may be configured to implement a system configured to cause a first device to participate in the performance of actions by a device set such as the exemplary system of . Some embodiments of this computer readable medium may comprise a computer readable storage device e.g. a hard disk drive an optical disc or a flash memory device that is configured to store processor executable instructions configured in this manner. Many such computer readable media may be devised by those of ordinary skill in the art that are configured to operate in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

The techniques discussed herein may be devised with variations in many aspects and some variations may present additional advantages and or reduce disadvantages with respect to other variations of these and other techniques. Moreover some variations may be implemented in combination and some combinations may feature additional advantages and or reduced disadvantages through synergistic cooperation. The variations may be incorporated in various embodiments e.g. the exemplary method of the exemplary system of and the exemplary memory device of to confer individual and or synergistic advantages upon such embodiments.

A first aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the scenarios wherein such techniques may be utilized.

As a first variation of this first aspect the techniques presented herein may be utilized to achieve the configuration of a variety of devices such as workstations laptops tablets phones and other communication devices headsets earpieces eyewear wristwatches portable gaming devices portable media players such as televisions and appliances.

As a second variation of this first aspect the techniques presented herein may be utilized with a variety of device sets such as a set of devices that are owned by a particular user or institution a set of devices that are deployed to a particular area and or a set of devices that occupy a particular role such as a set of file servers. Moreover the devices of the device set may communicate in a variety of ways including a personal area network PAN such as Bluetooth a wired and or wireless local area network LAN such as WiFi or a cellular network or a wide area network WAN such as the internet or a virtual private network VPN deployed thereupon.

As a third variation of this first aspect the techniques presented herein may be utilized to achieve the performance of a variety of actions . As a first such example the actions may comprise the receipt generation evaluation storage and or transmission of various forms of data. As a second such example the actions may involve a particular user such as a communication session intended to include the user or a physical activity that the user wishes to perform with the assistance of a device . As a third such example the actions may include a particular place or object such as the monitoring of a weather condition in a particular area. As a fourth such example the actions may include a particular circumstance or context that may apply to one or more devices such as devices that are currently carried by the user . Moreover the action may be initiated by the requesting device on behalf of a local application executing on the requesting device and or on behalf of a remote device outside of the device set such as a server. Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many such scenarios in which the techniques presented herein may be utilized.

A second aspect that may vary among embodiments of the techniques presented herein involves the manner in which a device of the device set determines and reports its suitability for performing a requested action .

As a first variation of this second aspect a first device may determine its suitability for performing an action according to an accessibility of the user by the first device . As a first such example the accessibility may comprise the proximity of the user e.g. the action may comprise an audio alert to be presented to the user and the suitability may comprise a detection that the user is within audible range of the first device . As a second such example the action may comprise capturing an image of the user and the suitability may comprise a visibility of the user to a camera of the first device . As a third such example the action may utilize the attention of the user such as the ability of the user to answer a particular question and the suitability may be determined according to whether the user is currently paying attention to the first device and or whether the user is able to pay attention to the first device . The distinctiveness of these concepts may be illustrated e.g. according to a collection of three devices that are present in a vehicle of the user a first device that is positioned in a compartment of the vehicle and thus is not proximate to the user a second device that is present near the user but that the user is unable to attend to safely such as a visual device that the user is unable to utilize while operating the vehicle and a third device that is both present near the user and capable of utilizing the attention of the user such as an audio device that may more safely communicate with the user .

As a second variation of this second aspect a first device may determine its suitability for performing an action according to a device capability of the first device to perform the action . As a first such example the action may comprise capturing an image of the user and the suitability of the first device may be determined in view of whether or not the first device has a suitable camera. As a second such example the action may comprise presenting an audio message to the user through an output device and the first device may identify itself as having high suitability if it comprises an audio output device and a lower but still positive suitability if it comprises an audio transcribing component and a visual output device in order to present the audio message as a text message.

As a third variation of this second aspect a first device may determine its suitability for performing an action according to the resources availability of the first device such as its available processing power storage capacity or network bandwidth. As a particular example the resource availability may comprise a power capacity of the first device e.g. whether the first device is operating on an unlimited power source such as a wall outlet a limited but plentiful power source such as a fully charged battery or a limited and scant power source such as a nearly depleted battery.

As a fourth variation of this second aspect a first device may determine its suitability for performing an action according to a user preference specified by a user . For example the action comprises an audio message to be presented to the user and even if the first device comprises a speaker that is capable of presenting the audio message to the user however the user may indicate his or her preference that the first device is not to present audio messages. Accordingly the first device may identify itself as unsuitable for the action . Conversely the user may specify that a particular device is to perform all actions of a particular type such as presenting text messages to the user even if other devices might have been automatically determined as having higher suitability.

As a fifth variation of this second aspect some actions may involve an interoperation of two or more devices of the device set . For example a first device may receive a request from a user to record video and may comprise a videocamera that is capable of capturing the video but may not have adequate storage. The first device may request a second device to participate in the recording of the video by storing a video stream captured by the first device . When a second device indicates a high suitability for storing the video such as plentiful storage capacity the first device and the second device may cooperatively perform the action e.g. the first device may capture the stream and transmit it to the second device which receives the stream and stores the video. Alternatively if the first device that receives the request from the user also does not include a camera it may request the devices of the device set to indicate a suitability for capturing video and when a third device reports a high suitability for capturing video the second device and the third device may cooperatively achieve the recording of the video.

As a sixth variation of the techniques presented herein a device of the device set may determine its suitability for performing an action in view of a future suitability of the first device at a future time. As a first such example a first device may determine that it currently has a limited but plentiful power reserves but may determine that the user intends to take the device on a train trip when the user may expect to use the first device and may depend upon its plentiful power supply at that time. Accordingly the first device may report a low suitability for performing an action at a present time even if its power source is plentiful due to the anticipated future prioritization of power capacity at a future time. As a second such example a first device may determine that it is currently unsuitable for performing an action but may anticipate that a future time presents a high suitability for performing the action e.g. the device may be requested to present a message to a user who is currently inaccessible to the device but who is anticipated to be in the proximity of the device in the near future. The device may therefore report a high suitability for performing the action either presently or as an indication that the current suitability is low but an anticipated future suitability is high which may enable a selection of the device unless another device that is currently in the presence of the user presents a currently high suitability . Many such considerations including a combination thereof may be utilized to determine and report the suitability of the devices for performing an action on behalf of the device set in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

A third aspect that may vary among embodiments of the techniques presented herein involves the manner of performing the action in view of the suitability reports of the respective devices of the device set .

As a first variation of this third aspect the requesting device may identify the device reporting the highest suitability for the action among the responding devices of the device set and may send an action request asking the selected device to perform the action . Alternatively the requesting device may select among the responding devices of the device set a subset of the devices of the device set based on their reported suitabilities and may send action requests to each selected device of the selected device subset. As a further example where the action is associated with an action priority the requesting device may identify among the responding devices a responding device subset having a subset size that is proportional to the action priority of the action e.g. a large subset of devices for high priority actions in order to ensure that the action is performed to completion.

As a second variation of this third aspect the selected device may notify the requesting device upon achieving a completion of the action . Alternatively or additionally upon achieving a failure to achieve a completion of the action at a first time the selected device may notify the requesting device of the failure and or may retry the action at a second time on behalf of the requesting device . Upon receiving the notification of failure and or upon failing to receive a report of a completion of the action within a particular time frame which may arise if the selected device is disabled or experiences a loss of power or connectivity the requesting device may therefore select a second device of the device set to perform the action . Similarly if the requesting device is requesting a performance of the action by the device set on behalf of a local application and or a remote device outside of the device set the requesting device may transmit notifications of a completion and or a failure of the performance of the action by the selected device .
