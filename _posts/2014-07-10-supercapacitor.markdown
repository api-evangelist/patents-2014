The invention described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

The present invention relates generally to capacitors and more particularly to electrochemical capacitors also known as supercapacitors.

Capacitors have long been known and used in electronic circuitry for the storage of electrical energy. In its simplest form the capacitor includes a pair of electrically conductive plates typically constructed of metal separated by air or a dielectric material. The size or area of the conductive plates as well as the permittivity and thickness of the dielectric material between the plates determines the magnitude of the capacitance of the capacitor.

Some previously known capacitors include both electrostatic as well as electrolytic capacitors. Such capacitors have a relatively low capacitance but are able to operate at voltages ranging from a few volts to thousands of volts. Furthermore such capacitors are capable of operating at high frequencies.

More recently supercapacitors have been developed which do not have a conventional dielectric. Instead supercapacitor electrodes include a conductive plate known as a current collector which is coated with a carbon derivative material such as activated carbon or graphene. These electrodes are typically separated from each other by an intervening separator made from a porous insulating material that prevents the electrical shorting of the electrodes but allows electrolyte ions to move between the electrodes. In use when subjected to a voltage ion flow between the electrodes results in energy storage within the electrodes through the charge separation at the electrode surface with positive charges in one electrode attracting negative ions to that electrode s surface and with negative charges in the other electrode attracting positive ions to that electrode s surface.

A primary advantage of supercapacitors is that they are able to exhibit capacitances up to 10 000 times that of an electrolytic capacitor. Furthermore such supercapacitors exhibit the greatest energy density of all currently known capacitors.

During both charging and discharging of the prior art supercapacitor electrolytic ions must travel between particles or flakes of the carbonaceous material in order to access the full surface area of the electrodes so as to store as much energy as the device can hold. Since the electrolytic ions cannot travel directly through the particles or flakes of carbonaceous material the ions must travel around them. One exemplary long and tortuous path of an ion traveling through the particles or flakes of carbonaceous material is shown at and effectively increases the ionic impedance of the electrode.

Supercapacitors do however suffer from some disadvantages due in part to the extended path necessary for the ions to travel during both charge and discharge. First the previously known supercapacitors were limited to operate at low frequencies typically less than 1 Hertz. Such low frequencies of course limit their applications in electrical circuits.

A still further disadvantage of these previously known supercapacitors is that the rate of charging as well as discharging is relatively slow. This relatively slow charging and discharging of the supercapacitor is due primarily to the ionic impedance present in the carbon based electrodes used for the supercapacitor.

The present invention provides a supercapacitor or electrochemical capacitor with reduced ionic impedance of the electrodes which greatly increases the frequency of operation as compared with the previously known supercapacitors. This means that supercapacitors according to embodiments of the present invention enjoy faster discharge and charging time compared with other previously known supercapacitors.

In brief the supercapacitor comprises spaced apart electrodes which are separated from each other by a separator. The separator is made of an electrical insulating material such as a porous polymer.

Each of the electrodes is formed of carbonaceous material and capable of being impregnated with a liquid electrolyte. Metal current collectors are provided on the sides of the electrodes opposite from the separator. The electrical energy storage is achieved by charge separation at the electrode carbonaceous material surfaces.

Unlike the previously known supercapacitors according to embodiments of the present invention holes are formed through the electrodes. The holes extend generally from the metal current collector and towards the separator and may be aligned preferably in a grid pattern. These holes within the electrodes facilitate the rapid travel of electrolyte ions through the electrode thickness. Thus since the electrolyte ions travel throughout the electrodes during charging and discharging more rapid charging and discharging of the supercapacitor is achieved.

Different methods may be used to form the holes through the electrodes. In one method carbonaceous material of the electrode is deposited on a metal mesh current collector which can be done using various methods such as drop casting doctor blading air brushing filtration or similar. The metal mesh current collector has a very small pitch such as 2000 lines per inch and a low transmission percentage such as 5 10 . The latter is important as it prevents the electrode etching methods from removing too much of the carbonaceous material. Using the mesh current collector as a mask the holes are milled through the carbonaceous material in a grid pattern using various methods such as ion milling or oxygen reactive ion etching that produce an anisotropic etch of the carbonaceous material. Alternatively the metal mesh current collector could be used to mask a photochemical or photoelectrochemical etch of the carbon. Still another approach would be to use laser drilling of the holes in the layer of carbonaceous material. This method could be used to pattern the hole arrays in the electrodes without the need for a mesh current collector to mask the etch process. And in yet other embodiments a photolithographic approach with associated anisotropic etching could also be performed without the need for the mesh rather the holes can be patterned using a resist material.

The provision of the holes through the electrodes effectively reduces the otherwise tortuous path of ions traveling through the electrode since the holes provide a direct path through the carbonaceous material to access the full surface area of the electrode. This effectively reduces both charging and discharging time of the capacitor.

Or to put it another way the supercapacitors according to embodiments of the present invention is able to operate at higher frequencies than the previously known supercapacitors.

In some embodiments of the invention nanotubes and or nanoparticles may be further intermixed with the carbonaceous material. The nanotubes or nanoparticles produce additional space between particles or flakes of the carbonaceous material making ionic transport within the electrode plane easier while the etched holes in the electrodes provide easier ionic transport perpendicular to the electrode plane. This combination in turn results in increased frequency of operation as well as increased discharge and charging speed for the supercapacitor by achieving reduced ionic impedance.

With reference first to a first embodiment of a supercapacitor or electrochemical capacitor according to the present invention is shown. Like the previously known supercapacitors of the supercapacitor generally includes a pair of spaced apart metal current collectors and which are spaced apart by a few microns to a few hundred microns and are parallel to each other. Each current collector and is connected to its associated electrical circuit not shown by a lead .

A separator constructed of an electrical insulating material such as a porous polymer is positioned in between the metal current collectors and and thus separates a pair of electrodes from each other. Any conventional material may be used for the separator .

The electrodes are porous electric conductive electrodes which are impregnated with liquid electrolyte not shown which provides a source of electrolytic ions. When bias voltage is applied between the two electrodes positive charge at an exposed surface of one electrode attracts negative ions from the electrolyte and negative charge at an exposed surface of the other electrode attracts the positive ions from the electrolyte. Carbonaceous material can be deposited or otherwise provided on the current collectors and to form porous material electrodes .

The carbonaceous material can include particles or flakes of a carbon based material which can sufficiently transfer an electric charge and or is sufficiently porous for enabling electrolytic ions to flow in the electrodes thus functioning as a supercapacitor. Such carbonaceous material may include for example graphene carbon nanotubes CNT porous carbon activated carbon AC or any combination thereof. For graphene in particular it may be applied as particles or flakes on the order of about 1 micron in diameter. The graphene particles or flakes will generally arrange parallel to the current collectors and bind together by van der Wales forces so as to form sheets in a stack. While two electrodes are illustrated in the figures it should be appreciated that additional electrodes can be stacked in a similar manner in keeping with the scope of the invention with a separator provided between adjacent electrodes .

In some embodiments the electrodes may further include a binder conductivity enhancing material such as carbon black and or pseudo capacitive materials such as conductive polymers or oxides of transition metals mixed with the carbonaceous material .

The carbonaceous material thus provide the necessary storage surface area for the ions when the capacitor is charged. Most conventional methods may be used to deposit the carbonaceous material onto the current collectors and .

Unlike the previously known supercapacitors however holes each having a diameter in the range of nanometers to microns are formed through the electrodes . These holes provide a pathway for travel of the electrolytic ions during charging and discharging of the capacitor . For example an exemplary ion travel path is illustrated in in which ions travel not around each of the many layers of particles and flakes of the carbonaceous material in the electrodes but rather directly through the holes . As such since ions travel a much less tortuous path to go through the electrode thickness as compared to the prior art path . This effectively reduces the ionic impedance of the carbonaceous material in the electrodes to that required for traveling a short distance laterally in the electrode which enables faster charging and discharging of the capacitor which is also seen as an increased operational frequency.

Although only two holes are illustrated through the electrodes in it will be appreciated that typically there will be many holes formed through the electrodes preferably in an orthogonal grid pattern. For example in one embodiment a hole is provided approximately every 9 13 microns in a grid pattern so that the holes constitute about 8 of the overall area of one side of the electrode . This configuration of holes is not to be construed as limiting and it should be appreciated that other hole patterns and configurations are contemplated.

Furthermore the faster travel of the electrolytic ions through the carbonaceous material of the electrodes due to the holes enables higher frequency of operation for the supercapacitor than with the previously known supercapacitors. The inventor has demonstrated a 100 fold increase in speed e.g. 0.1 Hz to about 10 Hz in experiments with the inclusion of holes in the supercapacitor . This is a significant improvement in the operating range compared to conventional supercapacitors having which operate typically less than 1 Hz.

With reference now to one method of creating the holes through the carbonaceous material of the electrodes is illustrated. In particles or flakes of carbonaceous material are deposited on a metal mesh using one of many conventional methods such as by filtration or air brushing. A layer of filter paper or other appropriate barrier covers the opposite side of the mesh to keep too much carbonaceous material from passing through the mesh and being lost.

With reference now to after the carbonaceous material has been deposited on the mesh the filter paper is removed. The mesh is then subjected to an anisotropic etch such as oxygen reactive ion etching or argon ion milling indicated by incident etching particles such as oxygen ions which etches mills or abrades the holes in the carbonaceous material as shown in .

With reference now to an alternative method for forming the holes through the electrodes is shown. The carbonaceous material forming an electrode is first deposited on the metal current collector in any conventional fashion such as filtration or air brushing. The metal collector is then positioned beneath a laser so that the electrode faces the laser . The laser is then activated under control of a control circuit to drill holes through the electrode by a laser beam . The control circuit controls the positioning of the beam from the laser either directly or through a lens system or the position of the electrode to vary the position of the laser beam on the electrode and preferably create the same grid pattern as with the ion milling depicted in .

In other embodiments a photolithographic approach with associated anisotropic etching could also be performed without the need for the mesh rather the holes can be patterned in the electrodes using a resist material.

With reference now to another embodiment of a supercapacitor is shown. Unlike the previously described embodiment of the present invention in the supercapacitor of a plurality of nanotubes or nanoparticles and or nanowires having a diameter of nanometers to microns are intermixed with the carbonaceous material forming the electrodes . The nanotubes may extend generally in a direction parallel to the metal current collector and the separator . These nanotubes or nanoparticles prop the carbonaceous material apart providing wider passageways or pores for the electrolytic ions to travel laterally away from or to the etched holes that provide easy ion transport in the direction perpendicular to the current collector as shown by an exemplary path which is shorter than the more tortuous path of the prior art. As previously discussed this lowers the ionic impedance and perhaps the electronic impedance of the electrode and results in reduced charging and discharging time for the supercapacitor as well as increased operating frequency for the supercapacitor.

From the foregoing it can be seen that the present invention provides a supercapacitor which enjoys improved charge and discharge times as compared to the other previously known supercapacitors by reducing the ionic impedance of the supercapacitor. Such reduction also results in increased frequency operation for the supercapacitor.

Having described my invention however many modifications thereto will become apparent to those skilled in the art to which it pertains without deviation from the spirit of the invention as defined by the scope of the appended claims.
