title: Systems and methods to authenticate identity for selective access to information relating to property
abstract: Credential and/or location data included in data received by a networked system from a device that communicated the data to the networked system may be processed to determine if the credential data and/or location data validate an identity of a user (e.g., a guest, traveler, patron) and/or a location of the user based on a location of the device when the data is communicated. The data may be review data and the credential and/or location data may be included in review data. The device and/or the networked system may generate a location history database from location data from the device or other system that is periodically logged from multiple locations at different times during an event (e.g., a stay at a vacation rental). Data from the database may be used to determine if a location for a communication is with a threshold of an allowable distance from an allowable location.

The present application relates generally to systems software electronic messaging mobile computing and communication devices commerce and electronic commerce. More specifically systems methods and software to authenticate identity are disclosed.

Travelers and owners may both benefit from goodwill associated with a positive experience the traveler has in regards to a stay at a rental owned by the owner. In some scenarios the stay may be related to a date and or time range that the traveler arrives or checks into a vacation rental and another date and or time that the traveler checks out of the vacation rental for example. In some instances the traveler may wait until some period of time has passed before taking the time to generate a review of the property at which the traveler stayed. In some examples the traveler may have had a positive review of the property e.g. 4 or 5 stars in a five star system where 5 stars is the highest approval rating and 1 star is the lowest approval rating . After the passage of time the travelers recollection of their experience may change and what would have been a positive review may turn into a more negative review e.g. 3 stars or lower .

A less than positive review that may occur due to a travelers change in circumstances after the stay or due to a traveler s lack of accurate recollection about the stay may lead to reviews of the property that do not accurately reflect the actual sentiment the traveler had during the stay. Stays that are accurately reviewed as being positive may benefit both traveler and owner by increasing rental opportunities for the owner and by leaving a favorable impression on the traveler that may result in future stays by the traveler. Moreover some owners may not directly manage some or all of the aspects of the logistics of a stay and may defer some or all tasks to an agent or vacation rental company. Stays that are accurately reviewed as being positive may also benefit the agent vacation rental company by generating good will that may garner new and repeat stays from individuals who read the positive reviews.

Generally in some industries e.g. hospitality or services e.g. restaurants where patrons or guests provide feedback typically in the form of a review ensuring that the review is legitimate that is the review was completed by a guest who actually experienced the subject of the review e.g. a traveler during a vacation stay at a vacation rental is based on an honor system. Accordingly there are likely to be reviews that are fraudulently submitted by a person who did not actually experience the subject of the review. As a result a party having a proprietary interest in receiving authentic reviews e.g. an owner of a vacation rental unit of a proprietor of a restaurant may have their reputation and or good will damaged by fraudulent reviews that may include negative impressions of an experience. Further the party having the proprietary interest may garner an undeserved reputation and or good will due to positive reviews that are fraudulently submitted e.g. reviews submitted by the owner or proprietor . Fraudulent reviews may arise in part due to a lack of adequate validation and authentication mechanisms.

Thus there is a need for devices systems methods and software that facilitate authentication and validation of review of an event.

Various embodiments or examples may be implemented in numerous ways including as a system a process a method an apparatus a user interface or a series of program instructions on a non transitory computer readable medium such as a computer readable storage medium or a computer network where the program instructions are sent over optical electronic or wireless communication links. In general operations of disclosed processes may be performed in an arbitrary order unless otherwise provided in the claims.

A detailed description of one or more examples is provided below along with accompanying figures. The detailed description is provided in connection with such examples but is not limited to any particular example. The scope is limited only by the claims and numerous alternatives modifications and equivalents are encompassed. Numerous specific details are set forth in the following description in order to provide a thorough understanding. These details are provided for the purpose of example and the described techniques may be practiced according to the claims without some or all of these specific details. For clarity technical material that is known in the technical fields related to the examples has not been described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the description.

Attention is now directed to where one example of a block diagram of a system for authentication of credentials and or location is depicted. In a guest e.g. a traveler and optionally an associate guest guest hereinafter e.g. another person traveling with guest may be experiencing an event at a location such as a stay at a vacation rental property for example. There may be more than one guest and there may be one or more other individuals associated with guest such as the guest e.g. spouse friends domestic partner relatives children business associates etc. as denoted by . Guest and or guest may be mobile and may move or otherwise travel to from one or more other events denoted by while at the location such as visits to bars restaurants entertainment venues businesses parks sporting events local attractions shopping etc. The location where one or more events may occur e.g. event or other events may include but are not limited to a city a town a ship a resort a park a festival a hotel a motel etc. The location may cover a small area e.g. 100 meters or less or a large area 100 miles or less for example.

Guest may have a client device e.g. a smartphone tablet pad laptop PDA gaming device etc. that may be in communication with other systems and or resources such as a wireless and or a wired communications link an external resource e.g. Internet Cloud etc. a networked system a wireless access point a cellular communications network just to name a few. There may be more than one client device as denoted by for example. Guest may have a client device . Guest and or guest may have additional client devices not shown such as a tablet or pad for example. There may be more or fewer wireless access points and or cellular communications network than depicted in . Data communications between the client devices e.g. and the networked system may be direct e.g. via and or or may be routed through one or more other portal computing devices such as wireless access points and or cellular communications network for example.

Wireless communications may include but is not limited to WiFi WiMAX Bluetooth near filed communications NFC and cellular e.g. 2G 3G 4G for example. Wired communications may include but is not limited to local area network LAN universal serial bus USB FireWire and Lightning for example. External resource may include and or have access to computing resources and data storage resources and there may be more or fewer computing resources and data storage resources than depicted as denoted by . Networked system may also include and or have access to networked computing and data storage resources not shown .

As one non limiting example of an event guest may be a traveler who has booked a reservation for a stay at a vacation rental property in a location e.g. Stowe Vt. . The stay may include typical beginning dates and or times and ending dates and or times such as a check in time and date and a check out time and date for example. An owner of the vacation rental property may desire positive reviews from the guest and the guest may desire a positive stay experience. A positive stay experience may be evidenced by a positive review drafted by the guest using client device and its associated systems e.g. keyboard display camera microphone APP etc. to draft the review. System may be operative to allow the guest to provide the review during a time period that may be contemporaneous with the event and or other events . For example if the stay will end at a 12 00 PM check out time on the end date for the stay it may be desirable for the guest to draft the review prior to the check out time because the experience of the stay may be still fresh in the mind of the guest . Accordingly guest may interact with the client device to enter data relevant to the experience the guest had during his her stay for event . Moreover an application APP executing on client device may notify e.g. directly or from a Push message received by device or otherwise remind guest to review the event using one or more systems of client device such as display a vibration engine not shown a microphone speakers not shown and a user interface UI such as keyboard for example. The APP may receive and or generate messages or images displayed on display of client device to remind or otherwise prompt guest to proffer a review of the event .

The review may include media content such as a video and or a still image captured using an image capture system of client device such as a first camera e.g. a rear facing camera or a second camera e.g. a front facing camera . APP may prompt e.g. using audio video text vibration etc. guest to capture an image of a favorite aspect of the event such as a view afforded by the vacation rental. To that end guest may capture an image of an ocean view to be included in the review using first camera . Other types of images such as a self portrait e.g. a selfie of the guest and or guest enjoying the beach or other aspect of the event . For example second camera may be used to capture an image for a selfie with the image including some aspect of the event in the background. APP may activate an icon such as a camera icon as a reminder for the guest to capture media content for the review. A microphone icon may be activated by APP to prompt or otherwise remind the guest to include audio a sound clip e.g. ocean sounds or voice commentary for the review using microphone . Keyboard may be used by guest to enter review text to be included in the review of the event . In some examples the review text being entered on client device is for an amended review of the event . The text entered by guest may be free text as typed or otherwise entered by guest using keyboard voice to text application or other interface device e.g. a Bluetooth keyboard paired with client device . APP may present event rating choices on display such as a five star rating system for the guest to select the star rating that most closely matches his her sentiment regarding the stay such as four to five stars for a favorable experience three stars for an acceptable experience and one to two stars for an unfavorable experience for example. The star rating may be structured text that is selected from icons or other objects presented on display e.g. a touchscreen display such as separate selectable fields for each star rating as depicted by . In other examples structured text may include data created by a drop down menu or check boxes for example.

APP or other component of system may solicit or otherwise notify or prompt guest to proffer the review at a time that is near the end time and or date for the stay. As one example if the check out time for the last day of the stay is 12 00 PM then at time of 10 50 AM e.g. as determined by a clock on client device the guest may be reminded to compose a review of the event e.g. contemporaneous with the stay before the check out time. The reminder may include but is not limited to an electronic message a voice mail a text an email a tweet an instant message vibrating client device information presented on display just to name a few. As described above the reminder may include a request for the guest to capture media content for the review of the event e.g. image . After the guest has completed composing the review including media content if any a send icon or return enter key on keyboard may be activated to communicate data for the review e.g. review data to an external system using one or more communications systems of client device such as one or more wired e.g. USB Lightning LAN and or wireless e.g. WiFi Cellular NFC Bluetooth communications interfaces. In the external system that receives the data transmitted by the client device may be a portal computing device such as a wired and or wireless router a wireless access point a cellular network e.g. one or more cellular towers and or antennae . Non limiting examples of computing devices that may be operative as an external system include but are not limited to wireless access points cellular communications network external resource networked system or some combination of the foregoing.

APP and or other systems in communication with APP via client device may operate to ensure that the review is legitimate and originates from a location that is consistent with a location for the event . APP may access from client device and or external systems e.g. external resource or other location data e.g. GPS geolocation or other locations based services and or credential data associated with client device e.g. access credentials for WiFi and or wired networks and or guest . Location data from portal computing devices e.g. may be used in addition to or instead of location data from client device to determine location. In some examples location data may include information on radio frequency RF signals emitted by client device such as received signal strength indicator RSSI RF signal strength or data included in packets or other data structures included in a RF transmission from client device e.g. MAC Address IP address Bluetooth address etc. . Biometric or other data may be used to verify identity and or credentials of guest such as a biometric sensor e.g. a fingerprint reader or scanner on client device voice print analysis facial image recognition e.g. using camera or others.

Owner or an agent acting on behalf of owner may provide as part of the event access credentials to a WiFi network e.g. a wireless router access point at the vacation rental for guest to access during the stay. Availability of the WiFi network at the event may be displayed by icon on client device . APP may access via client device wireless address information e.g. MAC address Bluetooth ID etc. of the client device and other wireless devices the client device communicates with. Received signal strength indicator RSSI RF signal strength signal ping times or other indicators may be used to verify credentials of client device associated with guest and or proximity of the client device with a portal computing device such as the wireless access point and or cellular network for example. As one example if guest is given access credentials e.g. SSID and wireless network key password for a wireless network provided by the owner for use by guests at the vacation rental unit then access to that network via client device may be used by APP to provide data to an external system to verify that a review data transmitted by client device matches credentials for the event . Transmitted data that includes the review data may also include fields e.g. in one or more packets headers etc. or metadata that includes client device credentials and or access credentials for the wireless network the client device is in communication with e.g. wired and or wireless link between and and or and .

Location tracking capabilities and or systems accessed by or available to client device may be used to determine if review data is originating from a locus within a range of the event e.g. measured in distances of feet meters miles kilometers etc. . For example if the stay for event is in Lake Tahoe Calif. and the location data indicates the review data is being communicated from Las Vegas Nev. then the distance between Lake Tahoe Calif. and Las Vegas Nev. may be outside a locus for a legitimate location for the review data to originate e.g. several hundred miles between the event and the origin of the review data . Further to the example if the review and associated media content are to be composed while the guest is at the event e.g. in situ from a room of the vacation rental then the locus may be 30 meters of less. All events need not be tied to a rental and some events may take place at a bar restaurant arena stadium and the locus may be a larger or smaller distance based on the type of event. As another example if the event occurs in a national park the locus may be 50 miles or less. Actual values for the locus may be application dependent and are not limited to the examples herein. Cellular communications networks located near event may be used to verify location for guest via one or more cellular communications networks e.g. cell towers that are accessed by client device e.g. client device having 2G 3G 4G cellular radios . Wide area and or public WiFi networks such as WiMAX located in vicinity of event and detected and or accessed by client device and or by the WiMAX network may be used to determine location data for a client device associated with guest . Although a locus may be determined by geo location data a locus may also be determined by information and or signals including but not limited to location data from systems internal to the client device location data from systems external to the client device e.g. external resource location data from systems internal to a communications interface e.g. location data from systems external to e.g. external resource a communications interface e.g. radio frequency RF signal strength as measured by a communications interface e.g. in communications with the client device RSSI as measured by a communications interface e.g. signal ping times as measured by a communications interface e.g. just to name a few for example. As one example location data may be determined to be unreliable and or unverifiable if RSSI in RF signals transmitted by the client device are below a threshold value and or if RF signal strength from RF signals transmitted by the client device are below a threshold value. RSSI and or RF signal strength that are below their respective threshold values may be indicative of a distance between the client device and a communications interface e.g. being too great for the client device e.g. and its associated guest to be within a locus of the event.

As another example location data and or credential data associated with owner device if received in data associated with a stay by guest at a vacation rental of owner may be invalidated or ignored because the location data is outside the locus for the event e.g. event is in Lake Tahoe Calif. and the owner lives in Dallas Tex. and the location data from owner device is consistent the review data originating near Dallas Tex. . Similarly access credentials used by owner device may not match those for the WiFi network at the vacation rental. Although and owner was used as an example the location data and credential data from other non guest devices may lead to the same result invalidation of fraudulent or erroneous review data due to that data not matching the expected location data and or credentials data.

In other examples one or more events may include one or more locus associated with those events and an external system that receives data from a computing device e.g. client device directly or indirectly from a portal computing device e.g. wireless access point may extract location data from the received data and determine if that location data is within a threshold of an allowable distance from an allowable location. An allowable distance may be computed by a networked computing device that receives the data e.g. via a communications interface in communication with the networked computing device and an allowable location may be stored data in a data storage resource data store data base or other resource that is accessed by the networked computing device. Each event may include its own allowable location and may also include its own allowable distance. As one example if the event is a stay at a rental property and the portal computing device is the wireless access point that is positioned at the rental property then location data extracted from data transmitted by the client device may be processed by the networked computing resource to extract the location data from the received data. The location data may include location data for the portal computing device and or RF signal data related to the wireless link between the portal computing device and the client device .

Accordingly if the vacation rental is a 1250 sq ft two story condo unit and the wireless access point is positioned on the first floor of the condo if the extracted location data indicates the client device is positioned approximately 50 meters way from the wireless access point then that distance may not be an allowable distance from the event based on the allowable location e.g. inside one of the rooms of the rental property . In this example a distance of 50 meters e.g. more than 150 feet is not likely to be consistent with an allowable distance e.g. approximately 10 meters or less for a data transmission to have originated from somewhere inside the 1250 sq ft condo e.g. an allowable location . An image captured of the event e.g. a room or view from the condo is less likely to have not been captured at the allowable location based on the position of the client device being approximately 50 meters distant from the portal computing device . Metadata included in the image captured by the client device may include embedded location data from systems and or services available to the client device and metadata may be processed to extract the embedded location data. The embedded location data may be analyzed by the networked computing device to determine that the location of the image is not within the threshold for the allowable distance for the allowable location.

As another example a stay may include attendance by guest at a music festival as the event e.g. Outside Lands in San Francisco Calif. Newport Jazz Festival SXSW in Austin Tex. Monterey Jazz Festivals etc. . The event may take place in a large outdoor area e.g. a park and may also include one or more indoor venues such as night clubs auditoriums theaters etc. Some locations at the event may include known wireless access points such as WiMAX or WiFi routers for example. Other locations may not have traditional WiFi access and longer range portal computing devices such as cellular communications networks e.g. one or more of may be used to wirelessly link with a computing device such as client device of guest while the guest is attending the event. The event e.g. music festival being attended by guest may or may not be associated with other events such as a stay event at a vacation rental in a local near the music festival for example.

To the example the threshold for an allowable distance for an allowable location at the music festival e.g. in the outdoor grounds may typically be a larger allowable distance than would be the case for a vacation rental unit. For example the threshold for an allowable distance may be approximately a hundred feet or more. Portal computing devices e.g. WiFi and or WiMAX at the music festival and or longer range portal computing devices e.g. cellular communications networks may be used to receive data from the client device and then communicate that data to the networked computing device. Smaller or more intimate venues at the music festival e.g. a night club may include a wireless access point e.g. and the threshold for an allowable distance for an allowable location may typically be smaller e.g. approximately 50 feet or less than would be the case for larger outdoor events e.g. approximately 100 feet or more .

In that there may be multiple locations at the music festival consistent with attendance presence of the guest and their client device there may be multiple allowable location and multiple threshold allowable distances that may be accessed by the networked computing device to validate the location of the client device and to form validated location data for example. Validated locations for the client device and validated location data may be used to allow access to the networked computing device and or other systems in networked system . Access may include data communications access and upon allowing access data from the client device may be acted on by the networked system e.g. via processing by networked computing device . As one example if the data includes review data of one or more attractions at the music festival event then a validated location and validated location data may be used to allow access to the networked computing device to generate a review data file that may be distributed or otherwise published e.g. electronically as a review of the event.

In APP executing on a computing system of client device may access hardware and or software systems and or resources of client device to transmit data to one or more external systems e.g. networked system . Data may include but is not limited to location data location history data credentials review data amended review data media content free text structured text metadata and electronic messages for example. APP may receive data from one or more external systems e.g. networked system . Data may include but is not limited to request s e.g. to compose a review push messages e.g. to compose a review information on other events for guest to consider electronic messages e.g. text email tweets IM s verification data e.g. location data access credential data push location data e.g. location data for other events the guest may partake in location history push events e.g. events related to offers from business for the guest to consider applications APP s for client device and configuration data CFG e.g. to configure client device . In some example the external system that transmits the data e.g. networked system may only do so after data has been verified by the external system so that client device has been granted data communications access to the external system. Data communications access may be allowed after data e.g. received from a computing device e.g. client device has been authenticated as to credential data verified as to location data or both.

As will be described below after review data e.g. transmitted by APP via client device is received by one or more external systems the review data may be verified e.g. for location data and or credential data and formatted for publication e.g. to a web page bulletin board newsletter etc. . A verified review may be queued for publication at a later time and prior to being published owner device may receive a version of the pending review for owner to consider and optionally act on before the review is published to a broader audience e.g. people searching for vacation rentals for future stay dates . Owner device may receive a pending review e.g. in an email message or other form of electronic messaging . If the review is suboptimal e.g. less than four stars or free text indicating guest dissatisfaction owner may uses owner device or some other device to either contact the guest to cure any grievance the guest may have or to amend the review to rebut the suboptimal review. In some examples the owner may have cured the cause for the suboptimal review and the owner guest or both may communicate an amended review that will be published instead of the initial review. Accordingly output from owner device may include data for an amended review or data used to cure the grievance of guest for example. An application executing on owner device may process incoming data and outgoing data .

According to some examples computer system performs specific operations by one or more processors executing one or more sequences of one or more instructions stored in system memory . Such instructions may be read into system memory from another non transitory computer readable medium such as storage device or disk drive e.g. a HDD or SSD . In some examples circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions for implementation. The term non transitory computer readable medium refers to any tangible medium that participates in providing instructions and or data to processor s for execution. Such a medium may take many forms including but not limited to non volatile media and volatile media. Non volatile media includes for example optical magnetic or solid state disks such as disk drive . Volatile media includes dynamic memory such as system memory . Common forms of non transitory computer readable media includes for example floppy disk flexible disk hard disk SSD magnetic tape any other magnetic medium CD ROM DVD ROM Blu Ray ROM USB thumb drive SD Card any other optical medium punch cards paper tape any other physical medium with patterns of holes RAM PROM EPROM FLASH EPROM any other memory chip or cartridge or any other medium from which a computer may read.

Instructions may further be transmitted or received using a transmission medium. The term transmission medium may include any tangible or intangible medium that is capable of storing encoding or carrying instructions for execution by the machine and includes digital or analog communications signals or other intangible medium to facilitate communication of such instructions. Transmission media may include coaxial cables copper wire and fiber optics including wires that comprise bus for transmitting a computer data signal or other signals e.g. from hardware or circuitry . In some examples execution of the sequences of instructions may be performed by a single computer system . According to some examples two or more computer systems coupled by communication link e.g. LAN Ethernet PSTN USB or wireless network may perform the sequence of instructions in coordination with one another. Computer system may transmit and receive messages data and instructions including programs i.e. application code through communication link and communication interface . Received program code may be executed by processor as it is received and or stored in disk drive or other non volatile storage for later execution. Computer system may optionally include a wireless transceiver coupled with the communication interface and coupled with an antenna for receiving and generating RF signals such as from a WiFi network WiMAX network BT radio Cellular network networked computing resources external resource client devices e.g. owner devices e.g. near field communication NFC satellite network data storage network or other wireless network and or wireless devices for example. Examples of wireless devices e.g. client devices may include but is not limited to those depicted in . Communications interface may be coupled with data storage external to computer system . Communications interface may be coupled with external resources and or systems such as those depicted in for example. Computer system may be used to implement a computing device e.g. a portal computing device e.g. a networked computing device e.g. a networked system e.g. and an external resource e.g. for example.

Moving on to where one example of a block diagram of a networked system including a networked computing device operative to receive and validate data for authentication of credentials and or location is depicted. The data may be used to generate a review data file based on review data included in the data and generated from an in situ evaluation or amended versions of an in situ evaluation of an event by a guest traveler user customer client or the like. Networked system may be in wired and or wireless communications with other devices and systems including but not limited to external resource and its associated resources client device owner device and devices of guests just to name a few. Networked system may include resources in communications with one another that may include but is not limited to an application program interface API one or more laptop computers one or more servers a communications interface that may include wireless and wired links firewall one or more server farms data storage review data location data location history data e.g. a location history data base event data credential data owner data guest data stay data and executable code . In some examples data storage may include one or more of the other data storage categories e.g. . In other examples data storage resources accessed by networked system may be external to networked system e.g. positioned in external resource . One or more of the flows depicted in may be implemented using executable code and or API for example. For purposes of explanation a computing resource e.g. depicted in may be referred to as a networked computing device and a data storage resource e.g. may be referred to as data storage. For example data may be received by networked computing resource via communications interface . In some examples a computing device that transmitted the data may be referred to as a client device e.g. .

Review data may include review data and or amended review data and may include formatted reviews for publication or queued for publication e.g. at some later time such as after owner has had an opportunity to review cure or rebut a pending review . Review data may include location data and or credential data from a guest device e.g. that may be compared to location data in and or credential data in . Review data may include review data files for formatted reviews and may include amended review data files. In some examples data includes amended review data.

Location data may include locations e.g. GPS data and or other location data associated with events e.g. events in and locations around events e.g. in approximately the same locale as an event . Location data may include locations associated with owners for use in verifying location data for amended review data transmitted by an application executing on an owner device e.g. . Examples of location around an event may include but are not limited to a park across the street from an event a cafe of coffee shop down the street from an event etc. Examples of owner locations may include location data associated with use of the owner device such as location data from cellular networks e.g. in the city or state the owner lives in WiFi networks WiMAX networks etc.

Event data may include data for events such as a stay at a vacation rental an entertainment venue a bar a grocery store a bakery goods services business restaurants etc. that may be the primary event for guest or may be associated with activities the guest partakes of during his her stay at the primary event e.g. the stay at the vacation rental .

Location history data base may include location data tracked and stored over time based on various locations visited by guest with a computing device e.g. client device that includes or has access to internal external sources of location data. Validation of location may include accessing data in location data location history data base or both. In some examples a computing device that communicates the data may include location history data base LH DB which may include the same or different data than location history data base . In some examples location data in one of the location history data bases may be used to update and or replace location data in the other location history data base. For example location data in LH DB of client device may be received and stored in location history data base . As another example location data in location history data base of client device may be received and stored in LH DB .

Credential data e.g. access credentials user name password etc. may be a data store where access data is retained for various events owner properties etc. For example credential data may include credentials for WiFi access points in owner properties businesses that may be promoted by the owner or by an agent acting on behalf of the owner etc. Other forms of credentials may be included in credential data such as access credentials for guest devices locks or doors needed to gain access to a rental property or other protected area associated with a stay at an event for example.

Owner data may include data about owners e.g. such as property addresses owner address and contact information email accounts account information for a vacation rental agency the owner uses to manage stays by guests data on owner devices e.g. MAC address or other forms of device ID etc. . Guest data may include data about guests e.g. such as addresses and contact information email accounts guest demographics data on guest devices e.g. MAC address or other forms of device ID etc. financial accounts for deposits payments refunds etc. Stay data may include data for an event such as stay dates check in check out times event address event categories for different types of events e.g. vacation rental events restaurant events casino events etc. . Data storage may be used as a data store that may be accessed by other components internal to and or external to networked system . Networked system may include more or fewer resources than depicted in as denoted by .

Guest devices and or owner devices may communicate with networked system via a Web Site Web Page e.g. using a browser or application on a laptop PC wireless device smartphone pad tablet touch screen device etc. . Information may be viewed entered transmitted received or otherwise communicated between networked system and another device e.g. etc. using Web Site Page . Reviews amended reviews or other data associated with event or other events may be communicated via Web Site Page . Network service may require access be granted to a device e.g. etc. prior to allowing data communication with the networked service via Web Site Page .

Moving now to where examples of a computing device and a portal computing device in communications with a networked system including a networked computing device that receives data transmitted by the computing device and or portal computing device. In example a portal device may receive the data from a computing device e.g. client device via or and transmit the received data via a communications link with a communications interface CI of networked system . Networked computing device e.g. a server may receive the data via the CI . Location data L associated with portal computing device may be include e.g. in a data packet or other data structure communicated over the communications link and networked computing device may use location data originating from the computing device e.g. client device location data from portal computing device or both to validate location and form validated location data. A portal computing device may include its own data storage resources computing resources communications interface RF systems and associated algorithms. Data storage resources may be accessed from an external data store such as networked attached storage external resource SD card USB thumb drive or other resource for example.

In example computing device includes the data and transmits the data e.g. to networked system via a communications link with CI . In example an intermediate communications device such as portal computing device may not be used for data communications between computing device and networked system . Therefore in some examples data received by networked computing device via CI may be directly communicated by computing device via a communications link between CI and computing device .

In example computing device includes the data and transmits the data e.g. to portal computing device and the portal computing device transmit the data to the networked computing device via CI . Examples and may be similar however example includes a scenario where computing device has transmitted the data to portal device and the data may be buffered queued or stored for later transmission e.g. in networked attached storage NAS SD card or USB thumb drive or delayed in transmission due to network traffic or network failure. Example may include a scenario where the computing device is no longer in communications range or is no longer linked with portal computing device at the time the portal device transmits the data to networked system via CI .

In example a client device is depicted as one example of a computing device that may transmit data to and or receive data from networked system via one or more portal computing devices in communication with CI . Portal computing devices may include their own location data L as described above. Client device may communicate with portal computing device e.g. a WiFi access point such as during one or more periods of time during a duration of an event and with portal computing device e.g. one or more cellular communications networks such as at one or more other periods of time during a duration of the event. Location data in the location history data base of client device the location history data base of networked system or both may be updated revised or otherwise modified by changes in location of client device e.g. due to movement associated with guest as tracked or otherwise logged by one or more portal computing devices or by location data from the client device itself. In example networked computing device may receive data from one or more portal computing devices e.g. and may use the data received from the portal computing devices to authenticate credential data and or validate location data included in the data and may grant data communications access to the networked computing device and or other resources in networked system based on the authentication and or validation.

APP may select one or more portal computing device based on one or more factors including but not limited to data bandwidth e.g. select the portal computing device with the highest upload speed in Mb s portal computing device with the highest signal strength e.g. in data usage cost e.g. free WiFi or Bluetooth vs. Cellular 3G or 4G etc. and size of data to be transmitted or received . For example media content in data may have a large data size that may be used by APP to determine which portal computing device to interface with. Those factors may be used to select among multiple portal computing device that may be available for use by client device at the same time e.g. access to both WiFi via and Cellular via . There may be more or fewer computing devices and or portal computing devices than depicted in the examples of as denoted by and . Data communication depicted in may be wired wireless or both.

Turning now to where one example of a flow diagram for receiving data at a networked computing device that validates and or authenticates the data is depicted. At a stage data e.g. is received at a networked computing device e.g. . The data may be received via a communications interface e.g. in communication with the networked computing device. Data may be received from a computing device e.g. client device and or from a portal computing device e.g. .

At a stage credential data included in the data may be extracted from the data e.g. extracted at the networked computing device . At a stage location data included in the data may be extracted from the data e.g. extracted at the networked computing device . In some examples the location data may include location data from a computing device e.g. client device and may include location data from a portal computing device. In other examples data may include metadata and the metadata may include embedded location data.

At a stage a match between the credential data and an access credential in data storage e.g. credential data is determined. Credential data may include credential data from the computing device that transmitted the data and the portal computing device from which the data was received from by CI .

At a stage a determination is made as to whether or not the location data is within a threshold allowable distance from an allowable location in data storage e.g. location data . The location data may originate from location data collected by APP on client device and or from location data in portal computing device e.g. .

At a stage data communications access to the networked computing device e.g. by the computing device e.g. client device is allowed based on the credential data matching the access credentials in data storage the location data being determined to be within the threshold allowable distance from an allowable location.

Reference is now made to where another example of a flow diagram for receiving data at a networked computing device that validates and or authenticates the data is depicted. At a stage a networked computing device e.g. may receive data e.g. from a computing device e.g. via a communications link e.g. between the networked computing device and a portal computing device e.g. . In other examples networked computing device e.g. may receive the data from the computing device e.g. via the communications link e.g. as described above in reference to example in .

At a stage credential data included in the data may be extracted from the data at the networked computing device. At a stage location data included in the data may be extracted from the data at the networked computing device.

At a stage the networked computing device may determine if the credential data matches access credentials in a data store e.g. credential data . At a stage a determination may be made at the networked computing device as to whether or not the credential data matched the access credentials in the data store. If there was no match then a NO branch may be taken to a stage . On the other hand if there was a match then a YES branch may be taken to a stage where an identity of the computing device that originated the transmission of the data e.g. may be authenticated and authenticated identity data may be formed. After stage has executed or if the NO branch was taken from the stage flow may transition to another stage such as the stage .

At the stage a determination may be made at the networked computing device as to whether or not the location data is within a threshold of an allowable distance from an allowable location in the data store e.g. location data and or location history data base . At a stage if the location data is not within the threshold distance then a NO branch may be taken to a stage . If a YES branch is taken then flow may transition to the stage .

At the stage the computing device is validated based on the location being within the threshold for an allowable distance for an allowable event and validated location data may be generated. At the stage a determination may be made as to whether or not the credential data was authenticated at the stage whether the location data has been validated at the stage or both. If the credential data was not authenticated at the stage and the location data was not validated at the stage then a NO branch may be taken from the stage and flow may terminate. On the other hand if one or both of the credential data or location data were authenticated and validated at the stages and respectively then a YES branch may be taken from the stage to a stage .

At the stage data communications access to networked computing device e.g. is allowed. The allowing of data communications access may include allowing further processing of the data that was received at the stage e.g. processed to generate a review data file . The allowing of data communications access may include allowing data from one or more resources in networked system to be transmitted to the computing device e.g. data that is received by client device . The allowing of data communications access may include allowing access to the computing device e.g. client device to a web site or web page provided by networked system . The allowing of data communications access may include allowing data from the computing device to be stored or otherwise acted on by one or more resources in networked system . The allowing of data communications access may include uni directional e.g. one way or bi directional data communications between networked computing device e.g. and the computing device e.g. .

Referring now to where one example of a flow diagram for generating a review data file is depicted. At a stage review data included in data received e.g. by a networked computing device e.g. in is processed at the networked computing device.

At a stage text data e.g. free text structured text or both are extracted at the networked computing device. At a stage media content if any that was included in the review data is extracted at the networked computing device. At a stage metadata if any that was included in the review data is extracted at the networked computing device. In some examples the metadata may be included media content. In other examples the metadata may include location data time data date data etc. captured at a time media content was generate e.g. on client device . Metadata may be embedded in other data included in data . APP on client device may generate metadata from sources internal to and or external to client device and that metadata may be included in the data in review data included in data included in media content that is included in the review data or media content that is included or in the data for example.

At a stage a determination may be made as to whether or not the metadata extracted at the stage includes embedded location data. If embedded location data is included in the extracted metadata then a YES branch may be taken to a stage where the embedded location data is extracted at the networked computing resource and flow may transition to a stage . If embedded location data is not included in the extracted metadata then a NO branch may be taken to the stage .

At the stage a review data file or amended review data file may be generated at the networked computing device. The review data file may include formatted data from one or more of the extracted text extracted media content extracted metadata or embedded location data for example. The embedded location data may be used to update revise or otherwise modify the location history data base and or location history data base on client device for example. The review data file may be queued for later publication. The review data file may be communicated to an owner or other interested party e.g. a proprietor manager who s business or establishment may be the subject of a review from an event attended by the guest .

Attention is now directed to where examples and of a threshold for an allowable distance for an allowable location are depicted. In example the event is a stay at a vacation rental unit where guest and his her client device are present. WiFi access point e.g. a portal computing device is positioned in the rental unit and includes access credentials . Concentric circles depict a radial distance centered about access point e.g. in a room of the vacation rental where a threshold for an allowable distance denoted as a black dot for device for an allowable location e.g. event may be used by networked computing device e.g. to validate location data and form validated location data as described above in reference to for example. For purposes of explanation a distance between adjacent circles in may be 3 meters for example. Distances that are not an allowable distance are denoted by a x and some of those distances may fall outside of circle .

For example as a distance of the client device increases along direction of the arrow for radial distance locations associated with x may increase whereas as a distance of the client device increases along direction of the arrow for radial distance locations associated with may increase.

In example as the client device moves closer to or further away from access point as denoted by dashed line a RF signal parameter may change as a function of distance along . As an example RSSI or RF signal strength associated with 1 bar or 2 bars for x may be indicative of the client device being outside the allowable distance. On the other hand at closer distances to access point RSSI or RF signal strength associated with 3 bars or 4 bars for may be indicative of the client device being inside the allowable distance. As another example review data and or media content in review data captured by client device at x may result in the data not being validated as to location and data communications access to the networked computing device may be denied. However review data and or media content in review data captured by client device at may result in the data being validated as to location and data communications access to the networked computing device may be allowed. Hardware software circuitry RF systems or the like in access point may include signal strength data indicative of a relatively strong signal e.g. 4 to 5 bars an adequate signal e.g. 3 bars or a relatively weak signal e.g. one to two bars in data . The signal strength data may be used by the networked computing device to validate the location data. APP may access systems of client device e.g. RF system and include signal strength data in the data and that may be may be used by the networked computing device to validate the location data.

Further to example an owner may own both rental units depicted e.g. and . An access point with access credentials in rental unit may be detected by and may even be accessed by client device of guest . For example another guest in may give the access credentials for access point to guest . However data transmitted by client device using access point may not be authenticated due to the credential data in not matching the access credentials assigned to event . Use by guest of access point to communicate data to from networked computing device may result in credential data not being authenticated and data communications access being denied. For example review data included in the data may be rejected by networked computing device due the data not originating from a location and or credentials associated with event .

Attention is now directed to where examples of locations for events are depicted. Events may be stays at vacation rental properties in locations such as in Alaska in California in Mexico in Brazil in South Africa in Australia in China in France in the United Kingdom and in Russia. Associated events may occur in a locale of the events . Each event location e.g. city town venue etc. may include a plurality of events that are occurring at the same time and some of the events may be in the same general location e.g. Union Square in San Francisco Calif. of one another.

For events that are related to stays at a rental property there may be standard terms for occupancy such as a stay date range and check in and check out times. As one example for an event on the beginning date of the stay the guest has a check in time Ci denoted on clock and the guest enters the event e.g. a stay at a rental home at that check in time. Clock denotes a check out time Co for the guest to exit the event on the ending date for the stay where the guest ends occupancy of the event .

The event may include communications access for client device that may be used by the guest to enter review data using client device . Prior to the check out time Co the APP on executing on client device the networked system or both may prompt a review Pr of the event by signaling or otherwise messaging the guest to generate a review of his her stay at the event contemporaneously with the stay that is before the guest actually checks out Co. The prompt for the review Pr may include a prompt for the guest to capture an image of a favorite or memorable aspect of the stay at the event such as a picture of an ocean beach view from a room at the event e.g. a bedroom balcony . The prompt for the review Pr may be timed for activation by the APP at a time before the check out time Co e.g. one to two hours before Co or be included in incoming data received by client device for example. After the guest has captured the image e.g. at a time approximately at or around check out time and entered review text and or vocal commentary the review data may be transmitted e.g. to networked system for processing and subsequent formatting Fr of the review for publication. The prompt for the review Pr may occur while the guest is still in situ at event and may occur minutes or hours before the designated check out Co time.

An advantage of the in situ evaluation of the event before the guest has departed the event is that feelings impressions experiences associated with the stay at the event may still be fresh and or strong in the mind of the guest and or an guest and therefore may lead to a more accurate and positive review than would be the case if the guest and or guest submitted the review at a later date e.g. days or weeks later . If the owner provided a five star property for event and the guest at the time of the stay also feels the event is worthy of a five star review then the best time to capture that sentiment may be in situ while the guest is still present at the event . Similarly guest may also have a similar sentiment and the best time to capture that sentiment may be while the guest is in situ at the event . Guest may have client device and that device may receive data and transmit data and the guest may be prompted Pr to generate an in situ review in a manner similar to that for guest .

Another advantage of the in situ evaluation of events is that after the submission of the event e.g. by transmitting data the networked system may process the received review data and format the review Fr for publication. Therefore at some time after check out Co e.g. minutes to hours later a formatted review may be ready for publication to a broader audience. Owner may receive notice and a copy of the formatted review Fr for consideration and may take action to cure any issues that arose during the guest s stay at the event and or negotiate with the guest to amend the review Ar prior to its publication in its present form. The time from prompting the review Pr to publishing the formatted review Fr in its original or amended form Ar may be a matter of a few hours or less instead of days or weeks as may be the case when a guest submits a review long after the guest has departed the event . The review captured in situ may be more accurate as the guest may be in a good mood while still at the event and that mood may change post event and lead to an inaccurate review.

Further to example an event in location may include a stay at a town house rental property denoted as event . A room at the event may include a wireless access point that may communicate wirelessly with client device networked system and or external resource not shown . Prior to check out time Co from event guest may capture in situ media content and enter review textual content while present at event e.g. from inside room . Location data and or credential data may be included in the review data e.g. communicated by APP via client device and that data may be verified by networked system e.g. the location data is consistent with the client device being within a locus of the location for event and or room . Similarly credential data may be verified by wireless device address of client device being received by access point by RSSI by access credentials stored in memory of client device being accessed by APP and included in the data received by networked system for example. While at location guest and or guest may be mobile and may travel to other events at location such as a restaurant event in which guest and guest are seated at a table . Wireless access point may communicate with client devices and with networked system to verify credential and location data associated with a review of the restaurant event by the guest . During stay at location other communications resources such as cellular networks and or may be used to verify location data e.g. the client device associated with guest is in vicinity of one or more of the cellular networks and or . Multiple cellular networks may be used to fix a location for devices using triangulation or other techniques. Data may be communicated to from networked system and or client device using one or more of the cellular networks. Location based services accessible by client devices and or APP may be used to access location data for use in verifying location for reviews or other purposes.

A review of restaurant event may be in situ and be formatted and queued for publication in a manner similar to that described above. A push message e.g. in data may be received by APP on client device and that message may include information on the restaurant event that may be used to inform the guest of the location menu hours of operation contact information prices etc. for the restaurant event . The push message may include a discount offer or other incentive for the guest to motivate the guest to patronize the restaurant event . Owners of venues such as the restaurant event for example may receive formatted reviews prior to publication and may take action to cure grievances and or amend reviews.

Although the foregoing examples have been described in some detail for purposes of clarity of understanding the above described conceptual techniques are not limited to the details provided. There are many alternative ways of implementing the above described conceptual techniques. The disclosed examples are illustrative and not restrictive.
