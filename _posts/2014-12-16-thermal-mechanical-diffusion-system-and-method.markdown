title: Thermal mechanical diffusion system and method
abstract: Provided is a thermal mechanical diffusion system and method. In accordance with the present invention, one end of a fiber under tension is vibrated while a portion of the fiber is heated. A push-pull action of one end of the fiber forces increased (or rapid) diffusion of dopants in the portion of the fiber that is in a heat zone, which receives the heat. By controlling the amplitude and frequency of the vibration, a diffusion profile of one or more fibers can be dictated with precision. Heat sources having narrower thermal profiles can enable greater precision in dictating the diffusion profile. As an example, this can be particularly useful for creating a diffusion taper within a fiber to be spliced, where the taper is a result of thermal expansion of the fiber core. Diffusion can occur much more rapidly than is typical.

The present inventive concepts relate the field of systems and methods used for processing such materials as optical fibers for example systems and methods used for cleaving splicing tapering diffusion other thermal processing and the like of optical fiber strands cables and so on.

As known by those skilled in the art ideally two fibers i.e. optical fibers being spliced together should have the same numerical aperture NA . This is true even if the fiber cores are different size. Thus NA is a critical parameter when splicing fibers.

Generally in fiber optics NA is a dimensionless number that characterizes the range of angles over which the fiber can accept or emit light and is given by the formula square root over where n is the refractive index of the fiber core and n is the fiber index of the cladding. The fiber core and cladding tend to have slightly different make ups which results in the different refractive indexes. See for an example.

Selectively changing the NA of an optical fiber typically involves changing the refractive index and diameter of the core. This can be accomplished by applying a flame having a width of about 5 mm 6 mm to a fixed fiber. The fiber is heated at its melting temperature for a relatively long time i.e. several minutes or more until the cladding and core start to blend thereby changing the refractive index of the core by diffusion of dopants therein. An end of the fiber can also be pulled so that the diameter of the fiber is also selectively reduced also referred to as tapering. 

The heated portion is cleaved at the center of the thermal profile which is generally Gaussian. Therefore assuming the flame has a width of about 5 mm a cleave can be made at about 2.5 mm from each end of the thermal profile. See .

This process works relatively well for an individual fiber. However because using such a flame takes several minutes or more to achieve the necessary diffusion this cannot be done quickly. Slow diffusion means less yield and higher cost.

Also the stationary flame with a fixed flame width presents limitations with respect to achievable thermal profiles that can be used for diffusion. And the same flame is used regardless of the core diameter.

In accordance with one aspect of the present disclosure provided is a thermal mechanical diffusion system and method. One end of a fiber or fiber bundle under tension is vibrated while a portion of the fiber is heated. The push and pull of at least one end of the fiber forces increased diffusion of dopants in the core in the portion of the fiber that is in the heat zone. Thus by precisely controlling the amplitude and frequency of the vibration a diffusion profile of one or more fibers can be dictated with precision. Also diffusion can occur much more rapidly than is typical. As an example this can be particularly useful for creating a diffusion taper within a fiber to be spliced where the taper is a result of thermal expansion of the fiber core.

In accordance with one aspect of the invention first and second portions of a fiber or fiber bundle are respectively secured with a first fiber holder and a second fiber holder. The first fiber holder is coupled to a vibration mechanism. A heat source applies heat to an area of the fiber between the two fiber holders. The vibration mechanism causes predetermined vibration of the first fiber holder with the fiber experiencing a resulting push and pull from the first fiber holder. As a result rapid diffusion occurs in the fiber core.

The heat source can include a flame. The flame can be applied directly to the fiber or applied to a crucible that surrounds the fiber.

The heat source can be a filament heat source that substantially surrounds the fiber. The filament heat source can include a Tungsten or graphite filament.

The heat source can include a laser. The laser can be a CO2 laser. The CO2 laser can be a 10 m laser.

The rapid diffusion can take place in not more than about 1 minute as an example rapid diffusion can take place in less than 10 seconds.

An amplitude of the vibration can be between about 1 100 m. As an example the amplitude vibration can be 1 25 m.

A heated field according to a thermal profile of the heat source can be about 1 mm or less in width. As an example the heated field can be about 500 m in width.

The area of the fiber receiving the heat can be a heat zone. The heat zone can be wider than the heated field of the heat source.

The rapid diffusion can be applied to more than one area of the fiber. The rapid diffusion can be applied to a first area of the fiber then an adjacent second area of the fiber and so on. The areas can overlap.

The vibration amplitude and or vibration frequency can be programmable. Temperature diffusion profile and areas to be heated can also be programmable.

In accordance with another aspect of the invention provided is a thermal mechanical diffusion system useful to achieve rapid diffusion in optical fibers. The system comprises a first fiber holder configured to secure a first portion of at least one fiber a second fiber holder configured to secure a second portion of the at least one fiber a vibration mechanism coupled to the first fiber holder and configured to provide vibratory motion of the first fiber holder with respect to the second fiber holder and a heat source configured to apply heat to a portion of the at least one fiber disposed between the two fiber holders during the vibratory motion.

The vibration mechanism can be configured to cause a predetermined vibration of the first fiber holder.

The second fiber holder can be configured to maintain the second portion of the fiber in a fixed position relative to the first fiber holder.

The heat source can be a filament heat source that substantially surrounds a circumference of the at least one fiber.

A portion of the fiber receiving the heat can be a heat zone and the heat zone can be wider than the heated field of the heat source.

In accordance with another aspect of the invention provided is a method of causing rapid thermal diffusion in optical fibers. The method comprises securing a first portion of at least one fiber in a first fiber holder securing a second portion of the at least one fiber in a second fiber holder and vibrating the first fiber holder with respect to the second fiber holder while applying heat to a portion of the at least one fiber disposed between the two fiber holders to achieve diffusion of dopants within the at least one fiber.

The method can further comprise performing the vibrating and heating to more than one area of the fiber.

The method can further comprise controlling at least one of a vibration amplitude and a vibration frequency with a programmable computer.

The method can further comprise controlling a thermal profile of the heat source with a programmable computer.

The method can further comprise controlling a diffusion profile of the at least one fiber with a programmable computer.

The method can further comprise diffusing the dopants within the at least one fiber by performing the vibration and heating for not more than about 1 minute.

The method can further comprise diffusing the dopants within the at least one fiber by performing the vibration and heating for not more than about 10 seconds.

The vibration can be caused by at least one piezo having a frequency of vibration in a range of about 1 Hz 100Hz.

Hereinafter aspects of the present invention will be described by explaining illustrative embodiments in accordance therewith with reference to the attached drawings. While describing these embodiments detailed descriptions of well known items functions or configurations are typically omitted for conciseness.

It will be understood that although the terms first second etc. may be used herein to describe various elements these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are used to distinguish one element from another but not to imply a required sequence of elements. For example a first element can be termed a second element and similarly a second element can be termed a first element without departing from the scope of the present invention. As used herein the term and or includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.

It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being on or connected or coupled to another element it can be directly on or connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements can be present. In contrast when an element is referred to as being directly on or directly connected or directly coupled to another element there are no intervening elements present. Other words used to describe the relationship between elements should be interpreted in a like fashion e.g. between versus directly between adjacent versus directly adjacent etc. .

The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used herein the singular forms a an and the are intended to include the plural forms as well unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms comprises comprising includes and or including when used herein specify the presence of stated features steps operations elements and or components but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features steps operations elements components and or groups thereof.

Spatially relative terms such as beneath below lower above upper and the like may be used to describe an element and or feature s relationship to another element s and or feature s as for example illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use and or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example if the device in the figures is turned over elements described as below and or beneath other elements or features would then be oriented above the other elements or features. The device may be otherwise oriented e.g. rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.

Diffusion in a fiber that is accomplished in accordance with the present invention is more rapid and a diffusion profile can be more precisely dictated than with prior systems. Therefore the numerical aperture NA of a fiber can be changed more rapidly and with greater precision. As a result the NAs of fibers intended to be spliced together can be much more precisely matched in a shorter amount of time using less energy.

In accordance with one aspect of the present disclosure provided is a thermal mechanical diffusion system and method. provide example embodiments of thermal mechanical diffusion systems and provides an example embodiment of a thermal mechanical diffusion method in accordance with aspects of the present invention. Unlike prior systems one end of a fiber under tension is vibrated while a portion of the fiber is heated. The push and pull of one end of the fiber forces increased diffusion in the portion of the fiber that is in the heat zone. Thus by precisely controlling the amplitude and frequency of the vibration a diffusion profile of one or more fibers can be dictated with precision. Also diffusion can occur much more rapidly than is typical.

The push and pull or vibration causes tension then release of the fiber in small increments over a plurality of cycles. This mechanical vibration forces increased diffusion in the heat zone beyond that which would result from only applying heat. As a result rapid diffusion occurs in the core of fiber F. This for example can result in controlled expansion of the core creating a diffusion taper. For instance where diffusion using a prior art approach could take tens of minutes the present invention could achieve a similar if not better result in tens of seconds or less while using substantially the same temperature. But because the duration would be far shorter using the present invention significant energy would be saved.

In fiber F is along a Z axis and the motion of the vibration mechanism is preferably also along the Z axis in the presently preferred embodiment. This is depicted by the double arrow superimposed over fiber holder FH. In this embodiment fiber holder FH is stationary so that the second portion of the fiber secured therein does not move. Again this is presently preferred in this embodiment. As an example the vibration mechanism can be a piezo actuator or mechanism to which power is applied to create the necessary vibration. In other embodiments different types of vibration mechanisms could be used.

The vibration mechanism e.g. piezo can respond to the applied power by vibrating such vibration having an amplitude and frequency that can be a function of the input power. The diffusion profile in fiber F will be a function of the amplitude and vibration of the vibration mechanism as well as the diameter and makeup of fiber F as well as the thermal profile of the heat source width and peak temperature . Assuming that the thermal profile of the heat source is unchanged and the physics of the fiber are inherent modulating the amplitude and frequency of the vibration can have significant impacts in otherwise dictating the diffusion profile in the fiber. This can be done selectively to for example create a desired thermal expansion taper within a fiber. And multiple areas of a fiber can be subjected to thermal mechanical diffusion to different degrees creating different amounts of diffusion in each area. The areas can overlap if necessary to create the desired diffusion profile.

A frequency of the vibration can be 1 100 Hz but the present invention is not limited to such a range. A frequency of the vibration can be more than 100 Hz if desired or useful.

An amplitude of the vibration can be between about 1 100 m. That is the vibration mechanism can have a range of movement of 1 100 m. As an example in some situations it may be desirable to have the amplitude vibration be 1 25 m. But there is no inherent limitation an amplitude of the vibration can be more than 100 m if necessary or desirable.

Ultimately the choice of vibration amplitude and frequency may depend largely of the fiber F desired diffusion profile and or thermal profile of the heat source.

With a typical heat source the thermal profile is Gaussian where the heat source delivers a heated field according to its Gaussian thermal profile. For example a flame heat source can produce a heated field having a width of about 5 6 mm. A three electrode can produce a heated field having a width of about 1 mm or less e.g. about 500 m.

Using the described vibration mechanism the heat zone i.e. heated portion of the fiber can be wider than the heating field width of the heat source. A three electrode heat source provides a heated field having a relatively narrow width. Therefore greater precision would be possible than with a flame that produces a heated field having a width of about 5 6 mm.

Thermal mechanical diffusion can be performed at different areas of the fiber F within the heat zone to create the desired diffusion profile. The different vibration frequency and or amplitude can be used in different areas and the areas can overlap if necessary. For example rapid diffusion can be applied to a first area of the fiber then an adjacent second area of the fiber and so on.

The thermal power of the heat source vibration amplitude and or vibration frequency can be programmable see . For instance the diffusion profile shown in could be achieved by applying thermal mechanical diffusion to 2 or more areas within the heat zone.

Returning to the heat source preferably provides a substantially uniform heated field about the fiber wherein the fiber is disposed so that a portion thereof is in the heated field. The heat source can take the form of any known or later developed heat source. For example the heat source can be a two electrode heat source. The heat source can include a flame. The flame can be applied directly to the fiber or applied to a crucible that surrounds the fiber. The heat source can be a filament heat source that substantially circumferentially surrounds some or all of the fiber. The filament heat source can include a Tungsten or graphite filament as examples or other types of known filaments. The laser can be a 10 m CO2 laser. In still other embodiments the heat source can be a multi electrode heat source having three to more electrodes as in .

In there are three thermal electrodes shown A B and C which are arranged to form a heated field. In other embodiments a different plurality of electrodes could be provided e.g. 2 electrodes 4 electrodes and so on . The individual electrodes are generally known in the art so not discussed in detail herein. In the demonstrated arrangement of the electrodes can produce a heated field having a temperature in a range of about 100 C about 3 000 C. The temperature used will typically depend on the makeup of fiber F particularly the fiber s melting temperature. In the demonstrated arrangement of the electrodes can produce a heated field having a width of about 1 mm at high power and about 500 m at low power. In some embodiments the heated field can be a heated plasma field.

In at least one fiber F is held or secured by two fiber holders FH and FH . Fiber F is arranged to pass through the heated field as is shown. In the preferred embodiment the electrodes are arranged substantially perpendicular to fiber F. In this embodiment fiber F can be considered to be on a Z axis as shown in and the multi electrode thermal source can be in the X Y plane. While presently preferred this may not necessarily be the arrangement in all embodiments. For example there may be embodiments where the heated field is angled with respect to the Z axis and fiber F.

In this embodiment fiber F is securely held in fiber holders FH and FH. Fiber holder FH remains fixed. However fiber holder FH is caused to vibrate. For illustrative purposes fiber holder FH is coupled to a piezo as a vibration mechanism. When power is applied to the piezo it vibrates causing fiber holder FH to vibrate. This vibration results in a small push and pull push pull action on fiber F along its axis the Z axis . The piezo vibrates with an amplitude and frequency that can be selectively chosen or programmed into a controller. This push and pull motion results in a rapid diffusion within the fiber area that is within the heat zone.

In some embodiments the fiber makeup NA and core diameter may be computer inputs and one or more of vibration amplitude vibration frequency heat zone area s heat source temperature and diffusion profile may be determined by a computer. For programmability purposes a processor memory and controller can be arranged to set and control such parameters.

While the foregoing has described what are considered to be the best mode and or other preferred embodiments it is understood that various modifications can be made therein and that the invention or inventions may be implemented in various forms and embodiments and that they may be applied in numerous applications only some of which have been described herein. It is intended by the following claims to claim that which is literally described and all equivalents thereto including all modifications and variations that fall within the scope of each claim.
