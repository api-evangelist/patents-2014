This application is a Continuation in Part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 828 855 filed Mar. 14 2013 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety which is based on and claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 624 009 filed Apr. 13 2012 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

This invention was made with government support under Grant No. 2009 DN 077 ARI031 awarded by the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office of the United States Department of Homeland Security and the National Science Foundation. The government has certain rights in the invention.

The presently disclosed subject matter relates to composite materials comprising a neutron capture agent an aromatic polymeric matrix material and an organic or inorganic luminescent fluor. The composite materials can be used for thermal neutron detection. In some embodiments the composite materials can be formed into nanofibers or thin films.

Scintillators are materials that can emit light upon absorbing radiation or energy from ionizing radiation. The research defense and industrial communities use scintillators as radiation detectors in a variety of applications such as but not limited to imaging nuclear power generation detection of special nuclear materials and homeland security.

Detectors for the detection of neutrons in the presence of photons can use many different methods to discriminate signals that originate from either neutrons or photons. As an example use of He in a pressurized tube for neutron detection permits discrimination of neutrons from photons by pulse amplitude. These detectors fail to correctly discriminate neutrons from photons only about one per 50 000 events. There are a few other scintillation materials that have slightly different light output characteristics when the energy is deposited by a photon or by a charged particle. This permits pulse shape discrimination PSD with sophisticated electronics. Another approach is to employ detectors with a very small probability of interaction for photons and a relatively high probability of interaction for neutrons. Some detectors of this type can achieve essentially 100 discrimination if charged particles are directly detected.

There is an ongoing need in the research defense and industrial communities for scintillators that demonstrate improved capabilities in terms of light output detection efficiency high count rate capability better time resolution of events and for neutron scintillators fewer false counts due to gamma radiation. Especially in view of the imminent shortage of He there is a need for an inexpensive replacement technology for thermal neutron detection particularly for replacement technologies that provide easy to make detectors that can have various geometries and or sizes.

Neutron scintillators can employ stable isotopes with a high neutron cross section. In some embodiments the presently disclosed subject matter provides composite materials comprising Li compounds as neutron capture agents distributed within a polymer matrix scintillator. On thermal neutron capture the Li nucleus can undergo fission to produce charged particles with high kinetic energy about 4.78 MeV namely an alpha particle about 2.05 MeV and a triton particle about 2.73 MeV . These high energy charged particles can leave behind them a field of ionization along their path length as they fragment the polymeric chains of the matrix by breaking covalent bonds. These ionizations can in turn create secondary electrons secondary ions and excitations in the aromatic matrix of the scintillator polymer of the presently disclosed composites all of which can directly or indirectly take part in activation of the polymer to produce excitations. Such excitations can either produce photons directly through monomer excimer emission characterized by quantum yield be dissipated by vibrational means or be transported through the matrix by random hopping to be eventually harvested by antenna molecules distributed within the matrix e.g. energy harvesting fluors such as inorganic or organic luminescent fluors that can concomitantly emit photons at a longer wavelength than the matrix. The transfer of energy to the lower energy excited state of the luminescent fluor can allow for re radiation at a wavelength where the bulk material is more transparent such that higher quantum efficiency is achieved. Thus according to the presently disclosed subject matter the polymer matrix is more than simply a binder or structural element it also produces and transports excitations efficiently.

Thus in some embodiments the presently disclosed subject matter provides a polymer composite comprising a polymeric matrix material. Distributed within the polymeric matrix material e.g. non covalently encapsulated or embedded within the polymeric matrix material can be a neutron capture agent and an organic or inorganic luminescent fluor. The polymeric matrix material can comprise an organic polymer copolymer or blend thereof having high energy transport efficiency and comprising at least one polymer or copolymer comprising an aromatic moiety.

Any suitable ratio of polymeric matrix material to neutron capture agent to fluor can be used. In some embodiments the composite has a ratio of matrix material to neutron capture agent of between about 9 1 by weight to about 1 5 by weight e.g. about 9 1 8 1 7 1 6 1 5 1 4 1 3 1 2 1 1.5 1 1 1 1 1.5 1 2 1 2.5 1 3 1 3.5 1 4 1 4.5 or 1 5 . In some embodiments the ratio of matrix material to neutron capture agent is between about 3 1 to about 1 5.

In some embodiments the ratio of matrix material to neutron capture agent is between about 1 1 and about 1 5 by weight. In some embodiments the ratio is between about 3 1 and about 1 1 by weight.

Typically the amount of organic and or inorganic luminescent fluor is relatively low compared to the amount of matrix material and neutron capture agent. In some embodiments the composite comprises about 5 e.g. about 5 4.5 4 3.5 3 2.5 2 1.5 1 or 0.5 or less by weight of the organic or inorganic luminescent fluor. In some embodiments the composite comprises about 1 by weight of the organic or inorganic luminescent fluor.

In some embodiments the polymer matrix is selected from the group including but not limited to aromatic polyesters polyamides polyethers polyimides polythioesters arylvinyl polymers i.e. polyarylvinyls such as but not limited to poly anthrylenevinylene PAV and poly naphthalenevinylene PNV vinylpolyesters vinylpolyethers vinylpolyamides and polythioesters. In some embodiments the polymer matrix is not polystyrene polyvinyltoluene or poly phenylenevinylene . In some embodiments the polymer matrix includes an aromatic moiety other than phenyl or alkyl substituted phenyl e.g. methylphenyl . In some embodiments the polymer matrix is stereo regular. In some embodiments the polymer matrix includes an aromatic moiety that has a higher energy transport efficiency and or quantum yield than phenyl i.e. a higher quantum yield than about 0.07 or methyl substituted phenyl i.e. a higher quantum yield than about 0.17 . In some embodiments the aromatic moiety of the polymer is selected from the group including but not limited to naphthalene anthracene fluorine terphenyl phenanthrene pyridine furan and thiophene. In some embodiments the aromatic moieties are unsubstituted i.e. with the exception of any bonding required to attach the aromatic moiety to the backbone of the polymeric matrix . In some embodiments the aromatic moiety can be substituted by one or more aryl group substituents.

In some embodiments the polymer matrix is an aromatic polyester. In some embodiments the matrix material comprises or consists of polyethylene naphthalate PEN or polytrimethylene naphthalate PTN or a blend or copolymer of both. In some embodiments PEN and PTN can be modified by various functional groups i.e. by one or more aryl group substituents .

Polyesters in general have good structural integrity and their synthesis is relatively straight forward. A large variety of polymers can be prepared by several different routes. Aromatic polyesters are often highly crystalline with high melting points and low solubility. Crystallinity can be decreased by introducing bulky side groups e.g. alkyl or aryl groups or kinks in the polymer backbone to make more soluble polyesters.

Suitable polyesters can be prepared for example by reacting a dicarboxylic acid or diacid chloride with a diol in a step growth condensation reaction liberating water or HCl. Equimolar amounts of reactants can be used to achieve high molecular weights. In some embodiments the dicarboxylic acid can be malonic acid and the diacid chloride can be terephthaloyl chloride. A mixture of isophthaloyl chloride and terephthaloyl chloride can be used to introduce kinks into the polymer backbone. The diol generally can contain a scintillating functional group e.g. an aromatic moiety such as fluorene or another aromatic group that has a high quantum yield.

The reaction between a dicarboxylic acid and a diol can be done in a melt and liberated water can be removed in order to force the reaction. A catalyst such as zinc acetate or antimony trioxide can be used to obtain high molecular weights in a timely fashion. The reaction between a diacid chloride and a diol can occur quickly and irreversibly at room temperature. A tertiary amine such as pyridine or triethylamine can be added to neutralize the produced HCl resulting in the hydrochloride salt of the amine. Reactions can also be done in solution. Suitable solvents include but are not limited to tetrahydrofuran THF or dichloromethane DCM and other ethers halogenated alkanes or aromatic solvents. The reaction mixture can be heated in order to speed up the kinetics of the reaction which should cause an increase in the molecular weight of the obtained polymer.

The structures of some exemplary polyester matrix polymers are shown in Scheme 1 below. These exemplary polyesters include poly 9H fluorene 9 9 dimethanol malonate which can be synthesized in the melt is soluble in a variety of solvents melts at about 140 C. and which turns yellow brown in color upon melting due to decomposition of fluorine dimethanol. Poly 9H fluorene 9 9 dimethanol terephthalate can be synthesized by a diacid chloride route and is white in color. Poly 4 4 9 fluorenylidene diphenol terephthalate can be synthesized by an acid chloride route is white in color fairly soluble in a variety of solvents and give a good fluorescence spectrum. To introduce kinks into the backbone in attempts to increase solubility mixtures of acid chlorides e.g. 50 50 and 70 30 mixtures of terephthaloyl chloride isophthaloyl chloride for example can be used.

In some embodiments the matrix material can comprise a vinyl polymer with ester or amide ether or thioester linked scintillating side groups. The backbone of these vinylpolyester vinylpolyamide vinylpolyether and vinylpolythioester polymers can be derived from methacryloyl chloride or another suitable vinyl containing acid chloride . The acid groups of a polyacrylic acid or poly alkylacrylic acid polymer can react with thiols or alcohols to form thioester or ester linked side chains or with amines to form amide linked side chains. The side chains can be derived from for example the following high quantum yield molecules 9 anthracenemethanol 9 fluorenemethanol and 1 1 4 1 terphenyl 4 thiol. Scheme 2 shows the structures of some exemplary vinylpolyesters and vinylpolythioesters.

Neutron scintillators can benefit from the presence of stable isotopes with a high neutron cross section. Typically the neutron capture agent of the presently disclosed materials comprises a Li compound. However in some embodiments other neutron capture agents such as those including isotopes of boron e.g. B xenon Xe Cadmium Cd hafnium Hf Gadolinium Gd Cobalt Co Europium Eu and Ytterbium Yb can be used. When the neutron capture agent comprises Li suitable Li compounds can include but are not limited to Li containing LiBH LiOH LiF LiCO LiCl LiBF LiClO and Li salicylate i.e. LiSal .

In some embodiments the neutron capture agent is non hygroscopic and or not reactive with water or only slightly hygroscopic. By non hygroscopic is meant a compound that does not absorb water or that does not appreciably absorb water. In some embodiments a non hygroscopic compound is a compound that absorbs less than 5 weight weight of water when exposed to ambient atmospheric conditions for 24 hours or longer e.g. 1 week or more . In some embodiments the non hygroscopic compound is a compound that absorbs less than 0.5 weight weight of water when exposed to ambient atmospheric conditions for 24 hours or longer e.g. 10 weeks with high relative humidity e.g. 80 relative humidity or higher . In some embodiments the neutron capture agent is slightly hygroscopic i.e. the agent can absorb more water than a non hygroscopic compound but not enough water to cause a composite material containing said agent to become mechanically unstable or to degrade its performance e.g. as a scintillator . Thus in some embodiments the Li compound is non hygroscopic and is a compound such as but not limited to Li containing LiF or LiCO. In some embodiments the Li compound is slightly hygroscopic such as but not limited to Li containing LiCIOor LiSal. The non or low hygroscopic nature of the Li compound can aid in the provision of composites and composite films that remain mechanically stable over time. Although LiSal can absorb moisture it does not form unstable films when composites are made using arylvinyl polymers e.g. P2VN .

In some embodiments the Li compound is LiF. LiF is one of the few lithium compounds that is thermally stable non hygroscopic and that does not violently react with water. LiF demonstrates one of the highest transparencies in the UV and near blue region of the visible spectra. Furthermore LiF has a very high density of 2.64 g cc and has a high stoichiometric lithium content of 24 .

Generally LiF has relatively low solubility in common organic solvents that dissolve polymers. Thus in some embodiments it can be advantageous to employ a Li compound that is soluble e.g. LiSal and forms a single phase or a nano phase distribution within a scintillation polymer matrix. However an alternative to a single phase system is to obtain uniformly distributed LiF phases with a minimum possible mean crystal size with low standard deviation which in turn reduces self absorption of charged particles within LiF crystals increases the probability of neutron interaction and can improve transparency of the composite. LiF is also slightly soluble in THF approximately 6 mg mL which can make it possible to process as a partially soluble component in a polymeric composite with uniformity in composition.

In some embodiments the neutron capture agent comprises LiF micro or nanoparticles. The LiF micro or nanoparticles can be prepared by titrating lithium hydroxide with hydrofluoric acid. In some embodiments the micro or nanoparticles are about 100 microns or smaller e.g. about 100 75 50 25 10 or 5 microns or smaller . In some embodiments the micro or nanoparticles are about 3.2 microns or smaller. In some embodiments the LiF micro or nanoparticles range in size from about 3.2 microns to about 200 nm e.g. about 3.2 3.1 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 2.3 2.2 2.1 2.0 1.9 1.8 1.7 1.6 1.5 1.4 1.3 1.2 1.1 1.0 0.9. 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 or 0.2 microns . In some embodiments nanoparticles are about 200 nm or less or about 100 nm or less in size. For example LiF nanoparticles that are about 200 nm or about 100 nm or less can be prepared by size reduction of larger LiF microparticles or nanoparticles e.g. LiF particles that are about 0.5 nm to about 10 microns in size . Size reduction can be carried out for instance via ball milling e.g. cryo ball milling the larger particles for a period of time e.g. 10 to 20 hours . Size reduction of the particles can increase the transparency of the polymer composite films prepared with the particles increase interactions with neutrons and better allow charged alpha and triton particles to escape into the polymer matrix thus improving light emission. Accordingly size reduction of the particles can increase light yield.

In some embodiments the composite comprises Li salicylate or LiF as a neutron capture agent and P2VN as a matrix material. In some embodiments the composite comprises LiF as a neutron capture agent and PEN or another aromatic polyester as a matrix material.

The presently disclosed composites can comprise organic and or inorganic luminescent fluors. The term fluor as used herein refers to a substance that displays fluorescence when excited by electromagnetic or particular radiation. The organic or inorganic luminescent fluors of the presently disclosed composites can act as energy harvesting antenna molecules to trap excitations from the matrix and to emit photons. For example an excitation can hop from one aromatic moiety to another in the polymeric matrix until it comes within a particular distance e.g. transfer radius of the fluor at which time the fluor traps the excitation and subsequently emits a photon. The fluors can act as light amplifiers when the composite materials are used as scintillation detectors and can also act as wavelength shifters for improving the efficiency of the detectors. Thus use of the fluors can increase the quantum yield of the composites e.g by allowing radiation at a wavelength where the composite is more transparent .

Any suitable luminescent fluor can be used. In some embodiments the fluor can be selected based on acceptor donor resonance the light emission characteristics of the fluor and or its ability to resist oxygen and or moisture induced scintillation quenching. In some embodiments the fluor can be selected based on overlap between the excitation spectra of the fluor and the emission spectra of the other components of the composite e.g. the polymer matrix .

Suitable luminescent fluors include but are not limited to 2 5 diphenyloxazole PPO 1 4 bis 5 phenyloxazol 2 yl POPOP anthracene 9 9 9 9 9 9 hexakis octyl 2 7 2 7 trifluorene n terphenyl 2 biphenyl 5 phenyl 1 3 oxazole 2 biphenyl 5 naphthyl 1 3 oxazole 2 phenyl 5 4 biphenylyl 1 3 4 oxadiazole 2 4 tert butylphenyl 5 4 biphenylyl 1 3 4 oxadiazole n bis o methylstyryl benzene 1 4 di 5 phenyl 2 oxazolyl benzene conjugated polymeric and oligomeric dyes metal organic framework dyes quantum dots two photon absorber semiconductor fluors and mixtures thereof.

In some embodiments the presently disclosed subject matter provides films of the presently disclosed polymer composites. The films can be used for example as thin scintillation detectors. The thinness of the films can allow secondary electrons to escape the scintillators providing better neutron to gamma discrimination.

The composite films can be prepared by any suitable technique such as but not limited to solution casting hot pressing and extrusion. For example the film can be prepared by using an extruder such as but not limited to a randcastle extruder with various processing conditions e.g. various process zone temperatures feed rate die slit arrangements and opening size take off rate and downstream cooling of the extruded film to increase the degree of crystallinity and or optical clarity of the film.

In some embodiments the film can have a thickness of about 500 microns or less e.g. about 500 450 400 350 300 250 200 150 100 75 50 40 30 20 or 10 microns or less . In some embodiments the film has a thickness between about 400 and about 200 microns. In some embodiments the film has a thickness of about 220 microns or less. In some embodiments the film has a thickness of about 50 microns or less. In some embodiments thicker films 500 microns can be used for example when the neutron capture agent is provided as nanoparticles that are about 200 nm or less in size. In some embodiments the presently disclosed subject matter provides thin films of composite materials where the films are as thick as about 1 millimeter. Thus in some embodiments the films can be about 1000 about 950 about 900 about 850 about 800 about 750 about 700 about 650 about 600 about 550 or about 500 microns thick.

In some embodiments the film can be biaxially or uniaxially stretched. The stretching can be performed by any suitable method e.g. mechanically or manually. In some embodiments the stretching can be done with a commercial film stretching machine. The stretching can be performed using hot circulated air e.g. at between about 120 C. and about 150 C. . Stretching of the films below the matrix melting point can allow polymeric chains to orient. For example in PEN containing composite films or other naphthalene containing polymer composite films strain induced stacking of naphthalene units can be obtained much like a single crystal. Such stacking of naphthalene units can increase the energy transport efficiency of the matrix. Addition of excitation harvesting luminescent molecules in stretched films can increase the net quantum yield of the composite as compared to an unstretched film.

In some embodiments the films or stretched films can be thermally annealed. Any suitable annealing technique can be used e.g. free annealing taut annealing etc. In some embodiments the films are thermally annealed for example between about 150 C. to about 180 C. e.g. about 150 155 160 165 170 175 or about 180 C. using confined conditions using a ring or free annealing. Annealing the film can increase light yield when the film is used as a scintillator due to an increase in crystallinity of semi crystalline polymer matrix materials such as but not limited to polyethylene naphthalate PEN .

In some embodiments the film comprises a polymer composite comprising about 70 by weight PEN about 25 by weight LiF nanoparticles and about 5 weight of a fluor or fluor mixture i.e. PPO POPOP .

Films of the presently disclosed subject matter can have a neutron count rate per mg of Li of between about 4 and about 12 counts per second cps e.g. about 4 4.5 5 5.5 6 6.5 7 7.5 8 8.5 9 9.5 10 10.5 11 11.5 or 12 cps . In some embodiments the neutron count rate per mg of Li is above that of a commercially available lithiated glass detector i.e. GS20 available from Applied Scintillation Technologies Ltd. Harlow United Kingdom . Thus in some embodiments the neutron count rate per mg of Li is above about 6.23.

In some embodiments the film can be prepared by providing a mixture of an aromatic polymeric matrix material a neutron capture agent and a luminescent fluor and hot pressing or extruding the mixture to form the film. In some embodiments providing the mixture comprises preparing micro or nanoparticles of LiF and mixing the micro or nanoparticles with the matrix material and the luminescent fluor e.g. in the desired weight ratios .

In some embodiments the apparatus is free of a low level discriminator LLD and or can distinguish between neutron and gamma radiation without the use of a LLD.

The polymer composite can be in the form of a film a molded coupon a fiber or a fiber mat. In some embodiments the polymer composite in is the form of a film. In some embodiments the film is biaxially or uniaxially stretched and or thermally annealed.

In some embodiments the method comprises the use of a suitable detector or detectors optically coupled to the polymer composite for producing an electrical signal in response to emission of light from the composite. Thus in some embodiments the method comprises using a photon detector in combination with the polymer composite. Suitable photon detectors include but are not limited to photomultiplier tubes photodiodes CCD sensors and image intensifiers.

One particularly useful type of radiation detection is pulse shape discrimination PSD . As used herein PSD refers to discrimination between light emission caused by neutron radiation and light emission caused by gamma radiation based on a difference in pulse shape between photodetection signals from a photodetector i.e. signals of light emitted by a scintillator material in response to radiation and detected and converted to an electronic signal by a photodetector . A pulse shape of a photodetection signal can refer to a peak shape from occurrence of light emission to decay thereof in a graph with time plotted on the horizontal or x axis and magnitude amplitude of the signal plotted on the vertical or y axis. PSD is based on the fact that decay time of light emission caused by neutron radiation is longer than decay time of light emission caused by gamma radiation. By using the difference in decay times for thermal neutrons and gammas and using suitable algorithms for PSD analysis to discriminate neutron gamma events and obtain high count rates with excellent neutron gamma rejection for example smaller than one in one million as currently targeted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security neutron detection can be performed with very low false positives in an environment with high gamma rays background.

In some embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter average neutron pulse shape can be different from average gamma pulse shape. As shown in generally the pulse shape for each type of radiation has a steep component and a tail component. The steep component relates to light produced by polymer composite scintillator material relatively soon or immediately after the radiation exposure. This light can be referred to as prompt light. The tail component relates to light produced over a period of time which can be referred to as delayed light. As seen in the tail component for the neutron pulse shape is larger than that for the gamma pulse shape.

Modern high speed waveform digitizers allow for separation of neutron and gamma pulse shapes giving rise to rapid characterization of PSD properties. More particularly in some embodiments a pulse shape can be numerically integrated over two time intervals e.g. and corresponding to the prompt and delayed light components of the pulse shape respectively. The ratio of the charge integrals for the two time intervals i.e. prompt delayed also referred to herein as the PSD parameter indicates whether the considered event was likely produced by a neutron small PSD parameter value e.g. below about 2.5 or a gamma ray large PSD parameter value e.g. above about 2.5 . The determination that a PSD value is small or large can depend on e.g. the type of PMT used and thus is desirably adjusted depending upon the apparatus used. Also since pulse shape can vary depending upon apparatus configuration it can be desirable that the values of the integral ranges be experimentally checked and adjusted before measurements.

In some embodiments the presently disclosed subject matter provides a method for detecting neutron radiation wherein the method comprises discriminating between neutron and gamma radiation using PSD. Thus in some embodiments the presently disclosed subject matter provides a method for detecting neutron radiation wherein the method comprises providing a polymer composite according to an embodiment of the presently disclosed subject matter e.g. a polymer composite comprising a matrix material comprising at least one aromatic polymer or copolymer a neutron capture agent comprising a Li compound distributed within the matrix material and an organic or inorganic luminescent fluor distributed within the matrix material disposing the polymer composite in the path of a beam of radiation wherein the matrix and the luminescent fluor of the polymer composite emit light when the composite absorbs said radiation and detecting neutron radiation by detecting the light emitted by the composite wherein the detecting discriminates between neutron and gamma radiation. The detecting can comprise detecting the light emitted by the composite to provide a photodetection signal and processing the photodetection signal using PSD.

Thus in some embodiments the presently disclosed subject matter relates to preparing a mixture e.g. a solid powder mixture of a matrix material e.g. a partially polymerized resin or resin mixture of an organic polymer copolymer or polymer blend or polymerizable monomers for the polymer matrix material a neutron capture agent e.g. micro or nanoparticles of a neutron capture agent and an organic or inorganic luminescent fluor e.g. a luminescent activator and or a wavelength shifter and hot pressing or extruding the mixture to form a film or a thick coupon wherein the neutron capture agent and luminescent fluor are distributed within the matrix material e.g. non covalently encapsulated within pores in the polymer matrix . Suitable extruders include but are not limited to randcastle extruders. Processing conditions e.g. process zone temperatures feed rate die slit arrangements and opening size take off rate downstream cooling etc. can be adjusted to increase the degree of crystallinity and optical clarity.

In some embodiments the matrix material is powdered e.g. using a high speed grinder prior to mixing with the neutron capture agent and the luminescent fluor. In some embodiments the mixture is ground in to a powder e.g. using a high speed grinder and sieved and or blended e.g. in a vortex mixer or by stirring or shaking mechanically or manually to obtain a homogenous mixture. In some embodiments the mixture is sieved through a 500 m or smaller sieve e.g. through a 500 450 400 350 300 250 200 150 100 50 m or smaller sieve .

In some embodiments the neutron capture agent is LiF micro or nanoparticles that are 3.2 microns or smaller in diameter. The LiF micro or nanoparticles can be provided for example by titrating Li enriched lithium hydroxide with hydrofluoric acid to precipitate LiF particles and collecting the precipitated particles e.g. by vacuum filtration . The collecting can also include washing e.g. with water the particles to remove impurities and or drying the particles.

In some embodiments the neutron capture agent is LiF nanoparticles that are about 200 or about 100 nm or smaller. The LiF nanoparticles can be prepared by pulverizing larger LiF particles e.g. LiF particles that are about 0.5 to about 10 microns or about 1 to about 3 microns in size . The pulverizing can be performed by for example by ball milling e.g. cryo ball milling the larger LiF particles for a period of time e.g. between about 10 to 20 hours to achieve the desired size reduction.

In some embodiments pressing and heating the mixture comprises heating the mixture to a temperature of between about 260 C. and about 300 C. e.g. about 260 270 280 290 or 300 C. . In some embodiments the film can be stretched e.g. uniaxially or biaxially . The stretching can be performed manually or mechanically. In some embodiments the stretching is performed using a commercial film stretcher. In some embodiments the stretching is performed at a temperature between about 120 C. and about 150 C. e.g. at about 120 125 130 135 140 145 or 150 C. . In some embodiments the film can be thermally annealed for example at a temperature between about 150 C. and about 180 C. e.g. at about 150 C. 155 C. 160 C. 165 C. 170 C. 175 C. or 180 C. . The annealing can increase the crystallinity of the composite.

In some embodiments the film can be prepared by solution casting a solution comprising the matrix material the neutron capture agent and the luminescent fluor. In some embodiments the solution comprises THF DMF chloroform or mixtures thereof. In some embodiments the presently disclosed subject matter relates to a microwave based high pressure volumetric heating process to obtain LiF distribution within a polymer matrix by completely dissolving LiF and a polymer fluor system in a common solvent. In some embodiments the solution cast film can be stretched biaxially or uniaxially and or thermally annealed.

The following Examples have been included to provide guidance to one of ordinary skill in the art for practicing representative embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter. In light of the present disclosure and the general level of skill in the art those of skill can appreciate that the following Examples are intended to be exemplary only and that numerous changes modifications and alterations can be employed without departing from the scope of the presently disclosed subject matter.

In a vial with a septum and a stir bar 4 4 9 fluorenylidene diphenol 1.2615 g 3.6 mmol is dissolved in THF 8 mL and pyridine 0.6 mL 7.2 mmol is added. The vial is sealed evacuated using an aspirator and refilled with argon. This evacuation and refilling is repeated two more times. In a separate vial with a septum terephthaloyl chloride 0.7308 g 3.6 mmol is dissolved in THF 3 mL . The vial is sealed evacuated and refilled with argon like above. While stirring the diol solution is heated to 65 C. and the acid chloride solution is added drop wise with a syringe over about ten minutes. The mixture is then allowed to stir for an additional hour. Upon cooling the polymer mixture is dropped into vigorously stirred methanol 120 mL . The precipitated polymer is then suction filtered and dried in a vacuum desiccator. White polymer is obtained. A typical yield is 70 to 80 .

Methacryloyl chloride is dissolved in THF in a vial with a septum and a stir bar. The vial is evacuated and refilled with argon three times. Equimolar amounts of an alcohol or thiol and pyridine dissolved in THF are added dropwise with a syringe to the methacryloyl chloride solution. The solution is stirred for one hour and or until formation of the vinyl monomer with ester linked side group is complete e.g. as determined by thin layer chromatography or by gas or liquid chromatography . A solution of azobisisobutyronitrile AlBN in THF is then added to the vial with a syringe to initiate polymerization and the solution is heated overnight at a temperature of 70 to 80 C. The polymer is then precipitated in methanol filtered and dried.

Solutions containing varying amounts of poly 2 vinylnaphthalene P2VN Polymer Source Inc. Dorval Quebec Canada and LiSal in 1.5 mL anhydrous THF were placed under vacuum to remove dissolved air and stored under an argon atmosphere. Films were cast in a glove bag in a dry nitrogen atmosphere. THF was evaporated and the films dried in a vacuum at 50 C. to remove any residual solvent. Translucent films about 46 mm in diameter with thicknesses ranging from 85 to 110 microns were obtained. Some phase separation was detected by optical microscopy which showed what appeared to be LiSal domains separated within the P2VN matrix. It is also possible that pores formed in the polymer matrix during solvent evaporation. It is expected that broadening the molecular weight distributions of the polymer to include shorter chains as plasticizers and or limiting the thickness of the cast films can reduce phase separation and pore formation.

Thin film samples 110 microns thick of equal weight and composition of P2VN and polyvinyl toluene PVT doped with 25 weight LiSal but without additional fluor were prepared as described above for P2VN films. Thin films can be exposed to radiation flux using acrylic and cadmium cylinders as described in Sen et al. 58 3 1386 1393 2011 . Superior light output was observed with the P2VN based detector. Pure P2VN and PVT films without LiSal were exposed to the same radiation flux and did not show any scintillation response. There were no major changes in P2VN fluorescence spectra of samples that were held under nitrogen as compared to air equilibrated samples indicating that the detectors were stable to oxygen.

Films having equal total weight 200 mg but different weight of LiSal and different thicknesses were prepared and subjected to thermal neutron flux. See Table 1 below. The best composition based on relative light output observed was 25 weight LiSal.

To increase the thickness of the detectors multiple layers of films were stacked. Each film had a composition of 22 weight LiSal and 2 weight of an additional fluor 9 9 9 9 9 9 hexakis octyl 2 7 2 7 tetrafluorene i.e. ADS038FO from American Dye Source Inc. Baie D Urf Quebec Canada . The composite films had an emission peak at 420 nm matching the emission peak for the fluor when excited with 270 nm light demonstrating efficient energy transport and migration from naphthalene to the fluor. The decay time for the film was 3 ns matching the decay time of the fluor. The net neutron response for stacking up to four films is shown in Table 2 which includes comparative data from a 2 mm lithiated glass scintillator GS20 Applied Scintillation Technologies Ltd. Harlow United Kingdom .

As can be seen from Table 2 neutron sensitivity of GS20 is an order of magnitude higher as compared to the composite films. However without being bound to any one theory it is believed that this is due at least in part to the matrix being an amorphous polymer and the composite being opaque. The light output of the composite films was comparable to GS20.

Polyethylene naphthalate PEN pellets available from Goodfellow Corporation Oakdale Pa. United States of America were ground to powder with a commercial grinder and sieved through a 150 m sieve. The PEN powder was mixed with ADS156FS dye American Dye Source Inc. Baie D Urf Quebec Canada and LiF nanopowder for 10 minutes in a vortex mixer. Circular samples were pressed within kapton sheets in a hot press at 300 C. providing films of 50 mm diameter and varying thicknesses. SEM imaging of the films showed a featureless surface while dark field microscope imaging indicated that the LiF particles were non agglomerated and fairly well distributed within the PEN matrix at 35 weight loading.

Scintillation measurements were made using three sample composite thin film detectors comprising 25 weight LiF 74 weight PEN and 1 weight ADS156FS dye and compared to measurements taken using a 2 mm thick lithiated glass disc scintillator GS20 Applied Scintillation Technologies Ltd. Harlow United Kingdom . Scintillation measurements were performed as described in Sen et al. 2012 vol. 59 4 1781 1786 . The net thermal neutron count rate for a 220 m thick 480 mg PEN composite film was 505 counts per second cps while that for a 150 m thick 375 mg PEN composite film was 426 cps that for a 66 m thick 120 mg PEN composite film was 74 cps and that for the glass disc scintillator was 498 cps. Thus the composite films had comparable count rates to GS20. The responses of the films to alpha beta and gamma radiation were also determined. There was a lack of a Compton edge on the gamma spectrum for the films. Without being bound to any one theory this lack is believed to be due to secondary electrons not depositing their energy in the film as the Compton electrons are escaping the thin film.

There was separation between the neutron and gamma spectra for the sample films providing the potential for discrimination based on pulse height. The neutron efficiency and count rates at various gamma efficiency pulse height discriminator levels are shown in Table 3 below for the 150 m thick film and in Table 4 below for the 66 m thick film.

PEN was purchased from Goodfellow Corporation Oakdale Pa. United States of America . The ADS156FS luminescent molecule chemical formula CHOS American Dye Source Inc. Baie D Urf Quebec Canada was used to increase the quantum yield of the composite and selected based on its high quantum yield resonance energy transport ranges and resistance to luminescence quenching in the presence of moisture. Pure PEN resin had an excitation maximum at 258 nm and an emission peak at 430 nm. The decay times for pure PEN were 6 ns and 19 ns. ADS156FS has an absorption peak at 382 nm photoluminescent maximum at 432 nm and decay time of 3 ns.

PEN chips LiF nanoparticles and ADS156FS were mixed in a weight ratio of 49.5 49.5 1 PEN LiF ADS156FS ground into a powder in a high speed grinder sieved through a 150 m sieve blended in a vortex mixer for ten minutes to obtain a homogeneous blend and dried in vacuum at 110 C. The mixture was weighed and formed into a film on a hot press at 280 C. at 1.7 10Pascal Pa . For comparison PEN chips alone were subjected to grinding sieving blending and drying and also formed into a pure PEN film using the hot press.

The pure PEN and composite films were biaxially stretched by 1.5 1.5 on an AccuPull laboratory biaxial film stretcher Inventure Laboratories Incorporated Knoxville Tenn. United States of America which drew the film simultaneously in the machine direction MD and the transverse direction TD in a single step. Stretching can cause orientation of the polymer chains in the direction of the stretch and improve the crystallization of the film. Circular samples 50 mm in diameter were cut for analysis. The thicknesses of the films were as follows unstretched pure PEN film 75 microns biaxially stretched pure PEN film 43 microns unstretched composite PEN film 150 microns biaxially stretched composite PEN film 41 microns.

Emission and excitation spectra of the film samples were characterized on a Hitachi F4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer at a voltage of 400 volts and slit of 2.5 mm. Transmission spectra of the film samples were characterized on a Cary WinUV spectrophotometer. The alpha beta gamma and neutron response of the film samples were characterized and scintillation measurements were made as described in Sen et al. 2012 vol. 59 4 1781 1786 . Alpha beta gamma and neutron response for the pure and composite PEN films were measured at 1200V. A GS20 glass disc scintillator Applied Scintillation Technologies Ltd. Harlow United Kingdom having a diameter of 25 mm a thickness of 2 mm and a mass of 2.461 g was used for comparison.

The biaxially stretched composite PEN films appear to be more luminescent in UV light than unstretched pure PEN or biaxially stretched pure PEN films. The transmission spectra of the pure and composite films showed that UV light is strongly absorbed below 380 nm. Unstretched pure PEN film had a high optical transmittance between 50 and 80 in the visible region and the film appeared translucent. Stretched pure PEN film has optical transmission between 63 and 69 in the visible region. Biaxially stretched composite PEN films had no transmission. This lack of transmission is believed to be due at least in part to very high loading of LiF which is opaque and also causes light scattering which could not be detected by the small detector of the instrument . All three films appeared translucent under natural light. Biaxially stretched pure PEN film was the most transparent as it had a lesser thickness than the unstretched pure PEN film and did not contain LiF.

Unstretched PEN film which is amorphous emits fluorescence. See . The emission spectra are mirror images of absorption spectra of PEN and fluorescence occurs from the lowest energy level of the singlet excited states. The fluorescence peak at about 380 390 nm of the pure PEN film spectra is assigned to monomer fluorescence because of its coincidence with that of dimethyl 2 6 naphthalate whereas the peak around 420 430 nm was assigned to be excimer fluorescence because the excitation spectrum monitored at 430 nm coincided with that for the monomer fluorescence.

Emission spectra of unstretched PEN film and biaxially stretched PEN films excited at 310 nm show peaks at 434 436 nm whereas biaxially stretched composite PEN films excited at 310 nm show peaks at 466 468 nm. See . The fluorescence spectrum of naphthalene shows emission at 323 nm and 335 nm. The high energy charged reaction products can excite electrons in the aromatic group of the polymer matrix of the scintillation detector and can generate secondary electrons. It appeared that the PEN excimers can have an excited level corresponding to the emission peaks of 434 436 nm. The excitons can either produce photons directly through excimer emission or can harvested by the luminescent molecules that concomitantly emit photons at a longer wavelength than the polymer matrix.

Excitation spectra of unstretched PEN film and biaxially stretched PEN films observed at 430 nm show absorption band peaks at 285 286 nm and 375 379 nm whereas biaxially stretched composite PEN films observed at 430 nm show two absorption band peaks one at 287 nm and second band peaks at 372 nm 400 nm and 427 nm. See . The fluorescence spectrum of naphthalene showed excitation at 266 nm 275 nm and 285 nm.

The absorption band peaks of biaxially stretched composite PEN films are shifted toward longer wavelengths because of the presence of wavelength shifting fluor. The absorption peaks correspond with the excitation peaks. The peak with a maximum at 413 nm and two shoulders at 392 nm and 430 nm is attributed to the fluorescence of an excimeric configuration of the PEN molecule. PEN can exhibit a low rate of intersystem crossing of the monomeric unit. See Cheung et al. 24 1809 1830 1979 .

Thermal neutrons interact with Li and produce charged particles and triton with kinetic energy sufficient to excite the aromatic units of the PEN of the scintillation detector. The energy released as kinetic energy during neutron capture by Li is split into 2.73 MeV for the triton and 2.05 MeV for the particle. The neutron count rates of the PEN films are presented in Table 5 below and the neutron count spectra are shown in . The count rates for stretched and unstretched composite films were compared to that of a 2 mm thick lithiated glass scintillator GS20 Applied Scintillation Technologies Ltd. Harlow United Kingdom . The choice of amplifier time constant determines the degree of charge collection from the tube. Time constant of 2 s or greater resulted in nearly complete charge collection and yield spectra. The unstretched composite PEN film with a mass of 521 mg had a count rate of 265 cps whereas the stretched composite PEN film with a mass of 76 mg had a count rate of 62 cps. The GS20 had a count rate of 442 cps. A significant increase 60 in the count rate per mg Li was observed for the stretched composite film as compared to the unstretched composite film. The count rate per mg Li of the stretched composite film was found to be higher than that for GS20.

Without being bound to any one theory a scintillation detector with high crystallinity is believed to be capable of capture of higher incident high energy particles to generate a greater number of photons. The efficiency of singlet singlet energy transfer given in steady state experiments depends for example upon excitation energy which is brought into the neighborhood of the luminescent molecule singlet level by the naphthalene singlet band luminescent molecule polymer fluorescence ratio excitation exchange interactions the lifetime the luminescent molecule polymer energy difference the temperature and system defects and impurities. See Argyfukis and Kopelman 51 9 16 1980 . A crystal provides a highly efficient energy transport system to luminescent molecules as it has fewer defect sites or imperfections in the lattice. Defect sites or imperfections can act as traps for the annihilation of excitons. See Ratnera et al. 486 463 470 2002 . The luminescent molecules within the presently disclosed polymer matrix can harvest the resonant energy transferred RET from excited naphthalene molecules and emit photons. RET depends upon the degree of spectral overlap distance and the orientation of transition moments between the luminescent molecule and the polymer. See Andrews 86 855 870 2008 .

A broad neutron peak for unstretched composite PEN film was observed at approximately 3000 whereas a broad neutron plateau was observed for stretched composite PEN film. An unstretched film had a thickness of 150 m and is thick enough to capture the energy deposited by charged reaction products but the stretched composite PEN film had a thickness of 41 m which is less than the range of charged reaction products. So it is believed possible that the charged reaction products do not deposit the full energy in the stretched film. The energy deposited by charged reaction products within the crystals is efficiently transported by luminescent molecules which produced net radioluminescence response with lower pulse height deficit.

Neutron gamma discrimination curves for unstretched and stretched composite PEN films are shown in . The stretched composite PEN film showed better discrimination. The effect of energy deposited by gamma and charged particles became clearly separable leading to thermal neutron discrimination because of the lower thickness of the stretched composite PEN film. The low pulse height from gamma ray events can be due to secondary electrons that are knocked off by gamma rays to escape thin detectors. The stretched composite PEN films appear to have low susceptibility to gamma induced scintillation and thus can be effective discriminators for thermal neutrons. At low LLD settings the electronic system is paralyzed by the processing of low amplitude noise while at high LLD values the count rate decreases due to the loss of neutron detection events. Based on if the LLD is set at 3000 for the stretched composite PEN films neutron gamma discrimination can be established and yields the possibility of discrimination based on pulse height. However suitable LLD settings can vary depending upon the gain used for a given PMT scintillation material composition and attachment settings.

Pulse height spectra were obtained by exposing the unstretched and stretched pure and composite PEN films to alpha Am beta Cl and gamma Co particles. See respectively. The photoelectron yield is the number of photoelectrons created at the photocathode of the PMT. The total number of the counts in the photopeak can be calculated from the area under the spectral curve in the photopeak zone. The light yields of various PEN films are provided in Table 6. All values are scaled to 1200 V 50 G. The GS20 Co measurement reported is the Compton edge.

The stretched composite PEN film had about 30 higher light output than unstretched composite PEN film. See . Stretched film samples were approximately one fourth as thin as unstretched composite PEN films so the alpha particles were not able to deposit on the stretched films as much. However as the stretched composite PEN film had higher crystallinity which results in more efficient energy transport to luminescent molecules it generated a higher number of photons as compared to unstretched composite PEN film.

Stretched composite PEN films have low alpha to beta ratio and hence neutron gamma discrimination. The low gamma ray sensitivity can be due to the high thermal neutron capture cross section the large 4.78 MeV energy of the reaction products and the thinness of the detectors. Thicker PEN films have more interactions than the thinner PEN films. Photopeaks were observed at less than 500 keV by the film samples as the secondary electrons at higher energy had greater probability to escape without deposition of energy in the 41 to 150 micron film samples.

Compton scattering was observed for unstretched composite PEN films and was absent in the case of stretched composite PEN films. Lack of Compton scattering can be attributed to non deposition of the energy of the electrons in the thinner stretched composite PEN films. The broadness of the photopeaks can also be due to the thin samples or from an increase in the transfer resolution due to the optical transmission of the sample. Pulse height spectroscopy of a thicker unstretched composite PEN film sample yielded a smaller photopeak suggesting that light yield was significantly degraded due to poor light propagation in the sample. Scattered light trace out a longer distance and therefore will be attenuated to a greater extent in the presence of impurities and quenching.

Unstretched and stretched pure as well as composite PEN films embedded with LiF and a wavelength shifting luminescent molecule were fabricated. The stretched composite detectors effectively discriminate between thermal neutrons and gamma radiation due at least in part because the film samples were thin in some embodiments having a thickness of 41 microns . Low atomic number components have low susceptibility to gamma induced scintillation and thus are effective discriminators for thermal neutrons. The effect of energy deposited by gamma and charged particles became clearly separable leading to thermal neutron discrimination because of the higher degree of crystallinity in the scintillation detector. Stretched composite PEN films have low alpha to beta ratio and hence neutron gamma discrimination due to higher crystallinity. A 60 increase in the count rate per mg Li was observed for the stretched composite film as compared to the unstretched composite film. The count rate per mg Li of stretched film was found to be higher than that for a Li based transparent glass detector GS20 . The stretched composite PEN film had about 30 higher light output than unstretched composite PEN film. The energy deposited by charged particles within such oriented molecules is efficiently harvested by luminescent molecules which produced net radioluminescence response with lower pulse height deficit.

The dried purified LiOH was dissolved in de ionized water by vigorous stirring at about 350 to 400 rpm for about 30 to 60 minutes. Once dissolution was complete the LiOH solution was treated with a solution of hydrofluoric acid HF according to the equation LiOH HF HO LiF The resulting liquid was then poured into a cold acetone bath and subsequently filtered. All reactions were performed in TEFLON E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Company Wilmington Del. United States of America beakers to avoid silicon impurities in the final product. The acetone mixture was vacuum filtered through a 1 m filter paper. The filtrate was collected and retained while the filtrant was allowed to dry. The filtrate was then passed through a 450 m filter paper. The resulting filtrate was allowed to dry.

Resulting LiF particles were subjected to cryo ball milling for 10 to 20 hours to provide nanoparticles of very small sizes i.e. less than 100 nm .

Composite films were prepared by mixing about 25 weight of the LiF nanoparticles about 70 weight PEN and about 5 weight PPO POPOP and then blending the mixture in a vortex mixer to obtain a homogenous blend. The homogenous blend was dried in a vacuum. The dried blends were weighed and formed into cast composite polymer films.

Unstretched cast composite films UCFs were post processed by different technologies. In particular the UCFs were annealed at 150 C. to provide processed composite polymer films PCFs . Circular samples of 50 mm diameter size were cut from the UCFs and PCFs for further characterization.

Tables 7 and 8 below show the impact of post processing on neutron count rate and brightness. For comparison with the UCFs and PCFs data is also provided for a 2 mm commercial lithiated glass scintillator GS20 Applied Scintillation Technologies Ltd. Harlow United Kingdom . An increase of between 70 to 90 in neutron count rate above gamma LLD and a 40 increase in brightness was observed for the PCFs compared to the UCFs. Neutron count rate above gamma LLD for the PCFs was three to five times higher than that for GS20. Without being bound to any one theory it is believed that the post processing provides increased crystallinity in the composite films which can increase their efficiency in detecting thermal neutrons and in neutron gamma discrimination.

An additional thicker 490 microns cast composite film comprising 70 weight PEN 25 weight LiF nanoparticles and 5 weight PPO POPOP was prepared. The film was cut into two inch diameter samples. One sample was post processed via thermal annealing as described above. Both an unstretched non annealed sample UCF 490 microns and the post processed sample PCF 490 microns were characterized for neutron and gamma response. See . See also Table 9 below. For comparison results for the commercial lithiated glass scintillator GS20 2100 microns thick are also shown. Both composite samples had a mass of 1.02 g while the glass scintillator had a mass of 2.47 g.

Polymer composite nanofibers can be prepared as follows. Briefly a solution of high molecular weight PS M 10as determined by gel permeation chromography and P2VN M 1.2 10 was prepared in anhydrous THF DMF 4 1 v v by mixing the polymer and solvents 3 weight by volume PS and 2 weight by volume P2VN and heating the mixture to 75 C. for 90 minutes until a homogenous solution was obtained. A solution of the high molecular weight PS 3 weight by volume was prepared in anhydrous CHCl DMF 17 3 by mixing the polymer and solvents and heating the mixture to 75 C. for 90 minutes until a homogenous solution was obtained. To the PS P2VN solution was added LiSal 13.5 weight in polymer and anthracene 7 weight in polymer . To the PS solution was added LiF 20 weight in polymer and PPO POPOP 8 weight in polymer . The polymer solutions were electrospun using 3 mL and 5 mL syringes having 16.5 gauge for the PS solution and 23 gauge for the PS P2VN solution needles. A metering pump delivered polymer solution through the syringe to the tip of the needle. A direct current high voltage power supply was used to apply voltage 16 kV 18 kV to the needle producing a jet toward a grounded collector.

For characterization by energy dispersive X ray scanning electron microscopy or scanning electron microscopy the fibers were coated with gold using a sputter coater. The fibers had diameter size distributions between 200 and 1400 nm. The fiber distribution and average fiber diameter 505 nm of the LiF PS fibers were slightly narrower and smaller than the fiber distribution and average fiber diameter 515 nm of the LiSal PS P2VN fibers. Without being bound to any one theory it is believed that an increase in polymer concentration can increase the average nanofiber diameter while the dielectric properties and surface tension of the solution solvents can influence the phase morphology and fiber dimensions. In one larger diameter fiber micron size crystals approximately 3 microns were observed distributed within the PS fibers.

The excitation emission behavior of fiber mats of the LiF PS and LiSal PS P2VN nanofibers were studied. The LiF PS nanofiber mat had an excitation peak at 280 nm and an emission peak at 420 nm with a Stokes shift of 140 nm. The LiSal PS P2VN nanofiber mat had an excitation peak at 313 nm and an emission peak at 432 nm with a Stokes shift of 119 nm. The emission curve of the LiSal PS P2VN nanofiber mat had a single peak corresponding to the emission of anthracene indicating efficient intermolecular energy transport.

The samples were tested under irradiation with alpha beta and gamma sources using a neutron irradiator containing acrylic and cadmium cylinders to obtain a net thermal neutron response as described in Sen et al. 58 3 1386 1393 2011 . The LiSal PS P2VN nanofiber mat had clear distinction of thermal neutrons. See Young et al. 134 010908 2012 . Although the neutron response was not as large as for GS20 the nanofiber mat had a significantly lower loading of Li was thinner and had a smaller net weight. Neutrons were not detected for the LiF PS fiber mats. Without being bound to any one theory this is believed to be due to quenching of light and to micron sized domains scattering light within the samples. The fiber mats did not yield appreciable light response using alpha beta or gamma rays. This was expected due to the small amount of neutron absorbing material in the mats.

The pulse shape discrimination PSD characteristics of the presently disclosed polymer composites were examined. A sample of a polymer composite film of the presently disclosed subject matter i.e. a 200 micron thick 25 mm diameter film of a polymer composite comprising 70 weight PEN 25 weight LiF particles having a size range of 200 to 400 nm and 5 weight PPO POPOP wavelength shifting fluor was mounted with optical grease to the photocathode of a Hamamatsu R6233 100 PMT Hamamatsu Photonics K.K. Hamamatsu Japan . The sample was separately exposed to radioactive sources of sufficient strength to overwhelm background radiation rates to permit the separate examination of gamma and neutron related response. Pulse height spectra were calculated and anode pulse shape was examined for PSD properties. A Struck SIS3305 waveform digitizer 5 gigasample per second GSPS 200 picosecond per sample Stuck Innovative System GmbH Hamburg Germany was used to collect the pulses resulting from the interaction of composite scintillator film with thermal neutrons or gamma rays. Examination of pulse shape differences for gamma and neutron response in the sample was conducted by comparing statistically averaged waveforms from specific pulse height regions. To avoid time smearing effects in the statistical averaging of the waveforms a few thousand waveforms were averaged together in each region to construct separate gamma related and neutron related waveforms. Gamma related waveforms corresponded to 4 000 to 10 000 in pulse height sum. Neutron related waveforms corresponded to above 60 000 in the pulse height spectrum. Results are shown in . PSD parameter was calculated as the ratio of prompt to delayed integrated charges as outlined in D Olympia et al. 714 121 127 2013 . The PSD parameter was plotted against the pulse height sum as shown in . As indicated in the use of the PSD parameter increased neutron gamma discrimination without the need for a pulse height only based LLD.

It will be understood that various details of the presently disclosed subject matter may be changed without departing from the scope of the presently disclosed subject matter. Furthermore the foregoing description is for the purpose of illustration only and not for the purpose of limitation.
