The details of one or more aspects of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features aspects and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description the drawings and the claims.

Countless risks associated with identities may be present in transactions being conducted on a daily basis. With the advent of the Internet comes the age of e commerce in which on line transactions may replace face to face transactions. The sheer volume and complexity of these on line transactions may give rise to a digital world fraught with peril including for example identity theft identity fraud spoofing phishing etc. Notably such risks may not be new in the Internet age although the Internet may have amplified such risks. As the society moves towards cloud computing more and more identity databases may become available. Identity data in some databases may be more reliable and robust than others based on history or tradition. In some implementations identity data in identity databases administered by a department of motor vehicles DMV may be leveraged to verify an identity of a recipient party engaged in for example a financial transaction. Additional identity databases may provide collaborative confirmation attesting to the authenticity of a purported identity. Some implementations as disclosed herein may provide servers and engines to power an integrated identity management system in which the servers or engines act in concert with each other to verify the authenticity of an identity. For example the system may provide access control so that a consumer can prescribe the parties authorized to verify the identity of the consumer as well as the scope of the authorized power. The envisioned identity management system may include fee for service arrangements to enforce business rules for accessing to the system. For example business may purchase a subscription plan that provides various levels of access with a commensurate fee. The identity management system may provide application interfaces to interconnect with other identity management systems to extend services to consumers and providers. At the same time consumers and providers may opt in or opt out of the system. Deployment of the integrated identity management system may enhance confidence in the transactions being conducted between parties and hence promote commerce.

As shown in data request may represent a transaction request submitted by a user in the capacity of a consumer. The consumer may include an individual consumer or an organizational entity. Example organizational entities may include a corporation a bank a government agency etc. The transaction request may be submitted at a variety of places including for example a financial institution a merchant a service provider a government agency etc. Indeed the Internet may allow a consumer to conduct virtually all commercial business and social transactions on line.

The requested on line transaction may access data owned by the recipient of the request. The recipient of the requested on line transaction may include financial institutions merchants service providers as well as government agencies. Example financial institutions may include any organization engaged in financial transactions banks securities brokerage firms trust administrators retirement plan administrators college saving plans administrators etc. The recipient merchant may include any vendor attempting to sell merchandise on line. The recipient service provider may include any entity that charges a fee for a service including for example accounting firms consulting firms etc. The recipient government agency may include any government agency or commission at the state or federal level including for example social security agency unemployment agency taxation agency department of human and health services and its state counterparts department of motor vehicles etc.

In response to the received data request the recipient entity may conduct a due diligence verification to determine the trustworthiness of the submitted transaction request. The due diligence verification may include verifying that the user submitting the transaction request is the person he or she purports to be. The due diligence verification may also include verifying whether the transaction requested is permissible between the recipient entity and the user. Unless the due diligence verification proves that the submitted transaction request is trustworthy the recipient entity may not allow access to the data being requested.

To conduct the due diligence verification of a received transaction request the recipient entity may submit inquiries to the disclosed identity management system. In submitting the verification inquiries the recipient entities become participant entities in the identity management system. Pictorially the participant entities are represented by data request originators 1 to 5 shown in . For each transaction request received at data request originators 1 to 5 inquiries may be submitted via respective interfaces to transaction authentication engine TAE . The inquiries may elicit respective responses from the TAE regarding a trustworthiness disposition of the requested transaction.

For the TAE to process the submitted inquiries from data originators 1 5 the respective data owner may provide discrimination methods for the TAE . The discrimination methods may enable context dependent processing of the transaction request for which the trustworthiness is being investigated. In some configurations the trustworthiness investigation may be performed in accordance with varying threshold level requirements that are commensurate with the character of the underlying transaction trust level of each electronic proof of identity as well as the custom policies of the participant entities managing the data targeted by the transaction being requested. For example discrimination method may include threshold level of the transaction amount to trigger increased scrutiny. As an illustration financial transaction over the amount of 500 may automatically trigger increased scrutiny and if the amount is over 100 000 then more than one source may be consulted to verify the identity of the requestor. Such discrimination method may correspond to the discrimination layer illustrated in the hierarchy in .

Thus TAE may function as an infrastructure apparatus to determine whether the transaction request is sufficiently trustworthy for the recipient entity to process the requested transaction.

The determination of trustworthiness of the transaction request may incorporate validating electronic proof of identity accompanying the submitted transaction request. The electronic proof of identity may be compared against an identity database during the validation process. In general the identity proof may become available only after a vetting process at an authoritative institution such as the department of motor vehicles DMV the state department etc. The vetting process may additionally comply with legislative directives such as the REAL ID Act or the PASS ID Act to boost secure identity documentation. Examples electronic proof of identity may include a digital identification document such as for example a digital driver s license a digital passport a digital social security card a digital medicare Medicaid card etc. The electronic proof of identity may also include a biometric in digital form such as an electronic signature a digital finger print a digital palm print a digital iris scan a digital retina scan or even a DNA digitally captured. The electronic proof of identity may be subject to additional encryption for example by the holder s private key to further prevent tampering. Moreover revocation or replacement of lost stolen electronic proof of identity may be instantly effective at the identity database of the authoritative source. Hence lost stolen electronic proof of identity can be recognized during verification once the authoritative source has been updated. As a result possession of a verifiable electronic proof of identity may establish a prima facie showing that the holder is the person identified by the electronic proof of identity.

The next layer is the access methods layer . The access methods layer generally refers to a work flow including protocols for verifying for example the electronic proof of identity identity databases to compare against as well as user authorization of business partners to query an identity database to verify the user s identity. As disclosed herein access methods layer may be interchangeably referred to as the work flow layer .

The next layer is the access policies layer which generally includes macroscopic and microscopic policies for participant entities to query an identity database. The access policies may include a subscription status of a particular participant entity to query a specific identity database usage metering of a particular participant entity to query a specific identity database accounting for accessing a specific identity database by a particular participant entity load balancing of servers associated with querying a specific identity database etc.

In one configuration an authentication policy server may host a database to track the subscription status of participant entities. Depending on the underlying identity databases the subscription database may include the current subscription status of a particular participant entity. The current subscription status may reflect the levels of access to a particular identity database that a participant entity has paid for. For example participant entities may pay for a regular access that provides a monthly access quota. The regular access may include a labeled access bandwidth guarantee that may include i a floor level of the number of queries to the identity database submitted within a quantum of time such as for example per minute or ii a floor level of the number of responses received from the identity database per quantum of time such as for example per minute.

In comparison a basic access may include a labeled access bandwidth guarantee that includes i a ceiling level of the number of queries to the identity database submitted within a quantum of time such as for example per minute or ii a ceiling level of the number of responses received from the identity database per quantum of time such as for example per minute. Not surprisingly the subscription fee is reduced for basic access.

Similarly a premium access may be a step upward from the regular access. For example the premium access may include a labeled access bandwidth guarantee with higher floor levels in the number of queries to the identity database submitted by the paying participant entity or higher floor levels in the number of responses to be received by the paying participant entity from a particular identity database.

In a way the labeled access bandwidth guarantee may be similar to advertised access bandwidth as provided by cable or phone companies. Indeed the labeled access bandwidth guarantee may be listed in such metrics as the amount of information or data to or from a particular identity database for each payment level. In short the participant entities each get what they paid for. A non paying participant entity may not have the identity management system to submit query to the identity database and may not receive responses from the identity database either.

The level of access may be measured in metrics other than a mere bandwidth. For example the level of access may also be measured in throughput terms. The throughput terms may track the total amount of information e.g. number of bytes transmitted between a participant entity and an identity database. The throughput terms can be more fine grained than the total data in bidirectional communication. For example the throughput terms may include the number of queries or the amount of data encoding such queries submitted by a participant entity to an identity database the number of responses or the amount of data encoding such responses received by a participant entity from an identity database etc. Hence the level of access according to some implementations disclosed herein may be measured in terms similar to the metrics adopted by water sewage gas or electricity companies.

Moreover the level access may include duration of connection time. Connection time may include the period of time during which a participant entity is engaged in actual communication with an identity database. The connection time metrics may be enforced by simple timers installed on the authentication policy server . The connection time metric according to some implementations may resemble the metrics used by phone companies or internet caf . For example if an access plan according to some implementations may allocate a time quota for a paying participant entity to access the identity database during a peak time for example between 9 am and 5 pm local time where the identity database. During off peak time however the paying participant entity may be given more time quota to communicate with the identity database. In some instances the paying participant entity may even communicate constantly during off peak time much like unlimited access during off peak time as used by certain phone companies.

To enforce a subscription plan the authentication policy server may meter the usage of a particular database by counting the number of queries transmitted to the identity database the amount of data transmitted to the identity database in association with the queries the number of responses received by the participant entity the amount of data received from the identity database in association with the responses to queries.

Participant entities may choose a plan based on actual usage. Actual usage of a particular participant entity may be determined by metering as discussed above. Based on the metered usage accounting may be performed to determine a monetary cost to the particular participant entity. For participant entities on a plan with a cost quota the determined monetary cost may be compared against the quota in real time as the queries and responses are being communicated back and forth. When the cost incurred from actual usage approaches the cost quota an alert may be sent to the participant entity to inform the entity of the status. If the cost incurred reaches the quota and no additional subscription payment is received from the participant entity the participant may no long receive service from the transaction authentication engine .

The next layer is the database trusted source layer which may correspond to authenticated verification engine AVE in some implementations. AVE may interface directly to identity databases maintained at authoritative sources. The identity data layer may correspond to databases . As shown in the identity databases administered by authoritative sources such as a government agencies. A government agency mandated to provide service to individual citizens may be an authoritative source in maintaining an identity database hosting identity information of the individual citizens being served. Example government agencies may include the Department of State the Department of Homeland Security US Citizenship and Immigration Services the Department of Health and Human Services the Internal Revenue Service the Social Security Administration the Department of Motor Vehicles at each state etc. Sovereign nations other than the US may have comparable agencies or administrations or commissions that function similarly to the US counterparts in serving individual citizens.

Moreover identity database could be from a non government authoritative source. As illustrated in third party trusted system may house additional identity databases which may be queries by AVE . In some implementations third party trusted system may include non government entities that may be trusted by history or tradition in serving consumers. Example non government entities may include quasi government agencies such as professional organizations of individual members and membership may require a thorough application process to check the applicant s background e.g. credit history employment history educational background criminal record etc. . Example professional organization may include the American Bar Association the state bar of each jurisdiction a professional trade association a professional sport association an alumni association etc. Example non government entities that may house identity databases may additionally include financial institutions with a long history of serving average consumers such as mortgage institutions banks credit unions credit card companies etc. More recently on line social networking entities may also house identity databases with a qualified degree of authority. Such on line social networking entities may include LinkedIn MySpace Twitter Facebook etc.

The identity data stored in databases and third party trusted system may be acquired after a vetting process corresponding to acquisition methods layer . The vetting process for a government entity may include a lengthy application process to verify an applicant s identity. For example when applying for a driver s license a state DMV typically require the applicant to present a valid driver s license from another jurisdiction or a valid passport or a valid permanent resident card. The applicant may be further required to provide proof of residence including utility bills cable bills phone bills etc. to show that the applicant indeed resides in the intended jurisdiction. Sometimes the applicant may need to provide proof of employment as well. The applicant may be additionally required to pass vision test or a driving test. Once the applicant has passed the tests biometric information identifying the applicant may be taken from the applicant including for example a portrait of the applicant a finger print of the applicant a signature of the applicant etc. Other personally identifiable information such as hair color eye color blood type birth date etc. may also be collected from the applicant. The vetting process may include authenticating the applicant and performing background check on the applicant. Successful completion of the vetting process may establish a prima facie presumption of the applicant s identity as recorded in the identity database.

As to the non government entities housing identity databases a comparable vetting process may be instituted to establish a prima facie presumption of the member s identity. For example profession organizations may require applicant to complete a thorough screening process before the applicant can be admitted as a member. Additionally annual membership dues and compliance with professional conduct may be required to maintain membership. The screening process along with membership obligations may filter out unqualified individuals or members not in good standing. In doing so the trustworthiness quality of the identity data of the active members may be maintained.

User may desire to engage in a transaction with participant entity . The transaction may be a financial transaction such as transferring funds between financial accounts making on line payments viewing account balance etc. The transaction may be administrative such as for example updating contact information updating residential address updating employment history updating employment status updating insurance coverage information updating educational background etc. The transaction request may be submitted in a variety of ways. The transaction may be submitted on line through a computer of user or a mobile device of user . The transaction request may also be submitted at a branch office of the participant entity e.g. a financial institution a government agency etc. and may be processed by a machine apparatus at the branch office e.g. a kiosk an automatic teller machine etc. 

User may include an individual user an organizational user e.g. a corporation a non profit organization a government agency etc. . Participant entity may be any entity subscribing to the integrated identity management system as disclosed herein. Participant entity may include a business entity e.g. a person a corporation a partnership a sole proprietary etc. a non profit entity e.g. professional organizations educational institutions etc. a government entity e.g. a government entity at the state or federal level etc. .

The requested transaction may attempt to access data managed by the participant entity . When participant entity receives the transaction request participant entity may need to authenticate that user submitting the request is who user purports to be. In the Internet age simple authentication based on user name and password may not suffice with the advent of Cloud computing and the trend towards the Big Data. In fact simple on line identities including user name and password may be subject to identity theft and identity fraud. A recent survey revealed that identity theft in the United States rose to a three year high in 2012 with more than 5 percent of the adult population or 12.6 million people falling victim to such crimes. The numbers are up from 4.9 percent in 2011 and 4.35 percent in 2010. The incidence of identity theft is only expected to rise. To mitigate the risks arising from identity theft in the context of e commerce some implementations as disclosed herein function towards an integrated identity management system in which participant entities as subscribers may leverage the identity information at identity databases located elsewhere. A vetting process may be in place as a gatekeeper to allow verified identity information of individual users to enter the identity databases. For example by history and tradition identity databases at the Department of Motor Vehicles may serve as the authoritative source of identity information because the identity information in the identity database of the DMV have been verified and validated during the background checking and on site application process. The ubiquitous internet may provide a unique opportunity to leverage the authority of identity information in the identity database to validate user submitted transaction requests.

As illustrated in participant entity may submit a request to validate . The request to validate may be submitted at the transaction authentication engine . The request to validate may be submitted by participant entity in response to a transaction request received from user . The purpose of the request to validate is to get an opinion as to the trustworthiness of the transaction request as submitted by user . To reach a disposition on the trustworthiness as requested TAE may conduct two inquiries. First whether the user submitting the transaction request is indeed what user purports to be. Second whether participant entity is entitled to submit the request to validate.

TAE may submit the first inquiry to authentication verification engine . The first inquiry may include identity information of user . Such identity information may be obtained from user when submitting the transaction request at participant entity . In some implementations user may present an identification document at the time of submitting the transaction request. For example user may show a driver s license to a reader device such as a scanning device attached to a mobile device of the . Other forms of identification document such as a passport a national identification card a social security card a medicare Medicaid card etc. The identification document may also be a digital identification document issued by a government agency through the same rigorous vetting process. The digital identification document may or may not be scanned by a reader device. In some implementations data encoding the digital identification document may be beamed to a reader device. In some implementations data encoding the digital identification document may be received along with the transaction request at the participant entity . Watermarking features may be present in the identification document to deter counterfeiting or tampering.

AVE may interface to an authoritative identity database such as an identity database at a department of motor vehicles the state department the social administration the department of human and health services etc. AVE may submit a query to identity database in an effort to compare the identity information of user against identity database . AVE may compute an authenticity score indicating the relative authenticity of the identity information of user . In other words the authenticity score may numerically attest to the identity of user . Query results may be received from identity database. In some implementations a 1 to 1 mapping result may be returned from the identity database in response to the query. The query results may also be relayed by AVE to TAE along with the computed authenticity score.

Either subsequently or concurrently TAE may submit a second inquiry at authentication policy engine to ascertain whether participant entity is entitled to submit the request to validate. APS may maintain a database to track the subscription status of each participant entity. If participant entity has not subscribed to the service or if the participant entity has an expired subscription then participant may not have the currency to support the request to validate. Moreover the database at APS may also include the subscription plan for each subscribing participant entity. As discussed above the subscription plan may impact the time and manner in which a participant entity may access a particular identity database. Furthermore APS may enforce a set of business rules for each subscribing participant entity. For example a participant entity may only submit request to validate and access the identity database during specified times from specific IP addresses etc. The business rules may prescribe the scope of services that each participant entity may obtain from a particular identity database. APS may enforce the business rules.

Based on the subscription status of the participant entity and the prescribed business rules associated with the participant entity APS may compute a validity score for the participant entity to access the identity database. By submitting the request to validate a transaction request participant entity may attempt to access a particular identity database. In response to the second inquiry submitted by TAE to APS the computed validity score may be returned to TAE . The validity score may reflect numerically the relative degree of validity for the participant entity to access the identity database when the participant entity requested TAE to for example verify the identity of the user requesting a transaction at the participant entity.

Based on the computed authenticity score and the validity score TAE may reach a disposition on the trustworthiness of the transaction request. The determination may also factor in the specific query results received from the identity database in response to the submitted query. The disposition results may be relayed to participant entity . If the disposition of trustworthiness is favorable then participant entity may proceed with the requested transaction and provide user with the transaction results . If however the disposition of trustworthiness is not favorable then participant entity may not proceed with the requested transaction. Instead participant entity may provide an error message to user indicating that the requested transaction failed to go through.

In an example TAE according to some implementations may receive from a participant entity a request to determine a trustworthiness of a transaction request . As discussed above the transaction request may be submitted by a user in an attempt to access data managed by the participant entity.

In response TAE may submit a first inquiry at an authentication verification engine AVE to determine an authenticity status attesting to a purported identity of the user . Thereafter TAE may receive a response from AVE . The response may include a computed authenticity score indicative of the relative authenticity of the purported identity of the user.

In some implementations based on the computed authenticity score TAE may determine the trustworthiness of the transaction request being submitted by the user . For example when the participant entity merely seeks a second identity proof of user at an identity database and participant entity has access right to eventually query at the identity database then a response from TAE either confirming or refuting the user s identity may be sufficient. An example scenario may be when user submits a transaction request to purchase alcohol from participant entity . In addition to take payment for the alcohol product local regulations may require participant entity to confirm that user is indeed over for example 21 years of age. An identification document of user may be presented by user along with the transaction request. The identification document may include for example a driver s license a passport a national identification card etc. The transaction request may include an on line transaction request. A copy of the identification document may be may be forwarded to the TAE . In turn TAE may query identity database through AVE based on the identification document. If query results confirm that the identification document is authentic and has not been tampered with and that user is over 21 years of age AVE may return a full authenticity score to TAE . TAE may subsequently determine that the transaction request is trustworthy as submitted by user . Thereafter TAE may notify the participant entity of the determined trustworthiness of the transaction request .

Similar example scenarios may include the purchase of guns controlled substances etc. In these example scenarios identity databases may be queried to ascertain whether user as the requestor may have criminal record that may impact the requestor s ability to buy such items. Example identity databases to be queried may include for example the registered sex offender registry.

Generally the authenticity score may amount to a matter of degree of confidence as to the authenticity of a purported identity. The requisite authenticity score may vary depending on the application underneath. For example for transactions involving a financial sum of under 500 a lower degree of match authentication level may be sufficient. While for applications involving any purchase of controlled substances a higher degree of confidence may be needed.

In some implementations TAE may submit a second inquiry at authentication policy engine APS to determine a scope of right possessed by the participant entity to access a particular identity database . As discussed herein the participant entity may attempt to verify the user s identity by querying for example through AVE an identity database as an authoritative source. Subsequent to submitting the second inquiry TAE may receive a reply from APS . The reply including a computed validity score indicative of the scope of the right to access the particular identity database.

TAE may also receive query results from a particular identity database for example through AVE in accordance with the scope of right for the participant entity to access the particular identity database. The query results may be in response to a query about the identity of a user submitting a transaction request at the participant entity. APS may administer business rules to regulate the manner in which such query results may be received by TAE . These business rules may be entity specific and may be at various granularity levels. In one configuration the business rules may have special provisions for insurance companies to access a user s medical history. Some business rules may limit query results in response to queries on employment history to employment data of the user during the past three years. Other business rules may prescribe the quantity of received query results depending on when or where queries are submitted. For example during busy times the prescribed quantity may be more limited. If the queries are submitted from geographically more distant addresses the query results may be more limited in content or quantity.

In implementations where the TAE submits a second inquiry to APS to determine a scope of right possessed by the participant entity the second inquiry may be submitted simultaneously along with the first inquiry or sequentially. The second inquiry may be submitted ahead of the first inquiry and if participant entity is not entitled to use the integrated system to query a particular identity database the first inquiry may not need to be submitted. In return for the submitted second inquiry TAE may receive a computed validity score from APS . TAE may make a determination of trustworthiness of the transaction request being submitted and may factor in both the authenticity score and the validity score in the determination.

After making the determination TAE may notify the participant entity of the determined trustworthiness of the transaction request . If the determination is unfavorable TAE may also notify participant of the reasons behind the unfavorable determination including for example subscription expired quota exceeded etc.

The contents of the query results when received at TAE may be considered by TAE during the determination of the trustworthiness of the transaction request. As discussed the determination may also factor in the authenticity score quantitatively attesting to the purported identity of the user submitting the transaction request as well as the validity score indicative of the right possessed by the participant entity to use the integrated identity management system to verify the identity of the user. For example user may submit a transaction request to obtain a homestead tax exemption in the jurisdiction to which user is transferring. In the illustrative example the transaction request may be submitted at the department of taxation of the jurisdiction which may operate in the capacity of participant entity . The department of taxation may use the integrated identity management system to query for example an identity database at the DMV of the jurisdiction to ascertain the current residential address of user . TAE may coordinate the verification process by submitting an inquiry at AVE which may interface with an identity database administered by the DMV of the jurisdiction. Through coordination of TAE AVE may submit query into the identity database at the DMV. The returned query results may be forwarded by AVE to TAE . In determining the trustworthiness of the requested transaction to obtain an tax exemption status TAE may review the residential address as returned from the DMV identity database to ascertain for example whether user may qualify for the applied for exemption status whether user has been residing for any requisite time whether the address is within an exemption zone etc. Thus the determination on the trustworthiness of the exemption status application as requested may hinge on the combined factors of the query results the authenticity score and the validity score. The results of the trustworthiness may be returned to the department of taxation along with the residential address from the query results. In some cases TAE may query DMVs of several jurisdictions to obtain a residential history of user . The trustworthiness determination may factor in the entire residential history. The department of taxation receiving the homestead status application may receive both the trustworthiness determination and the residential history.

In another illustrative example user may request a transaction to bid for a job opening at a hiring employer. User may submit a proof of identity such as for example an identification document along with the job application. In this illustrative example the hiring employer be it a private corporation or government entity may operate in the capacity of participant entity. Hiring employer may use the integrated identity management system to query for example an identity database at the department of labor to obtain the employment history of user . If the obtained employment history matches the data as disclosed by user as the applicant full credit of trustworthiness may be issued by TAE . If however the obtained employment history does not match the data disclosed by user the trustworthiness determination may become more nuanced. In some cases if there are undisclosed gaps in the employment history from department of labor then the trustworthiness determination may become unfavorable. In some cases if the discrepancies appear as minor spelling variations the trustworthiness may be considered intact. In some cases when the trustworthiness becomes difficult to determine then TAE may cause the AVE to submit further queries at other identity databases such as for example income tax record at the internal revenue service or an equivalent foreign agency such as Revenue Canada . Income tax record such as W2 forms or 1099 forms for user may be obtained from the taxation agencies as a surrogate of the employment history data. If the income tax record as the returned query results can demonstrate that user has paid income taxes commensurate with the disclosed employment history data during the questionable years then the trustworthiness of the application may still receive almost full credit. If no commensurate tax record may be found in the returned query results the trustworthiness may be deemed low. As discussed herein the determined trustworthiness and the query results returned from one or more identity databases may be communicated to user .

In some implementations the received query results may be stored temporally at TAE . The temporary storage may amount to a form of caching such that TAE may look up the temporarily stored query results before querying through AVE the particular identity database. The temporarily stored query results may be accessed in accordance with the business rules regulating the scope of access right as discussed above. Further the business rules may allow a participant entity to use the temporarily stored query results for a specific time period during which the temporarily stored copy may be considered current as compared to stale . Moreover TAE may institute caching policies to coordinate with the particular identity database regarding updates in the identity data for user . For example TAE may establish an update status list for the identity data for each user queried before. TAE may then receive a notification from the particular identity database when the identity data for one of the listed user has been updated.

Further TAE may obtain an authentication policy from the authentication policy engine functioning as a server. The authentication policy may govern communication between the transaction authentication engine and the authentication verification engine. For example the authentication policy may include prescribed communications protocols between TAE and AVE as well as between AVE and identity database . The communication protocols may be session specific or subscription dependent. TAE may then configure and set up the agreed on communication protocol to engage in data communication with AVE and through AVE to identity database . For example TAE may configure the communication protocol according to the subscription of the participant entity. In other words TAE may enable a participant entity to obtain as much as access to database through AVE as the participant entity has paid for. Furthermore TAE may set up the encryption protocol to transmit data from TAE to AVE as well as the decryption protocol to decode data received from AVE .

Turing to an example flow char for AVE is shown. AVE may receive from TAE an inquiry regarding a user submitting a transaction request to access data managed by the participant entity . The inquiry may include information identifying the user. AVE may gather the information identifying the user . For example to gather the information from the transaction request AVE may call a method individually encapsulated in the transaction request. The encapsulation may mitigate the risk for AVE or other components of the integrated identity management system to leak the identifying information even inadvertently. The encapsulation may be consistent with for example object oriented programming OO paradigm and may be implemented in a variety of programming languages such as for example JAVA C or any scripting language with compatible with the OO paradigm. AVE may then receive a return value as a result of calling the method and the information identifying the user may be retrieved from the return value.

The information identifying the user may include information encoding a biometric of user such as for example a finger print a palm print a written signature etc. The information identifying the user may also include personally identifiable information of user . Example personally identifiable information may include name birth date address height weight eye color hair color marital status etc. Information identifying the user may also include user name and password pair for user to access an on line account. Information identifying user may be obtained from an identification document of the user. In some implementations user may attach a copy of an identification document along with the transaction request. The attached identification document may include a copy of the driver s license scanned by a reader device when user was submitting the transaction request. In one configuration the attached identification document may include a digital identification document such as for example a digital driver s license. Information encoding the digital identification document may be beamed in when user was submitting the transaction request.

Based on the information identifying the user AVE may construct a query to verify an identity of the user who has requested the transaction . AVE may then submit the query to a particular identity database in communication with AVE . As disclosed herein the identity database may be administered by an authoritative source such as the department of motor vehicles the department of state etc. Each of the authoritative sources may administer a rigorous vetting process to check the background of an individual before the identity data of the individual can be entered into the identity database. In some implementations third party identity databases may be resorted to. These third party identity databases may have a qualified degree of authority. For example social networking sites like Facebook or Linked in may have an identity database for each user. Identity data in these databases may be less reliable than comparable identity data maintained at traditionally authoritative sources such as the DMV. Identity data in less reliable identity databases may be treated with more scrutiny.

AVE may then receive a reply from the identity database in response to the query . In some implementations the reply may be a 1 1 mapping in which the top match is returned. In other implementations the reply may be a 1 n mapping in which the top n matches are returned.

Based on the received reply AVE may compute an authenticity score quantitatively attesting to the identity of the user who has requested the transaction . AVE may then provide the computed authenticity score useful for determining a trustworthiness of the transaction request.

When engaging a particular identity database AVE may configure a protocol for communication with the identity database. In some implementations the protocol may be determined by an authentication policy governing data access rights by participant entity at the identity database. The authentication policy may be administered by APS of the integrated identity management system as disclosed herein. Each participant entity may purchase a subscription plan to the integrated identity management system. The subscription plan may cover an authentication policy. In some implementations AVE may configure the protocol for communication according to the authentication policy as purchased by the participant entity. The authentication policy may cover communication between the AVE and a particular identity database. The detailed protocols may include a encryption component as well as a decryption component. AVE may configure a first protocol component for encrypting data being transmitted from the AVE to the particular identity database. Concurrently AVE may configure a second protocol component for decrypting data being received by the AVE from the particular identity database. AVE may further maintain parameters of the identity database by configuring component fields of identity data of users admitted into the identity database through a vetting process. Additionally AVE may manage based on the protocol attributes corresponding to the component fields of the identity data. Subsequently AVE may configure in accordance to the protocol access to the component fields of the identity data stored at the identity database. Furthermore AVE may configure the protocol for communication with an identity database provided by a government entity. As noted herein the government entity may administer a vetting process to perform background check of the user before the corresponding identity data of the user is entered into the identity database. AVE may additionally configure the protocol for communication with an identity database provided by a third party entity different from a government entity and the participant entity. As disclosed herein identity database maintained by third party entities may serve as a surrogate identity database. To the extent that identity data in such third party identity database may not be as reliable as identity data in traditionally authoritative identity databases identity data in such third party identity databases may be treated with additional scrutiny. Examples of such third party identity database may include databases maintained by social media enterprises such as for example Linked in or Facebook.

Turning to an example APS according to some implementations is being shown. As illustrated APS may receive from a transaction authentication engine an inquiry regarding a participant entity attempting to verify an identity of a user . As disclosed here in user may be submitting a transaction request at the participant entity .

Based on the received inquiry APS may gather information identifying the participant entity . The information identifying the participant entity may be embedded in the inquiry received. In some implementations the information identifying the participant entity may be obtained from the transaction request being ascertained for the trustworthiness. TAE may indicate the identifying information to APS with no need for retrieval or extraction.

Based on the information identifying APS may determine an authentication policy for the participant entity to verify the identity of the user. This authentication policy may apply to all users who may submit transaction request at participant entity . In other words this authentication policy may be a systematic policy for a particular participant entity and may not vary with regard to the identity of each individual user who may interact with particular participant entity.

Based on the determined authentication policy APS may compute a validity score for the participant entity to verify the identity of the user . As discussed herein the validity score may depend on a valid subscription status. For example participant entity may need a current subscription to the integrated identity managements system in order to receive a passing validity score.

Additionally the subscription may be qualified in terms of the manner in which participant entity may access the integrated identity management system the components thereof identity databases in communication to the integrated identity management system or as discussed herein similar or sibling identity management system in communication thereto. As an illustration the authentication policy may provide an access plan for participant entity to use for example transaction authentication engine of the integrated identity management system. The access plan may provide for example a time quota a bandwidth quota or a throughput quota for participant entity to submit requests to validate to the transaction authentication engine . In accordance with provisions of the subscription plan the time quota the bandwidth quota or the throughput quota for the participant may vary as a function of when the requests to validate are being submitted e.g. peak time or off peak time where the requests to validate are being submitted e.g. more proximal or more distal to the transaction authentication engine etc.

Moreover the available subscription plans may depend on the nature of the business conducted by participant entity . As an illustration insurance companies may never obtain records of certain medical tests for any individual patient. For example legislative directives in many jurisdictions may not allow insurance companies to access results of genetic tests. Likewise federal HIPPA The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 regulations may prohibit healthcare providers from disclosing medical information of individual patients especially when the medical information may be sensitive.

Furthermore subscription plans may prescribe the extent to which identity information may be accessible during a verification activity. As an illustration some subscription plans may reveal only the last four digitals of the social security number for verification purposes within transaction authentication engine . Likewise some subscriptions plans may only disclose the street number or zip code of where user resides without revealing the entire residential address.

The validity score may be computed in accordance with the subscription status of entity . APS may then provide the computed validity score to TAE for TAE to determine a trustworthiness of the transaction request submitted by the user at the participant entity. As discussed herein in determining the trustworthiness of the transaction request TAE may factor in other considerations such as for example authenticity scores attesting to the purported identity of the user or query results from identity databases.

Notably APS may log verification activities requested by the participant entity based on the received inquiry . Logging may be a book keeping activity to keep a record which may be used for a variety of purposes such as for example auditing. APS may then analyze the logged verification activities to determine a usage by the participant entity. The verification activities may refer to any activity taking place anywhere in the integrated identity management system or any identity database in connection with the integrated identity system. As an illustration APS may log queries to access an identity database as part of the verification activities requested by the participant entity . As noted herein the queries may be submitted by AVE to a particular identity database. The queries may be submitted to verify or obtain identity data. APS may analyze the logged queries to determine the usage of the identity database by the participant entity. In some implementations APS may further profile the logged queries to determine a pattern of usage of the identity database by the participant entity.

Based on the determined usage of for example the identity database APS may perform accounting to determine a use fee to be charged to the participant entity for accessing the identity database. In some implementations APS may perform accounting by measuring in terms of the number of queries submitted to the identity database on behalf of the participant entity. The accounting may also be measured in terms of the number of responses sent to the participant entity in response to corresponding queries. In some implementations the accounting may be performed to measure the data amount transmitted or received. For example the accounting may measure an amount of data sent by AVE to query the identity database on behalf of participant entity . Similar the accounting may also be measured by the amount of data received at AVE on behalf of participant entity from the particular identity database. Based on the determined usage APS may provide feedback information to enable load balancing for any component of the integrated identity managements system or a particular identity database in communication with the identity management system. For example the load balancing may be applied on AVE when submitting future queries to the particular identity database.

When computing the validity score APS may compare the determined usage of for example the identity database by the participant entity with the authentication policy of the participant entity. Inconsistencies between the determined usage and provisions of the authentication policy may cause a reduction of the validity score. Additionally APS may provide an administrative interface to report the determined usage to a human administrator. The reported usage may provide feedback information to elucidate the reasons behind a validity score.

Interestingly APS may also provide an application program interface through which APS may extend service for the participant entity to access other identity databases different from the particular identity database. More specifically the application program interface may allow APS to communicate with other authentication policy engines different from APS to access the identity database serviced by those authentication policy engines. Conversely the application program interface may also allow the other authentication policy engines to access the particular identity database access to which is being logged by APS .

APS may administer an access right that is systematic for a particular participant entity to submit inquires about the identity of users. The users may be requesting transactions to access data managed by the participant entity. A concern may arise about self initiated queries by a participant entity. In particular the participant entities may engage in spoofing activities to query the identity information of users who may not be requesting a transaction with the participant entity in the first place. Such spoofing activities may lead to unwarranted accesses to identity databases. In certain cases repeated polling of an identity database at a credit agency may negatively impact a user s credit score. In other cases intensive and indiscriminate polling of a particular identity database may lead to slower responses from the identity database for genuine queries. In other words unwarranted accesses to the identity database could amount to a denial of service attack for legitimate queries to verify user identities. Generally speaking the concern of unwarranted access to identity database may be a privacy concern. Each user may have an arguably reasonable expectation of privacy of his or her identity data as stored in an identity database at the DMV. To address the privacy concern a validated individual engine VIE may be introduced to administer an access right that is specific for a particular participant entity to submit queries to verify a particular user s identity. In other words the VIE may implement an access right control at an individual level rather than a systematic control as administered by APS .

A user may submit a transaction request at a relying party. The relying party may include for example a financial institution a healthcare provider an insurance carrier a merchant. In the context of relying party serving the user s transaction request the user may also be known as the requesting party. The transaction request may include for example a request to access an account managed by the relying party. In some instances the account may include a financial account and the access may include monetary withdrawal. The transaction request may also include for example a request to download media contents from a storage facility managed by the relying party. In some instances the transaction request may be accompanied with credential information of the user such as for example a password a personal identification number PIN an encryption key or a digital certificate of the user.

The relying party may rely on the identity resources within a federated system of transaction authentication and verification. Generally a relying party may include a participant entity who has for example subscribed to a service of a federated system including the transaction authentication engine the authentication policy engine and the authentication verification engine . In other words the relying party may rely on the providing party within the federated system. By way of illustration when the verification request from the relying party is received by the providing party the providing party e.g. owner keeper of the identity information checks login transaction credentials against a database in order to determine access eligibility and then returns results of the verification request to the relying party. Within the above context the providing party may be the most attractive location for launching on line attacks and thus can be the most likely root cause of identity thefts.

Implementations of perishable symbology may enhance confidence that i a user submitting a transaction request is the person he or she claims to be and ii the user is authorized to engage in the requested transaction at the time of submission. is a diagram showing an example process flow for using perishable symbology to foil for example replay attacks or spoofing attempts.

In some implementations to determine the trustworthiness of the submitted transaction request the relying party may submit a verification request to transaction authentication engine . This request is for the relying party to tap into the resources of a federated system so that database information from discrete identity databases can be leveraged. In the context of on line authentication in a distributed network environment a common theme of attack includes replay attacks or spoofing attacks in which the attacker attempts to reuse a captured message between the parties in later communications with the attacker assuming a forged identity.

In some implementations data characterizing the transaction requested may be generated at transaction authentication engine. The data characterizing the transaction may be unique to the transaction request. Such characterizing data may include for example identity of the requesting party network and geographical origination of this party identity of the providing party network and geographical origination of this party tokenization data from the participating parties including the requesting party and the providing party type of transaction amount of transaction time of transaction origination permitted time window for communication requests acknowledgement timestamp of the data access the actual payload data and accompanying metadata of payload network carrier identity and routers repeaters and their locations that handle the transaction information and communication and security protocols used to enable the communication. The time stamp can be a unified time stamp within the federated system. In some implementations the time stamp may originate from a network time server within the federated system running a network time protocol NTP . By incorporating one or more of these associated characteristics the chances of the characterizing data of two underlying transactions to be the same are greatly reduced. In some instances the characterizing data can be smaller or substantially smaller in size than the transaction request or the underlying transaction. For example the characterizing data for a transaction request to download a large media file would be a fraction of the size of the media content. In one instance the characterizing data may be known as the pre transactional characteristics. In this context the characterizing data may also be referred to as metadata. The metadata can support the authenticity of the transaction request. The different types of data that could be captured to support the transaction would merely have to be unique. Each data element on its own would not be considered individually identifiable but altogether might provide better definition of its authenticity

The characterizing data is devoid of source assets of the transaction. Source assets of a transaction within this disclosure generally refer to the information used for identifying a user such as the credential information manifested by a password a PIN a security word a digital certificate or an encryption key.

In one instance the characterizing data is generated in the form of machine readable data for example symbology data. Example symbology may include a QR code a 1 D bar code or a 2 D bar code. In this instance the symbology data may be pushed to a transaction database engine . Once stored at transaction database engine this symbology data may be retrieved on a limited time basis to effectively foil spoofing or replay attacks. In one instance the symbology data may be retrievable only once for verification and once retrieved the symbology data may no longer be accessible to a relying party. In another instance the symbology data may be retrievable within a time window and retrieval requests outside the time window may not be honored. For example if a retrieval request is received outside the time window transaction database may ignore the retrieval request. In some instances transaction data base may drop or punt the retrieval request. In other instances transaction database may respond with a message that the record is not available.

Transaction database is accessible for retrieval by transaction authentication engine and authentication verification engine . In some instances transaction database can be collocated with authentication policy engine . In other instances transaction database may be at a location separate from authentication policy engine .

In some implementations transaction authentication engine may wait for confirmation that the characterizing data has been received by transaction database and saved to the database for subsequent access. This wait may be part of a mechanism to synchronize the receipt of the characterizing data as pre transactional characteristics at transaction database with subsequent transmission of data from transaction authentication engine . In this mechanism a time out wait can be implemented so that transaction authentication engine will not wait indefinitely for the confirmation that the characterizing data has been received. In one example authentication engine may retransmit the characterizing data to transaction database when no confirmation is received at authentication engine after the time out period has elapsed. In some instances the retransmitted characterizing data may be different from the earlier transmitted characterizing data because for example the time that the characterizing data is generated has been updated. Noteworthy is that some implementations may incorporate time stamps encoding both the time the verification request has arrived and the time the characteristics e.g. pre transactional are summarized. In fact the configuration of what time stamps to keep can be maintained by software programming and the configuration can affect a formula defining perishability. The time out and retransmission in these instances are implemented at the application level and are supplementary to existing TCP IP retransmission mechanisms.

Thereafter transaction authentication engine may submit an inquiry to authentication verification engine to authenticate that the user submitting transaction request is who he or she claims to be and to verify that transaction requested is permissible between the requesting party and the providing party . The inquiry may include the credential information of the requesting party as well as the characterizing data including the summarized transactional characteristics . The characterizing data is applicable only once to the underlying transaction request.

While verifying that the user submitting transaction request is who he or she claims to be the authentication verification engine may rely on identity data as stored in database of trusted sources . Authentication verification engine AVE may rely on access policies to determine whether the requesting party or the providing party may query an identity database. Access policies may include macroscopic and microscopic policies for participant entities to query a particular identity database.

While verifying the identity of the requesting party by querying identity databases according to access policies AVE may generally verify the credential information submitted in the first inquiry from TAE . In some instances verifying the credential information includes verifying a password a PIN a security word or an encryption. The requesting party for example the user submitting the transaction request at the relying party can prove his or her identity by presenting the credential information that can be verified successfully.

Meanwhile authentication verification engine may verify that the transaction request from the requesting party is a freshly submitted request and not a replay. To this end authentication verification engine may query transaction database per arrow to correlate the inquiry received at the verification engine with characterizing data stored at transaction database . In one instance the inquiry submitted from transaction authentication engine includes the characterizing data. In this instance the characterizing data stored on transaction database can be machine readable data for example in the form of symbology data. In another instance the characterizing data included in the inquiry submitted from transaction authentication engine may also be in the form of symbology data. Retrieval of the characterizing data from transaction database can succeed before expiration and hence the characterizing data is perishable . In some examples retrieval query is allowed only once. This one time use example can render replay or spoofing attacks moot as the characterizing data is single use only. In other examples retrieval query may only be allowed within a time window to enforce freshness of the characterizing data. As disclosed below such characterizing data may be compared to determine the liveness of a transaction request. The characterizing data may also be used to log the transaction requests for forensic analysis.

Successful correlation within the time limit can confirm the summarized characteristics of the transaction thereby validating the transaction request as freshly submitted and not a replay of an earlier submitted transaction request. A transaction request submitted as a replay will have for example a different time stamp at the transaction authentication engine . The different time stamp would lead to different characterizing data. The machine readable data generated and stored per the earlier transaction request would not match the characteristics of the replayed request. If however a replay is launched on arrow to insert characterizing data from an earlier transaction request this characterizing data would not match the summarized characteristics of later transactions and therefore would not confirm the legitimacy of later submitted transaction requests.

In a related note the TAE relying party side and the AVE trusted source side communicate and authorize the transaction. However the APS governs that route request . If the APS is programmed to not permit re use of a particular transaction authorization then a reuse attempt does not get routed. This feature is part of the utilitarian value of perishable symbology to deter spoofing or replay attempts. Perishable symbology provides a manner by which each transaction is unique and segregated by the time of the request. A hacker would need to replicate the timestamp of a transaction and that fraudulent transaction request would have to have the identical timestamp on all components of the transaction validation and verification system through the request workflow which would be very difficult and virtually impossible.

In some instances the characterizing data stored as machine readable data on transaction database may be used to log transaction requests received at transaction authentication engine TAE . The logged entries may be encrypted to further enhance data protection. These logged entries may enable data analytics for example to study consumer behavior on an aggregated level in response to external advertising campaigns. These logged entries may also enable data analytics to track consumer behavior on an individual basis without compromising the credential information of the individual consumer also known as the source assets of each transaction . The statistical analysis on the aggregate level and at the individual level may record number of transaction requests type of transaction requests distribution of the logged transaction request per month per type etc. In time of a breach at transaction authentication engine TAE the logged transaction request in the form of machine readable data stored on transaction database may be used to reconstruct the transaction request received at TAE as well as the sequence in which the transaction requests were received. Such reconstructed sequence of transactions request received may assist in tracing the transpired events that led to the breach. In some instances the machine readable data may include characteristics such as submission time of the transaction requests.

In one example the correlation with characterizing data stored on transaction database may be performed before the verification with identity database . In other words when the characteristics of the transaction may be confirmed first before the access eligibility can be determined. In this example a breach at the authentication verification engine may not expose the identity database . This is because the breach would be revealed based on the comparison pre transactional characteristics and the verification with identity database would not even proceed. Stated in another way the TAE and the AVE are gathering environmental characteristics of an actual transaction which then get stored in the Transactional database. An algorithm uses these characteristics to build a perishable or temporary mark representing that particular and specific actual transaction. If a hacking party tries to use past characteristics to spoof the authenticity the time stamp element of the unique perishable mark flags the replay as possibly fraudulent and does not let the recycling proceed. Furthermore a breach at the transaction authentication engine alone may lead to a more rapid forensic reconstruction of the infarction. This is because the breach would be detected earlier on based on the comparison of pre transactional characteristics. In another example the verification with identity database may be performed before the confirmation with characterizing data stored on transaction database .

In the context of the transaction database in and perishable symbology there is the need to store the computed transactional results of the transaction and presents the stored transactional results as a unique string for purposes of access or forensic audit. The policy server determination results can be used as part of the computation of this unique string hash to characterize the transactional results. As envisioned in the context of perishable symbology the database is not an identity engine like the TAE or AVE but rather a data warehouse to store characteristics which can incorporate symbology data.

If the verifications from transaction database and identity database are both satisfactory according to the access policies that govern the type of transaction between the requesting party and the relying party authentication verification engine may signal transaction authentication engine to proceed with the requested transaction . Otherwise authentication verification engine may signal transaction authentication engine not to proceed with the requested transaction. In some instances if the verifications from either the transaction database or the identity database is unsatisfactory authentication verification engine may choose not to send any signal to transaction authentication engine . In these instances after a time out period transaction authentication engine may retransmit inquires or may treat the verifications as unsuccessful.

Thereafter transaction authentication engine may signal over arrow the relying party to proceed with the requested transaction if the verifications succeeded. Otherwise transaction authentication engine may signal over arrow the relying party not to proceed with the requested transaction. In some instances if the verifications did not succeed the transaction authentication engine may choose not to respond further to the relying party.

As discussed above after a relying party receives a transaction request e.g. from a consumer the relying party may submit a verification inquiry to transaction authentication engine . Before the transaction authentication engine TAE generates the pre transactional characteristics summarizing the transaction request TAE may first inquire at authentication policy server APS to confirm any business relationship between the relying party and the providing parties such as TAE offering the verification service . In particular relying parties as users of the federated eco system may first subscribe to the ecosystem and declare which providing parties they have a relationship with the nature of the relationship e.g. the type of identity data being sought . In some instances this information is stored in a business rules biz rules repository for example associated with access policies . In other instances technical information is also declared e.g. mutually agreed upon communication and authentication protocols and allowable contact windows and stored in a workflow database for example associated with access methods . As illustrated in APS may then confirm each relationship and the terms stored in the business rules repository B . The technical information including protocols can be similarly verified A . When the business rules and work flow information are acceptable and reconciled APS may place the relying party on the cleared list e.g. a whitelist of the providing party such as TAE . When a relying party is on the providing party s whitelist additional verification inquiries from the relying party may be processed automatically and without additional confirmation of the business rules and work flow protocols by APS . On the other hand if elements of business rules or work flow information cannot be verified or is otherwise problematic then the relying party may be placed in a review status for further disposition. This means automatic processing of verification inquiries may be inhibited and additional verification inquiries from the relying party may still be processed by APS confirming the business rules and work flow protocols. When the business rules and specified work flow protocols are satisfied then the transaction request may be processed further within the federated system.

Subsequently transaction authentication engine TAE may push pre transactional characteristics to transaction database . As discussed above the pre transactional characteristics may be in the form of perishable symbology data. Thereafter transaction authentication engine may submit a inquiry to authentication verification engine to authenticate that the user submitting transaction request is who he or she claims to be and to verify that transaction requested is permissible between the requesting party and the providing party . Here APS may play a similar role. Authentication verification engine AVE can confirm any business relationship between the relying party and the providing parties such as AVE offering the verification service . As illustrated in APS may then confirm each relationship and the terms stored in the business rules repository B . The technical information including protocols can be similarly verified A . When the business rules and work flow information are acceptable and reconciled APS may place the relying party on the cleared list e.g. a whitelist of the providing party such as TAE . When a relying party is on the whitelist of AVE additional verification inquiries from the relying party may be processed automatically and without additional confirmation of the business rules and work flow protocols by APS . On the other hand if elements of business rules or work flow information cannot not be verified or is otherwise problematic then the relying party may be placed in a review status which means automatic processing of verification inquiries may be inhibited and additional verification inquiries from the relying party may still be processed by APS confirming the business rules and work flow protocols. When the business rules and specified work flow protocols are satisfied then the transaction request may be processed further within the federated system .

In the above illustration tiers of access rights may be created based on different subscription classifications. Such tiered access rights may then be updated in the business rules repository database. For example in addition to the breach protection discussed earlier other situational protections such a spoof and clock override protections can be added by configuring the APS to authenticate the transaction requests against the pre defined times methods and rules.

In the illustration APS though shown as a single instance proxy may be configured as a federated set of servers or virtual machines synchronized and dedicated to the functional protection of request compliance checking.

Once participant entity has been registered as an authorized business partner of user participant may request the integrated identity management system to validate a transaction request submitted by user at participant entity in a manner consistent with discussions above for example in association with . Work flow illustrated by arrows are similar to work flow illustrated by arrows to .

The following provides an example workflow of signing a mortgage refinance document to highlight nuances that may be introduced by adding VIE to the integrated identity management system. Initially a mortgage institution such as a bank may send a web link to an individual consumer. The web link points to a secure web site for the consumer a homeowner to review the refinance paperwork electronically. In this example the mortgage institution may operate in the capacity of participant entity with the consumer in the capacity of user .

Upon receipt of the web link the homeowner may follow the web link to the secure web site using credential information based on for example the recipient email address. The homeowner may complete the application paperwork and may then prepare to sign. The homeowner may utilize VIE to assist in the signing process. For example the homeowner may have an account at VIE . In logging into the homeowner s VIE account the home owner may present credential information. VIE may run a local query to verify the presented credential information. If the user authentication is unsuccessful the home owner s attempt to use VIE may be aborted. If the user authentication is successful VIE may proceed to provide identity functionalities for the homeowner to sign off the mortgage refinance application. For example VIE may send the transaction request of the refinance application to the bank. The refinance application is now waiting for an e signature of the homeowner. The transaction request may be processed by TAE in communication with the bank. TAE may consult APS to determine for example the subscription status of the bank to use the integrated identity management system or to query an authoritative identity database. As discussed herein APS may administer the systematic right of access for a participant entity such as the bank to inquire about the authenticity of user identities through the integrated identity management system. If the bank has adequate subscription status to verify identities of users then APS may allow TAE to proceed further. TAE may then engage in a dialog with VIE . If the transaction request is originated by user for example if the user submitted the transaction request sua sponte and without directives from participant entity VIE may register the participant entity as an authorized business partner of user . In this particular example the bank initiated the work flow and hence the transaction request in the form of the refinance application may not be deemed to be originated by the homeowner. Instead in this example the refinance application was solicited by the bank. In a situation in which the transaction request is not originated by user for example solicited by participant entity or even faked by participant entity in a spoofing effort then VIE may check the list of authorized business partners to determine whether participant is authorized to use the integrated identity management system to query an identity information for user .

As discussed herein such access control is on an individual level and specific to each user as compared to a systematic control of access right by APS . VIE may return a numerical score indicating the level of authorization possessed by a participant entity with regard to a specific user or even the level of authorization possessed by the participant entity with regard to a specific transaction request from the specific user. For example corporations may have a hierarchical structure. After merger and acquisition activities company A may become a subsidiary of company B. If company A was an authorized business partner of user and company B was not the power of company A may be carried upward to company B per the merger and acquisition agreements. Conversely if company B was an authorized business partner of user and company A was not the power may be carried downward to company A per the merger and acquisition agreements. In cases where merger and acquisition is a result of bankruptcy proceedings the merger and acquisition agreements may provide more qualified carry over of the authorization power. A numerical score may quantify the extent of power carry over in a hierarchical structure that is context specific. In other examples the numerical score may also indicate the attenuation of the authorized power if user provides negative reviews with regard to services or goods received from an authorized business partner of user . If the negative reviews reached a threshold level for example the number of negative reviews or the amount negativity posted the particular authorized business partner may be automatically removed from the list of authorized business partners. Conversely the reduced power may be cured if user posts positive reviews regarding more recent transactions with the authorized business partner.

Additionally VIE may provide a user interface to allow user to register a chosen participant entity as an authorized business partner. The user interface may also allow user to remove a current authorized business partner from the list. In a way the list of authorized users may function as a reverse do not call list as mandated by the FTC to curb unsolicited telemarketing calls.

Notably however the user interface as disclosed herein may allow a user to assert more fine grained access control. For example the user may authorize finance institutions to verify the user s identity with a prescribed set of identity databases. In other words the authorized identity database for a finance institution e.g. an insurance company may include identity databases administered by a DMV but may not include identity databases administered by hospitals. Moreover the user may authorize a particular business partner to access identity data in prescribed format. For example the user may by default authorize the particular business partner to obtain residential address only at the granularity of zip code or at the granularity of city and state without the street address or house number. Furthermore the user may prescribe the type of queries that might be submitted at a particular identity database in order for an authorized business partner to verify the user s identity. For example the user may limit insurance companies to be query only about identity records at hospitals in the past three years. Similarly the user may limit insurance companies to receive responses from identity databases administered by a hospital. For example the received responses may be limited to identity data during the past three years etc. Hence the user interface may enable a variety of individualized access control over the manner in which the particular user s identity data may accessed by authorized business partners.

Based on the request to verify VIE may determine the identity of the user submitting the transaction request . VIE may also determine the identity of the participant entity . The identities of the user and the participant entity may be determined in parallel or in serial.

Based on the determined identities of the user and the participant entity VIE may query a database at VIE . As discussed herein the database administered at VIE may include a list of authorized business partners for the particular user. An authorized business partner is a participant entity that is permitted by the user to query identity data associated with the user. The database may also include more fine grained access control over the manner in which such identity data may be accessed by a particular authorized business parent.

According to results from the querying VIE may determine the authorization status . As discussed herein the authorization status may be determined as a numerical score to indicate the relative power possessed by the participant entity to verify the user s identity. The determined authorization status may be communicated to the participant entity the transaction authentication engine engaged by the participant entity etc.

In some implementations VIE may query the database at the verified identity engine to determine whether the participant entity as an authorized business partner of the user is authorized to engage in the requested transaction between the user and the participant entity. In response to determining that the participant entity as an authorized business partner of the user is authorized to engage in the requested transaction between the user and the participant entity signaling the participant entity to proceed with the requested transaction. In response to determining that the participant entity as an authorized business partner of the user is not authorized to engage in the requested transaction between the user and the participant entity altering the user and the participant entity that the participant entity is not authorized to engage in the requested transaction.

In some other implementations if the transaction request was originally submitted by the user to the participant entity and that participant entity is not yet an authorized business partner of the user VIE may treat the submission as an implied authorization for the participant entity to verify the user s identity. In response VIE may register in the database the participating entity as an authorized business partner of the user. If the transaction request being submitted by the user was solicited by the participant entity VIE may query the database to determine whether the participant entity is an authorized business partner of the user. If the participant entity is not yet an authorized business partner of the user VIE may alert the user that the participant entity is not an authorized business partner. In one configuration VIE may further alert a transaction authentication engine engaged by the participant entity to hold off further processing of the request submitted by the participant entity to verify identity of the user. Similarly if the participant entity is not yet an authorized business partner of the user alerting the user that the participant entity is not an authorized business partner and alerting the entity submitting the request to verify to hold off processing a particular request from the participant entity with regard to the user.

In still some other implementations VIE may provide a user interface to allow the user to register a specific participating entity as an authorized business partner. The user interface may allow the user to configure one or more types of transactions as permissible transactions between the user and the authorized business partner. The user interface to allow the user to configure one or more types of permissible queries submitted by the authorized business partner and directed at a particular identity database.

In yet other implementations VIE may gather information capable of identifying the user as well as information on authorized business partners of the user. VIE may then store in the database at the verified identity engine the identifying information and information of authorized business partners. VIE may gather identity information to attest to a purported identity of the user before granting access to the database at the verified identity engine. Additionally VIE may gather information on permissible queries at a particular identity database by each authorized business partner of the user. Furthermore VIE may also gather information on permissible data responses from a particular identity database to each authorized business partner of the user.

Directory service may include active directory AD service. The directory service may be based on for example Lightweight Directory Access Protocol LDAP . The directory service may generally administer and maintain distributed directory information much like Yellow Pages or White Pages for listing residential address or telephone of each subscriber of the telephone network. The directory service may likewise provide such consumer information as name and address residential and email . The directory service may similarly provide provider information such as vendor name type of business address web site etc. The directory service may also provide links to consumer reviews for a particular vendor opting into the integrated identity management system. In some implementations the directory service may be maintained and administered by the integrated identity management system to include information of participating consumers and subscribing participant entities. In some other implementations the directory service may be administered by an organizational entity for example an academic institution such as a university a research institute a hospital etc. The organizational entity may opt in the integrated identity management system through the application programming interface at for example the authentication policy server APS . Thereafter the employee or student information may be accessible by VIE or APS . Inclusion of the directory service may further improve the amount and quality of the identity data accessible on the envisioned integrated identity system.

In some implementations an individual user may self declare one s identity by utilizing a biometric core platform . Initially the individual user may create a digital abstraction to represent an identity of the individual user. In some instances the digital abstraction may be created to incorporate biometrics of the individual user as well as a series of personal trust. For example biometric can be in a digital form such as an electronic signature a digital finger print a digital palm print a digital iris scan a digital retina scan a digital facial portrait a digital skin texture a vice print a gait characteristic or even a DNA digitally captured. The biometric represents unique personal traits of the individual user which still uniquely describes this individual. In one instance the electronic proof of identity may be subject to additional encryption for example by the holder s private key to further prevent tampering. In another instance a digital biometric may be embedded as digital watermark in a digital portrait of the individual user. In yet another instance one biometric can be embedded in another biometric to provide enhanced authenticity. For example a digital finger print may be embedded as a watermark in the digital portrait of the same individual. In some implementations the digital biometric may be self captured by the individual. For example the digital portrait of the user may be taken by the user himself. By way of illustration after the digital abstraction is created to represent a digital identity of the user the digital identity may be lost or stolen and the individual may revoke the breached digital identity. The revocation can be immediately effective within the federated eco system. Hence lost stolen electronic proof of identity can be readily recognized during verification.

The individual can then declare himself or herself to the ecosystem using validated individual engine VIE to configure access right control to identity databases of the federated ecosystem. In declaring himself the actual biometrics of the individual user may not be stored in the eco system. Only a unique representation of an identity mash up from the individual may be stored.

As illustrated in when the individual user presents a digital identity to VIE VIE may engage APS and databases encoding access methods as well as databases encoding access policies . As noted above VIE implements access right control at an individual level rather than a systematic control as administered by APS . Through a predefined set of negotiations with APS and the appropriate databases the individual user can implement access rights control so that providing parties may obtain commensurate access rights to identity data of the individual user. Transactional elements that are definable may include for example parties with whom the individual has a relationship with primary and alternative locations where ecosystem access is requested performed and transaction characteristics such as defined monetary limits or transaction types that are permitted by certain relying parties and or certain providing parties. In some implementations APS may consolidate the input configurations from VIE and stores the configurations into the corresponding accessible databases. Subsequently when a relying party initiates a verification request regarding a transaction request APS will run the verification steps not only for business to business B2B situations but also for the context of individual interactions functionally limiting or curtailing the transaction constraints as specified.

In the examples enumerated above no single point of failure exists. No actual transactional data is preserved or monitored by the components of the eco system except the transaction characteristics and constraints. Actual data may only be passed between relying and providing parties. Thus vulnerability to replay attacks may be greatly reduced and forensic reconstruction enabled by virtue of the unique transactional characteristics and constraints.

Some implementations may provide methods to characterize a disposition of individual identity based on physical credentials and biometric data. In these implementations a portable computing device may be used. Some implementations may be employed to vet an individual identity and can enable that identity for enrollment and use in a data transaction where individual identity matters. Such enrollment and use may promote corporate adoption and industry growth.

For context the biometrics market is estimated to grow from 4.2 billion in 2010 to 11.2 billion in 2015 at an estimated CAGR of 21.6 . The growth of the biometrics market is mainly due to increasing concerns of the countries in terms of strengthening national security. Amongst all the biometrics modalities automated fingerprint Identification System AFIS market was estimated to generate the highest revenue of 1.4 billion in 2010 and is expected to reach 3.3 billion in 2015 a CAGR of 19 . Adoption of AFIS in national IDs and civil identification is the prime reason behind the growth of AFIS market. However the IRIS vein and face market is expected to grow with at a CAGR of 19.9 from 1.4 B to 3.5B.

Despite the announcement of a biometric data standard by National Institute Standard Technology adoption of biometrics data remain limited. This may be attributed a myriad of legacy technical standards proliferated from the many established biometric device companies and the lack of local computing power. Compounding the chaos a sea of new software based biometric algorithm and analysis companies also attempted to seize this market opportunity. As a result the adoption of biometric data is low and many implementations around identity management may be limited to physical credentials most typically a physical government issued ID travel papers or a key or security token.

Some implementations may incorporate advances in biometric data capture as well as algorithm computation and storage of the data with purpose designed hardware. Such storage may be optimized for a specific class of biometric data and may require interpretation and authentication approval performed in conjunction with server computers to run the analysis algorithms. In some instances access to such systems can be limited and typically done as a forensic or audit event after criminal or fraudulent activity has been performed. Such methods can impair the broad adoption by limiting each stage of the process to dedicated hardware or custom software which is very expensive to manufacture procure and complicated to use.

Some implementations may enable a more secure manner to vet personal identity to a secure portable computing devices including but not limited to laptop and portable computers smartphones tablets wireless medical or health and wellness devices GPS or pedometer and wearable computing accessories such as electronically enhanced glasses wristwatches and helmets. Some implementations may enable secure data transactions into a trusted transaction ecosystem by enhancing identity verification through incorporating the possession of a physical credential with multi modal biometric authentication on a portable computing device. Some implementations may create a standards neutral platform to simplify the capture enrollment comparison and interpretation of biometric data by resorting to a general purpose consumer device. Some implementations can broaden adoption for biometrically enabled transactions by using readily available commercial hardware device. Some implementations may provide the software and methods to extend the utility of different types of biometric data within the context of the general purpose portable computing device. Some implementations may create opportunities for integrating other biometric and personal identity related data methods into the platform as dictated by a consumer user.

Referring to the Biometric Core Platform BCP may facilitate create a secure unique electronic identity that combines a physical or machine readable identity credential with the parallel capture processing storage and disposition of multiple types of biometric data. This multi modal biometric capability for example when applied along with a physical identity credential can allow the user to more confidently assert their unique identity when performing an electronic transaction. In some implementations the enhanced identity profile may be enabled by using algorithmic methods to combine specific biometric data with the electronic representation and validation of a physical credential. Events or data transactions which may require increased security could require multiple challenge response iterations or additional individuals biometric data such as in the case of monetary transactions or identity inclusion into a trusted transaction ecosystem. The BCP would execute and disposition this challenge response cycle and contain the individual s biometric profiles including but not limited to facial map fingerprint skin texture iris body scent movement gait dental topology etc.

Some implementations may additionally include configurable computational engine to perform multiple functions pertaining to the capture storage caching and disposition of biometric data. Engine may provide a multi processor system with multiple processing threads capability. In some instances the data management process can be parallelized to enable parallel comparisons and threshold mappings. Engine may include for example a consumer mobile device a portable device or a desktop device.

Some implementations may provide a threaded computational engine configured to digitize and capture the demographic information of a physical identity credential or document. The computation engine may process the receipt of identity credentials and biometric enrollment data from third party stores and providers. Examples of identity providers may include for example an IdentiGO center. In some instances the computation engine may encrypt and store the physical demographics information for use in subsequent data transaction events. The computation engine may further create and proliferate the enhanced identity profile and exchanges the profile with other services to which the individual has an active subscription.

Some implementations may provide a multi tenancy environment where comparisons and computations can be performed upon data stored in multiple identity databases the computational engine will prioritize and queue the requests cache the interim results and present results of the disposition. The identity databases may include local identity database which may be located on device . Some implementations may provide configurable mobile databases as an aggregation point for the biometric data captured locally. In some cases the mobile database may include raw data from the biometric data capture. The mobile database can also store a results hash which obfuscates the quality and physical accuracy of the raw data. In this manner loss of the commercial device for example engine may not lead to a loss of electronic identity. Some implementations may provide multiple mobile databases to provide response to type specific data requests or enable query load balancing among the multiple databases. In some cases multi tenant databases may be accessed. In these cases the local database will retain location and access methods in order to process the raw data or computational request. Some implementations may incorporate a commercially available consumer device with or without direct integration of biometric capture devices.

The identity databases may also include externally hosted biometric databases A and B. Externally hosted databases A and B may include for example a Lexis Nexis identity database an Equifax identity database or an authoritative DMV database. As illustrated in engine tap into not only local database but also externally hosted biometric databases A and B. Some implementations may provide a variety of biometric algorithms A to D. Each biometric algorithm may correspond to a particular biometric identity modality for example facial recognition finger print palm print or iris scan. In some implementations a biometric algorithm may include a biometric template for matching purposes. The biometric template may be specific and unique to each subject much like a password or a PIN. Some implementations may include interpretation algorithm to blend verification results from querying multiple identity databases. Particularly implementation algorithm may include calculation of trustworthiness based on disposition results from more than one identity databases. For example an interpretation algorithm may engage a facial recognition biometric algorithm with an assurance of 80 or better while another may engage the facial recognition biometric algorithm with a finger print recognition biometric algorithm.

Some implementations may provide a communication layer. As illustrated in engine may include an external interface coupling engine via layers A and B to the example externally hosted biometric databases A and B. Layers A and B may include virtual or physical communication links customized for the transportation of identity related data. For example such links may be customized to transfer only a hash of data requests versus the actual data. In some implementations the BCP system can pass a unique representation such as a hash of biometric data in lieu of the actual physical biometric data. Under this approach engine may query externally hosted databases A and B to obtain a hashed biometric template to be transferred over layers A or B. Engine may also transmit a hashed version of a captured biometric over layers A or B to externally hosted databases A or B. This approach can protect the trusted biometric data and individual identity by never revealing the actual biometric data or computational methods for verifying biometric data over layers A and B. This approach may provide immunity to replay attacks if the hash is incorporated into a transactional characteristic being transferred over layers A and B.

Some implementations may enable use of transactional data within a closed network when embodied as a discrete instance. Other implementations may be established within a virtual private network VPN or may have an application programming interface API and sufficient system access to facilitate the system connections to asset s within the VPN. These implementations may additionally include the use of transactional data across general purpose IP networks such as cellular WiFi or wired access to the internet. In these implementations communication and identity presentation can be through cloud environments or through hybrid server environments. These implementations may also incorporate single or multi tenancy algorithmic and computational services as well as data management at various steps of physical data capture data storage computational query and identity disposition.

Data I O may further engage a communication channel e.g. communication layers A and B . In some implementations a user selection may be made via data I O with regard to methods discrimination . For example a user may choose a computation method or a threshold level for verifying an identity digital physical or combined . Methods discrimination may apply to multimodal identity verification . For example the identity verification may include multiple modalities including various biometrics such as facial recognition finger print palm print etc. as well as physical identification documents. A particular modality may have a corresponding verification template algorithm or an associated threshold level for determining a successful match. As illustrated the multimodal identification verification may include determination contributions based on a physical credential .

Multimodal identity verification may engage data selection to choose from the available database discrimination . As illustrated the available identity databases may include a variety digital biometric databases including facial portrait database A skin texture database B iris pattern database C as well as off device biometric databases such as gait pattern database A and scent pattern database B . Here the biometric data can be captured by user device .

User interface may engage physical credential service A. An example physical credential service may include work flow to obtain demographic information from a physical identification document such as a driver s license a passport a student ID a member ID or an employee ID. The work flow through user interface may include a user experience aspect as annotated as UX. The work flow may include extraction methodologies to extract demographic information of the holder of the physical credential from a presented physical credential. The extraction methodologies can read encrypted information from the presented physical credential. In some cases such encrypted information may be embedded in digital watermarks on the physical credential. In some cases such encrypted information may be located in a machine readable zone of the physical credential.

User interface may interact with access controls service B. An example access control service B may refer to workflow that includes presenting challenges to an end user whose identity is being verified and receiving responses from the end user. Access may be conditioned on matches or substantial matches . Statistics of number of matches number of trials and complexity of challenges responses may be recorded and analyzed.

Third party processing module may utilize third party software and or services and third party business intelligence . Third party software and or services may include software services and processes from a third party neutral with regard to a particular transaction being conducted between a consumer user and an underlying identity data transaction system such as identity data eco system . Third party business intelligence may include statistics rules or analytics of the third party neutral. The third party business intelligence may be analyzed by third party software and or services to generate enhanced identity profile . An example enhanced identity profile may incorporate the identity data from the related third party neutral according to the applicable software services and processes as well as the corresponding business intelligence.

As illustrated an identity discrimination programming interface may leverage identity data from database A. In analyzing such identity data identity discrimination programming interface may utilize third party hardware data capture methods and systems to supplement additional identity data from third parties. In some instances an enhanced identity profile may additionally provide algorithms and threshold levels for querying databases A.

Identity discrimination programming interface leverage computational algorithms service A and biometric database registration service B. Computational algorithms service A may provide credential creation such as the generation of digital biometric information the obfuscated data e.g. providing hashes of digital biometric data for transportation over a communication layer database discrimination e.g. selection of database s for a particular application . Biometric database registration service B may interface with database B so that identity data transaction system may leverage identity data on database B.

The above described components may be implemented as software layers residing on event service layer . The event service layer may generate software events corresponding to prescribed conditions such as assurance determination reaching a threshold level or detected real world events such as leveraging identity data from a third party . The event layer is provided over programming environment provided for a particular underlying operating system .

The transaction authentication engine according to some implementations may electronically enable data exchanges among multiple interested parties. Such data exchanges may allow each party to vet the identity of the other parties in a manner that is secure so that the vetted identities may be trusted. These data exchanges may include for example commercial transactions as well as non financial communications such as healthcare records .

In 2012 12.6 M individuals were victims of identity theft mainly from data breaches of sensitive account information social security bank accounts etc. attributing to approximately 5.3 M man days spent to rectify the breach. Financial fraud accounted for 21B in losses throughout the financial services industries and 41.3B in losses in healthcare due to medical identity theft.

This issue plagues for example financial institutions. Some may create their own proprietary in house networks and databases and business rules schemas to handle their particular requirements and create financial reserves to account for instances of fraud that may slip through. Such measures may protect the institution but ignore the individual end user who may be denied access or suffer from identity theft. As each institution has its own requirements on quality of identity data the institution is unable to share the identity verification information with other interested parties in a programmatic manner. Relying on human intervention general becomes less feasible or economical when the volume of identity data increases.

Some implementations may support the creation of a trusted identity ecosystem. In these implementations software systems and methods may be provided to extend institutional data requirements and trust levels to support programmatic automation and trust level standardization within the identity ecosystem. Some implementations may handle growing identity related problems in the commercial markets by improving the technological quality and commercial viability of trusted identities while simplifying the process of individual initiated and bulk automation steps towards mitigating crime and fraud related to identities. Some implementations may be integrated into the eco system of identity data transaction. In some cases identity related security technologies such as Smart Card Token based security systems public private software key combinations and thick client biometric software and hardware peripherals may be integrated.

The Transaction Authentication Engine TAE may provide a set of database rules and computational algorithms prescribing the electronic means and workflow rules by which the participating entity is permitted to interact with the trusted transaction ecosystem and its agents of functionality. Additionally the TAE may define a set of intermediary algorithms necessary to compute the minimum level of trustworthiness acceptable to the participating entity in the ecosystem. For instance the TAE may include sessions from data requestors from within a common participant subscription e.g. a company with a centralized policy management hierarchy but with distributed decision making and identity verification needs for a multitude of purposes . Each instance of a requesting event can dictate the software application security environment communications protocol originating domain name server DNS and subnet infrastructure such as transmission control protocol internet protocol TCP IP one or more security protocols such as secure sockets layer SSL or a virtual private network VPN or public key infrastructure PKI a centralized permissions subscription enforcement engine one or more centralized business rules expected for the transaction a minimum computed threshold of trustworthiness a single or a plurality of participating trusted identity Databases a custom system configuration instance for each database system administration functionality and any required hardware or devices required to perform these actions.

In an example implementation commercial businesses such as a bank may desire to verify the identity of an individual for a trusted transaction. Here the data requestor uses their configured application to initiate a data query transaction at the bank. The application configures the query based on specifications such as configurations for dataset methods expected response type and security tokens. By using secured communications the system may verify the subscription of the data requestor process the request against business rules and send the query to the trusted identity database. The trusted identity database in turn is configured to accept and reply to data query transactions based on a custom configuration. The data query transactions may include for example verifying that the data requestor is not on a black list the data requester has submitted a compliant query and that the request is in a proper format. Once validated as a compliant transaction the query is performed and the database response is formatted for reply and sent back through the system and to the data requestor.

Features of the TAE subsystem may include a scalable configuration engine. The configuration engine may function as a local compliance engine initiate data requests upon the trusted transaction ecosystem TTE per their subscription status. The TTE may also be referred to as the identity data transaction system or the identity data eco system. The configuration engine may provide mapping defined connectors in a multi tenancy environment combining local rules and requirements with the gaps of knowledge in order to determine programmatically which pieces of information are missing and which sources of data to query. The configuration engine may present e.g. in a multi tenancy environment the defining protocols security and data parameters for the bidirectional data transaction to take place to determine whether the authenticity of the transaction is trustworthy. As deployed in a multi tenancy multi instance solution the configuration engine may decentralize the business rules and data transaction elements of the data requesting entity of the ecosystem. This decentralization may reduce the impact of negative events such as outages while spreading the computational and data burden across other TAEs deployed by the corporate request originator. The configuration engine may also provide an access gate by leveraging biometric or biometrically fused data alone or in combination with real time data hashing algorithms to ensure the data request is authentic and not hacked or spoofed .

In some implementations the TAE can be deployed on a single server instance or across a federation of server instances. This engine then passes a hash of the request the communication codes and the target of requesting data providers. These elements may be archived for reconciliation and may provide a method for audit as well as reconciliation of requests and their status. This approach can protect the participating data requestor subscriber by providing a discrete hierarchy of authentication within their business to ensure that the data request is authentic and the requesting party is authorized to do so. Data being handled may conform to the related data handling and security policies and the actual data may not be exposed. By scaling the TAE deployments throughout their organizational points of presence the participating data requestor may also provide for redundancy to protect business operations against functional outages.

The TAE may be configured and deployed for a variety of network settings including virtual private networks closed networks cloud environments or hybrid server environments. The TAE may be single or multi tenancy at both the data request originator level and the databases of identity level. A participating entity for the identity data transaction system may choose to configure or customer data owner may configure the connectors and profiles on the configuration engines. Databases engines and additional systems may be hosted in disparate networked or single server environments. Computational logic may take place in a decentralized manner consistent with the implementation described envisioned in these embodiments.

User interface may interact with access controls service . An example access control service may refer to workflow that includes presenting challenges to an end user whose identity is being verified and receiving responses from the end user. The work flow through user interface may include a user experience aspect as annotated as UX. Access may be conditioned on matches or substantial matches . In some implementations statistics of number of matches number of trials complexity of challenges responses may be recorded and retrospectively analyzed.

Internal routing rules engine may utilize participant business processes and participant business intelligence . Rules engine may apply verification rules to identity data. Participant business processes may include software services and processes for identity verification for the participant business. Participant business intelligence may include statistics rules or analytics of the participating business. Participant business intelligence may be analyzed by participant software services and processes the result of which may be further processed by obfuscation hashing service . An example obfuscation and hashing may provide a one way encryption not reversible by virtue of applying encryption or decryption key s .

As illustrated an identity discrimination programming interface may leverage identity data from database A. In analyzing such identity data identity discrimination programming interface may utilize third party hardware data capture methods and systems to supplement additional identity data from third parties. In some instances an enhanced identity profile may additionally provide algorithms and threshold levels for querying databases A.

Identity discrimination programming interface may leverage credential request service A computational algorithms service B and biometric database registration service C. Credential request service A may provide sources and types of credentials required. Computational algorithms service B may provide disposition of trustworthiness. Biometric database registration presentation obfuscation service C may interface with database B so that identity data transaction system may leverage identity data on database B. The service may include registration of a digital identity stored on database B presentation of a digital identity and obfuscation of a digital identity to generate for example an abstraction such as a hash of the digital identity for transportation over a communication layer.

The above described components may be implemented as software layers residing on transaction authentication layer . The transaction authentication layer may generate software events corresponding to prescribed conditions such as assurance determination reaching a threshold level or detected real world events such as leveraging identity data arriving from a third party . The transaction authentication layer may be provided over data requester synchronization prioritization layer which in turn may be provided over a communication bus access interface to trusted transaction engine TTE .

Meanwhile a process request service may allow transaction requests to be queued and prioritized. The process request service may interact with subscription management as well as communication protocol management .

The Authenticated Validation Engine AVE may include computational algorithms prescribing the electronic means and workflow rules by which the participating entity the identity provider is permitted to interact with the trusted transaction ecosystem and its agents of functionality. Additionally the AVE may define and deliver a set of intermediary algorithms and results necessary to compute the minimum level of trustworthiness and may ensure the rules for completing the data request are completed within policy compliance among contributors within the participating entity and between the parties engaged in a transaction event in the identity data transaction ecosystem and with the ecosystem itself.

In an example implementation the AVE may include a combination of a single or a plurality of sessions from data providers from within their common participant subnetwork e.g. a company or jurisdiction with a centralized policy management hierarchy but with distributed identity data elements a subset of which is being requested by another party in the trusted transaction ecosystem .

Upon each request instance local policy may dictate that elements related to identity trust authentication and security are being adhered to. Examples of attributes may include for example the software application security environment communications protocol originating domain name server DNS and subnet infrastructure such as transmission control protocol internet protocol TCP IP one or more security protocols such as secure sockets layer SSL or a virtual private network VPN or public key infrastructure PKI . Additionally the AVE would query a centralized permissions subscription enforcement engine one or more centralized business rules expected for the transaction a single or a plurality of participating trusted identity databases to extract and incrementally compute n input value for the minimum threshold of trustworthiness.

In an example implementation commercial businesses such as a bank may desire to verify the identity of an individual for a trusted transaction. The requesting TAE may initiate a data query transaction. The request is transported through the trusted transaction ecosystem to the participating data provider s . The AVE may receive the request and self configure itself based on the provided request specifications such as for example configurations for dataset methods expected response type and security tokens. Based on the communications protocol and secured with technologies known to those skilled in the art the system may verify the subscription of the data requestor process the request against pre negotiated business rules verify compliance with local policies and send the query to the trusted identity database. The trusted identity database in turn is configured to accept and reply to data query transactions based on a custom configuration that may include for example verifying that the data requestor is not on a black list the requester has submitted a compliant query and that the request is in the proper format. Once validated as a compliant transaction the query is performed and the database response is formatted for reply and sent back through the system in reverse to the data requestor.

Some implementations may function as a local compliance engine receives data requests from the trusted transaction ecosystem TTE . Some implementations may function as mapping defined connectors in a multi tenancy environment combining local rules and requirements with the gaps of knowledge in order to determine programmatically which pieces of information are missing and which sources of data to query. Some implementations may function as a communications coding engine by receiving e.g. in a multi tenancy environment the pre negotiated protocols security and data parameters that may be required for the bidirectional data transaction to take place to ensure authenticity of the transaction is trustworthy. As deployed in a multi tenancy multi instance solution some implementations may decentralize the business rules and data transaction elements of the data providing entity of the ecosystem. This decentralization may reduce impacts of negative events such as outages while spreading the computational and data burden across other AVEs deployed by the corporate identity data provider. Some implementations may function as an access gate requiring biometric or biometrically fused data alone or in combination with real time data hashing algorithms to ensure the data request is authentic and not hacked or spoofed .

In some implementations the authenticated validation engine AVE can be deployed on a single server instance or across a federation of server instances. This engine then processes a hash of the request the communication codes and the requested target identity databases. These requests are archived for reconciliation and may provide auditing information as well as reconciliation of requests and their status. Such implementations may protect the participating identity data provider by providing a discrete hierarchy of authentication within their business to ensure that the data response is authentic and compliant with their local policies and that the providing party is authorized to do so. Data being handled will conform to the related data handling and security policies and the actual data may not be exposed.

By scaling the AVE deployments throughout their organizational points of presence the participating data provider may also provide redundancy to protect business operations against functional outages. The AVE may be configured and deployed for a variety of network settings including virtual private networks closed networks cloud environments or hybrid server environments. The AVE may be single or multi tenancy at both the data request originator level and the databases of identity level. A participating entity for the identity data transaction system may choose to configure or customer data owner may configure the connectors and profiles on the configuration engines. Databases engines and additional systems may be hosted in disparate networked or single server environments. Computational logic may take place in a decentralized manner consistent with the implementation described envisioned in these embodiments.

User interface may interact with access controls service . An example access control service may refer to workflow that includes presenting challenges to an end user whose identity is being verified and receiving responses from the end user. Access may be conditioned on matches or substantial matches . The work flow through user interface may include a user experience aspect as annotated as UX. Statistics of number of matches number of trials and complexity of challenges responses may be recorded and analyzed.

Internal routing rules engine may utilize participant business processes and participant business intelligence . Rules engine may apply verification rules to identity data. Participant business policies may include services and processes for identity verification for the participant business. Participant customer relation management CRM and access constraints may include statistics rules or analytics of the participating business. Participant CRM and access constraints may be coupled to identity database A to obtain CRM and or access constraints data. Participant CRM and access constraints may be analyzed by participant software services and processes the result of which may be further processed by obfuscation hashing service . An example obfuscation and hashing may provide a one way encryption not reversible by virtue of applying encryption or decryption key s .

As illustrated an identity discrimination programming interface may leverage identity data from database B. In analyzing such identity data identity discrimination programming interface may utilize third party hardware data capture methods and systems to supplement additional identity data from third parties. In some instances an enhanced identity profile may additionally provide algorithms and threshold levels for querying databases B.

Identity discrimination programming interface may leverage credential request service A computational algorithms service B and biometric database registration service C. Credential request service A may provide sources and types of credentials required. Computational algorithms service B may provide disposition of trustworthiness. Biometric database registration presentation obfuscation service C may interface with database C so that identity data transaction system may leverage identity data on database C. The service may include registration of a digital identity stored on database C presentation of a digital identity and obfuscation of a digital identity to generate for example an abstraction such as a hash of the digital identity for transportation over a communication layer.

The above described components may be implemented as software layers residing on authentication validation layer . The authentication validation layer may generate software events corresponding to prescribed conditions such as assurance determination reaching a threshold level or detected real world events such as leveraging identity data arriving from a third party . The authentication validation layer may be provided over data provider synchronization prioritization layer which in turn may be provided over a communication bus access interface to TTE. Data provider synchronization prioritization layer may also couple to database D. Here the databases may be external databases. In some cases under a functional requirement for providing trusted identity an operating agreement or a legislative mandate these external databases may be kept in synchronization with the identity data ecosystem. The ability to leverage external databases can be important for real time function of accessibility visibility or even for disaster recovery.

Meanwhile a process request service may allow transaction requests to be queued and prioritized. The process request service may interact with subscription management as well as communication protocol management .

Credentials for individuals and entities may be issued by a certifying authority based on the data and privileges desired at the discretion of the certifying authority or with the certifying authority acting as an agent on behalf of an organization which likewise determines the privileges. Because each certifying authority controls the aspects of each credential credential holders may be limited in terms of the use of the credential.

Notably credential holders in need of multiple credentials are issued multiple discrete credentials by multiple certificate authorities each may require independent maintenance.

Some implementations of an identity credential ecosystem may be electronic or digital yet likewise certifying agency centric. In these implementations each organization may establish or manage a credentialing process and the credential holders may have limited roles and can only enjoy a narrow range of permissions typically tied to one set of use cases and permission sets. For example management of electronic credential documents including eIDs electronic IDs eWallets payment tokens and even FID type e.g. standards based and others typically revolve around one unifying ecosystem or master certificate authority that would manage the identity and rights privileges of the credential holder individuals.

Some implementations of digital IDs may include a certificate authority body providing the infrastructure of identity credential in which a participating entity may manage the token identities of the holder. These implementations may create vetted trusted identity tokens to enable identity related privileges and transactions. In these implementations the tokens may be user initiated and or user configured. These implementations may provide an embodiment of the identity data transaction system to enable users to manage their identities and associated permissions and transactions across multiple participants in the identity data transaction system. These implementations may facilitate the enrollment configuration and ongoing management of a token based identity as centrally managed by each participant consumer. In these implementations the paradigm may be changed from the establishment and management of a credential on behalf of central and authoritative CA certificate authority to a model whereby the identity transaction system brokers credential management transactions on behalf of the user thereby enabling the user to request and obtain roles and permissions according to multiple user specified scenarios. In these implementations the CA interacts with the identity transaction system e.g. according to business rules on policy engines to determine if and how the permissions will be granted in an automated fashion without the need for human mediation except that human mediation is possible in a system administration capacity . Specifically some examples may incorporate a trustworthiness score based on the underlying privileges and permissions. Some examples may configure preferences for identity databases to participate in the ecosystem such as the identity data transaction system . Some examples may configure preferences of the subscribers enterprise participants to the identity data transaction system.

Some implementations provide software systems methods and physical digital outputs to enable the deployment and use of identity tokens on portable computing devices where the user initiates and authorizes the privileges associated with the credential. In an example implementation such token may be first authorized by a qualified certificate authority such as a government agency or official organization. In another example implementation such token may be initiated by a user and managed by an identity data transaction system. In an example implementation physical digital outputs such as a physical identification document or a digital identification document may include a token that represents a single set or plurality of sets of privileges associated with a trusted and vetted identity. In this example such token entities may be configured as instances that are enabled for different permissions and configurations based on individually configured relationships with different participants of the ecosystem such as the identity data transaction system . In yet another example implementation such tokens may be established configured managed revoked or set to expire by the user credential holder at the user discretion. In this example permissions associated with the tokens are configurable such that if one permission is revoked or has expired other permissions sets may remain intact until likewise managed or revoked specifically to enable the ability for a temporary or one time token artifact.

Some implementations may provide access to a central repository of identity related credentials and documents. In these implementations the access may be enabled and facilitated by the trusted identity token and its associated privileges. Some implementations may allow consumer users to self generate digitally watermarked physical credentials for machine validation. Some implementations may allow for integration into identity related security technologies including for example smart card token based security systems public private software key combinations and thick client biometric software and hardware peripherals.

Some implementations may enable the creation and configuration of digital tokens that can be used to execute privileges. In one example a user may conduct trusted transactions associated with the user s vetted trusted identity according to the privileges established with one or a plurality of credential authorities. In this example the configuration and control of such privileges and permissions are mastered by the user. Notably features of some implementations may include the ability for the user to initiate and or configure one or a plurality of instances of a credential and its associated permissions through a unified interface on a computing device.

In some implementations the user may have established as part of an enrollment process a primary trusted identity meeting enrollment criteria from a qualified certificate authority such as for example a government agency such as a department of motor vehicles an immigration agency an official organization such as a university hospital or financial institution or a commercial organization such as a provider of identity services . The token issuers may also include providers of trusted identity data.

In some implementation a user enrolls for a credential with a trusted certificate authority and provides sufficient proof of identity documents and or data so as to establish a trusted identity with that entity. By way of illustration that entity may initiate according to business practice one or more additional data queries at an identity data ecosystem for identity verification. The identity data ecosystem may include a federated system of identity databases from various sources including a government agency such as the U.S. Social Security Agency or the Veterans Administration a commercial entity such as a financial reporting organization such as EXPERIAN or an organization of higher learning such as a university in order to further vet the identity and or increase the confidence in the identity. Notably the user data may also be cross correlated to additional negative indicator databases such as a watch list problem driver list sex offender list the FBI felony database or other source of data that may restrict the users permissions. These organizations may be inside and or outside a formal ecosystem enabling data queries with third parties that do not participate in the ecosystem as a tertiary validation check. The identity data eco system may provide a scoring method for ranking the quality of the trusted identity on one or more dimensions including but not limited to identity surety or risks associated with the identity. In some implementations the identity data eco system may incorporate multiple forms of identity data such as biometric data elements to provide added confidence level in a given authentication as well as multi factor authentication.

Some implementations may provide a user with a foundational credential. The foundational credential may be digitized into a digital token including for example an electronic ID or other unique identifier.

Some implementations may include a plurality token. The plurality token may include a collection of tokens or a token with multiple sets of discrete characteristics to serve as multiple tokens for different purposes. By way of illustration such plurality tokens may be machine readable machine validated or human verifiable. Specifically such plurality tokens are extensible to incorporate more than one set of identity data including for example multiple aliases. For instance each set of identity may be associated with a particular set of roles and permissions. In these implementations a persistent identity dataset may include a unique identifier across the identity data eco system.

Example plurality token sets may be secured by authentication. In one instance the unique identifier across the ecosystem may be enabled for multi factor authentication including for example biometrics password PIN numbers or challenge response. Each set of identity may be authenticated by its own biometrics password PIN numbers or challenge response. As noted the plurality token may include a collection of tokens or a token with multiple discrete characteristics serve as multiple tokens for different purposes. During the enrollment process the token unique identifier may be established and may then be cryptographically tied to the user with an encryption scheme that amongst its decoding protocols includes multi factor authentication such as a biometric e.g. facial recognition fingerprint or voice . In one example a multi factor authentication including for example a PIN number a key phrase or secondary biometric may greatly reduce the chances of another human being having same combination. The authentication may further include mechanisms to thwart for example replay attacks. Such mechanisms may incorporate a measure of freshness or liveliness for example by asking the requester to provide evidence of a live session. In one instance the requester may be asked to enter a pseudo random verification code unique for each session. In another instance the pseudo random code may be dynamic to thwart further crawler robot attacks. Such measures may also include associating fresh characteristics for each requesting session for example generating characteristic data unique for each session and coupling the characteristics with a password a biometric a PIN number etc.

The level of authentication sophistication may vary with the underlying roles and permissions associated with each set of identity. The sophistication level for each identity set may be adjusted by the user consumer on his her own initiative. Some implementations may allow the user to have control over the use of their trusted identity tokens and associated privileges. Since users can have more than one credential and can combine their credentials into a unified multi purpose plurality token. For example the user may have a core or foundation token. The core or foundation token may be used to back up other identities each with its own set of permission and privileges. Access to the core or foundation token may enable access to other tokens. The user however is enabled for example through a user device to modify permissions and privileges for each identity including for example initiating expiring or disabling temporarily . This configuration capability can happen at each token level and can happen even at the core token within constraints defined by the identity data system. In some implementations such configuration may be performed over a network wired or wireless so that the permissions and privileges for each identity at remote identity databases can be managed by the user.

In some implementations the plurality tokens may be managed through a certificate authority of the identity data eco system. This certificate authority may acts as a proxy for multiple third party or ecosystem based certificate authorities and may operate under policies administered through the identity data eco system.

Notably the token may be installed or uploaded into a device of the user s choice including for example a mobile tag a smart phone tablet a portable computing device a dongle a NFC RFID or other device capable of electronic communication.

Once the token is enabled the token is activated with an underlying trusted identity. The trusted entity may be in an encrypted form and locked to the user s identity which may present a physical identity document of the user. The enabled token can be used to authenticate to a registry service of the identity data eco system. The use may further configure the token to define for example the types of transactions enabled by a successful authentication based on the token. The registry service may require authorization from the user to use the newly configured token and may need the authentication that the token is valid. In this manner the user may interface directly to the identity data eco system as well as the proxy certificate authority and associated policy engines. As an additional layer of security a temporary PIN number assigned by the identity data eco system may further secure the registry transaction from unauthorized access.

The registry may create a unique identifier for example a token type ID a hash of the token ID or serial number combined with a unique identity ID and a secondary hash of one or more of the multi factor authentication templates thereby creating a unique identifier string unique to that User. This unique identifier may be encrypted upon creation and can be reduced in string size by applying a hash a digest a checksum or other algorithmic shortening. Once the identity token has been defined and secured the identity token may be tied to the physical identity of the user.

Some implementations may include a user controlled permissions system. In this system the user can for example establish multiple token identities define the entities that have permissions to access the users credential configure those permissions suspend or set to expire the permissions on an entity by entity or permission by permission basis and revoke tokens or permissions e.g. on an entity by entity or permission by permission basis .

To expand on the registry account further a user may have a trusted government identity loaded as a secured token. In one illustration the user may have used that identity token to submit his or her fingerprints to the FBI. Thereafter the user may have been licensed to carry a concealed weapon. Such authorization may be encoded into the particular identity token. The user may at the same time maintain another identity token encoding an authorization to fish in particular jurisdiction. Thus some implementations may allow one person to have multiple credentials with associated permissions and managed in a single token set and managed by the user himself herself.

Once installed on a user device and locked by virtue of multi factor authentication the identity token may be used by the user in trusted transactions where identity matters. Examples of transactions may include one time or low incident but high risk transactions such as large sum financial transactions enrollment in institutions of higher learning providing proof of identity for trusted transactions such as obtaining a concealed carry weapons permit or background checks. Example transactions may further include recurring transactions such as using an ATM machine using public transportation obtaining health care picking up children from daycare or other recurring transactions.

In some implementations an identity token may be used as the access control for a repository of identity related data and document. For example an identity database such as an identity vault may be under such access control. By way of illustration the identity token may be used for access control of a physical safety deposit at a local bank where physical items can be kept for example jewelry birth certificates or physical keys . The identity token may be used for access control of other safety premises such as a firearm safe or a controlled substance safe .

In some implementations the user can generate on a portable computing device a digitally watermarked credential. The credential may be displayed on a portable computing device in printed form or other as a means of providing a physical token that can be validated verified with a machine scanner configured to identify and decode digital watermarks.

Some implementations may be practiced in a variety of network settings including virtual private networks closed networks cloud environments or hybrid server environments. The network may be a single or multi tenancy setting at both the data request originator level as well as the databases of identity level. A participating entity for the identity data transaction system may choose to configure or customer data owner may configure the connectors and profiles on the configuration engines. Databases engines and additional systems hosted in disparate networked or single server environments. Computational logic may take place in a decentralized manner consistent with the implementation described envisioned in these embodiments.

A certificate authority may employ advanced feature sets for screening applicants and or issuing credential tokens. For example a certificate authority may attempt to manage a subscriber community with increasingly sophisticated measures intended to more robustly verify user identity. However an individual user especially a less sophisticated user may be intimidated by the number of credential tokens issued from various certification authorities such as a user s school bank credit card company employer retirement services agency the Social Security Administration a health insurance provider the user s auto insurance company a user s mortgage company a user s health club a primary care physician a user s social network account. Each of these CAs may include different measures configurations and risk levels for authenticating the carrying party of a credential token. The sheer number of credential tokens from these certification authorities may only grow as the society becomes increasingly a digital society.

For some users managing such an array of tokens may become problematic. For example an average user may forget passwords for certain accounts and may resort to resetting passwords frequently. A user may opt to use the same password for multiple accounts which may compound the impact of a breach on one account. A user may resort to writing passwords for each account on a piece of paper or a single file on a disk the loss of which may lead to adverse consequences.

Moreover users may be forced to rely upon a difficult to use token and the associated CA centric control system. In order for recipient A to grant access rights to recipient B a different user recipient A may pass the token that recipient received from the certificate authority to recipient B. This passing of the token may increase the risk of identity theft in the digital age.

As illustrated in a user may start with a foundation token. The foundation token also may be known as a primary identity document. A foundation token may be issued based on or premised on a primary identity document issued by for example a government agency after a rigorous vetting process. This example may allow the plurality token set to leverage the authority and trustworthiness associated with such government identification documents or the vetting process thereof. In this illustration the foundation token may be issued by one of CAs A to C. Some examples of a digital foundation token may include a digital portrait a digital passport a digital driver license etc. Because a vetting process implemented by some entities e.g. a government authority may authenticate a person or an entity for that matter in a manner that provides an increased degree of confidence the tie in of such a record having a high degree of confidence i.e. a golden record or system of record into the ecosystem carries with it the gravitas of that identity endorsement. For instance the state of Massachusetts Department of Motor Vehicles DMV may personally authenticate using measures associated with a high degree of confidence before the DMV issues the user the foundation token i.e. the driver license . The credential of the driver license and the associated record have more value than an identity backed by an non traditional source such as Facebook where Facebook may take a user s word at face value. Hence by extending the use of that foundation token into a certified token set the certified token set carries with it that identity endorsement.

Some implementations may allow a user to take the initiative to extend a token set based on the foundation token. The combination of the foundation token and the user initiative can provide a level of veracity and authenticity backed by the foundation token while maintaining the ease of management through the user initiative.

Notably extending the privileges from the foundation token may extend the confidence for proposed pending transactions that can be linked to a trusted entity. In particular the link to government issued identities or even official commercial enterprise may provide the missing link of veracity of the underlying foundation token. Yet additional value may be realized to include extending the individual user s ability to manage and control their token facilitated transactions through one token set. The token set may be scalable in size and extensible to new platforms as they are developed. Figuratively the foundation token may serve as the ring or the key chain to tie all credential tokens that an individual user may receive from certification authorities. In contrast to the one to many mapping from one certificate authority to many users some implementations may provide many to many mappings between two individual users. Here the plurality is in the user managing a token system tied by a foundation token versus certification authorities issuing multiple tokens which users manage separately on a token by token basis.

Through the user initiative some implementations may allow a user to delegate portions of permissions and privileges of the user to another user. For example the user may have as part of the user s identity token maintained with regard to access a local gym or library the permissions and privileges to access gym or library facilities during visits on premise between 9 am and 5 pm local time. In this example the user may delegate such permissions and privileges to the user s child when the child is away from school in summer time. The delegation may be limited to the user s child only and may be limited to summer months. In a similar vein delegation through token configuration may allow the principal user to assign portions of the principal s permission and privileges to another user in the capacity of an agent. In the above example during school season the parent may delegate to school officials the permission and privileges to configure access right of the child to school facilities on premise. Such delegation may also include the access right of child to use local medical facilities. In these delegation examples the parent may issue a token to the receiving party. The token may be combined with the receiving party s foundation token so that the receiving party may use the foundation token to authenticate the receiving party s identity in order to enjoy the delegated right or perform the delegated task.

Some implementations may allow a user to impute portions of permissions and privileges of the user to another user. For example the user may enjoy access rights to an on line banking facility. Through token configuration the user may impute such permissions and privileges to a spouse or trusted family member. As a result the spouse or trusted family member may enjoy the same access rights at the on line banking facility. The imputation may be realized by the user issuing a token to the receiving family member. The token issued by the user may rely on the receiving user s foundation token to authenticate the receiving user at the on line banking facility.

The user then may submit a request for associating an index of privileges and permissions to the foundation token for example a digital portrait issued by a trusted entity. The request may be submitted along with a foundation token of the user. The index of privileges and permissions may be known as a credential token. The index of privileges and permissions may encode the scope of permissions for the user to for example access transactional data managed or controlled by the certificate authority. In some implementations the transactional data may be merely under the custody of the certificate authority. The privileges and permissions may also encode a duration during which the user may access the transactional data.

The request may be received at a server . The server may be located at the certificate authority. The server may then extract the foundation token from the request or information related to a foundation token . Thereafter the server at the certificate authority may validate the foundation token as authentic . The validation may include verifying the format of the foundation token as in conformance with jurisdictional requirements verifying that a computed checksum from a particular segment from the foundation token match a corresponding recorded checksum for the particular area cross correlating information from various segments on the foundation token confirming with the trusted entity that has issued the foundation token or verifying with a third party identity broker that can attest to the validity of the foundation token.

In some implementations the validation may further include authenticating that the user submitting the request is the person identified by the foundation token. For example the validation may include matching a biometric value of the submitting user with the corresponding biometric on the foundation token. The biometric value may include a face a finger print a palm print an iris scan a retina scan a voice a gait analysis etc. By way of illustration some implementations may include automatic facial recognition to compare the face of the submitting user matches the face shown on the foundation token. To mitigate spoofing or other fraudulent measures the submitting user may be prompted to gesture in a manner that cannot be predicted by injecting a static image as a man in the middle attack.

The validation may establish that the foundation token is authentic and has not been tampered with or at least indicate that the presented data has been analyzed using certain filtering processes that address certain fraudulent techniques . The validation also may validate that submitting user is the user identified by the foundation token. Thereafter the server at the certificate authority may further compare the requested permission and privileges with internal business rules to determine whether the requesting user can have the requested permissions and privileges.

By way of illustration if the requesting user is requesting access to building A the server at the certificate authority may determine whether the requesting user is prohibited from entering building A. For example the server at the may verify whether the requesting user has an office in building A whether the requesting user is on a black list to visit building A whether the requesting user has paid commensurate fees to visit building A at a particular time or whether the requesting user has other legitimate business reasons to visit building A at the particular time.

In another illustration the requesting user may be requesting temporary access rights for a different user. In this case the server at the certificate authority may verify whether the requesting party is authorized to grant access rights to a third party for example regarding the transactional data in question.

Once the server at the certificate authority determines that the requesting user may have the requested permission and privileges the server at the certificate authority may add the credential token to the requesting user s token set .

In yet another illustration the server at the certificate authority may cause the requested privileges and permissions to be associated with the foundation token. In one example the server at the certificate authority may generate an add on credential token and transmit the same back to a computing device of the user. The credential token may include data encoding an index for the requested permissions and privileges. The data may be encrypted using a private key of the certificate authority and a public key of the user. Upon receipt an application program on the user s computing device may decrypt the encrypted data by using the private key of the user and link the credential token to the foundation token. The user may now have a token set linking the newly received credential token to the foundation token. The user may subsequently link more credential tokens to the same foundation token and extend the token set.

In yet another example the server at the certificate authority may attach data encoding the requested privileges and permissions directly to the foundation token. The attachment may take the form of appending embedding steganography etc. The attachment portion may be encrypted using a private key of the certificate authority and a public key of the user. Upon receipt an application program on the user s computing device may decrypt the encrypted portion of the foundation token by using the private key of the user. The user may now have the foundation token extended to include the newly obtained privileges and permissions. The user may subsequently extend the foundation token to privileges and permissions obtained from other certification authorities or link more credential tokens to the same foundation token. Hence the user may treat the foundation token as the master ring or key chain to tie in credential tokens obtained from participating certification authorities in an eco system.

Thereafter the computing device of the user may transmit a request to the certificate authority as referenced by the request . The request may be accompanied by a foundation token of the user. Sometimes the foundation token may be referred to as primary identification document. The foundation token may identify the holder of the foundation token by encoding a biometric of the holder. The foundation token may be issued by a trusted entity through a rigorous vetting process. As noted above a server at the certificate authority may process the request by verifying that the foundation token is valid. The server may also authenticate that the requesting user is the holder of the foundation token. The server may additionally confirm that the requesting user meets the pre requisites for requesting the desired privileges and permissions. For example when the requesting user attempts to engage in age restricted activities the server may perform an age calculation to confirm that the requesting user meets the age requirements. In another example when the requesting user attempts to have access to restricted items such as controlled substances guns ammunitions etc. the server may check the request against rules. The rules may limit the amount duration or time window of accessing such restricted items. If the request complies with the rules the server at the certificate authority may allow the request to proceed.

The computing device of the user may receive a response from the server at the certificate authority . The response may indicate that the request has been approved or disapproved. In some implementations if the request has been approved the user computing device may computationally associate the requested set of privileges and permissions with the foundation token of the user. In some implementations however if the request has been approved the user computing device may receive data encoding the foundation token that has already been computationally associated with the desired privileges and permissions. The computation may have been performed by the server at the certificate authority.

As noted above the envisioned work flow may enable a user to take the initiative to configure and manage a token set of privileges and permissions. For example when the user has obtained a credential token from a certificate authority encoding the set of privileges and permissions of the user the user may take the initiative to revoke renew replace or update the credential token. By way of illustration the user may submit the revocation renewal replacement or update request through the same interface as noted above. The revocation renewal replacement or update requests may be processed by the server at the certificate authority in a manner consistent with the description herein.

Similarly the user has the initiative to add credential tokens from other certification authorities to the same token set based on the foundation token. By way of example the user may submit additional requests for associating a new set of privileges and permissions with the foundation token . The submission may be through the same interface as noted above. The submission may be accompanied by the foundation token of the user. The foundation token may already be computationally associated with privileges and permissions at certification authorities that the user has previously dealt with. The newly submitted request however may attempt to extend the foundation token to the new set of privileges and permissions so that the user may obtain the new set of privileges and permissions. The new set of privileges and permissions may indicate the scope of right of the user for example to access transactional data managed by a certificate authority that the user has not dealt with before.

The server at the new certificate authority may process the request in accordance with the descriptions herein. If the request is approved then the server at the new certificate authority may cause the foundation token to be computationally associated with the additional set of privileges and permissions. Further the user may receive on the user device data encoding a digital identity associated with the newly requested set of privileges and permissions . Notably the foundation token is also associated with that existing set or sets of privileges and permissions. In other words if the request is approved the requesting user may have the additional set of privileges and permissions attached to the foundation token that has been associated with existing sets of privileges and permissions.

The benefits may not be limited to the disclosure above. Some implementations may allow a consumer user to upgrade from a physical identification document to an electronic identification document for example at license renewal time. The renewal may be initiated from a mobile computer device. The renewal time could also correspond to renewal time of a physical document. The electronic identification document may be one example foundation token. A digital driver s license may be one example of an electronic identification document. By way of illustration a digital driver s license may be stored on a smart phone or a consumer user and may be presented on the touch screen of the smart phone.

Some implementations may allow a consumer user to add new security features to the consumer user s eWallet solutions. Some implementations may a consumer user to add security features to the consumer user s social network account such as for example a Facebook account a Twitter account.

Some implementations may facilitate Single Sign Ons. Particularly some implementations may allow a consumer user to prove the consumer user s identity from a variety of contexts or situations.

Some implementations may allow a consumer user to incorporate a number of credentials or endorsements into a foundation token of the consumer user. The credentials and endorsements may include first responders state employee ID professional licenses etc.

Some implementations may allow a consumer user to update data to an authoritative source such as the DMV at a time chosen by the consumer user. The updates may include for example address changes donor status veteran status. Some implementations may allow the consumer user to reinstate or revoke a driver license or other endorsements of the consumer user in a real time manner.

Some implementations may allow a consumer user to assert an identity of the consumer user from a variety of platforms including for example mobile platforms table devices desktop PCs or Web browsers.

Some implementations may allow a consumer user to use facial biometrics with a digital driver license for verification.

Some implementations may extend a foundation token to include other credentials for a consumer user. In one example a consumer user may back a credit card application by using a digital driver license of the consumer user. In another example a consumer user may link a point of service POS digital Medicaid card to a foundation token. The linked credentials may be used in a request for proposal RFP response.

Some implementations may integrate the use of digital driver s license with OpenID. Some implementations may accommodate using digital driver s license to support Single Sign On SSO . Some implementations may use a foundation token with eWallet to support an identity of the consumer user in possession of the foundation token and the eWallet. Some implementations may verify an identity of a state employee for example case workers in connection with a digital driver s license of the employee. Some implementations may verify an identity of a Medicaid beneficiary based on a digital driver license of the user holding the Medicaid beneficiary card. Some implementations may allow a consumer user to apply for benefits under a DHHS program by using a digital driver s license. Some implementations may allow a consumer to make credit card purchases by authenticating the consumer according to a digital driver license. Some implementations may include conducting background check for applicants for example coaches teachers etc based on digital driver s license. Some implementations may facilitate home healthcare uses with digital Medicaid card.

The systems here may be configured to support Internet virtual or IT centric systems. For example the system may be configured to link different internet connected systems so that an Internet banking system may be linked to support more elaborate operations within a social networking system e.g. share data or purchase prints . The internetworking may rely upon public networks e.g. the Internet or private e.g. a government corporate or private financial network . In one configuration the systems are configured to support enterprise IP networks. For example the systems may be configured to support an enterprise financial payment system that pays outside vendors. Disbursements below a threshold amount may require that an administrator authorize a transaction using input from a driver s license e.g. reading optical and authorization data from a driver s license reading system with an enterprise social network e.g. an intranet configured to interface with a user centric identity management system. For transactions involving disbursements above a threshold a passport reading system may be required to interface with an identity management module that requires a first identity module for a first user to interface with a second identity management module for a second user where the second user endorses the authorization of the first user.

The system may be configured to support virtual implementations where an identity management module is managed and controlled by the user. The user may authorize other modules to interface with the virtual machine management the identity. The virtual machine may act as a certificate authority and key manager or delegate other systems to act as certificate authority or key distributor on behalf of the user.

As noted above the systems may be configured to create tokens that reflect the authorization from multiple software and or hardware systems e.g. a physical token such as a printed driver s or a hybrid identification document such as a digital driver s license resident on a mobile phone . For example the user may wish to create a configuration through their identity management module whereby high risk transactions mortgage and credit card applications require both presentation of a digital token that reflects a sequence of authorization using both a messaging account e.g. Google s Gmail service a social networking account e.g. Facebook and a user presenting a passport through a passport reading application. The authorizations may be structured so that a first service acts upon information authenticated by the prior service. Thus a messaging time stamp may be processed to create a delegated Facebook token that is received by a passport processing application. The passport processing application may optically interrogate the passport based upon the received Facebook token. The resultant token received from the passport reading application may be passed onto a banking system for approval by a user s virtual identity management agent. The resultant hybrid token may be physically presented in the form of an electronic device electronic ID or electronic ID application resident on a smartphone to another user e.g. an authorizing official at the bank who in turn presents their own digital credential. Alternatively or in addition the transaction may be performed between software and server agents acting on behalf of the user and remote system e.g. banking system . The user may configure the token so that the token may be accessed and relied upon by a first user e.g. a first bank but not a second user e.g. a second bank . The user may specify a list of agents authorized to rely upon and access the particular token.

The resultant token may feature a drill down or hierarchical feature set. For example in a first case a user may create a general token that is used in a credit application for general applicability. The user may specify that a pool of banks are authorized to consider a credit application so long as the bank is participating in the accredited approval system and or specifies parameters in terms of certain rates and parameters. One or more banking systems may accept the preliminary request and contact the user s identity management module in order to receive more information. The user then may modify their token to include a more detailed credit application and only authorize the more detailed information for specified institutions.

The user agent may be configured to act as a user controllable key management agent and or certificate authority that selectively distributes keys delegates authority and acts as a certificate authority on behalf of the user. The user may specify one or more remote systems with whom the user agent is authorized to act as a certificate authority CA exchange keys and or share delegate information. In one configuration the user may instruct their agent perhaps resident on or hosted on a virtual machine accessible through a mobile device to use a first set of keys to support financial transactions less than a specified threshold for vendors willing to authenticate in a specified financial transaction network.
