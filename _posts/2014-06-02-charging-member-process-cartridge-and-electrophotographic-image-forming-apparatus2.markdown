This application is a continuation of International Application No. PCT JP2013 007552 filed Dec. 24 2013 which claims the benefit of Japanese Patent Application No. 2012 285242 filed Dec. 27 2012.

The present invention relates to a charging member a process cartridge and an electrophotographic image forming apparatus.

In an image forming apparatus using an electrophotographic method a charging member allows an electrophotographic photosensitive member hereinafter also referred to as photosensitive member to be charged to a predetermined potential. The charging member usually includes an elastic body such as rubber or elastomer of which surface is provided with a surface layer of for example cross linked urethane. A conducting agent is dispersed in the surface layer so as to impart conductivity.

Due to electric energy intermittently applied to the charging member in an electrophotographic image forming apparatus hereinafter also referred to as electrophotographic apparatus the electric resistance of the charging member gradually changes causing uneven charging and charging defects which result in image defects in some cases.

In Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. H03 9380 a technique for suppressing the occurrence of charging defects by addition of a hindered phenol material to the surface layer for suppression of deterioration of the surface layer material is disclosed.

As a result of investigation by the present inventors of the technique described in Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. H03 9380 however it was found that the charging member by the technique in Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. H03 9380 still caused charging defects due to changes in electric resistance over time in some cases. The present inventors assume the following cause.

A high voltage is usually applied to the charging member in an electrophotographic apparatus which discharges electricity to a photosensitive member to be charged resulting in generation of discharge products such as ozone and nitrogen oxides including NO. In the case of antioxidizing agent of hindered phenol material as described in Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. H03 9380 the antioxidizing ability under the presence of NOis inhibited by NOin some cases. The reason is believed that the antioxidizing agent of hindered phenol material itself causes chemical reaction with NO so as to form a stable quinone losing the function as antioxidizing agent. In other words the charging member by the technique of Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. H03 9380 has reduced antioxidizing ability of the hindered phenol compound due to generation of NOduring charging resulting in changes in electric resistance over time. Consequently the charging evenness is impaired.

The present invention is therefore directed to providing a charging member of which the electric resistance hardly changes even in a long term use so as to hardly cause image defects due to changes in electric resistance over time. The present invention is directed to providing a process cartridge and an electrophotographic apparatus capable of stably forming a high quality electrophotographic image.

The charging member of the present invention includes an electroconductive support and an electroconductive surface layer. The surface layer contains at least one compound selected from the group consisting of a compound represented by the following formula 1 a compound represented by the following formula 3 and a compound represented by the following formula 4 a binder resin and a conducting agent.

In the formula 1 Rrepresents a hydroxyl group or a substituent represented by the following formula 2 and Rto Reach independently represent a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group wherein at least one of Rto Ris a hydroxyl group.

In the formula 2 represents a bonding portion with the 3 position carbon atom of a compound represented by the formula 1 .

In the formula 3 Rto Reach independently represent an atom or a group selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom a hydroxyl group and a methoxy group wherein at least one of Rto Ris a hydroxyl group.

In the formula 4 Rto Reach independently represent an atom or a group selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom a hydroxyl group and a methoxy group wherein at least one of Rto Ris a hydroxyl group.

The present invention also provides an electrophotographic image forming apparatus having an electrophotographic photosensitive member and a charging member arranged to charge the electrophotographic photosensitive member wherein the charging member is the above described charging member.

Furthermore the present invention provides a process cartridge which integrally supports the charging member and at least one selected from the group consisting of an electrophotographic photosensitive member a developing unit a transferring unit and a cleaning unit and is detachably mountable to an electrophotographic image forming apparatus.

The present invention provides a charging member of which the electric resistance hardly changes even in a long term use so as to hardly cause image defects due to changes in electric resistance over time. The present invention also provides a process cartridge and an electrophotographic apparatus capable of stably forming a high quality electrophotographic image.

Further features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of exemplary embodiments with reference to the attached drawings.

Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail in accordance with the accompanying drawings.

The shape of a charging member of the present invention is not specifically limited including for example a roller shape a flat plate shape or a belt shape. Although the description is focused on the charging member in a roller shape hereinafter also referred to as charging roller in the following the present invention is not limited thereto.

The charging member of the present invention includes an electroconductive support and an electroconductive surface layer. A schematic cross sectional diagram of a charging member according to an example of the present invention is illustrated in . The charging member illustrated in is a charging roller having an electroconductive support an elastic layer formed on the support and an electroconductive surface layer formed on the elastic layer. In the present invention other layers e.g. an elastic layer and an adhesion layer may be arranged between the support and the surface layer formed on the support as described above.

As an electroconductive support substrate for use in the charging member of the present invention has conductivity volume resistivity 1 10 cm to 1 10 cm and function for supporting a layer such as surface layer to be arranged thereon. Examples of the material include a metal such as iron copper stainless steel aluminum and nickel and an alloy thereof.

The electroconductive surface layer contains at least one compound selected from the group consisting of a compound represented by the following formula 1 a compound represented by the following formula 3 and a compound represented by the following formula 4 a binder resin and a conducting agent.

In the formula 1 Rrepresents a hydroxyl group or a substituent represented by the following formula 2 and Rto Reach independently represent a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group wherein at least one of Rto Ris a hydroxyl group.

In the formula 2 represents a bonding portion with the 3 position carbon atom of the compound represented by the formula 1 .

In the formula 3 Rto Reach independently represent an atom or a group selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom a hydroxyl group and a methoxy group wherein at least one of Rto Ris a hydroxyl group.

In the formula 4 Rto Reach independently represent an atom or a group selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom a hydroxyl group and a methoxy group wherein at least one of Rto Ris a hydroxyl group.

The amount of the conducting agent contained in the surface layer compounded can be determined such that the surface layer has a middle range of resistance volume resistivity 1 10 cm to 1 10 cm under a low temperature and low humidity environment L L 15 C. 10 RH relative humidity a normal temperature and normal humidity environment N N 23 C. 55 RH and a high temperature and high humidity environment H H 30 C. 80 RH . The surface layer may further contain other additives to be described.

The compounds represented by the formula 1 formula 3 and formula 4 are referred to as flavans flavanones and flovones respectively which belong to flavonoids as a kind of polyphenols originally widely distributed in nature as a plant constituent. These compounds include a benzene ring basic skeleton which usually has a hydroxyl group.

The hydroxyl group is referred to as phenolic hydroxyl group. Although many parts of the detailed reaction mechanism are unknown yet it is assumed that the phenolic hydroxyl group supplies an electron or hydrogen atom to a radical molecule generated in a binder resin so as to form a phenoxy radical which is eliminated through resonance structure stabilization or polymerization into a dimer so that oxidative degradation of the material is prevented.

It is also assumed that the compounds have excellent radical elimination capability and antioxidative effect since the structure derived from the basic skeleton itself other than the phenolic hydroxyl group imparts an electron or hydrogen atom to a radical generated in a binder resin.

Furthermore being different from the antioxidizing agent of hindered phenol material these compounds have strong antioxidative effect even under presence of nitrogen oxides as discharge products so that free radicals formed from nitrogen oxides can be eliminated. In addition being different from the antioxidizing agent of hindered phenol material these compounds have no bulky alkyl group adjacent to a hydroxyl group so that the reaction rate with radicals can be increased due to the small steric barrier. It is therefore assumed that the resistance increase of a charging member is efficiently suppressed so that a high quality image can be maintained for a long period. One kind of these compounds may be used singly or a plurality of kinds of the compounds may be used in combination.

In the formula 1 Rrepresents a hydroxyl group or a substituent represented by the following formula 2 and Rto Reach independently represent a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group wherein at least one of Rto Ris a hydroxyl group.

In Table 1 H represents a hydrogen atom OH represents a hydroxyl group and Formula 2 represents a substituent represented by the following formula 2 .

In the formula 2 represents the bonding portion with the 3 position carbon atom of a compound represented by the formula 1 . The 3 position carbon atom of a compound represented by the formula 1 is the carbon atom with which Rin the formula 1 is bonded. Among the compounds represented by the formula 1 epicatechin epicatechin gallate epigallocatechin and epigallocatechin gallate can be used having a large number of hydroxyl groups in a molecule and excellent radical trapping ability and being relatively easily available.

In the formula 3 Rto Reach independently represent an atom or a group selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom a hydroxyl group and a methoxy group wherein at least one of Rto Ris a hydroxyl group.

In Table 2 H represents a hydrogen atom OH represents a hydroxyl group and OMe represents a methoxy group. Among the compounds represented by the formula 3 taxifolin can be used having many number of hydroxyl groups in a molecule and excellent radical trapping ability.

In the formula 4 Rto Reach independently represent an atom or a group selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom a hydroxyl group and a methoxy group wherein at least one of Rto Ris a hydroxyl group.

In Table 3 H represents a hydrogen atom OH represents a hydroxyl group and OMe represents a methoxy group. Among the compounds represented by the formula 4 quercetagetin and myricetin can be used having many number of hydroxyl groups in a molecule and excellent radical trapping ability.

The total amount of the specific flavonoids compounds represented by the formula 1 formula 3 and formula 4 respectively added in the surface layer is preferably 0.01 parts by mass or more and 10 parts by mass or less more preferably 0.05 parts by mass or more and 5 parts by mass or less relative to 100 parts by mass of the binder resin to be described below. With an amount added of 0.01 parts by mass or more the effect of the present invention may be easily obtained. With an amount added of 10 parts by mass or less reduction in strength of a binder resin may be easily prevented.

The total amount of these flavonoids in the surface layer can be 0.005 mass or more in considering of the effect for suppressing degradation due to electric conduction and can be 5 mass or less in considering of the film formability of the surface layer and moldability.

In the case of using flavans flavanones and flavones in combination the compounding ratios thereof are properly set without specific limitations.

Any structure of the compounds for use in the present invention represented by the formula 1 formula 3 and formula 4 respectively can be identified by NMR.

As the binder resin for use in the surface layer a known binder resin in the field of electrophotographic apparatus such as a thermosetting resin and a thermoplastic resin may be used. More specifically examples of the resin include a fluororesin a polyamide resin an acrylic resin a polyurethane resin an acrylic urethane resin and a butyral resin.

These binder resins may be used singly or two or more kinds of these may be mixed for use. The binder resin may be a homopolymer of one monomer or a copolymer of a plurality of monomers. Among these a thermosetting resin can be used as the binder resin for use in the surface layer from the view point of high release properties without causing contamination of a photosensitive member or other members.

The specific flavonoid for use in the present invention is a compound having excellent antioxidizing ability and the ability is expected to be shown not depending on the kind of binder resin to be added. These flavonoids tend to be rather hydrophilic so that a binder resin to be added having relatively low polarity tends to have affinity with the flavonoid compared to a resin having extremely high polarity. Consequently urethane resins are preferred among binder resins satisfying requisite characteristics for a charging member besides charging evenness. Among the urethane resins an acrylic urethane resin is preferred in particular.

Examples of the electron conducting agent include metallic fine particles of such as aluminum palladium iron copper and silver metal oxides such as titanium oxide tin oxide zinc oxide and silicon oxide the metal oxides and the above described metallic fine particles doped with a substance such as a dissimilar metal or a dissimilar metal oxide composite particles of metal oxide with surface treatment such as electrolysis spraying and mixing shaking and carbon particles carbon black such as furnace black thermal black acetylene black ketjen black PAN polyacrylonitrile based carbon and pitch based carbon.

Examples of the furnace black include SAF HS SAF ISAF HS ISAF ISAF LS I ISAF HS HAF HS HAF HAF LS T HS T NS MAF FEF GPF SRF HS HM SRF LM ECF and FEF HS. Examples of the thermal black include FT and MT.

Examples of the ionic conducting agent include an inorganic ionic material such as lithium perchlorate sodium perchlorate and calcium perchlorate a cationic surfactant such as lauryl trimethylammonium chloride stearyl trimethylammonium chloride octadecyl trimethylammonium chloride dodecyl trimethylammonium chloride hexadecyl trimethylammonium chloride trioctyl propylammonium bromide and modified aliphatic dimethyl ethyl ammonium ethosulfate a zwitterionic surfactant such as lauryl betaine stearyl betaine and dimethyl alkyl lauryl betaine a quaternary ammonium salt such as tetraethyl ammonium perchlorate tetrabutyl ammonium perchlorate and trimethyl octadecyl ammonium perchlorate and an organic lithium salt such as lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate.

These conducting agents may be used singly or in combinations of two or more kinds. The amount of the conducting agent added may be properly adjusted within the range allowing the desired electric resistance of a charging member to be obtained.

Other than the flavonoids the binder resin and the conducting agent additives such as a filler made of inorganic compound may be added to the surface layer on an as needed basis.

In the present invention an elastic layer may be arranged between the electroconductive support and the surface layer as described above.

The material for use in the elastic layer material for forming the elastic layer may include a polymer such as rubber and resin and various kinds of additives. Examples of the polymer include an epichlorohydrin rubber an acrylonitrile butadiene copolymer rubber NBR a chloroprene rubber a urethane rubber a silicone rubber and a thermoplastic elastomer such as a styrene butadiene styrene SBS block copolymer and a styrene ethylenebutylene styrene SEBS block copolymer any of which can be used. Among them the use of polar rubber is more preferred allowing for easy adjustment of resistance. Among the polar rubbers the use of epichlorohydrin rubber or NBR is particularly preferred having advantages allowing for more easy control of the resistance and hardness of an elastic layer. These polymers may be used singly or a plurality of kinds may be used in combination.

The polymer itself of epichlorohydrin rubber has a conductivity in the medium resistance range capable of for example easily having excellent conductivity even with a small amount of conductive particles added. Furthermore the epichlorohydrin rubber allows the variation of electric resistance in positional difference to be reduced being suitable for use as a polymer elastic body. Examples of the epichlorohydrin rubber include an epichlorohydrin homopolymer an epichlorohydrin ethylene oxide copolymer an epichlorohydrin allyl glycidyl ether copolymer and an epichlorohydrin ethylene oxide allyl glycidyl ether ternary copolymer. In particular an epichlorohydrin ethylene oxide allyl glycidyl ether ternary copolymer can be used among them having stable conductivity in the medium resistance range. The degree of polymerization and the composition ratio of the epichlorohydrin ethylene oxide allyl glycidyl ether ternary copolymer are arbitrarily adjusted so that the conductivity and the workability may be easily controlled.

The elastic layer may include an epichlorohydrin rubber alone or may include an epichlorohydrin rubber as main component component having the highest content in the elastic layer and other common rubbers and thermoplastic elastomers on an as needed basis. Examples of the other common rubbers include an ethylene propylene rubber EPM an ethylene propylene diene EPDM copolymer NBR a chloroprene rubber a natural rubber an isoprene rubber a butadiene rubber a styrene butadiene rubber a urethane rubber and a silicone rubber. Examples of the other thermoplastic elastomers include SBS and SEBS.

Other than the polymers the elastic layer may also include additives such as a conducting agent e.g. conductive particles a plasticizer an extender a vulcanizing agent a vulcanizing accelerator an antiaging agent and a foaming agent.

The charging member of the present invention can usually have an electric resistance of 1 10 or more and 1 10 or less under an environment at 23 C. 50 RH relative humidity so as to achieve excellent charging of a photosensitive member.

An example of the measurement method of the electric resistance of a charging member the elastic layer and surface layer part in particular is illustrated in . A shaft bearing not shown in drawing allows the exposed parts of the electroconductive support at both ends of a charging roller to be contacted in parallel with a cylindrical metal . The cylindrical metal is rotated with a motor not shown in drawing in this state and the contacting charging roller is rotary driven to which a DC voltage of 200 V is applied from a stabilized power source . On this occasion the current flowing in a reference resistance is measured with an ammeter so as to calculate the resistance of the charging roller. On this occasion the load applied to each of both ends of the charging roller is set at 4.9 N for one end and the rotation speed of the cylindrical metal is set at a circumferential velocity of 45 mm sec.

A charging member of the present invention may be prepared by a manufacturing method including the step of applying a surface layer forming material which contains at least one of the compounds represented by the formula 1 formula 3 and formula 4 respectively a binder resin and a conducting agent onto an electroconductive support for the formation of an electroconductive surface layer.

In the case of forming an elastic layer the method may include prior to the above described step the steps of forming an elastic layer on the electroconductive support and grinding the surface of the produced elastic layer.

Firstly a polymer and various additives are kneaded with a kneader so as to prepare a raw material rubber composition elastic layer forming material . Examples of the kneader include a ribbon blender a Nauta mixer a Henschel mixer a super mixer a Bambury mixer and a pressure kneader.

Subsequently the raw material rubber composition is applied onto the electroconductive support e.g. surface so as to form an elastic layer. More specifically the following method may be employed. For example using an extrusion forming device having a cross head as illustrated in an electroconductive support applied with an adhesive is fed to a cross head with an electroconductive support feeding roll . Meanwhile the raw material rubber composition is extruded from an extruder so that the electroconductive support as central shaft is coaxially coated with the raw material rubber composition in a cylindrical shape. The electroconductive support and the elastic layer forming material are thus integrally extruded to form the preformed body of a charging member.

The cross head is a device commonly used for covering electrical cables and wires being attached for use to a rubber discharge part of the cylinder of an extruder.

In an alternative method a rubber tube made of the raw material rubber composition is formed to which an electroconductive support coated with an adhesive is inserted in the tube to be bonded. In another alternative method an electroconductive support coated with an adhesive is covered with an unvulcanized rubber sheet made of the raw material rubber composition so as to be vulcanized in a mold. As described above the heating operation vulcanizing operation may be performed during formation of an elastic layer according to the material for use in the raw material rubber composition.

Subsequently the surface of the produced elastic layer may be polished on an as needed basis. As a grinding device a cylindrical grinding machine for forming a predetermined outer diameter may be used. Examples of the cylindrical grinding machine include a traverse type NC cylindrical grinding machine and a plunge cut type NC cylindrical grinding machine. A plunge cut type NC cylindrical grinding machine is preferred capable of reducing the processing time through use of a wider grinding stone compared to a traverse type machine with a smaller change in diameter of the grinding stone.

Subsequently a coating liquid of the surface layer forming material is applied onto the produced elastic layer onto the electroconductive support in the case of no elastic layer so as to form the surface layer. Examples of the coating method include a vertical ring coating method a dip coating method an immersion coating method a spray coating method a roll coating method a curtain coating method and a gravure printing method. Among them a vertical ring coating method and a dip coating method are most commonly used.

The schematic constitution diagram of an electrophotographic image forming apparatus having the charging member of the present invention is illustrated in .

An electrophotographic photosensitive member is a rotary drum type having a photosensitive layer on a conductive substrate. The photosensitive member is rotary driven in the arrow direction at a predetermined circumferential velocity process speed .

The charging device includes a contact type charging roller to be arranged in contact with the photosensitive member with a predetermined pressing force. A charging roller is rotary driven following the rotation of the photosensitive member. The photosensitive member is chargeable to a predetermined potential by applying a predetermined DC voltage to the charging roller from a power source for charging .

As a latent image forming device not shown in drawing for forming an electrostatic latent image on the photosensitive member for example an exposure device such as a laser beam scanner is used. The evenly charged photosensitive member is irradiated with exposure light corresponding to the image information so as to form an electrostatic latent image.

A developing device includes a developing roller arranged adjacent to or in contact with the photosensitive member . The developing roller allows the toner electrostatically treated in the same polarity as the charged polarity of the photosensitive member to form a toner image from the electrostatic latent image through reversal development.

A transferring roller transfers the toner image from the photosensitive member to a transfer material the transfer material is conveyed by a paper supply system having a conveying member . A cleaning device including a blade type cleaning member and a collection container mechanically scrapes off the toner remaining after transferring on the photosensitive member for collection after transferring.

A fixing device including a heated roll and the like fixes the transferred toner image on the transfer material which is discharged outside the machine.

The electrophotographic apparatus of the present invention may also include for example the following process cartridge exposure device and fixing device.

The electrophotographic apparatus of the present invention may also use a process cartridge of the present invention which integrates integrally supports the charging member and at least one selected from the group consisting of a electrophotographic photosensitive member a developing device developing unit a transferring device transferring unit and a cleaning device cleaning unit being designed to be detachably mountable to the electrophotographic apparatus. An example of the process cartridge is illustrated in . In the process cartridge the charging member charging roller is integrated with a member to be charged photosensitive member and detachably mountable to a main body of the electrophotographic apparatus. As the charging member the charging member of the present invention is used. The reference signs and represent an elasticity restricting blade and a toner seal respectively.

An elastic roller having an elastic layer on an electroconductive support was manufactured as follows.

To a stainless steel rod having a diameter of 6 mm and a length of 252.5 mm was coated with a thermosetting adhesive trade name METALOC U 20 made by Toyokagaku Kenkyusho Co. Ltd. which was then dried for use as the electroconductive support.

In manufacturing a raw material rubber composition for the rubber elastic layer the materials shown in the following Table 4 were kneaded for 15 minutes with a closed type mixer having a capacity of 6 litters adjusted at 50 C. In Table 4 EO represents ethylene oxide EP represents epichlorohydrin and AGE represents allyl glycidyl ether.

The materials described in the following Table 5 were added to the above which were kneaded for 10 minutes with a two roll mill cooled at 25 C. so as to prepare a raw material rubber composition.

Subsequently using an extrusion forming device having a cross head as illustrated in a raw material rubber composition is coaxially applied in a cylindrical shape onto a electroconductive support as central shaft so that the preformed body of a charging member having a raw material rubber composition layer with an outer diameter of 12.5 mm was produced.

Subsequently the preformed body of a charging member was heated at 160 C. for 1 hour with an electric oven for vulcanization and curing of the adhesive. The raw material rubber composition layer at both ends of the electroconductive support was removed such that the raw material composition layer had a length of 228 mm in the axial direction of the support. The surface was then ground such that the roller had a shape with an outer diameter of 12 mm at the center. The elastic roller having an elastic layer on an electroconductive support was thus produced. The crown amount difference in outer diameter at the center and at a position 90 mm away from the center of the roller was 120 m.

A surface layer coating material including an acrylic urethane resin as binder resin was prepared as follows.

Firstly methyl isobutyl ketone was added to caprolactone modified acrylic polyol solution trade name Placcel DC2016 made by Dicel Corporation so as to adjust to have 14 mass of solid content. To 720 parts by mass of the solution the materials shown in the following Table 6 were added to prepare a mixed solution.

Subsequently 200 g of the mixed solution and 200 g of glass beads as a dispersion medium having a central particle diameter of 0.6 mm to 0.85 mm glass beads remained on a mesh having an aperture of 0.65 mm after screening with a mesh having an aperture of 0.85 mm and further screening with a mesh having an aperture of 0.65 mm were placed in a glass bottle having a capacity of 450 mL and dispersed for 48 hours with a paint shaker so that a dispersion liquid was obtained.

Subsequently 0.224 g of epigallocatechin gallate 1 parts by mass relative to 100 parts by mass of acrylic polyol solid content was added to the dispersion liquid and further dispersed for 5 minutes.

The glass beads were then removed by filtration so that the surface layer coating material was obtained.

The elastic roller was coated with the surface layer coating material by one time dipping. The coated roller was air dried at normal temperature 23 C. for 30 minutes or more and further dried at 80 C. for 1 hour and 160 C. for 1 hour with a hot air circulation dryer so as to produce a charging roller having a surface layer on the elastic roller.

On this occasion the dip coating was performed under the following conditions. The dipping time was 9 seconds. The pulling up rate of the dip coat was changed linearly with time from an initial rate of 20 mm s to an final rate of 2 mm s.

Except that the amount of epigallocatechin gallate added for use in manufacturing the surface layer coating material was changed as described in Table 8 charging rollers to were obtained by the same method as in Example 1.

Except that the surface layer coating material was changed to the following surface layer coating material a charging roller was obtained by the same method as in Example 1.

Firstly 200 g of the mixed solution including the materials described in the following Table 7 and 200 g of glass beads as a dispersion medium having a central particle diameter of 0.6 mm to 0.85 mm glass beads remained on a mesh having an aperture of 0.65 mm after screening with a mesh having an aperture of 0.85 mm and further screening with a mesh having an aperture of 0.65 mm were placed in a glass bottle having a capacity of 450 mL and dispersed for 24 hours with a paint shaker so that a dispersion liquid was obtained.

Subsequently 0.19 g of epigallocatechin gallate 0.5 parts by mass relative to 100 parts by mass of methoxy methylated nylon solid content was added to the dispersion liquid and further dispersed for 5 minutes. The glass beads were then removed by filtration so that the surface layer coating material was obtained.

Except that epigallocatechin gallate for use in manufacturing the surface layer coating material was changed to a compound flavonoid described in Table 8 with an amount added described in Table 8 charging rollers to were obtained by the same method as in Example 1.

Except that epigallocatechin gallate for use in manufacturing the surface layer coating material was changed to a hindered phenol based antioxidizing agent trade name IRGANOX 1010 made by Toyotsu Chemiplas Corporation with an amount added of 0.5 parts by mass a charging roller was obtained by the same method as in Example 1.

Except that no epigallocatechin gallate was added to the surface layer coating material a charging roller was obtained by the same method as in Example 1.

For use as the electrophotographic apparatus having a configuration as illustrated in a color laser jet printer made by Hewlett Packard Development Company trade name HP COLOR LASERJET 4700DN was modified to have a recording medium output speed of 200 mm sec A4 vertical output . The image resolution was 600 dpi and the output DC voltage of primary charging was 1 100 V.

As the process cartridge having the configuration illustrated in the process cartridge for black for the printer was used. The charging roller produced in each of the examples was mounted to the process cartridge.

Subsequently a durability test was performed under a high temperature and high humidity environment 30 C. 80 RH . In the durability test conditions 15 000 15 k sheets of paper were intermittently fed through 3 second halt after feeding 2 sheets through with a print coverage rate of 2 . A half tone image image drawn by horizontal lines having a width of 1 dot and a space of 2 dots in the direction vertical to the rotation direction of the photosensitive member was then outputted for the evaluation of the streak like image existing on the halftone image according to the following criteria 

Rank D a level at which streak like images occur over the whole area seriously reducing the image quality.

The electric resistance of the charging roller was also measured in the early phase prior to the durability test and after the 15 k durability test. On this occasion the electric resistance was measured with the device illustrated in . More specifically a shaft bearing not shown in drawing allowed the exposed parts of the electroconductive support at both ends of a charging roller to be contacted in parallel with a cylindrical metal . The cylindrical metal was rotated with a motor not shown in drawing in this state and the contacting charging roller was rotary driven to which a DC voltage of 200 V was applied from a stabilized power source . On this occasion the current flowing in a reference resistance was measured with an ammeter so as to calculate the resistance of the charging roller. On this occasion the load applied to each of both ends of the charging roller was set at 4.9 N for one end and the rotation speed of the cylindrical metal was set at a circumferential velocity of 45 mm sec.

The evaluation results for the respective charging rollers obtained in Examples 1 to 21 and Comparative Examples 1 and 2 are described in Table 8.

In Comparative Examples 1 and 2 the change in electric resistance of the charging roller was large between before and after the durability test so that the charging ability was not sufficiently maintained. From the results it is indicated that the charging roller added with a hindered phenol based antioxidizing agent maintains no charging ability under presence of nitrogen oxides as discharge products due to deactivation of the radical trapping ability.

On the other hand in Examples 1 to 21 the change in electric resistance of the charging roller was small between before and after the durability test compared to the results in Comparative Examples. It was therefore confirmed that the charging ability can be maintained by addition of a specific flavonoid to the surface layer.

While the present invention has been described with reference to exemplary embodiments it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed exemplary embodiments. The scope of the following claims is to be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and equivalent structures and functions.

This application claims the benefit of Japanese Patent Application No. 2012 285242 filed Dec. 27 2012 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
