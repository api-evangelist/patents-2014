This application is a continuation of and claims priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 253 748 filed on Apr. 15 2014 and entitled REGULATION OF SERVICE IN RESTRICTED TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICE AREA which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 873 968 filed on Apr. 30 2013 issued as U.S. Pat. No. 8 761 661 on Jun. 24 2014 which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 492 484 filed on Jun. 8 2012 issued as U.S. Pat. No. 8 452 305 on May 28 2013 which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 576 924 filed on Oct. 9 2009 issued as U.S. Pat. No. 8 224 233 on Jul. 17 2012 . Priority is claimed to each of these applications and the entireties of these applications are incorporated herein by reference.

The subject application relates to wireless communications and more particularly to controlling access to wireless resources and monitoring wireless activity and locating sources thereof within areas in which telecommunication is restricted.

Unauthorized wireless use is a major problem in restricted areas. The problem is particularly exacerbated in restricted areas in which telecommunication can lead to illicit activities or can cause harm to wireless user or third party. Various issues can originate from unauthorized wireless use. Using short message service SMS prisoners in correctional facility may control illegal outside activities. Accessing messaging applications in mobile device may enable students to misrepresent knowledge or ability in examinations. Industrial or governmental spies may collect and deliver classified or proprietary information. Air controller that diverts attention from control activities to attend to cellphone call may cause aircraft collision with possible loss of life. Inconsiderate wireless users may disturb others in confined settings such as a theater a church a library or the like.

To mitigate unauthorized wireless communication in restricted areas typically adopted solutions relay primarily on negation of wireless resources e.g. electromagnetic spectrum bandwidth through deliberate spectral interference such solutions are commonly known as radio jamming. Even though radio jamming is widely available and employed it generally displays a number of utility inefficiencies 1 Lack of spectral selectivity. For a specific block of EM spectrum all radio frequencies users and calls sessions including emergency e.g. E911 calls are blocked. The latter may lead to safety issues for users in the restricted areas. 2 Inability to allow for user tracing or location. Radio jammed calls cannot be traced or located. 3 Substantial implementation costs. Conventional radio jamming exploits considerable expensive equipment and consumes significant power to negate wireless resources in wide blocks of EM spectrum. Such inefficiencies typically result in inadequate solutions for preventing unauthorized wireless communication in restricted areas.

The subject application provides system s device s and method s to regulate telecommunication service in a confined area in which telecommunication is restricted. Regulation of the telecommunication service includes control of wireless resources and access thereto and monitoring wireless activity and locating sources thereof within the confined area. Regulation can be accomplished through networked femtocell access points and distributed antenna systems DASs even though system s without DASs also can provide substantially the same efficiencies. In implementation s based on DAS transmission points can be distributed throughout the confined area in configuration that promotes generation of attachment signaling. A centralized component can manage at least a portion of regulation of the telecommunication service.

Control of wireless resources is accomplished through selective negation or selective radio jamming within the confined area. The selective radio jamming can be updated based on performance metrics of telecommunication service as provided in the wireless environment of the confined area. Updates can be effected through scanning of wireless environment at times which can be scheduled or determined based at least in part on the performance metrics. Such determination can be autonomously or automatically implemented. Configurable lists that authorize mobile device s to consume wireless service within the confined area control access to wireless resources. Access can be granted or denied statically or dynamically. Static grant or denial of access can be based on features of utilization of telecommunication service within the confined area such as known presence of specific mobile devices in the confined area during specific periods whereas dynamic grant or denial includes interactive or on demand inclusion of mobile device s to one or more of the lists.

Monitoring of wireless activity within the confined area includes tracking and recordation of signaling or traffic activity. Recorded wireless activity can serve to generate intelligence on utilization of telecommunication service. In addition various alarms can be delivered in accordance with control criteria and detected wireless activity. The monitoring of signaling activity also can enable location of a source of wireless activity while monitoring of traffic can lead to identification of a user thereof.

It should be appreciated that aspects features or advantages of the subject application are network and radio technology agnostic and can be exploited in substantially any network and through most any or any wireless communication technology.

As described in greater detail below the subject application provides system s and method s that enable regulation of telecommunication service in a confined area in which telecommunication is restricted. Regulation includes control of wireless resources and access thereto and monitoring wireless activity and locating sources thereof within the confined area. Regulation can be accomplished through networked femtocell access points and distributed antenna systems. Control of wireless resources is accomplished through selective jamming within the confined area selective jamming can be updated based on performance metrics of telecommunication service.

At least an advantage of the subject application is the scalability of the system s described herein afforded by utilization of low cost femtocell access points and functional elements e.g. server s for control thereof. At least another advantage of the subject application is the improved versatility of service domination access control and tracking features with respect to conventional jamming systems. In the subject application service domination is selective and thus does not rely on blocking substantial portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Accordingly service domination as described herein allows service provisions particularly of emergency calls. With respect to access control provision of service within confined restricted area does not adversely affect privacy and can be customized to accommodate requirement of different mission specific restricted areas. Customization of access to service affords improved service quality and reliability for authorized users. With respect to tracking the subject application can enable location of unauthorized devices operating within the confined restricted area since specific control and data wireless signals can propagate therein in view of the selective jamming provided in the subject application.

It is noted that features or aspects described in the subject application can rely at least in part on delivery or reception of directive s indication s request s or the like and information or payload data e.g. content s associated therewith. Directive s can be embodied in multi bit words e.g. P bit words with P an integer and coded to specifically convey a request s to a particular functional element e.g. a femtocell AP in order to execute specific operation s .

In addition directive s request s indication s or the like as described herein can be delivered in accordance with various protocols such as file transfer protocol FTP secure shell FTP SFTP FTP over secure socket layer FTPS short message service SMS protocol multimedia messaging service MMS protocol unstructured supplementary service data USSD standard simple network management protocol SNMP or the like.

With respect to the drawings is a block diagram of an example system that enables regulation of wireless service within an indoors restricted area in accordance with aspects described herein. The indoors restricted area can be a correctional facility a classroom or lecture hall in an educational institution entertainment premises such as a theater a meeting room in a public or private sector organization wherein sensitive confidential or classified subject matter is disclosed a church a library or the like. Example system is deployed within a region indicated as Indoor in drawing that comprises the indoors restricted area. The example system includes a set of N femto access points with N a natural number functionally connected to an administration component which is functionally coupled to a set of N transmission points and linked to a femtocell network platform femtocell gateway node s server s memory ies etc. via backhaul link and through a backhaul network that is part of access network s AN s . In an aspect backhaul link can be embodied in one or more wired backbone network pipes such as an optical fiber backbone a twisted pair line a T1 E1 phone line a digital subscriber line DSL either synchronous or asynchronous an asymmetric DSL a coaxial cable or the like. Backhaul link also can include one or more wireless backbone link s e.g. a line of sight LOS or a non LOS wireless link. In UMTS based radio technology backhaul link is embodied at least in part in Iuh interface.

Administration component can receive radio signals e.g. radio frequency RF signals in digital format generated at a femtocell AP e.g. and convert such radio signal s to signal s that can be delivered to transmission point s e.g. linked to the femtocell AP and therefore relayed to a mobile device e.g. . For instance the radio signals can be converted to light signals which can be transported through a fiber optic link to the transmission point s . In an aspect conversion of radio signal s at administration component can be effected by switch component . Likewise administration component can receive non wireless signal s from one or more transmission point s e.g. convert such signal s to a format or transport protocol e.g. internet protocol that can be consumed at a femto AP and relay such signal s to femto AP s associated with the one or more transmission point s . The non wireless signal s can include traffic and signaling generated by a served mobile device e.g. . In another aspect switch component can receive the non wireless signals and effect the described conversion.

Administration component also includes a router component that manages traffic and signaling received from a serving femtocell network platform not shown and directed to one or more of femtocell APs . Signaling and traffic decoded at femto AP s can be transmitted to administration component which delivers the decoded signaling and traffic to the serving femtocell network platform in an aspect router component manages delivery of such decoded signaling and traffic. To implement management of traffic and signaling router component can schedule queue address prioritize assemble and identify packets and so forth. Router component also can manage non wireless signal s received from one or more transmission point s and that are formatted to be consumed at one or more femto AP.

To enable delivery of non wireless signals each transmission point in sets of transmission point s include a set of one of more switches linked to a set of one or more respective antennas it should be appreciated that in an aspect a single transmission point includes a single switch antenna pair. Switch converts wireless signals e.g. radiofrequency RF signals received through antenna to signals that can be propagated to administration component and relayed to a femto AP there from as an example wireless signals can be converted to light signals that can be propagated through a fiber optic link that operationally connects transmission point s to administration component .

In an aspect of the subject application each femtocell AP with 1 2 . . . N has a unique non reused location area code LAC which is transmitted through respective transmission point s . In addition to being mutually different such location area codes LAC LAC N are different from external control channels delivered by base station s and detected through scanning of wireless environment as described herein. While LAC is an identifying pilot signal specific to UMTS based technology femtocell AP that operate in other radio technology also can be identified as described herein with pilot sequences or codes suitable to the other radio technology. Transmission points are distributed throughout the restricted area in a correlated manner that results in each antenna in a transmission point having a set of nearest neighbor antennas with disparate LACs. Such distribution referred to herein as interleaved distribution of transmission points leads a mobile device not shown that operates in the restricted area to detect disparate LAC s and exchange e.g. transmission and reception attachment signaling with transmission point s as mobile device enters and moves in idle mode within the restricted area. In an aspect in UMTS based radio technology the attachment signaling can include at least one of location area update LAU signaling or routing area update RAU signaling. It is noted that in radio technologies other than 3GPP UMTS alternative identifier s can be employed for each femto AP in order to force a mobile device to deliver attachment signaling when roaming from one transmission point to another. Such strategic distribution of transmission point s throughout the restricted area enables at least in part at least one of domination of service coverage or location of unauthorized mobile device s . It is noted that in one or more additional or alternative embodiments example system can have femtocell APs deployed throughout the indoors restricted area in accordance with the foregoing interleaved distribution and without reliance on transmission points for communication of wireless signals with such communication accomplished through one or more antennas in each of the femtocell APs .

In another aspect of the subject application administration component can regulate at least in part wireless resources within the restricted area in which transmission points are deployed. Regulation includes domination of wireless resources or spectrum domination in an aspect domination entails selective blockade of specific radio channels in which control data is communicated by a set of macrocellular base stations through over the air link s . To implement domination of wireless resources administration component includes a control component that configures scanning of wireless environment in the vicinity of deployed transmission points . One or more of femto APs scan at least in part the wireless environment and identify a set of control channels delivered by the set of base stations . The one or more femtocell APs schedule a set of frequency carriers that spectrally overlap the identified set of control channels and transmit the frequency carriers transmission is implemented via administration component or one or more components therein such as router component and switch component and one or more transmission points .

In addition administration component can control at least one of traffic or signaling collected at and delivered to one or more of transmission points . As part of control administration component can monitor via control component at least one of signaling or traffic served through femto APs and delivered through one or more of transmission points . Monitoring of such signaling and traffic can be initiated in response to specific attachment signaling e.g. LAU or RAU for instance initial attachment signaling detected from a specific mobile device identifier e.g. IMSI that enters the indoor restricted area can commence monitoring. Additionally monitoring of traffic can be accomplished in accordance with Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act CALEA requirements or other legal framework or means. Monitored traffic and signaling can be retained in memory in an aspect retention protocol of the monitored traffic and signaling can be consistent with CALEA.

In addition as an alternative or further part of control administration component also can generate and deliver entry alarm s or notification s to equipment mobile or otherwise associated with administration component for example the entry alarm s or notifications can be conveyed to a computer terminal and rendered in a display interface linked thereto. Moreover femto AP s also can generate and deliver alarm s or notification s in response to specific attachment signaling e.g. initial LAU or RAU upon entry of UE into indoor restricted area. The alarm s or notification s generated by at least one of administration control or the femto AP s can include automated call session s e.g. voice or data or automated message s such as SMS communication MMS communication or the like. Script s of the automated call session s or message s can be retained in at least memory . One such illustrative script can convey the following message unauthorized wireless access monitoring activated and be delivered to an unauthorized mobile device within confined restricted area. Alarm s and notification s can be recorded in memory .

Unauthorized mobile device can be detected by a femtocell AP in the set of femto APs . Detection of unauthorized mobile devices also is a part of access control to wireless service and can be comprised within regulation of telecommunication service as disclosed in the subject application. The unauthorized mobile device can be negated wireless service or granted access to service on at least a temporary basis. Temporary access to wireless service can enable monitoring of at least one of signaling or traffic generated through the unauthorized mobile device which can be advantageously exploited if administration component or a manager thereof human agent or automated component for example the administration of a correctional facility intends to utilize call session information to identify user s of the unauthorized mobile device e.g. or associate s or to generate intelligence e.g. a profile related to the unauthorized user s or associate s .

In an aspect access control to wireless service is based at least in part on access control list s ACL s that can be retained in each femto AP in the set of femto APs access control protocol is activated by reception of attachment signaling at any of femto AP in such set. An ACL can be associated with one or more femto APs. Such association can be at least one of the following. i One to none e.g. the ACL is logically available and retained in memory but not is provisioned to a femtocell AP. ii One to one association wherein the ACL is provisioned to a single femtocell AP. iii A many to one association which occurs if wireless environment s associated with transmission point s linked to a single femtocell AP can serve disparate locations within the confined restricted area and thus disparate groups of users each group with a dedicated ALC the latter can be the case in which example system is deployed in an enterprise environment. An ACL includes a set of field attributes that regulate access to telecommunication service and features of provision thereof via the one or more femto APs. In particular one of the field attributes identifies mobile number of wireless device authorized to receive telecommunication service through the one or more femto APs to which the ACL is associated.

If a femto AP with LAC J 1 J N in the set of femto APs receives attachment signaling e.g. LAU signaling or RAU signaling originated by a mobile device e.g. femto AP validates an identity of the mobile device as conveyed in the attachment signaling against an ACL that can reside in femto AP . If the identity of the mobile device matches a respective mobile number or mobile identity in the ACL the attachment procedure associated with attachment signaling is completed and femto AP allows the mobile device to camp therein and establish call sessions normally. If camped in femto AP J the mobile device can receive LAC J recognize it and display a unique alphanumeric indicator that conveys telecommunication service is supplied through a femtocell AP. In the alternative if validation against the ACL reveals no match amongst the identity of the mobile device and mobile identity ies retained in the ACL femto AP rejects the attachment signaling and the mobile device is allowed only to establish emergency calls.

It is noted that ACL s also can include other field attributes that control service access logic for an identified mobile number wherein such logic includes at least one of service priority access schedule or time constraints access quality of service forwarding number s auto reply configuration or the like. In an example if an employee whose mobile device is included in ACL s is in a supervisor role within an organization that deploys and utilizes example system the employee can receive telecommunication service with higher priority than another employee whose device also is identified in ACL s but is in a supervisee role. In another example the mobile number of the mobile device of the supervisee can have a field attribute in ACL s that indicates the femtocell AP to forward received calls to a disparate mobile number e.g. the supervisor phone. It is noted that ACL s and attribute s therein can enable access to service for an identified mobile device during a specific period of time thus an employee of the foregoing organization can be afforded wireless service in a personal mobile device at times outside the employee s job shift or at times the employee is not engaged in mission critical activities. In an example scenario a mobile device of a surgeon can be included in an ACL but negated wireless service during a surgery session. In another example scenario a mobile device of a student can be configured in an ACL to receive service at times other than in a test.

It is also noted that provision and negation of telecommunication service via ACL s can be accomplished without configuration of field attributes that establish a specific service logic for example the femtocell AP can receive updated instances of ACL s through a specific period wherein the updated instances include or exclude a specific mobile number. While less complex such alternative to manage access to wireless service can increase processing load in the femtocell AP.

Control of access to telecommunication service based on access control list s as described supra can enhance coverage and service quality for all emergency calls and most any non emergency voice and data call sessions. To implement at least in part such access control administration component can generate an access control list ACL and include or exclude a mobile device identifier e.g. IMSI from the generated ACL. Generation of an ACL can occur at a time of provisioning a femtocell AP within example system . At a time the ACL is generated administration component can pre populate or preset the ACL with a set of mobile device identifiers linked to a predetermined set of individuals such as all employees of an organization that deploys and utilizes example system . Inclusion or exclusion of mobile device identifier can be automatically implemented in accordance with manipulation criteria that dictate instance in which the ACL is to be updated. Manipulation criteria can include time based criteria such as schedule s based on employee work shift. In the alternative or in addition inclusion or exclusion can be effected interactively or on demand through reception of requests to update the ACL and grant thereof. For example identifier of mobile device of a specific authorized visitor can be added to an ACL or a mobile device identifier can be added to an ACL for a predetermined period to allow and monitor call sessions for an unauthorized mobile device wherein monitoring of the unauthorized mobile device can include identification of number s called by the unauthorized mobile device or number s that place a call thereto. Administration component can grant or decline a request to update an ACL based on update privileges of a requestor e.g. a human agent that manages administration component . In an aspect inclusion of the mobile device identifier or exclusion thereof from an ACL can determine at least in part whether a mobile device is monitored or located within the indoor restricted area.

Interactive inclusion in an ACL of an unauthorized mobile device can be effected in response to receiving unauthorized attachment signaling from the mobile device. Control component can request identification credential s interactively from the mobile device and populate an ACL if an indication of consent to be monitored is received. Identification credential s can be received through terminal via a network that is part of AN s . In case the confined restricted in which example system is deployed is embodied in a correctional facility terminal can be part of a guarded entry point.

In example system processor can be configured to provide or can provide at least in part the described functionality of administration component and various components therein. Processor also can be configured to provide or can provide at least part of the functionality of femto AP or transmission point s . To provide such functionality processor can exploit bus to exchange data or any other information amongst disclosed memory ies and component s or subcomponents bus can be embodied in at least one of a memory bus a system bus an address bus a message bus a reference link or any other conduit protocol or mechanism for data or information exchange. The information can include at least one of code instructions code structure s data structures or the like.

In one or more embodiment s processor can be distributed amongst two or more components that reside administration component . Further in some embodiments components that comprise administration component can reside within memory as one or more sets of code instructions that when executed by processor implement the various components and described functionality thereof.

Communication platform comprises electronic components and associated circuitry that enable processing and manipulation e.g. coding decoding deciphering modulation demodulation of signal s received by femto AP and signal s to be transmitted by femto AP received or transmitted signal s are modulated and coded or otherwise processed in accordance with various radio technology protocols e.g. 3GPP UMTS 3GPP LTE . . . .

Electronic mux demux component can multiplex and demultiplex information data traffic and control signaling according to various multiplexing schemes such as time division multiplexing TDM frequency division multiplexing FDM orthogonal frequency division multiplexing OFDM code division multiplexing CDM space division multiplexing SDM . In addition mux demux component can scramble and spread information e.g. codes according to substantially any code e.g. Hadamard Walsh codes Baker codes Kasami codes polyphase codes and so on. A modulator demodulator mod demod component also is a part of communication platform and can modulate and demodulate information according to various modulation techniques such as frequency modulation e.g. frequency shift keying amplitude modulation e.g. M ary quadrature amplitude modulation QAM with M a positive integer amplitude shift keying ASK phase shift keying PSK and the like.

Conventionally as part of configuration or re configuration a femtocell AP may scan wireless activity and associated data to determine satisfactory operating parameters such as channel s in spectrum areas of least interference and avoid transmission of femtocell carriers in spectral regions that transport external control channels. In the subject application femto AP scans and decodes signals associated with macro wireless coverage within the indoor wireless environment in vicinity of a transmission point e.g. in order to dominate wireless resources and service without avoidance of spectral regions that transport external control channels. Scanned signals are downlink signals and can include at least one of pilot signal s and system broadcast message s and traffic signal s . System broadcast message s can be specific message s linked to specific radio technologies and conveyed through disparate frequency carriers.

A scan conducted by femto AP or most any or any indoor based access point can survey and compare wireless signals transported in a set of electromagnetic EM radiation frequency bands and in accordance with a set of telecommunication protocols associated with respective set of radio technologies. Signal s originated within the set of EM radiation frequency bands can be processed at least in part by communication platform . The set of EM frequency bands which can comprise radio frequency RF portion s and microwave portion s of the EM spectrum and the set of radio technologies can be determined by a network operator that manages femtocell AP and an associated femtocell network. In addition the set of EM frequency bands can include all EM frequency bands licensed by a telecommunication carrier e.g. personal communication services PCS advanced wireless services AWS general wireless communications service GWCS and so forth or all unlicensed frequency bands currently available for telecommunication e.g. the 2.4 GHz industrial scientific and medical ISM band or one or more of the 5 GHz set of bands . The telecommunication carrier can be the network operator that administers wireless service via the femtocell AP or through macrocellular base stations or it can be a competing network operator. Accordingly survey of such EM frequency bands can allow collection of signaling data delivered from base stations that provide macro wireless service and are operated by a telecommunication carrier. The set of radio technologies surveyed during the scan of indoor wireless environment includes one or more telecommunication technologies such as Wi Fi WiMAX 3GPP2 UMB Enhanced GPRS 3GPP UMTS 3GPP LTE HSPA HSDPA HSUPA or LTE Advanced. It is noted that frequency bands or frequency carriers therein can be added to the set of EM frequency bands as such bands or carriers become available for communication e.g. auctioned for utilization or cleared for free of charge utilization. Similarly as new radio technologies become standardized or available such technologies can be introduced in the set of radio of technologies that is surveyed.

Scanning of indoor wireless environment in vicinity of transmission point s can proceed in polling mode. Through delivery of a scan directive or request administration component directs femto AP to scan and assess the indoor wireless environment in vicinity of transmission point s linked to femto AP not shown in . Directives can be conveyed periodically or in accordance to a schedule. Polling period or rate is configurable and determined by a manager of administration component wherein the manager is a human agent or a component e.g. control component . Similarly manager of administration component can configure the polling schedule that dictates communication of scan directives at predetermined instants. If a scan directive is received at femto AP e.g. via broadband network interface which enables incoming and outgoing data flow service load at the femtocell or load of processor s is evaluated and the directive is accepted or rejected. Evaluation can be based upon performance criteria not shown retained in memory based at least in part on at least one of in building service quality e.g. UL signal strength originated from mobile device s served through femto AP or capacity e.g. number of subscribers attached to femto AP scheduled traffic queued traffic or signaling . . . of femto AP . Acceptance or rejection is indicated via an ACK acknowledge or NACK negative acknowledge signal ACK NACK can be embodied for example in one or more reserved bits in a packet header a light payload e.g. of the order of 1 byte data packet a predetermined multi bit word conveyed in a radio frame within a control channel etc. If acceptance is indicated administration component can convey a scan configuration not shown that includes a set of measurements to be performed. Rejection can result in implementation of a retry cycle at administration component in which a predetermined number M an integer of scan directives are delivered at predetermined intervals until the directive is accepted or M attempts are completed. In an aspect a set of one or more processors in processor s can be dedicated to operate at least in part scanner component to mitigate performance degradation of femto AP when measurement of wireless signals are collected.

To scan wireless environment scanner component can detect signals that include DL reference signal s which can be transported through wireless link . Scan of the indoor wireless environment of transmission point s not shown linked to femto AP surveys received wireless signals over a configured set of EM frequency bands as indicated supra. To conduct a scan scanner component exploits at least in part communication platform . In an aspect scanner component s can configure receiver s transmitter s to collect signal s generated in a specific frequency carrier e.g. frequency channel. Such configuration can allow determination of downlink DL carrier frequency or channel number. Additionally scanner component can configure demodulation and demultiplexing operation of communication platform or a components therein in accordance with standard protocols associated with the plurality of disparate telecommunication technologies that are surveyed in an aspect the various telecommunication protocols and instructions necessary for implementation thereof can reside in memory . Thus demodulation and demultiplexing configuration enable determination of radio technology employed in DL signal e.g. DL reference signal s or UL signal e.g. UL reference signal s . Communication platform includes circuitry e.g. one or more chipsets such as multimode chipset s and at least one or more processors which can be part of processor s to switch radio technologies e.g. IS 95 WiMAX . . . within a configurable and upgradable set of technologies in order to effect telecommunication and enable a scan e.g. decoding or deciphering of signal s in accordance with configured demodulation and demultiplexing associated with a radio technology. Such radio technology agility can afford blind determination e.g. identification by inspection of a radio technology employed for communication within the indoor wireless environment.

Scanner component can decode received wireless signals and thus determine at least one of a network operator identity e.g. public land mobile network PLMN a mobile network code MNC and associated mobile country code MCC a cell site identity e.g. a cell global identity CGI or macro sector identifier. In an aspect the identifier can be a numeric index that characterizes a pilot code sequence e.g. a Zadoff Chu sequence or an M sequence. In addition scanner component can gather data on DL signal strength and quality associated with identified cell or sectors and related networks. To at least that end scanner component can collect DL reference signal s and analyze such signal s to determine DL channel quality or strength. In an aspect signal strength can be determined through received signal strength indicators RSSIs or received signal code power RSCP while quality can be assessed through metrics such as signal to noise ratio SNR signal to noise and interference ratio SNIR or energy per chip over total received power E N . Moreover scanner component also can gather uplink UL data originated at a mobile device e.g. . In an aspect scanner component can decode collected UL data to extract a unique identifier of the mobile device. Decoded unique identifier s can include an international mobile subscriber identity IMSI temporary IMSI TIMSI an international mobile equipment identifier IMEI a mobile directory number MDN a mobile identification number MIN a Telecommunications Industry Association TIA electronic serial number ESN or a multi bit identification number like the mobile identity number MEID . Data collected by scanner component can be retained in data storage .

Scanner component also can decode UL or DL subscriber traffic at femtocell AP . As described supra subscribers that access wireless service through one or more femtocell agree to have traffic monitored as part of wireless service provision within the indoor confined area.

Decoding performed by scanner component can be based at least in part on blind decoding of received signal s computation of log likelihood ratios LLR associated with constellation realization for a specific demodulation maximum likelihood ML estimation minimum mean square equalization MMSE zero forcing ZF filtering or maximal ratio combining MRC filtering. To determine code sequences and thus one or more of the foregoing identities or identifiers scanner component can compute cross correlation of decoded signal s and a set of code sequence hypotheses for the various radio technologies included in the set of technologies surveyed by scanner component s . Code sequences can include at least one of a scrambling code a pseudonoise PN sequence a chirp like sequence and so forth. Code sequence hypotheses can be retained in memory element .

In an aspect of the subject application the described scanning of wireless environment neighboring a transmission point can be exploited to effect service domination as follows. Femto AP which is embodied in femto AP and provides at least part of coverage to a confined restricted area can identify a set of dominant external control channels delivered in accordance with one or more radio technology protocols and deliberately transmit a frequency carrier that overlaps the identified channel s . Femto AP identifies such external control channels through the previously described scanning. Such selective spectral overlap embodies selective jamming that allows the femtocell AP to dominate at least in part control activity within the indoor restricted area and thus dominate indoor coverage without having to jam all spectrum including non control channels. Since such selective jamming blocks external control channels deployed femtocell APs e.g. provides the only useable control signaling. Accordingly the selective jamming forces all mobile device s near transmission point s to camp strictly on deployed femtocell access point s .

In embodiment femto AP includes a radio control node that can manage available radio resources such management is effected without increasing processing load in administration component . Processor s can enable at least in part such management. RC node includes a scheduler component that can allocate radio resources such as transmission time s packet format s code rate s frequency carriers transmit power or the like. Scheduler component can receive an indication of a set of identified external control channels and allocate a set of femtocell frequency carriers to be delivered in the spectral region in which the identified external control channels propagate. In an aspect as part of allocation of the set of frequency carriers RC node via at least in part scheduler component can adjust frequency of the carriers in the set of femtocell frequency carriers to ensure overlap with frequency ies of the set of identified external control channels. To at least that end RC node can tune one or more clock sources not shown in femtocell AP to shift the frequency of an available femtocell carrier generated within a first EM frequency band such as one of EM frequency bands indicated supra in which femtocell AP radiates so as to overlap with the frequency of an external control channel transported in a second EM frequency band such as one of EM frequency bands indicated supra. Femtocell frequency carriers can be red shifted e.g. downconverted or blue shifted e.g. upconverted to match frequency of external control channels for a specific frequency of an external control channel downconversion or upconversion can be implemented in one or more discrete increments e.g. 200 KHz or decrements e.g. 200 KHz that adjust the center frequency of the femtocell carrier. In addition scheduler component can grant transmit power for each carrier in the allocated set of frequency carriers. In an aspect scheduler component can determine transmit power for each carrier through various models and related simulations for instance scheduler component can exploit Orthogonal Carrier Noise Simulation OCNS to generate a set of transmit TX power allocation s that can dominate e.g. transmit maximum energy within 5 Mhz of EM spectrum regardless of served call traffic.

In an aspect number and spectrum spread of detected DL control channels can determine number of femtocell frequency carriers that are to be scheduled and transmitted to dominate wireless resources within a confined coverage area see as an illustration . Example diagram displays channel quality indicator CQI of channels detected in macrocell DL wireless signal in two illustrative EM frequency bands band and band . In diagram detected non control channels are illustrated with open bars whereas control channels e.g. broadcast control channel BCCH are illustrated as dashed bars in particular a set of nine control channels is displayed in band . As illustrated in diagram spectral bandwidth of frequency carriers available to femtocell APs within confined restricted area can be such that a set of three such carriers fully overlap the spectral spread of detected control channels in set . It should be appreciated that generally the femtocell frequency carriers can exceed the spectral bandwidth of detected DL control channels. As indicate hereinbefore femtocell frequency carriers in example set have disparate allocated transmit powers such power is allocated as indicated supra and it is sufficient to block or substantially block reception of control channels in set . It should be appreciated that also depicts the selectivity of jamming as described herein for instance since control channels are not detected in band frequency carriers available for femtocell communication are not allocated in frequencies in such band.

As described supra access to wireless service within confined area in which example system operates is restricted.

In an aspect scanner component can extract such credential s through decoding of UL attachment signaling and supply them to access manager component which checks the credential s against access control list s ACL s . If received credential s of the mobile device are matched with an identified mobile number in ACL s attachment procedure e.g. LAU is completed and the mobile device is allowed to camp in femto AP and establish emergency and non emergency calls sessions. Conversely if the received credential s do not match a configured mobile number in ACL s access manager component rejects the attachment signaling e.g. delivers a LAC reject signal in response to LAU attempt and the mobile device is allowed to make emergency calls only.

Femto AP includes processor s which can be configured to provide or that can provide at least in part functionality to substantially any or any component s platform s interface s node s and so forth within femto AP in accordance with one or more aspects of the described operation of femto AP . Processor s is functionally coupled to each functional element within mobile device and to memory through bus which can be embodied in at least one of a memory bus a system bus an address bus a message bus or one or more reference link s or interface s . In embodiment processor s is illustrated as external to the various functional elements e.g. component s interface s platform s node s of femto AP however in additional or alternative embodiment s processor s can be distributed amongst a plurality of such functional elements.

Autonomous assignment of at least one of suitable polling rate s or schedule s is automatic and can be based at least in part on inference of suitable values of or set s of instants that comprise the schedule s . An inference e.g. reasoning and generation of conclusion based upon a set of metrics arguments or known outcomes in controlled scenarios can produced through artificial intelligence AI or machine learning methods. For example the set of metrics employed to generate the inference can include performance metrics related to telecommunication service within the confined restricted area which is served by the set of femto APs . In particular the performance metrics can comprise at least one of 1 telecommunication load or capacity of the wireless environment in the confined restricted area 2 processing load in one or more processor s or component s within example system 3 bandwidth availability at air interface or 4 traffic congestion at air interface or wired links e.g. backhaul . In addition the inference can be produced through optimization of a utility trade off between the cost of scanning wireless environment of one or more transmission point s and the benefit of conducting accurate selective jamming as described supra AI methods can be employed to carry out the optimization. Further such autonomous assignment of at least one of suitable polling rate s or schedule s can be simplified through introduction of thresholds for the performance metrics associated with telecommunication service within a confined restricted area the threshold s can be retained as part of control criteria .

In an aspect regulation component can exploit intelligent component to carry out the AI or machine learning methods to produce inference s or conduct cost utility analysis and optimization. The artificial intelligence methods or techniques referred to herein typically apply advanced mathematical algorithms e.g. decision trees neural networks regression analysis principal component analysis PCA for feature and pattern extraction cluster analysis genetic algorithm or reinforced learning to a data set. In particular incentive generator can employ one of numerous methodologies for learning from data and then drawing inferences from the models so constructed. Such methodologies can be retained in memory element . As an example Hidden Markov Models HMMs and related prototypical dependency models can be employed.

In addition linear classifiers such as support vector machines SVMs non linear classifiers like methods referred to as neural network methodologies fuzzy logic methodologies can also be employed. Moreover game theoretic models e.g. game trees game matrices pure and mixed strategies utility algorithms Nash equilibria evolutionary game theory and other approaches that perform data fusion or the like can be exploited.

Regulation component also can determine whether to monitor signaling or traffic generated at least in part by an unauthorized device traffic can include content of voice or data calls or content of messaging communications SMS communication MMS communication etc. . In addition or in the alternative monitoring of the unauthorized device can include identification of at least one of device s called by the unauthorized device or devices that place a call to the unauthorized device. In an aspect such determination can be based at least in part on monitoring criteria that can be part of control criteria . In an example the monitoring criteria can include at threshold of unauthorized attachment attempts.

To monitor traffic regulation component can direct ACL management component to add a UE ID in a set of ACLs associated with a set of respective femtocell APs that are deployed as part of example system . Monitor component can collect data and control packets delivered to and from a femtocell AP and track at least one of traffic or signaling associated with a mobile device e.g. that operates within the confined restricted area in which example system is deployed. Monitor component can track data and signaling conveyed from femtocell network platform not shown directly. However coded and modulated data delivered by transmission point and received by switch component is conveyed to femtocell AP for processing decoding and demodulation and subsequently collected by monitor component .

In an example embodiment illustrated in monitor component can include a collection component that gathers the foregoing data and control packets or data and signaling and records the traffic and signaling in memory element for generation of related intelligence. In addition example embodiment also includes a report component that can generate traffic and signaling intelligence based at least in part on traffic and signaling that is either received from collection component or retrieved from activity record storage . In an aspect report component can aggregate the traffic and signaling in accordance to various reporting strategies which can be retained in control criteria and produce one or more report s . In addition to aggregate the traffic and signaling report component can exploit intelligent component . Aggregation can include data mining e.g. generation of statistics of attachment including rejection thereof LAC s femtocell AP ID s extraction of patterns of attachment signaling or traffic classification and segmentation such as compilation of traffic and signaling associated with at least one of a specific period destination of call session s duration thereof or the like. One or more methods or algorithms for aggregation can be retained in algorithm storage and can include at least one of the AI methods indicate supra.

To locate a mobile device e.g. within a confined restricted area in an aspect of the subject application regulation component can instruct one or more femtocell APs to modulate transmit TX power of one or more transmission point s associated thereof and instruct monitor component to track attachment signaling directed to a set of the one or more femtocell APs the set can include all or a portion of the one or more femtocell APs. In an aspect of monitoring to track the attachment signaling monitor component receives information from the one or more femtocell APs. In an embodiment e.g. collection component can receive the information which can be relayed to report component for aggregation and report generation.

Modulation of TX power effected by the one or more femtocell APs includes decrements and increments to transmit power of each antenna in the one or more transmission point s the increments and decrements are determined by a specific sequence which can be stored in control criteria . Such modulation can cause a mobile device e.g. within wireless environment s of the one or more transmission point s to halt delivery of attachment signaling to a first femtocell AP with low TX power and search for a second femtocell AP that transmits at higher power. Typically the second femtocell AP radiates through transmission point s that are nearest neighbor s to transmission point s through which the first femtocell AP radiates. As described above since distribution of transmission point s throughout the confined restricted area is such that nearest neighboring transmission point s can deliver disparate LAC s than a reference transmission point the mobile device e.g. initiates delivery of attachment signaling to the second femtocell AP. If as part of TX power modulation power radiated through transmission point s associated with the first femtocell AP increases the mobile device can re initiate delivery of attachment signaling directed to the first femtocell AP. If modulation cycle continues with decrement of TX power the second femtocell AP can detect reiteration of reception of attachment signaling. Accordingly the first and second femtocell APs can detect reiteration of reception of attachment signaling from the mobile device as a result of transmit power modulation.

The first and second femtocell APs can extract identifier s e.g. IMSI temporary international mobile subscriber identity TIMSI packet TIMSI P TMSI etc. of the mobile device as part of attachment signaling and convey the extracted identifier s to monitor component . In addition the first and second femtocell AP can notify monitor component if reiteration of attachment signaling is detected. Moreover through a suitable modulation sequence that turns on and off each transmission point s associated with a femtocell AP the first or second femtocell AP can identify antenna s in the set of distributed antennas that reside within transmission point s linked to the first and second femtocell APs that causes reiteration of unauthorized attachment signaling. The first of second femtocell APs can convey the identity of the antenna s to monitor component .

In response to received indication of the foregoing antenna s identity ies monitor component can generate and deliver a location alarm that conveys a likely location of the mobile device e.g. the likely location is within the coverage area of transmission point s associated with the identified antenna s . The alert message can be at least one of a call voice or data or a message communication e.g. a short message service SMS communication or a multimedia messaging service MMS or an unstructured supplementary service data USSD code . Features of the location alarm such as recipient or destination content s application of retry delivery cycles or the like can be established through alarm criteria that can be part of control criteria .

With respect to control of access to telecommunication service access control list ACL management component can generate and manipulate ACL s . As described supra generation of an ACL can occur at a time of provisioning a femtocell AP within example system . In an aspect regulation component can receive an indication the femtocell AP is provisioned as part of set of femto APs . In response to such indication regulation component can direct ACL management component to generate an ACL and supply the generated ACL for provisioning the femtocell AP. The generated ACL can be supplied as part of data and retained in ACL database . In an example embodiment illustrated in configuration component can generate the ACL and supply it for provisioning in a femtocell AP configuration component also can record the generated ACL in ACL database .

To manipulate an access control list ACL management component can exploit manipulation criteria which dictate instance s in which an ACL is to be updated as described supra. Manipulation of ACL s includes at least one of i inclusion or exclusion of mobile device identifiers e.g. IMSI MSISDN or ii configuration e.g. addition deletion edition of attribute fields in the ACL s that control logic of granted telecommunication service. At least one of an updated ACL for provisioning in a femtocell AP or update s to an ACL local to a femtocell AP can be conveyed as part of data . In an embodiment e.g. configuration component can access the manipulation criteria in memory element update the ACL and record the updated ACL in ACL database configuration component also can supply the updated ACL for provisioning in a femtocell AP. Manipulation criteria can be retained as part of control criteria . In addition ACL management component can convert a customary mobile directory number MDN or MSISDN to other identification code s or token s such as IMSI IMEI MIN TIA ESN or a multi bit identification number e.g. MEID. Such conversion can be implemented for utilization at various levels within a serving network not shown .

As described supra manipulation of an ACL can be effected interactively at least in part via for example terminal and AN s . To at least that end control component can receive a request to configure an ACL. In an aspect the request can be received as part of signaling and processed by regulation component . The request can identify a requestor and regulation component can determine ACL configuration privileges of the identified requestor such privileges can be retained as part of control criteria . Based at least in part on the ACL configuration privileges regulation component can grant or decline the request. If the ACL configuration privileges of the requestor allow changes to the ACL regulation component grants the request and directs ACL management component to implement the request. Conversely if the ACL configuration privileges do not allow the requestor to configure an ACL regulation component can decline the request. In an embodiment e.g. ACL management component can include an access interface that enables interactive delivery of at least one of UE ID s to be included in an ACL or associated access profile attributes. Access interface can provide an update environment collect data e.g. mobile device identifier s or manipulation commands and relay the data to configuration component which can effect the update.

In top view of the example system described supra in connection with an illicit mobile device is illustrated within an enclosure which receives wireless signal s from neighboring transmission point B. Enclosures and are also within wireless coverage area spanned by transmission point B. The two sets of transmission points A Aand B Band respective femtocell AP and can facilitate or enable estimation of location of the illicit mobile device larger more complex wireless service system such as system can facilitate or enable estimation of unauthorized devices. A femtocell AP can effect location estimation of illicit device as described next which displays diagrams of attachment signaling activity and transmit power in accordance with aspects disclosed herein is employed to illustrate such description.

Unauthorized device within enclosure is exposed to transmission point B which emits wireless signal s at transmit TX power P attempts attachment e.g. LAU or RAU in UMTS based technology to femtocell AP at an instant which results in On attachment signaling activity for an interval . ON attachment activity can persist up to instant in which TX power of transmitter Bis reduced to P with P P

The foregoing restoration of attachment signaling activity in a reference transmission point and activation switch ON of attachment signaling activity in a nearest neighbor transmission point are both absent if the illicit device is not in proximity to the transmission point for which the TX power is modulated e.g. switched from high value to low value and vice versa. Thus through TX power modulation at each transmission point in a set of transmission points can identify a reference transmission point. In addition detection of restoration of attachment signaling at the reference transmission point or activation of attachment signaling at a nearest neighbor transmission point as result of TX power modulation of the reference transmission point can yield an estimated location of illicit device within the bounds of the wireless coverage area associated with the reference transmission point.

At act based at least in part of received credential s administration component can provision mobile device . In an aspect if received credential s are not satisfactory e.g. do not include subscriber s consent to have telecommunication activity control or traffic monitored mobile device can be seized for the time span of access to confined area. Provisioning includes configuring attributes in an ACL associated with femto AP or other femtocell APs that provide wireless service within the confined restricted area in an aspect the configuring act comprises addition of received MSISDN disclosed time span of access e.g. visit work shift or network operator or provider into the ACL. Received MSISDN can be included in a UE ID field within the ACL whereas time span of access can be included within a profile attribute field associated with the ACL and that controls at least in part logic of fulfillment of service for an identified UE in the ACL. At act administration component can clear the mobile device for access to telecommunication service. Clearing act includes delivering an indication to the mobile device that access to femtocell service is granted the indication can include a directive to render a unique alphanumeric indicator if mobile device recognizes the LAC for femto AP while mobile device is camping on it. At act femto AP enables access to femtocell service according to configured ACL attribute s .

At act one or more external control channels conveyed in the scanned wireless signal are identified. The control channel s are external with respect to control channel s conveyed by a set of one or more access points e.g. femto AP s that serve the confined wireless environment. Identification can be performed by decoding the wireless signal in accordance with one or more decoding and demodulation hypotheses corresponding to various radio technology protocols. At act a set of frequency carriers are scheduled the frequency carriers spectrally overlap the one or more identified external control channels. Scheduling includes establishing the number of elements in the set of frequency carriers based at least in part on the spectral spread of the identified external control channels and the radio technology employed for wireless communication by the one or more indoor based APs that enact at least in part the subject example method. Scheduling also includes allocating transmit power for each element in the set of frequency carriers in order to dominate propagation of the identified external control channels within the confined wireless environment. At act the scheduled set of frequency carriers is transmitted. As described supra the transmitting act can include generating the carrier s in the set of frequency carriers delivering the carriers to the component s that control the indoor based APs and relaying the carriers to transmission points that are part of the distributed antenna system s for delivery.

At act the indication of unauthorized attachment signaling is recorded. Such recordation can be retained within a memory functionally coupled to the one or more components or processors that can enact the subject example method . At act a pattern of unauthorized attachment signaling within a specified period is extracted. The specified period can span various time scales such as an hour 12 hours a day or multiple days. In an aspect an administrator that regulates telecommunication service within the confined area can configure the specified period. In the alternative or in addition the specified period can be autonomously configured to improve statistical significance of extracted pattern s .

At act a report of unauthorized attachment signaling in the specified period is generated for the identified UE ID. The report can include at least one of the identified pattern location of attachment event s and associated mobility data e.g. time of event and location or recurrence of attachment events e.g. frequency of attachment attempts at disparate locations.

Alternative or additional embodiments of method for monitoring attachment signaling to a femtocell AP that serves at least in part a confined area can include an act at which an attachment alarm can be generated and conveyed in accordance with alarm criteria as described supra see e.g. and associated description if unauthorized attachment signaling is received.

In addition to monitoring attachment signaling traffic can be monitored to generate intelligence that can lead to a user of the monitored device or associate s . displays a flowchart of an example method for monitoring traffic originated in a mobile device initially unauthorized to receive telecommunication service within a confined area. Component s or processor s that enact example method also can enact the subject example method . At act it is determined if multiple unauthorized attachment attempts are identified for a specific UE ID. In an aspect such determination can be accomplished by polling a memory element a database a set of files etc. that retains records of unauthorized attachment signaling. A negative outcome directs flow to act . Conversely a positive determination leads to act at which a directive to include the UE ID e.g. IMSI ENS IMEI MEID . . . in an access control list ACL in order to grant access to femtocell wireless service within the confined area. In an aspect the ACL can be associated with a particular limited set of femtocell APs e.g. femto APs and that provide wireless coverage within a specific location within the confined area inclusion of the UE ID in such limited set of femtocell APs can bound the number of potential offenders that utilize the identified UE. For instance in a correctional facility a femtocell AP that serves a laundry facility can be supplied with an ACL that includes the identified UE ID thus increased physical security and on location tracking equipment e.g. tunable radiation tracking equipment surveillance cameras . . . can be deployed within the laundry facility at times in which utilization of the identified UE is expected.
