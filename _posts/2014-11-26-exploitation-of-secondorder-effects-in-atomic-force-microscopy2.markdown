The invention relates to scanning probe microscopy also known as atomic force microscopy and in particular to processing of the output of an atomic force microscope to evaluate surface parameters.

Scanning probe microscopy also known as atomic force microscopy is a way to study force interactions between a probe and sample surface. It is broadly used to visualize features on a sample surface that have dimensions from hundreds of microns down to sub nanometer scale.

In atomic force microscopy a probe attached to a cantilevered member responds to forces that result from proximity or contact with some sample surface. This force affects the tip s motion. The tip s motion therefore provides a measure of the force.

By scanning the probe s tip across the surface of a sample one can obtain values of the extent of deflection as a function of spatial position. This allows one to build a two dimensional map showing values of some surface parameter.

A difficulty that arises is that building such a map takes time because an entire region needs to be scanned. An obvious solution to the problem of slow scanning is to scan faster. But a cantilever arm has its own resonance characteristics. When one scans faster the output signal of the microscope becomes a superposition of three components. The first component consists of the deflections caused by slow mechanical interaction with the surface. The second component consists of various second order effects such as deflections that arise from all other sources including those that arise from the dynamic properties of the cantilever arm itself and or from the sliding interaction between the AFM probe and sample surface. The third component consists of instrumental and environmental noise.

From the combination of these three components one can filter out an output signal. However this filtering process is not perfect. As a result the output signal can show artifacts that impair the accuracy of the measurement. To minimize formation of such artifacts it is known to slow down the scanning. But this results in undesirable excessively slow scanning.

The invention is based at least in part on the recognition that portions of a signal received from an atomic force microscope that have hitherto been regarded as parasitic or as noise and that have in the past been filtered out to avoid formation of artifacts can in fact be used to obtain useful properties of a surface being scanned by the microscope.

In one aspect the invention features an apparatus and method including hardware and software for data collection and data analysis to obtain information about physical and chemical properties of materials in atomic force microscopy. The novel apparatus and method allows surface mapping of previously unmeasured parameters as well as faster mapping of previously known parameters. These parameters include the restored adhesion the averaged restored adhesion the restored adhesion height the zero deflection height the viscoplastic height shift the dynamic creep phase shift stick slip response and viscoelastic adhesion response.

In one aspect the invention features an apparatus for evaluating a physical or a chemical property of a surface. Such an apparatus includes a processing system that cooperates with an atomic force microscope operating in ramp mode at a ramp frequency. The processing system collects data indicative either physical or chemical properties of a sample. In particular the processing system receives a probe signal indicative of movement of a probe at a frequency that is higher than the ramp frequency. The probe signal includes first portion and second portions. The first portion indicates deflection. The second portion consists of second order effects. The processing system obtains a parameter that is indicative either a physical or a chemical property of a sample based at least in part on this second portion of the probe signal.

In some embodiments the processing system receives a probe signal that includes contact and rebound portions. In these embodiments the second portion includes the rebound portion. Among these embodiments are those in which the processing system obtains a restored adhesion those in which it obtains an average restored adhesion those in which it is obtains a viscoelastic adhesion response and those in which it obtains a viscoplastic height shift.

In other embodiments the processing system receives a probe signal has a noise portion and a scanner portion. The noise portion includes noise in the contact portion of the probe signal. The scanner portion controls ramping motion of the probe. Among these are embodiments in which the processing system is configured to obtain a restored adhesion height and those in which it is configured to obtain a zero deflection height.

Among those embodiments that are configured to obtain a zero deflection height are those in which the zero deflection height is determined based on a retraction curve and those in which it is determined based on an approach curve.

Embodiments further include those in which processing system receives a probe signal in which the second portion includes periodic oscillation superimposed on the contact portion of the probe signal during contact of the probe with the sample. Among there are embodiments in which the processing system obtains a parameter indicative of slip stick motion including those in which the processing system obtains a parameter indicative of slip stick motion based on oscillation superimposed on an approaching portion of the contact portion and those in which it obtains a parameter indicative of slip stick motion based on oscillation superimposed on a retracting portion of the contact portion.

In other embodiments the processing system receives a probe signal and a scanner signal that controls ramping motion of the probe. This processing system obtains a parameter indicative of dynamic creep phase shift. Among these are embodiments in which the processing system is configured for offline processing.

Also included are embodiments in which the processing system is configured for real time processing those in which it includes a floating point gate array for real time processing.

Some embodiments further include an atomic force microscope coupled to the processing system. In these embodiments the processing system is configured to receive the probe signal from the atomic force microscope.

These and other features of the invention will be apparent from the accompanying detailed description and the figures in which 

The probe is generally coupled to a reflective portion of the cantilever that reflects an illumination beam provided by a laser . This reflective portion of the cantilevered will be referred to herein as a mirror . A reflected beam travels from the mirror to a photodetector the output of which connects to a processor . In some embodiments the processor comprises FPGA electronics to permit real time calculation of surface parameters.

The movement of the probe translates into movement of the mirror which then results in different parts of the photodetector being illuminated by the reflected beam . This results in a probe signal indicative of probe movement. The processor calculates certain surface parameters based on the probe signal using methods described below and outputs the results to a storage medium . These results include data representative of any of the surface parameters described herein.

The scanner is also connected to the processor and provides to it a scanner signal indicative of scanner position. This scanner signal is also available for use in calculating surface parameters.

In general the motion of the scanner in the vertical direction is a harmonic oscillation as shown in . Thus as the scanner moves concurrently in the scanning direction the probe traces a sinusoidal path having an amplitude and spatial frequency as shown by the scanner signal in . As it does so the probe alternately dips toward and then rises from the surface . This mode of operation is referred to herein as ramping mode. The frequency of oscillation is the ramping frequency. 

A typical probe signal is shown in . According to the probe signal as the scanner moves toward the surface along the vertical direction the probe eventually contacts the surface . The time at which this occurs is the moment of contact . As the scanner continues to move downward towards the surface the cantilever deflects and the surface deforms in response to the spring force exerted by the now deflected cantilever . The maximum force is reached in the position of maximum deflection of the cantilever .

As the scanner starts to move vertically away from the surface an adhesion force between the probe and the surface causes a portion of the surface to deform in an effort to follow the upward motion of the probe . Eventually when the probe has risen enough a restoring force inherent in the sample s material exceeds the adhesion force. At this point the probe and the surface separate. The time at which this occurs is the moment of release . The portion of the curve between the moment of contact and moment of release is the contact portion of the probe signal .

During the time between the moment of release and a subsequent moment of contact the cantilever rings. This ringing gradually dies down as a result of damping forces within the cantilever . The portion of the probe signal that includes this ringing is the rebound portion . The rebound frequency is typically much higher than the ramp frequency.

The vertical position of the probe at the moment of release provides information indicative of the adhesion force at a particular spatial location on the surface . The rebound portion however is generally regarded as a second order effect. It is typically filtered out and not used to determine any surface parameters.

Unlike a general purpose processor the illustrated processor is a special purpose particular machine that has been tied to the atomic force microscope and that has had its structure modified by having been programmed for determining various surface parameters such as adhesion forces surface stiffness phase change surface height position and viscoelastic energy losses. It is well established that function is a result of structure. Therefore if a first article is incapable of performing a function whereas a second article is then the two articles must have different structures. The processor is capable of performing the functions recited below and is therefore structurally different from processors that cannot perform those functions. In particular prior art processors are not programmed for determining surface parameters such as adhesion forces surface stiffness phase change surface height position and viscoelastic energy losses in the manner described herein.

The processor is programmed and configured such that in the process of determining surface parameters what would ordinarily be regarded as mere second order effects plays an essential role.

For example the rebound portion which is ordinarily filtered out actually represents energy that has been stored in the cantilever as a result of work done by the force of adhesion. Measurement of this stored energy thus provides an indication of the work done by the force of adhesion which in conjunction with the spring constant of the cantilever can be used to determine that force.

A first parameter that can be calculated is the force of restored adhesion F. The force of restored adhesion can be derived from the rebound portion by measuring the maximum of the rebound portion d the quality factor Q of the oscillations seen in the rebound portion and the spring constant K of the cantilever . The quality factor Q is a measure of how fast the oscillation cycles are decreasing in the rebound signal shown in . The quality factor can be calculated from the rebound portion by using known standard formulas. In addition the quality factor Q and the spring constant K can be determined using the thermal fluctuation method which is standard in atomic force microscopy. Both of these parameters can be found independently of the actual scanning procedure.

The maximum rebound d is the first maximum of the rebound portion shown in . To obtain the force of restored adhesion one defines a restored deflection dby weighting the maximum rebound by a factor of exp 2Q . The force of restored adhesion Fcan then be found by application of Hooke s law F K d K d exp 2Q .

Knowledge of specific values of various physical properties of the apparatus described herein such as its spring constant or quality factor is only necessary to obtain absolute values of restored adhesion. When only relative values of force are of interest it is not necessary to actually determine values of spring constant or quality factor. Instead default values Kand Qare used. If necessary relative values of restored adhesion can readily be transformed into absolute values through multiplication of each value by K exp 2Q K exp 2Q .

A related quantity that can be determined is the difference between the restored adhesion force and the adhesion force that is calculated based on the value of d at the moment of release i.e. d. Again based on Hooke s law the force of adhesion calculated based on dis K d. The difference is therefore K d d exp 2Q . This parameter is referred to as the viscoelastic adhesion response. 

Another parameter that can be calculated based on the rebound portion is the averaged restored adhesion ave F . This calculation uses several values of the rebound portion and not just the maximum rebound . According to this method the rebound portion is averaged by its absolute values for some user defined interval. This interval can be defined in units of time or more conveniently in oscillation periods. The average restored adhesion is determined by dividing each of N values of the cantilever rebound signal at time tby the product of exp ft Q and sin 2 ft where Q is the quality factor of the oscillation defined previously. The divided values are then added together and the resulting sum divided by N to yield an averaged restored adhesion.

In some embodiments signal values below some threshold are not counted towards N and are not used in calculating the averaged restored adhesion. This avoids corrupting the calculation with noise in the rebound signal.

Another parameter that can be determined is the restored adhesion height H. Referring to this is the value of Z on the scanner signal when the value of d is most negative in the probe signal . Said differently this is the height of the scanner at the moment of release which is the moment when the probe just detaches from the surface. Determining the time of the moment of release and looking up the corresponding height of the scanner can determine the restored adhesion height. Suitable code for carrying this out is as follows 

Another parameter that can be determined is the zero adhesion height H. Referring to this is the value of Z on the scanner signal when the value of d crosses zero in the probe signal for the first time after reaching the maximum positive deflection. Said differently this is the height of the scanner when the probe position signal crosses zero between the position of maximum deflection and the moment of release . Determining the time at which this zero crossing occurs and looking up the corresponding height of the scanner can determine the zero adhesion height. Suitable code for carrying this out is as follows 

As shown in the probe signal has two zero crossings i.e. two points at which d 0. The first zero crossing ends an approaching section of the contact portion and the second zero crossing begins a retracting section of the contact portion . The first and second zero crossings correspond to values of Z on the scanner signal . The difference between these two values provides a measure of viscoplastic height shift. This is the shift in the sample height as a result of viscoelastic and plastic deformation following contact with and release from the probe . Suitable code for carrying out this procedure is as follows 

For a perfectly rigid surface the minimum value of the probe signal will occur at the same time as the minimum value of the scanner signal. However for surfaces that experience plastic deformation there can be a difference in the scanner signal between these two events. This signal difference arises from viscous creep in the material.

The term creep is used for a slow change in equilibrium position of a material in response to a constant load. Because the scanner is moving the cantilever up and down the load on the surface will not be constant. Under these conditions where the equilibrium position of a surface changes in response to a dynamic load the resulting creep is said to be viscous creep or dynamic creep. This viscous creep can be detected from a phase difference between the maximum of the scanner signal and a corresponding maximum of the probe signal . The phase difference is given by 2 f t where t is the interval between the two maxima and fis the frequency of the scanner signal .

A phase as computed above will be a relative phase because of unknown initial delay between the probe signal and the scanner signal . This delay arises from internal electronic processing and delays. The phase shift can be found in absolute units by calibration using a rigid sample for example a silicon wafer or a flat clean glass slide. The phase recorded on this material will then be subtracted from phase recorded on the sample material. This can be implemented either offline or for real time processing.

Yet another parameter that can be measured is the stick slip response of the sample surface. Stick slip arises because the coefficient of static friction is different from the coefficient of dynamic friction. As a result of this characterized by sudden stops and starts that are translated into oscillations in the position of the tip.

The high frequency oscillations shown in have in the past been considered as extraneous second order effects. However the processor is configured for determining the amplitude and frequency of these oscillations as a basis for characterizing slip stick motion of the surface . In one embodiment the amplitude and frequency for both the retracting section and the approaching section form the basis for characterizing slip stick motion.

In a preferred embodiment the processing system further includes a user interface to enable a person to control its operation.

The processing system further includes first and second A D converters for receiving the probe signal and the scanner signals and placing them on a bus . A program storage section a working memory and CPU registers are also connected to the bus . A CPU for executing instructions from program storage is connected to both the registers and an ALU . These instructions are stored on a non transitory computer readable medium and include instructions that when executed cause the processing system to calculate any of the foregoing parameters based on inputs received through the first and second A D converters .

A specific example of the processing system may include FPGA electronics which stores all processing algorithms for calculation of the surface parameters described above.
