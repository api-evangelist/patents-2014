This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 541 985 filed Jul. 5 2012 the entirety of which is incorporated by reference herein.

The present disclosure relates generally to mobile communication devices having a full physical keypad. More particularly the present disclosure relates to dialing phonewords using the full physical keypad.

Mobile communication devices that have a full physical keypad are popular for the ease of typing they provide. However as full physical keypads do not generally have number keys marked with the same letter pattern as in standard telephone keypads using the full physical keypad to dial phonewords can be difficult.

To circumvent this problem it is possible to print out a drawing of a standard telephone keypad and to keep it with the mobile communication device. This allows a user to refer to the drawing in question when dialing using phonewords. However keeping the telephone keypad drawing with the mobile communication device requires effort on the part of the user.

Therefore improvements in phoneword dialing in mobile communication devices having a full physical keypad are desirable.

Generally the present disclosure provides a method for dialing phonewords on mobile communication devices that have a full keyboard. The method can detect that a telephone number being entered may have associated thereto a phoneword and provides a indication to the user that a pre determined operation is required in order to dial by phoneword. For example the indication can be a text indication displayed on the mobile communication device and the operation can be pressing a pre determined key of the mobile communication device. Additionally the method can allow the mobile communication device to display candidate phonewords or telephone numbers based on the partial telephone number or phoneword being entered.

It will be appreciated that for simplicity and clarity of illustration where considered appropriate reference numerals may be repeated among the figures to indicate corresponding or analogous elements. In addition numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments described herein. However it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the embodiments described herein may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known methods procedures and components have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the embodiments described herein. Also the description is not to be considered as limiting the scope of the embodiments described herein.

In a first aspect the present disclosure provides a method of dialing a phoneword using a mobile communication device. The mobile communication device has a full keyboard that comprises a plurality of keys. The phoneword has a numerical beginning sequence and a remainder sequence. The remainder sequence has associated numbers thereto at least one of the numbers has an associated letter. The method comprises receiving the numerical beginning sequence as an input from the full keyboard and in response to the received numerical beginning sequence generating an indication to perform an operation on the mobile communication device to enable entry of a letter associated to the phoneword.

In a second aspect the present disclosure provides a mobile communications device that comprises a full keyboard comprising a plurality of keys and at least one processor coupled to the keyboard the processor configured to receive inputs from the keyboard representing a phoneword having a numerical beginning sequence and a remainder sequence the remainder sequence having associated numbers thereto at least one of the numbers having an associated letter the processor further configured to receive the numerical beginning sequence as an input from the full keyboard and in response to the received numerical beginning sequence generate an indication to perform an operation on the mobile communication device to enable entry of a letter associated to the phoneword.

The embodiments described herein generally relate to a mobile wireless communication device hereafter referred to as a mobile communication device or as a mobile device. Examples of applicable communication devices include cellular phones cellular smart phones handheld wireless communication devices and the like.

The mobile device is a two way communication device with data communication capabilities including the capability to communicate with other mobile devices or computer systems through a network of transceiver stations. The mobile device also has the capability to allow voice communication. Depending on the functionality provided by the mobile device it may be referred to as a data messaging device a two way pager a cellular telephone with data messaging capabilities a wireless Internet appliance or a data communication device.

Referring first to shown therein is a block diagram of an embodiment of a mobile device . The mobile device includes a number of components such as a main processor that controls the overall operation of the mobile device . Communication functions including data and voice communications are performed through a communication subsystem . Data received by the mobile device can be decompressed and decrypted by decoder operating according to any suitable decompression techniques e.g. YK decompression and other known techniques and encryption techniques e.g. using an encryption techniques such as Data Encryption Standard DES Triple DES or Advanced Encryption Standard AES . The communication subsystem receives messages from and sends messages to a wireless network . In this embodiment of the mobile device the communication subsystem is configured in accordance with the Global System for Mobile Communication GSM and General Packet Radio Services GPRS standards. The GSM GPRS wireless network is used worldwide and it is expected that these standards will be superseded eventually by Enhanced Data GSM Environment EDGE and Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service UMTS . New standards are still being defined but it is believed that they will have similarities to the network behavior described herein and it will also be understood by persons skilled in the art that the embodiments described herein are intended to use any other suitable standards that are developed in the future. The wireless link connecting the communication subsystem with the wireless network represents one or more different Radio Frequency RF channels operating according to defined protocols specified for GSM GPRS communications. With newer network protocols these channels are capable of supporting both circuit switched voice communications and packet switched data communications.

Although the wireless network associated with mobile device is a GSM GPRS wireless network in one implementation other wireless networks may also be associated with the mobile device in variant implementations. The different types of wireless networks that may be employed include for example data centric wireless networks voice centric wireless networks and dual mode networks that can support both voice and data communications over the same physical base stations. Combined dual mode networks include but are not limited to Code Division Multiple Access CDMA or CDMA2000 networks GSM GPRS networks as mentioned above and future third generation 3G networks like EDGE and UMTS. Some other examples of data centric networks include WiFi 802.11 Mobitex and DataTAC network communication systems. Examples of other voice centric data networks include Personal Communication Systems PCS networks like GSM and Time Division Multiple Access TDMA systems. The main processor also interacts with additional subsystems such as a Random Access Memory RAM a flash memory a display an auxiliary input output I O subsystem a data port a keyboard a speaker a microphone short range communications and other device subsystems . As will be described further below the keyboard which can be referred to as a keypad can be a physical keyboard or a keyboard displayed on the display when the display in question is a touch sensitive display. A physical keyboard is a keyboard that comprises buttons that can move upon being depressed. Further the keyboard can be a full physical keyboard full physical keypad which in the context of the present disclosure is to be understood as being a keyboard with one key per letter of the Latin alphabet or one key per letter of any other suitable alphabet.

Some of the subsystems of the mobile device perform communication related functions whereas other subsystems may provide resident or on device functions. By way of example the display and the keyboard may be used for both communication related functions such as entering typing a text message for transmission over the network and device resident functions such as a calculator or task list.

The mobile device can send and receive communication signals over the wireless network after required network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Network access is associated with a subscriber or user of the mobile device . To identify a subscriber the mobile device requires a SIM RUIM card i.e. Subscriber Identity Module or a Removable User Identity Module to be inserted into a SIM RUIM interface in order to communicate with a network. The SIM card or RUIM is one type of a conventional smart card that can be used to identify a subscriber of the mobile device and to personalize the mobile device among other things. Without the SIM card the mobile device is not fully operational for communication with the wireless network . By inserting the SIM card RUIM into the SIM RUIM interface a subscriber can access all subscribed services. Services may include web browsing and messaging such as e mail voice mail Short Message Service SMS and Multimedia Messaging Services MMS . More advanced services may include point of sale field service and sales force automation. The SIM card RUIM includes a processor and memory for storing information. Once the SIM card RUIM is inserted into the SIM RUIM interface it is coupled to the main processor . In order to identify the subscriber the SIM card RUIM can include some user parameters such as an International Mobile Subscriber Identity IMSI . An advantage of using the SIM card RUIM is that a subscriber is not necessarily bound by any single physical mobile device. The SIM card RUIM may store additional subscriber information for a mobile device as well including datebook or calendar data and recent call data which can also be referred to as data items. Alternatively user identification data and data items can also be programmed into the flash memory .

The mobile device is a battery powered device and includes a battery interface for receiving one or more rechargeable batteries . In at least some embodiments the battery can be a smart battery with an embedded microprocessor. The battery interface is coupled to a regulator not shown which assists the battery in providing power V to the mobile device . Although current technology makes use of a battery future technologies such as micro fuel cells or capacitor based power supplies may provide the power to the mobile device .

The mobile device also includes an operating system and software components to which are described in more detail below. The operating system and the software components to that are executed by the main processor are typically stored in a persistent store such as the flash memory which may alternatively be a read only memory ROM or similar storage element not shown . Those skilled in the art will appreciate that portions of the operating system and the software components to such as specific device applications or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into a volatile store such as the RAM . Other software components can also be included as is well known to those skilled in the art.

The subset of software applications that control basic device operations including data and voice communication applications will normally be installed on the mobile device during its manufacture. Other software applications include a message application that can be any suitable software program that allows a user of the mobile device to send and receive electronic messages. Various alternatives exist for the message application as is well known to those skilled in the art. Messages that have been sent or received by the user are typically stored in the flash memory of the mobile device or some other suitable storage element in the mobile device . In at least some embodiments some of the sent and received messages may be stored remotely from the device such as in a data store of an associated host system that the mobile device communicates with.

The software applications can further include a device state module a Personal Information Manager PIM and other suitable modules not shown . The device state module provides persistence i.e. the device state module ensures that important device data is stored in persistent memory such as the flash memory so that the data is not lost when the mobile device is turned off or loses power.

The PIM includes functionality for organizing and managing data items of interest to the user such as but not limited to e mail contacts which can also be referred to as an address book calendar events appointments and task items. The PIM can also organize and manage any voice mails recorded on the mobile device . A PIM application has the ability to send and receive data items via the wireless network . PIM data items may be seamlessly integrated synchronized and updated via the wireless network with the mobile device subscriber s corresponding data items stored in or accessible by a host computer system. This functionality creates a mirrored host computer on the mobile device with respect to such items. This can be particularly advantageous when the host computer system is the mobile device subscriber s office computer system.

The mobile device also includes a connect module and an information technology IT policy module . The connect module implements the communication protocols that are required for the mobile device to communicate with the wireless infrastructure and any host system such as an enterprise system that the mobile device is authorized to interface with.

The connect module includes a set of application programming interfaces APIs that can be integrated with the mobile device to allow the mobile device to use any number of services associated with the enterprise system. The connect module allows the mobile device to establish an end to end secure authenticated communication pipe with the host system. A subset of applications for which access is provided by the connect module can be used to pass information technology IT policy commands from the host system to the mobile device . This can be done in a wireless or wired manner. These instructions can then be passed to the IT policy module to modify the configuration of the device . Alternatively in some cases the IT policy update can also be done over a wired connection.

Other types of software applications can also be installed on the mobile device . These software applications can be third party applications which are added after the manufacture of the mobile device . Examples of third party applications include games calculators utilities etc.

The additional applications can be loaded onto the mobile device through at least one of the wireless network the auxiliary input output I O subsystem the data port the short range communications subsystem or any other suitable device subsystem . This flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the mobile device and may provide enhanced on device functions communication related functions or both. For example secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the mobile device .

The data port enables a subscriber to set preferences through an external device or software application and extends the capabilities of the mobile device by providing for information or software downloads to the mobile device other than through a wireless communication network. The alternate download path may for example be used to load an encryption key onto the mobile device through a direct and thus reliable and trusted connection to provide secure device communication.

The data port can be any suitable port that enables data communication between the mobile device and another computing device. The data port can be a serial or a parallel port. In some instances the data port can be a USB port that includes data lines for data transfer and a supply line that can provide a charging current to charge the battery of the mobile device .

The short range communications subsystem provides for communication between the mobile device and different systems or devices without the use of the wireless network . For example the subsystem may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components for short range communication. Examples of short range communication standards include standards developed by the Infrared Data Association IrDA Bluetooth and the 802.11 family of standards developed by IEEE.

In use a received signal such as a text message an e mail message or web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem and input to the main processor . The main processor will then process the received signal for output to the display or alternatively to the auxiliary I O subsystem . A subscriber may also compose data items such as e mail messages for example using the keyboard in conjunction with the display and possibly the auxiliary I O subsystem . The auxiliary subsystem may include devices such as a touch screen mouse track ball infrared fingerprint detector or a roller wheel with dynamic button pressing capability. The keyboard is preferably an alphanumeric keyboard a telephone type keypad or both. However other types of keyboards may also be used. A composed item may be transmitted sent over the wireless network through the communication subsystem .

For voice communications the overall operation of the mobile device is substantially similar except that the received signals are output to the speaker and signals for transmission are generated by the microphone . Alternative voice or audio I O subsystems such as a voice message recording subsystem can also be implemented on the mobile device . Although voice or audio signal output is accomplished primarily through the speaker the display can also be used to provide additional information such as the identity of a calling party duration of a voice call or other voice call related information.

Phoneword dialing is a well known method of dialing a telephone number to which is associated a word an acronym or an alphabetical sequence that is easy to remember. Phoneword dialing is mostly but not exclusively associated with toll free numbers and prime rate numbers. The association of letters to a phoneword is generally set in accordance with the mapping shown at Table I.

As examples of phonewords the phoneword 1 800 GOFEDEX corresponds to the telephone number 1 800 463 3339 and the phoneword 1 800 FLOWERS corresponds to the telephone number 1 800 356 9377. The letter to number mapping of Table I has a counterpart standard telephone keypad shown at which is used on landline telephone as well as on some mobile devices.

Progress in mobile communication devices has led to mobile communication devices that have full physical keyboards. This allows users to write type messages efficiently. However dialing by phoneword using a full physical keyboard can be challenging as discussed below.

In some mobile communication devices with full physical keyboards pressing a pre determined key for example the ALT key will enable dialing an alphabetic sequence of a phoneword. As an example using the full physical keyboard to dial 1 800 GOFEDEX would require the user to dial enter 1 800 followed by holding down the ALT key while pressing the keys G O F E D E and X or by pressing and releasing the ALT key before entering each letter G O F E D E and X . As simple as this may sound a large proportion of users will not be aware of this feature and consequently will not be able to efficiently dial enter phonewords using the full physical keyboard .

The present disclosure can address this situation by indicating to the user that dialing by phoneword entering letters of a phoneword can be done by holding down the ALT key or any other suitable pre determined key. The indication provided to the user can be a visual indication displayed on the display . For example an indication spelling out Press ALT to dial by letter which is a visual or text indication can be displayed on the display . Any other suitable type of indication can be used without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. For example instead of or in addition to the text indication Press ALT to dial by letter there can be a pictograph also referred to as a pictogram or an ideogram indication displayed on the display. As another example of a type of indication that can be used to indicate that a pre determined key can be used to dial by letter the mobile device 100 could play an audio indication to press the pre determined key to dial by letter. The audio indication can be a spoken message a ringtone or any other suitable type audio indication. As yet another example of a type of indication that can be used to indicate that a pre determined key can be used to dial by letter the mobile device could if it includes a vibration device e.g a vibe motor or piezoelectric elements vibrate to draw the user s attention to a text or pictograph indication displayed on the display .

In some embodiments instead of having to hold down a pre determined key e.g. the ALT key to enable dialing letters the user might have to press and hold for a pre determined time period the keys of the letters of the phoneword. For example if the user wishes to enter the letter R using the keyboard of the user would press and hold the key on which are inscribed the letter R and the number 3. At first the number 3 would be entered but after the key is pressed and held pressed for the pre determined period of time the letter R would be entered and would replace the number 3.

Other than 1 800 numbers examples of toll free numerical beginning sequences that may have associated thereto a phoneword and that can cause the mobile communication device to provide an indication to press a pre determined key or to perform any other suitable action to dial by letter can include for example in North America 1 855 1 866 1 877 and 1 888 for the purpose of the present disclosure a numerical beginning sequence can be referred to as a prefix or as a telephone number prefix . Additionally the indication to press a pre determined key to dial by letter can be provided when the telephone establishes that the numerical beginning sequence is that of a prime rate telephone number which may have associated thereto a phoneword. For example in North America the initial dialing sequence 1 900 is that of prime rate telephone numbers which can be associated with chat lines voting for television shows contests and other types of services. Other countries may have different toll free telephone number numerical beginning sequences as well as different prime rate telephone number numerical beginning sequence. For example in Germany the equivalent of 1 800 numbers is 0800 numbers. Any type of telephone number that has a numerical beginning sequence that may have associated thereto a phoneword is to be considered as being within the scope of the present disclosure.

The indication e.g. the text indication can be provided when the mobile communication device determines that the initial dialing sequence for example 1 800 is that of a telephone number that may have associated thereto a phoneword. Alternatively the indication can be provided when the mobile communication device is set into its telephone mode by pressing the place call key . This can be useful when local telephone numbers have associated thereto a phoneword.

Also shown in is a different network to which the mobile communication device can become operationally connected when the mobile communication device enters the coverage area of the network . The network is operationally connected to a server which can include or which can be connected to a database . The database can include telephone numbers or a listing of telephone numbers that may have associated thereto a phoneword. The listing can include toll free telephone numbers prime rate telephone numbers and any other type of telephone number that has an initial dialing sequence indicative of the possibility of the telephone number having a phoneword associated thereto. The database can also include a table of prefixes to which phonewords may be associated. Such prefixes may include toll free number prefixes and prime rate telephone number prefixes. The prefixes associated to the database may be different than those associated with the database .

When the mobile communication device is activated switched on and its network communications capabilities are enabled the mobile communication device connects to the network . During the establishment of a connection between the mobile communication device and the network the mobile communication device can obtain parameters from the network . The parameters can include the aforementioned prefixes that may have associated thereto phonewords. The parameters and prefixes obtained by the mobile communication device from the network may depend on the location of the network . For example if the network is in North America the parameters might include as prefixes numerical beginning sequences 1 800 1 855 1 866 1 877 1 888 and 1 900. As another example if the network is in Germany the uploaded parameters would include as a numerical beginning sequence 0800. The parameters can be stored for example in the RAM shown at or in any other suitable memory of the mobile communication device .

Once the aforementioned parameters and valid numerical beginning sequences are present stored in the mobile communication device a phoneword indication program running on the mobile communication device can provide an indication when a numerical beginning sequence that may have associated thereto a phoneword is received entered at the mobile communication device . The phoneword indication program can be one of the software components of the mobile communication device .

At step still at the mobile communication device a numerical beginning sequence is received entered and at step the numerical beginning sequence received entered at is compared to prefixes obtained at step . The comparison effected at the mobile communication device will return a match status indicating whether or not there is a match between the numerical beginning sequence entered at step and the prefixes obtained at step . At step the mobile communication device provides the indication to perform an action if the match status is positive. If the match is negative the indication is not provided. As described above the indication can include among others displaying a text message on the display of the mobile communication device.

At step the mobile communication device operating in connected to a network enters a coverage area of a different network . Subsequent entering the coverage area of the different network at step the mobile communication device connects to the different network and obtains numerical beginning sequences prefixes from the different network . The valid numerical beginning sequences can be downloaded from the different network by the mobile communication device or can be uploaded by the different network to the mobile communication device . The valid numerical beginning sequences in question will depend on the location of the different network . For the purpose of the present disclosure the location of the different network includes the area covered area served by the different network . The valid numerical beginning sequences obtained by the mobile communication device from the different network may pertain only to toll free telephone numbers accessible from the province state or jurisdiction in which the different network is located.

At step still at the mobile communication device a numerical beginning sequence is received entered and at step the numerical beginning sequence received entered at is compared to prefixes obtained at step . The comparison effected at the mobile communication device will return a match status indicating whether or not there is a match between the numerical beginning sequence entered at step and the prefixes obtained at step . At step the mobile communication device provides the indication to perform an operation if the match status is positive. If the match is negative the indication is not provided. As described above the indication can include among others displaying a text message on a display of the mobile communication device.

In some mobile communication devices pressing the place call key will result in a Call Log interface being shown on the display of the device. The Call Log interface allows the user to enter using the keyboard a telephone number to be dialed. As the telephone number is being dialed i.e. as digits are entered previously logged called telephone numbers that match the sequence of digits entered thus far are displayed to the user who may stop entering digits of the telephone number and instead select one of the telephone numbers being displayed. shows an example of a mobile communication device with a Call Log interface which has an input window in which the digits 1 555 684 have been entered. As a result of those digits having been entered the Call Log interface displays three numbers that were previously dialed and that include the beginning sequence 1 555 684 namely 1 555 684 4072 1 555 684 3965 and 1 555 684 5238. Alternatively or additionally the Call Log interface can present to the user numbers that are listed in a telephone number store present in a memory of the mobile communication device . If the user wishes to dial a telephone number that does not correspond to one of the three displayed numbers he simply continues to enter digits of the telephone number he wishes to reach. If the user wishes to dial one of the three numbers appearing on the Call Log interface he can simply select the desired telephone number using any suitable display navigation means such as for example a navigation button .

The Call Log interface may also be used to search contact names stored in the mobile communication device . For example when the user wishes to retrieve contact information e.g. a telephone number of a person named Marie he simply begins entering the letters M A R I and E using the keyboard . As the user enters the letters the names that have a corresponding sequence of letters are displayed on the Call Log interface and can be selected by the user at any time. shows an example where the letters M A and R have been entered in the input window and where the names and their corresponding telephone numbers Marc Marie and Mario are displayed in the Call Log interface . The user can select Marie using the navigation button .

The Call Log interface is often set by the mobile communication device manufacturer to display in the input window numbers as long as only numbers have been entered at the keyboard . For example if the user wishes to search for the contact information of a person named Denis the user would enter the letters D E N I and S. The search window would start displaying 5 corresponds to D and then 52 correspond to DE simultaneously the Call Log interface would display names that begin with D and E as well as telephone numbers that begin with 52. shows an example of a scenario where the digits 5 and 2 are displayed in the search window and where the names Denis Derek and Devon are listed in the Call Log interface which does not in this example list any telephone number beginning with 52. Subsequently after the user has entered the letter N which does not have any number associated thereto the search window would display DEN and only Denis would be displayed in the Call Log interface . This is shown in .

As such a user dialing a phoneword that includes letters that do not have associated thereto a letter will likely notice when he missed holding down the ALT key or to perform any other pre determined suitable action to dial a letter. For example if the user begins dialing the phoneword 1 800 FLOWERS but forgets to hold the ALT key when using the keyboard the Call Log interface will first display in the search window the number 18006 which is shown in . However as the user dials the letter L the search window will display WX00FL shown in which is nonsensical in that it is neither a telephone number nor an entry in the contacts list of the mobile communication device. Clearly the user should then notice that a dialing error was made and that correction is required. Similarly if the user begins dialing the phoneword 1 800 GOFEDEX but forgets to hold the ALT key when using the keyboard the Call Log interface will first display in the search window the number 1800. However as the user dials the letter G the search window will display WX00G which again is nonsensical in that it is neither a telephone number nor an entry in the contacts list of the mobile communication device.

Another type of error when dialing phonewords is when the user holds down the ALT key when dialing some letters but not when dialing other letters that happen to have numbers associated thereto. The letters in question are in the example of the keyboard W E R S D F Z X and C. As an example if the phoneword to be entered is 1 800 GOFEDEX which corresponds to the telephone number 1 800 463 3339 but the user omits to hold down the pre determined key e.g. the ALT key after having properly dialed 1 800 GO the resulting phoneword entered would be 1 800 GO62528 corresponding to the telephone number 1 800 4662528 which as far as the inventors are aware of is not an assigned or registered 1 800 number. is a flowchart of a method of the present disclosure in accordance to certain embodiments of the present disclosure which can help reduce the occurrence of such errors.

At action the mobile communication device receives a letter or a number entered at the mobile communication device. A letter is received if the above noted operation was performed and if a key having the letter associated thereto was pressed in concordance with the operation. A number is received if the above noted operation was not performed and a number key was pressed. If a number was entered the method proceeds to action where the letter associated with the input provided at is identified. For example it the number 5 was and if that key also has associated thereto the letter D then the letter identified at will be the letter D.

At action partial candidate phonewords which include candidate telephone numbers are constructed in accordance with the numerical beginning sequence received at in accordance with the number entered at and in accordance with the letter identified at action . For example if the numerical beginning sequence is 1 800 the number entered at is 5 and the letter identified at is D then the partial candidate phonewords are 1 800 D which corresponds to 1 800 3 when the letter D corresponds to 3 on a standard keypad and 1 800 5.

At action the partial candidate phonewords are compared to assigned phonewords to identify assigned phonewords which include assigned telephone numbers that include the partial candidate phonewords. Referring back to the comparison can be effected at the server which can be referred to as a comparison module. The assigned phonewords that include the partial candidate phonewords are displayed on the mobile communication device at action where they can be selected by the user. Optionally at action the assigned phonewords that include the partial phonewords can be ranked in accordance with any suitable ranking method or predictive algorithm to obtain ranked assigned phonewords. The ranked assigned phonewords can be displayed in rank order at action . As an example the ranking may be performed in accordance with how often the phonewords in question are called by the user of the mobile communication device or by all the users that have dialed the phonewords in question. Referring back to the ranking of the phonewords may be performed at the server .

Referring again to action of if a letter is received the method proceeds to action where a partial candidate phoneword is constructed. As an example if the input was the letter D then the constructed phoneword will be 1 800 D. The method then proceeds to actions and as described above.

Following action the method proceeds to action where continued dialing of the phoneword or selection of a displayed telephone number phoneword can be effected. If dialing is to be continued the method loops back to action to receive another letter or number. For example if the letter E is received and for example if the existing partial phonewords are 1 800 D and 1 800 5 as described above then the constructed phonewords resulting from will be 1 800 DE 1 800 33 on a standard keypad and 1 800 5E 1 800 53 . However if the number 2 on full keyboard of mobile communication device was entered then the method proceeds to action where the letter associated with the number 2 is identified the letter in question is E in the present example . Subsequently at action the partial candidate phonewords 1 800 D2 1 800 32 1 800 52 1 800 DE 1 800 33 and 1 800 53 are constructed. The method may then proceeds to actions and as described above.

It is to be noted that the candidate telephone numbers displayed at action can be displayed as phonewords numbers or as both without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. For example the phoneword 1 800 GOFEDEX could be displayed as such or as 1 800 463 3339 or as both 1 800 GOFEDEX and 1 800 463 3339.

Upon the selection of a candidate number at action the method proceeds to action where the call can be placed.

In the preceding description for purposes of explanation numerous details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments. However it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that these specific details are not required. In other instances well known electrical structures and circuits are shown in block diagram form in order not to obscure the understanding. For example specific details are not provided as to whether the embodiments described herein are implemented as a software routine hardware circuit firmware or a combination thereof.

Embodiments of the disclosure can be represented as a computer program product stored in a machine readable medium also referred to as a computer readable medium a processor readable medium or a computer usable medium having a computer readable program code embodied therein .
