This application is a divisional of U.S. Nonprovisional Patent Application Ser. No. 13 463 290 filed May 3 2012 which claims the benefit of German Application no. 10 2011 100 779.6 filed May 6 2011 the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The invention relates to a semiconductor device and a method for electrically connecting a low resistive thin film resistor.

Various important technological applications employ thin film resistors. These thin film resistors may be integrated in individual integrated semiconductor devices or they can be located in complex hybrid circuits or integrated circuits. Thin film resistors may be arranged as resistive ladder networks in analog to digital converters or as current limiting and or load resistors in various different circuits such as amplifiers filters current or voltage buffering or biasing stages etc.

Thin film resistors may comprise various different materials as for example tantalum nitride TaN silicon chromium SiCr or nickel chromium NiCr . These resistor materials are generally evaporated or sputtered onto a substrate wafer at a metal interconnect level and subsequently patterned and etched. In order to use the thin film resistors they have to be electrically connected. The parameters and performance of the thin film resistors is then related to the condition and to the quality of the resistor surface and the electrical connection. However within the established manufacturing processes for integrated semiconductor devices it is challenging to contact thin film resistors without impairing or destroying important parameters or even the thin film transistors themselves.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 921 962 B1 discloses a semiconductor device and a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device with a thin film resistor. As shown in of the reference conductively filled VIAs extend from the upper metal interconnect layer to the thin film resistors and a lower metal interconnect layer . The VIAs are formed simultaneously with no processing steps being added to contact resistors . VIAs preferably contact optional portions of hard mask that remain over the ends of resistor material . However VIAs may contact resistor material and or hard mask . Optional hard mask portions can protect resistor material during the VIA etch. Hard mask portions comprise a conductive material such as titanium tungsten TiW titanium nitride TiN or molybdenum Mo . Resistor material can comprise materials such as tantalum nitride TaN silicon chromium SiCr or nickel chromium NiCr .

U.S. Pat. No. 7 112 286 B2 discloses a thin film resistor structure which includes an electrical interface layer or head layer that is a combination of a titanium Ti layer and a titanium nitride TiN layer. The combination of the Ti layer and the TiN layer mitigates resistance associated with the electrical interface. Additionally the employment of the Ti layer provides a more reproducible resistivity value associated with the electrical interface layer. Furthermore the Ti layer acts as a glue layer to facilitate adhesion of the TiN to the thin film resistor material.

In order to connect lower level interconnect layers of for example aluminum the interconnect layers traditionally were covered by a titanium nitride layer TiN . A hole for a VIA is then etched by a strong pre sputter etch step in order to remove the TiN layer and reach the aluminum layer below. Subsequently the opening for the VIA is covered with a liner of titanium Ti and then with a liner of TiN. Finally the remaining space within the opening is filled with tungsten in order to electrically connect the lower level interconnect layer with a higher level. This strong pre sputter etch for removing the TiN layer on top of the aluminum is not compatible with VIA etching for connecting a thin film resistor layer as the thin film resistor layer may easily be destroyed.

It is an object of the invention to provide a manufacturing method and a semiconductor device with an improved interconnect structure for connecting thin film resistors.

According to an aspect of the invention a method of manufacturing an electronic device is provided. A first conductive layer first metal interconnect layer is deposited. There is an insulating layer first intermetal dielectric layer deposited on top of the first conductive layer. A resistive layer is deposited on top of the insulating layer and structured in order to serve as a thin film resistor. A second insulating layer second intermetal dielectric is then deposited on top of the resistive layer. A first opening is etched into the insulating layers first and second intermetal dielectric down to the first conductive layer. A second opening is etched into the insulating layers first and second intermetal dielectrics down to the first conductive layer. The horizontal cross sectional plane i.e. the area of the cross section of the opening in the horizontal plane of the second opening is arranged such that it at least partially overlaps the resistive layer of the thin film resistor in a first dimension. In other words if the layers conductive layers insulating layers resistive layer are assumed to be arranged vertically one on top of the other the at least partial overlap of the opening of the VIA is then in at least one direction in the horizontal plane. This arrangement can result in various different advantageous embodiments.

The material of the resistive layer can preferable comprise materials such as tantalum nitride TaN silicon chromium SiCr or nickel chromium NiCr .

The layers are configured such that the first VIA and the second VIA are electrically connected at a lower side by the first conductive layer and at an upper side by the second conductive layer.

The second opening and the first opening are filled with an electrically conductive material as for example tungsten. The first and second openings are configured to serve as VIAs vertical electrical connections through the intermetal dielectrics. A second conductive material can be deposited on top of the second intermetal dielectric. The second VIA electrically connects the resistive layer of the thin film resistor in the region where the horizontal cross sectional area overlaps the resistive layer of the thin film resistor. This results in an electrical connection of the second conductive layer with the thin film resistor.

The same dry etching process may then be used for etching the first and the second opening. This simplifies manufacturing and is possible since the second opening only partially overlaps the resistive layer of the thin film resistor.

The overlap between the opening of the VIA or in other words the VIA itself and the resistive layer of the TFR in the at least one direction in the horizontal plane is advantageously between 0.2 m and 0.4 m.

In an aspect of the invention the thickness of the resistive layer for the thin film resistor may be adjusted properly to connect the VIA to the resistive layer. A thickness between 50 nm and 100 nm and more is advantageous. This provides that the resistive layer is not entirely removed during etching the VIA for connecting the resistive layer of the thin film resistor.

The second opening or in other words the second VIA for connecting the resistive layer of the thin film resistor is then configured to electrically connect a first conductive layer below the resistive layer of the thin film resistor and a second conductive layer above the resistive layer of the thin film resistor and the thin film resistor between the two conductive layers. This aspect of the invention provides that the relative position of the resistive layer of the thin film resistor becomes irrelevant or at least less significant as the resistive layer is connected to two conductive layers embedding somehow the resistive layer. If the resistive layer is then further apart from one of the conductive layers it is automatically closer to the other conductive layer.

A diameter or length of the second opening for connecting the TFR can be chosen or rather increased such that the remaining cross sectional area of the opening being reduced by the overlap with the resistive layer corresponds to the cross sectional area of the normal VIA. The resistance of the connection to the first conductive layer is then not reduced by the overlap compared with the normal configuration which decreases the contact area between the VIA and the second conductive layer.

According to another aspect of the invention the dimension of the second opening or the second VIA in a second direction in the horizontal plane can be greater than the dimension of the resistive layer in this direction. This means that the diameter of the VIA can extend over be larger than the resistive layer on both sides in this second direction. This provides that there is a larger tolerance for the position of the dimensions of the resistive layer relative to the VIA. The resistance of the connection between the VIA and the resistive layer is then less independent of the exact position of the resistive layer with respect to the VIA. The width of the second VIA in the second direction may be 0.4 m.

Advantageously a plurality of first openings can be provided. This plurality of first openings can be configured as an array of first opening. This plurality of first opening may then be configured to connect the first conductive layer and the second conductive layer. This can reduce the parasitic resistance between of the interconnection between the second conductive layer and the first conductive layer thereby reducing the parasitic resistance of the interconnection leading from the thin film resistor to the first conductive layer and from there to the second conductive layer.

The invention also provides an electronic device that is manufactured according to the aspects and embodiments of the invention. The electronic device may comprise a first conductive layer e.g. lower level metal MET1 a first intermetal dielectric layer on top of first conductive layer a resistive layer of a thin film resistor on top of the first intermetal dielectric a second intermetal dielectric layer on top of the resistive layer and a second conductive layer higher level metal MET2 . A first VIA is provided through the second intermetal dielectric and the first intermetal dielectric layer down to the first conductive layer for electrically connecting the first conductive layer. A second VIA is provided that leads through at least the second intermetal dielectric layer down to the first conductive layer. A horizontal cross sectional plane of the second VIA can then at least partially overlap the resistive layer of the thin film resistor. The cross sectional plane is coplanar to the horizontal plane if the direction in which the layers are stacked on top of each others are considered the vertical direction being perpendicular to the horizontal plane.

The resistive layer of the thin film resistor can have a substantially rectangular shape and the partial overlap of the horizontal cross sectional plane of the second VIA can extend beyond a circumferential outer edge of the resistive layer of the thin film resistor at three sides of the resistive layer of the thin film resistor.

The first VIA and the second VIA are electrically connected at a lower side by the first conductive layer. The first VIA and the second VIA are electrically connected at an upper side by the second conductive layer.

During manufacturing the conductive layer MET1 is deposited. After structuring the first conductive metal layer MET1. An insulating layer for example a first intermetal dielectric IMD1 is deposited on top of the first conductive layer. A resistive layer for a thin film resistor is deposited and structured. Another insulating layer for example a second intermetal dielectric IMD2 is applied and structured. Finally a dry etching step is performed during which the openings for the intermetal VIA VIAM and the VIA for connecting the thin film resistor layer TFR VIATFR are provided. Finally the remaining space within the VIAs is filled with a conductive material as for example tungsten. It possible to use the same dry etching step for both VIAs VIAM and VIATFR.

The VIA TFR is partially overlapping the thin film resistor layer TFR in longitudinal direction. The length of the VIA in longitudinal direction is LTFRVIA. Between conductive layer MET2 and the thin film resistor layer TFR the VIA VIATFR has a length of LTFRVIA. Between the thin film resistor layer TFR and conductive layer MET1 the length in longitudinal direction is then reduced to L1TFRVIA. This is due to the fact that the VIA VIATFR overlaps the thin film resistor layer TFR by a certain amount OLX LTFRVIA L1TFRVIA.

The width of the VIA VIATFR in lateral direction is WTFRVIA. As shown in the width of VIATFR is smaller than the width WTFR of the thin film resistor layer TFR. The partial overlap in the first dimension i.e. in longitudinal direction provides sufficient electrical connection between VIATFR and the thin film resistor TFR.

The first VIAs VIAM are configured as array plurality of VIAs. This reduces the parasitic resistance of the interconnection from the second conductive layer MET2 to the first conductive layer MET1 and from there to the resistive layer. The second conductive layer MET2 is usually the layer which is used to connect the resistor.

A possible parameter range for the dimensions can be 0.2 m OLX LTFRVIAREST which means that the length OLX of the overlap in longitudinal direction should not be smaller than 0.2 m and not greater than a minimum residual diameter LTFRVIAREST. LTFRVIAREST is diameter of TFRVIA in longitudinal direction minus the length of the overlap OLX. This remaining diameter LTFRVIAREST can be equal to the normal diameter LVIAM in longitudinal direction of VIAM.

The overlap OLX between the cross sectional area of the opening of VIATFR in the first direction may be between 0.2 m and LTFRVIAREST.

The thickness of the resistive layer of the TFR may be about 50 nm. The may even range down to 30 nm.

The width and length or the diameter of VIATFR is advantageously chosen such the part of the VIA that connects the resistive layer of the TFR with the first conductive layer MET1 is still large enough in particular as large as usual. The dimensions of the opening may then be chosen such that the reduction of the area of the cross sectional plane of the opening due to the overlap with the resistive layer is compensated. The opening for the VIATFR may then be increased in order to compensate for the loss due to the overlap with the resistive layer on the way down to the first conductive layer.

After etching the opening for VIATFR the opening for VIATFR reaches down to MET1. As it overlaps the TFR there is a small shoulder where IMD2 does not cover the TFR but the TFR is still supported by IMD1. In lateral direction the opening is larger than the TFR on both sides of the TFR by an amount OLY.

The pattern definition and finalization of the VIAM is then performed. This step includes applying photoresist exposure developing etching an ashes step and cleanup. The two openings for the VIAM and VIATFR are now prepared.

The openings for VIAM may be etched first or VIAM and VIATFR may be etched at the same time. The same dry etching step may here be used as the opening of the TFR overlaps the TFR only by a small amount. The VIAs VIAM and VIATFR are then filled. The step comprises barrier deposition and tungsten fill W fill a tungsten CMP step and cleanup.

Although the invention has been described hereinabove with reference to a specific embodiments it is not limited to these embodiments and no doubt further alternatives will occur to the skilled person that lie within the scope of the invention as claimed.
