title: Systems and methods for managing an account
abstract: An account is managed using information read from a dual frequency transponder. Information stored on the dual frequency transponder can be read by a NFC-enabled device and by a UHF RFID reader. The information links, corresponds, or otherwise provides access to account information stored at a remote server. For example, a NFC-enabled device can read the information from the dual frequency transponder and use that information to enable instant and on-the-spot recharging of a toll account. In addition, a UHF RFID toll reader can scan information from the dual frequency transponder and use that information to debit toll charges from the correct toll account. The dual frequency transponder can be embedded in a license plate and read using a reader placed in the road. Additionally, the transponder can be configured to function at the correct frequency only when a valid vehicle registration sticker is applied to the license plate.

This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119 e to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 865 600 filed Aug. 13 2013 and entitled SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR RADIO FREQUENCY IDENTIFICATION ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT APPLICATIONS which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety as if set forth in full.

The embodiments described herein are related to radio frequency identification RFID applications and more specifically to applications that allow for improved management and recharging of prepaid accounts.

RFID is a technology that allows companies to develop applications in a variety of areas. At its core RFID is a technology that allows for the identification of objects or people and to communicate information related to associated objects or people. Some of the major areas that RFID is enabling new applications include asset tracking companies can put RFID tags on assets that are lost or stolen often that are underutilized or that are just hard to locate at the time they are needed manufacturing RFID has been used in manufacturing plants for more than a decade. It s used to track parts and work in process and to reduce defects increase throughput and manage the production of different versions of the same product supply chain management RFID technology has been used in closed loop supply chains or to automate parts of the supply chain within a company s control for years payment systems one of the most popular uses of RFID today is to pay for road tolls without stopping and security and access control RFID has long been used as an electronic key to control who has access to office buildings or areas within office buildings. There are also numerous other types of applications such as animal or human tracking and identification electronic passports border crossing library applications 

An RFID system comprises one or more tags or transponders that are somehow associated with an object or objects and one or more readers or interrogators configured to read information out of the tag. The reader reads information by broadcasting a Radio Frequency RF signal over certain range. When a tag is within range of the reader and receives the signal it can reflect that signal back to the reader in order to communicate with the reader. In order to communicate the reader may put certain commands on the RF signal and the tag can respond by putting information stored in the tag onto the signal that is reflected back to the reader.

RFID systems can employ various types of technology including active technology semi active technology and passive technology. Active and semi active systems include a battery within the tag. In passive systems no battery is included in the tag. Rather the tag receives all the energy it needs from the received RF signal. Because passive tags do not include a battery they can be made smaller are less expensive than active or semi active tags and can also provide much more flexibility to design tags to meet various application and environmental requirements. While passive tags typically cannot communicate over as long a distance the size cost and flexibility provided by passive tags make them much more attractive for many applications.

RFID systems can also operate over many frequency ranges and in accordance with several communication protocols. A couple of the most common frequency ranges are the High Frequency HF band 13.56 MHz and Ultra High Frequency UHF band 865 928 MHz . HF systems can operate over shorter ranges e.g. 10 cm lm and at lower data rates whereas the UHF systems can operate over longer ranges 1 12 m and at higher data rates.

Near Field Communication NFC systems are examples of HF systems. NFC is a set of standards for smartphones and similar devices to establish radio communication with each other by touching them together or bringing them into proximity usually no more than a few inches. Present and anticipated applications include contactless transactions data exchange and simplified setup of more complex communications such as Wi Fi. Communication is also possible between an NFC device and an unpowered NFC chip in a tag.

NFC standards cover communications protocols and data exchange formats and are based on existing radio frequency identification standards including ISO IEC 14443 and FeliCa. The standards include ISO IEC 18092 4 and those defined by the NFC Forum which was founded in 2004 by Nokia Philips and Sony and now has more than 160 members. The Forum also promotes NFC and certifies device compliance. It fits the criteria for being considered a personal area network.

NFC builds upon RFID systems by allowing two way communication between endpoints where earlier systems such as contact less smartcards were one way only. NFC devices can also be used in contactless payment systems similar to those currently used in credit cards and electronic ticket smartcards and allow mobile payment to replace or supplement these systems. For example Google Wallet allows consumers to store credit card and store loyalty card information in a virtual wallet and then use an NFC enabled device at terminals that accepts for example MasterCard PayPass transactions. The NFC Forum also promotes the potential for NFC enabled devices to act as electronic identity documents and keycards. As NFC has a shorter range and supports encryption it is generally better suited than earlier less private RFID systems for exchanging sensitive data such as personal finance and identification.

While there are many uses for HF technologies such as NFC UHF technologies typically support longer range communication and higher data rates. Thus UHF technology tends to excel in applications that include but is not limited to tolling and electronic vehicle registration asset supervision and supply chain management.

These and other features aspects and embodiments are described below in the section entitled Detailed Description. 

The embodiments disclosed herein can be implemented in numerous ways including as a process an apparatus a system a composition of matter a computer program product embodied on a computer readable storage medium and or a processor such as a processor configured to execute instructions stored on and or provided by a memory coupled to the processor. In this specification these example embodiments or any other implementations may be referred to as techniques. In general the order of the steps of disclosed processes may be altered. Unless stated otherwise a component such as a processor or a memory described as being configured to perform a task may be implemented as a general component that is temporarily configured to perform the task at a given time or a specific component that is manufactured to perform the task. As used herein the term processor refers to one or more devices circuits and or processing cores configured to process data such as computer program instructions.

A detailed description of one or more embodiments of the invention is provided below along with accompanying figures that illustrate the principles of operation. The invention is described in connection with such embodiments but the invention is not limited to any embodiment. The scope of the invention is limited only by the claims and the invention encompasses numerous alternatives modifications and equivalents. Numerous specific details are set forth in the following description in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. These details are provided for the purpose of example and the invention may be practiced according to the claims without some or all of these specific details. For the purpose of clarity technical material that is known in the technical fields related to the invention has not been described in detail so that the invention is not unnecessarily obscured.

Various embodiments of the systems and methods described herein are directed toward applications for a multi frequency transponder. In particular the various embodiments of the systems and methods described herein are directed toward applications for a dual frequency transponder that incorporates both UHF and HF capabilities and is therefore able to operate over both the UHF band e.g. 865 928 MHz and the HF band e.g. 13.56 MHz .

U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 811 649 entitled Systems and Methods for Connecting People with Product Information filed Apr. 12 2013 describes one application for a dual frequency transponder. Meanwhile the various embodiments of the systems and methods described herein are directed toward applying the dual frequency transponder to streamline electronic prepayment routines and practices. In particular in various embodiments a dual frequency transponder is used to enable immediate and on the spot prepayment of road tolls enforced through Electronic Toll Collection ETC systems. Although embodiments of the systems and methods described herein are with respect to applications for a dual frequency transponder in electronic toll collection it is to be understood that there are numerous other possible applications of a dual frequency transponder. For example other applications for a dual frequency transponder include but are not limited to parking access customs and border control and electronic vehicle registration EVR .

ETC systems eliminate traffic delays on toll roads by automating toll collection and obviating protracted stops at manual toll booths. Although a few ETC systems allows toll charges to be postpaid i.e. billed to users periodically and or a later date by far the most common ETC billing mechanism is to automatically deduct the toll charges from prepaid debit accounts. Generally an ETC system must first identify a passing vehicle before it can electronically debit the account of registered vehicle owner. For vehicle identification most ETC systems operating today e.g. E ZPass rely on RFID technology. More specifically most ETC systems issue RFID transponders or tags that are then registered or activated to link to specific vehicle owner accounts. For instance in order for a user Alice to gain access to an ETC service she will initially have to set up a toll account with an appropriate transit or toll authority e.g. FasTrak in the San Francisco Bay Area and then carry a registered or activated RFID transponder in or on her vehicle. Meanwhile most toll plazas have RFID reader equipment installed on at least some toll gates. As Alice s vehicle passes through a toll gate on the San Francisco Oakland Bay Bridge the onboard FasTrak transponder communicates to a RFID toll reader a unique radio signature identifying the vehicle. Based on this unique radio signature the ETC system can then determine the account i.e. Alice s from which to deduct the amount of the toll.

Some prepaid toll accounts are set up to be automatically replenished whenever the balance falls below a certain threshold. For example if Alice subscribes to a FasTrac credit card account a replenishment amount equaling her average monthly usage determined based on the previous 90 days of use is charged to the credit card linked to the account whenever the account s balance falls below a threshold of 15. Most users however want autonomy over their prepaid toll account balances and would prefer to recharge their prepaid toll account at their own discretion. Control over when and how much to recharge a toll account is especially attractive to users who incur toll charges on an infrequent intermittent or irregular basis.

Nevertheless current technology still imposes drastic limitations on when and where users can recharge prepaid toll accounts. Generally recharging can only be performed at designated Point of Sale POS stations e.g. convenient store ATM . As such users are required to take a number of proactive measures e.g. check toll account status or balance find a POS station well in advance of crossing a toll road since recharging cannot be done instantaneously and on the spot. In practice many users will fail to check their account balance beforehand and won t realize that their account balance is insufficient until they are at or near a toll gate where absent any POS stations they must then resort to time consuming manual toll transactions.

One primary reason why current technology falls short is that the conventional toll transponders in use today are single frequency devices. The E ZPass transponder for instance operate over only a single UHF i.e. 915 MHz band. Conventional toll transponders are designed to communicate only with the UHF RFID readers at toll gates. Consequently only UHF RFID toll readers can gain access to the information stored on conventional toll tags. In contrast the various embodiments of the systems and methods described herein are directed toward a dual frequency transponder. In various embodiments Near Field Communication NFC technology is integrated with a UHF transponder. The resulting dual frequency transponder in various embodiments is capable of communicating with NFC enabled devices as well as UHF RFID readers. In various embodiments when implemented as a toll transponder for use in an ETC system the dual frequency transponder can communicate with both a user s NFC enabled device e.g. smartphone and the typical UHF RFID reader equipment found at toll gates.

Since Nokia introduced the first NFC enabled phone in 2006 a steady stream of phones with NFC capabilities e.g. Samsung Nexus Motorola Droid have been marketed and sold. As a result a growing number of users have a portable NFC reader constantly ready at their disposal. An NFC enabled smartphone is equipped with an embedded NFC reader module that can communicate with other NFC devices including but not limited to other NFC enabled smartphones NFC POS terminals and NFC transponders and tags. Unlike other wireless technologies such as Bluetooth which generally require manual device discovery and or pairing two NFC devices can detect and automatically initiate a connection with one another as soon as they are within range e.g. 4 cm or less . For example an unlocked Google Android smartphone will scan for NFC tags analyze any discovered NFC tags categorize data from the NFC tags and then launch the appropriate application s to handle each NFC tag.

As shown in in various embodiments the transponder communicates with the device . In various embodiments the device may be an NFC enabled device e.g. Android smartphone and the transponder may communicate with the device using the HF band. Meanwhile in various embodiments the transponder may also communicate with the reader . In various embodiments the reader may be a UHF RFID reader device and the transponder may communicate with the reader using the UFH band. In particular in various embodiments the reader can be a type of RFID reader device that is typically installed at an electronic toll gate. However as will be described in more detail below in embodiments where the transponder is integrated embedded or otherwise included in a license plate the reader may preferably be placed in the road underneath passing vehicles as opposed to in an overhead gantry.

In various embodiments the device communicates with the transponder in order to manage a toll account and to recharge the toll account instantaneously and on the spot. As shown in an application is installed on the device . In various embodiments interactions between the transponder and the device may trigger or activate the application . For example in one embodiment touching or tapping the transponder and the device together may launch the application on the device . Alternately in some embodiments the application may launch when the device is brought within close proximity of the transponder . In various embodiments interactions between the transponder and the device may further allow the device to scan read or otherwise retrieve information stored on the transponder . For example in one embodiment by touching tapping or otherwise positioning the transponder and the device together the device may be able to read the information that is stored on the transponder . In various embodiments the device may determine to launch the application automatically based on at least some of the information read from the transponder . In some embodiments instead of gaining access to all of the information stored on the transponder at once interaction between the device and the transponder may initiate an authentication process. In some embodiments before the device is able to access for example prepaid toll account information a user may be required to provide the proper credentials e.g. biometrics username password .

In various embodiments at least some of the information stored on the transponder may identify link or otherwise provide access to a corresponding prepaid toll account. As will be described in more detail below in various embodiments the application is able to use at least some of the information read from the transponder to obtain information associated with the toll account including for example but not limited to an account status and account balance. As shown in the application may communicate with an ETC server over a network . In various embodiments the network may comprise one or more of a wired network a wireless network a local area network a wide area network the Internet or any other appropriate network. In some embodiments the application may use web or application services provided by the ETC server in order to obtain prepaid toll account information e.g. account status account balance . Thus in some embodiments by activating the application through interactions between the transponder and the device e.g. touch tap a user can gain immediate access to current prepaid toll account information e.g. status balance .

In various embodiments the application may additionally provide a user interface for recharging a toll account. For instance in some embodiments the application may provide one or more graphic user interface GUI components e.g. text areas or fields radio buttons checkboxes drop down menu allowing a user to select or enter one or more inputs including for example but not limited to a recharge amount a payment method e.g. a credit card selection and security or authentication credentials for the virtual wallet. In various embodiments the application may be integrated with a virtual wallet e.g. Google Wallet on the device . As will be described in more detail below in various embodiments the application may interact with the virtual wallet e.g. Google Wallet to replenish the user s prepaid toll account.

As shown in in various embodiments in addition to the ETC server the application may also communicate with both an electronic wallet E Wallet server and a payment processor server over the network . In some embodiments the application may request payment information e.g. a credit card number from the E Wallet server so that the application may then request payment processor server to submit an appropriate recharge amount to the ETC server replenishing the user s prepaid toll account. Advantageously in various embodiments a prepaid toll account may be managed and replenished instantaneously and on the spot. For instance in various embodiments a user is no longer required to seek out a POS station but can instead recharge his or her prepaid toll account while on the road and from inside the vehicle.

In various embodiments the transponder may also communicate with the reader . In various embodiments the reader comprises a UHF RFID reader that is capable of reading information stored on the transponder using the UHF 865 928 MHz band. As shown in in various embodiments the reader may be an RFID reader installed at a toll gate. Furthermore as shows the reader may communicate with the ETC server over the network . In some embodiments information that the reader reads from the transponder may be transmitted to the ETC server via the network . As will be described in more detail below in various embodiments information stored on the transponder can link correspond or otherwise provide access to other information such as information that is stored elsewhere and remotely on a network server. For example in various embodiments the ETC server may use the information read from the transponder to identify a vehicle and to apply a toll charge to an account associated with the vehicle.

At at least some of the information stored on a dual frequency transponder is accessed. For example as described with respect to an NFC enabled device such as the device e.g. Android smartphone is able to read the information stored on the transponder . In some embodiments at last some of the information read from the transponder may trigger the launch of the application on the device . In addition a UHF RFID toll reader such as the reader may also be able to read some or all of the information stored on the transponder .

At account information is accessed based on the information stored on the dual frequency transponder. In various embodiments at least some of the information stored on the transponder may link correspond or otherwise provide access to account information. In various embodiments the information stored on the transponder may link correspond or otherwise provide access to account information that is stored at a remote server e.g. the ETC server . In some embodiments the information stored at the remote server includes prepaid toll account information including for example but not limited to account status and account balance.

At at least one action is performed with respect to the account. For example in some embodiments the action may include for example but not limited to communicating the account information stored at the remote server e.g. account status account balance to a user of the device via the application . As another example a type of action that can be performed with respect to the account the user of the device may also use the application to recharge the toll account. As will be described in more detail below the user of the device may replenish the toll account through a virtual wallet that may be integrated with the application . Finally in some embodiments a UHF RFID toll reader may also able to read the information stored on the transponder . In various embodiments the UHF RFID toll reader can be configured to provide some or all of this information to an ETC system e.g. the ETC server . In various embodiments based on information scanned from the dual frequency transponder by the UHF RFID toll reader the ETC system may be able to determine the account from which to deduct a toll charge.

As described earlier with respect to various embodiments of the systems and methods described herein simplify and abbreviate the process to recharge a toll account. For instance in various embodiments the recharging process may be initiated by simply bringing an NFC enabled device e.g. the device within the range of a dual frequency transponder e.g. the transponder . In response in various embodiments the NFC enabled device e.g. the device may launch an application e.g. the application that is integrated with a virtual wallet e.g. Google Wallet . Otherwise stated in various embodiments scanning a dual frequency toll transponder with an NFC enabled device may trigger an application that is configured to interact directly with a virtual wallet on the NFC enabled device. In various embodiments the application provides a user interface for a user to select or enter various inputs e.g. amount credit card credentials to recharge a toll account. At the same time in various embodiments functions and features of the virtual wallet may be integrated into the application using one or more appropriate Application Programming Interfaces APIs . For example to enable the integration of Google Wallet within the application the Android Software Development Kit SDK offers the following three basic APIs Google Wallet online commerce API Google Wallet for digital goods API and Google Checkout API.

In some embodiments the application may offer users the option to recharge their prepaid toll account using Google Wallet . Advantageously in some embodiments using a virtual wallet such as Google Wallet further expedites the recharging process since users are able to avoid manually inputting payment information e.g. credit card number billing address etc. . For example in some embodiments after a user Bob indicates that he would like to recharge his prepaid toll account by adding 10 to the account he can then select or click on a Buy with Google button to complete or finalize the recharging transaction almost instantaneously. In some embodiments selecting to pay with a virtual wallet such as by clicking on the Buy with Google button may trigger the process .

At masked wallet information is requested. In various embodiments the application sends to the Google Wallet backend server a masked wallet request JWT. In various embodiments masked wallet information comprises a Java object containing a masked or partially hidden version of Bob s credit card number. In some embodiments masked wallet information can further include Bob s shipping address. At a masked wallet object is received. In various embodiments in response to the request from the application the Google Wallet backend server returns to the application a masked wallet response JWT. In various embodiments the application can display an order review page or screen to Bob based on the masked wallet information. At a full wallet is requested. In various embodiments after receiving the masked wallet object at the application will then need full wallet information to complete Bob s order. As such in some embodiments the application then sends to the Google Wallet backend server a full wallet request JWT. At full wallet information is received. In various embodiments the Google Wallet backend server responds to the request by providing a full wallet response JWT to the application. In various embodiments the full wallet information includes details of a single use virtual credit card for the transaction. At the single use virtual credit card is transmitted. In various embodiments the application passes the single use virtual credit card provided by Google Wallet in the full wallet to a merchant server e.g. the payment processor server described with respect to . At transaction status is received. In various embodiments the merchant server processes the payment and notifies the application of the status of the transaction e.g. success or failure . Finally at a status notification object is transmitted. In various embodiments based on the status notification from the merchant server e.g. success or failure the application then creates and sends a transaction status JWT to the Google Wallet backend server. In addition in various embodiments the application displays a confirmation screen informing Bob that 10 has been added to his prepaid toll account.

PCT Application No. PCT EP2012 001765 entitled Method and Apparatus for Providing and Managing Information Linked to RFID Data Storage Media in a Network filed Apr. 25 2012 which is incorporated herein by reference describes the management of data that is linked to or otherwise associated with a RFID storage medium. The various embodiments of the methods and systems described herein are directed toward using a dual frequency transponder to manage and replenish a toll account. In the various embodiments described herein the dual frequency transponder can communicate with both a NFC enabled device and a UHF RFID reader. In various embodiments data stored on the dual frequency transponder links corresponds or otherwise provide access to a toll account. Thus in various embodiments both NFC enabled devices e.g. Android smartphones and UHF RFID readers e.g. common types of toll readers are able to read or scan information that is stored on the dual frequency transponder and then perform a number of essential functions based on this information.

According to various embodiments an account may be managed and recharged instantly and on the spot. In various embodiments bringing an NFC enabled device e.g. the device within the range of a dual frequency transponder e.g. the transponder automatically triggers the launch of an application e.g. the application on the NFC enabled device e.g. the device . In various embodiments the application can provide current prepaid toll account information e.g. account status account balance . Furthermore in various embodiments the application may be integrated with a virtual wallet e.g. Google Wallet thereby enabling a user to recharge the toll account instantly and on the spot. In the example described with respect to Bob uses his Android smartphone to scan a dual frequency transponder and is subsequently able to add 10 to his prepaid toll account.

In various embodiments the information stored in the dual frequency transponder links corresponds or otherwise provides access to an account. In various embodiments an NFC enabled device reads data that is stored on an RFID data storage medium e.g. a dual frequency transponder and then uses this data to access additional data that is stored at a remote server. For example in various embodiments reading or scanning the information stored in the dual frequency transponder enables the application to access a designated memory area at a remote server e.g. the ETC server . In some embodiments the application is then able to retrieve for example prepaid toll account information from the remote server e.g. the ETC server . Additionally in various embodiments the application is also able to update toll account information stored at the remote server including for example but not limited to by submitting a recharge payment that alters the status or the balance of the toll account.

As shown in in various embodiments the RFID storage medium may include an RFID data record and an additional memory .

In some embodiments the user may be authenticated e.g. biometrics username password before the RFID storage medium releases its data to the NFC RFID reader . In various embodiments the application may use the data released from the RFID data record to generate access rights for additional data stored in data memory area of a remote server . In some embodiments in order to generate access rights to the additional data the user may be required to provide one or more forms of security or authentication credentials e.g. biometrics username password . In one exemplary embodiment the remote server may be a server associated with an ETC system e.g. the ETC server and the additional data may include account information e.g. account status account balance with respect to a toll account associated with the user . In various embodiments the application requests for the additional data from the remote server by sending for example access rights to the remote server over a network . In various embodiments in response to the request from the application the remote server may transmit the additional data to the device via the network . In various embodiments the application can then provide with or without further processing or analysis the additional data to the user .

In various embodiments the transponder may be a multi frequency or frequency independent transponder. In various embodiments the transponder is a dual frequency transponder that operates over both the HF e.g. 13.56 MHz and UHF e.g. 865 928 MHz band. Advantageously in various embodiments the transponder is capable of communicating with both an NFC enabled device and a UHF RFID reader. For instance in some embodiments when an NFC enabled device such as an Android smartphone is brought within the range of the transponder the NFC enabled device can respond by automatically launching an application e.g. the application described with respect to or the application described with respect to that enables a quick and on the spot recharge of a toll account. In addition in some embodiments a UHF RFID reader installed at a toll gate can use information scanned from the transponder to determine the correct prepaid toll account from which to deduct a toll charge.

In various embodiments the transponder may include a base layer and at least one radio frequency device disposed upon the base layer. In various embodiments the radio frequency device comprises at least one chip and at least one antenna that are in electrically coupled with the chip. In some embodiments the transponder can include a frequency independent chip. In those embodiments the transponder can include a single manufactured silicon chip that is configured through proper connections and match to an appropriate antenna to operate using any of the relevant frequencies e.g. 13.56 MHz and 915 MHz assigned to the transponder . Alternately in some embodiments the transponder may include a multi frequency e.g. dual frequency chip. In those embodiments the transponder may include a chip that is designed and characterized to operate with a specific antenna at several e.g. two different frequencies.

As shown in in some embodiments the transponder may include an analog control unit which is a dual interface with a combination of two frequencies. For example in some embodiment the analog control unit may include an HF e.g. 13.56 MHz system and a UHF e.g. 915 MHz system both described in more detail below. In various embodiments the UHF system may operate over the 915 MHz band and is used for communicating with UHF RFID readers including but not limited to conventional UHF RFID toll readers. In some embodiment the UHF system may include a first antenna which can be a dipole antenna.

Meanwhile in various embodiments the HF system may operate over the 13.56 MHz band and is used for communicating with NFC enabled devices such as Android smartphones. In some embodiments the HF system may include second antenna which can be a coil antenna constructed from a helix of insulated wire.

In various embodiments the transponder can further include a digital control unit and a memory . In various embodiments the analog control unit comprises a continuous time system. That is in various embodiments the analog control unit comprises a system that is continuous in both time and magnitude. Furthermore in various embodiments the analog control unit may be configured to input and output analog signals. A signal is considered analog if it is defined for every point in time i.e. continuous time and is able to take any real magnitude value within its range.

In contrast in various embodiments the digital control unit comprises a discrete time and quantized system. In various embodiments the digital control unit may accept digital input signals and produce digital output signals. A digital signal is only defined for particular points in time i.e. discrete time and can only take on certain quantized values e.g. Os and is in a binary system . In some embodiments the analog control unit the digital control unit and the memory may all be components on a single integrated RFID circuit chip.

Many ETC systems have UHF RFID readers installed at toll gates. For instance readers in the E ZPass system broadcast a 915 MHz signal while E ZPass transponders are configured to listen for and respond to the 915 MHz signal. In some cases particularly where a transponder is configured to operate passively the transponder can respond to the 915 MHz signal broadcast by a reader with a backscatter signal to the reader that conveys the data stored in the transponder. In various embodiments data transmitted to the UHF RFID reader includes data e.g. a unique radio signature that links corresponds or otherwise provides access to the toll account associated with each passing vehicle. As such in various embodiments this data enables the ETC system to identify or determine the toll account to which to apply the toll charge.

As shown in the UHF system may include an alternating current direct current AC DC converter a power supply control unit an instruction sequencer and a memory . In various embodiments the AC DC converter may receive and convert an alternating current signal to a direct current signal. Meanwhile in various embodiments the power supply control unit is configured to regulate voltage and current to protect the UHF system fluctuations in power e.g. power surge . In various embodiments the instruction sequencer may queue instructions that are directed to the memory . In various embodiments the memory may comprise an Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory EEPROM storing data such as instructions from the instruction sequencer .

The Android Beam feature allows data to be transferred one NFC enabled device to another NFC enabled device via NFC. For example in some embodiments Android Beam allows data to be transferred from the dual frequency transponder to an Android smartphone via NFC. In various embodiments data from the dual frequency transponder triggers the launch of an appropriate application on the Android smartphone to handle the data. In various embodiments of the systems and methods described herein when a NFC enabled device e.g. Android smartphone reads data from a dual frequency transponder with an integrated HF component e.g. the HF system an application to recharge a toll account launches automatically. For example in some embodiments data read from the dual frequency transponder links corresponds or otherwise provide access to a toll account. In one common scenario the toll account has a deficient balance and needs to be recharged before a corresponding vehicle can pass through an ETC toll gate. In various embodiments the application through integration with a virtual wallet e.g. Google Wallet enables the toll account to be recharged instantly and on the spot.

As shown in the HF system includes a modulator an AC DC converter a codifier a decoder a power supply control unit an instruction sequencer a security administrator a cryptographic block and a memory .

In various embodiments the instruction sequencer is configured to queue instructions destined for the memory . In various embodiments the security administrator is configured to validate the cryptographic keys sent to the cryptographic block . In various embodiments one or both of the cryptographic block and the memory may be configured store the security keys that for example have been validated by the security administrator and that can be used to control e.g. grant deny access to the dual frequency transponder s e.g. the transponder memory or certain content therein. Finally in various embodiments the power supply control unit is configured to regulate voltage and current in order to protect the HF system from power fluctuations e.g. power surges .

The various embodiments of the systems and methods described herein are directed toward the use of a dual frequency transponder e.g. the transponder described with respect to the RFID storage medium described with respect to and the transponder described with respect to to manage and recharge an account. In particular in various embodiments the dual frequency transponder provides information that enables the application of both toll charges and reloads payments to the appropriate prepaid toll account. As the dual frequency transponder may be configured to interact both with UHF RFID toll readers and with NFC enabled devices the dual frequency transponder should preferably be set in a location that is convenient and accessible for scanning by both the UHF RFID toll readers and the NFC enabled devices. Thus according to one exemplary embodiment it may be desirable to attach the dual frequency transponder to a vehicle associated with a toll account. As such in some embodiments the dual frequency transponder can be a sticker e.g. a self adhesive decal that can be placed on an automobile window windshield or license plate a clamshell card or an encapsulated device e.g. in the housing of a rear view mirror headlights or taillights the vehicle s front or rear bumpers or in any non conductive component of the vehicle .

In some embodiments the dual frequency transponder can also be embedded in the vehicle s license plate. However vehicle license plates are most commonly made from metal e.g. aluminum . Direct and uninsulated contact between a transponder single or multi frequency and a metal license plate e.g. applying the transponder directly onto the metal license plate can short or severely detune the transponder s antenna s e.g. the first antenna and the second antenna described with respect to rendering the transponder virtually unreadable. Thus in the exemplary embodiments described in more detail below a transponder is embedded in a metal license plate in ways that neither compromise the performance of the transponder s antenna s nor add undesirable bulk to the license plate s usual dimensions. In the various exemplary embodiments described in more detail below a RFID enabled license plate is configured to resonate at multiple frequencies e.g. HF and UHF bands . In some embodiments a resonator for the transponder is formed from the license plate itself if the license plate is metal. In other embodiments whether the plate is metal or non metal the resonator may be formed from a metalized layer e.g. retro reflective material holographic foil or any other appropriate metallic substrate covering the license plate.

Furthermore as shown in an RFID Strap can be positioned across the second slot as illustrated. In some embodiments the RFID strap includes an RFID chip as well as one or more contacts that are connected to or capacitively coupled with the plate . In various embodiments the RFID strap can include the RFID strap and a slot antenna formed from the plate . In various embodiments the respective and relative dimensions spacing and location of the first Slot and the second slot are configured such that the slot antenna formed from the plate the first slot and the second slot will resonate at multiple desired frequencies. In various embodiments the slot antenna configured according to is able to resonate at both a HF e.g. 13.56 MHz and a UHF e.g. 915 MHz band. As described in more detail below in other embodiments instead of multiple slots e.g. the first slot and the second slot in the plate configured to resonate at several different frequencies an RFID enabled license plate can also include a single slot configured to resonate at a single frequency.

In some embodiments a RFID enabled license plate can include a transponder that will not function absent a valid and properly positioned vehicle registration sticker. For example in some embodiments the transponder can be intentionally tuned to a lower frequency e.g. less than 915 MHz and therefore cannot be properly read by a UHF RFID reader. Meanwhile in some embodiments applying a valid vehicle registration sticker in the correct position on the RFID enabled license plate tunes the transponder to the correct and operational frequency e.g. 915 MHz so that the transponder can be read by a UHF RFID reader. In various embodiments the vehicle registration sticker is fabricated from or otherwise includes one or more metallic or other conductive materials.

Although shows that the vehicle registration sticker is placed directly over the RFID module in embodiments where the vehicle registration sticker is composed of or otherwise includes conductive material the RFID module may not be directly underneath the vehicle registration sticker .

Typically in the United States motorists are required to renew their vehicle registration on an annual basis. For example California license plates have a month and a year sticker. A properly registered vehicle in California will have been issued a sticker that shows the current year. Although the registration status of a vehicle can be verified visually in many instances it would be preferable to verify vehicle registration status through electronic and automated means. Thus in various embodiments a vehicle registration sticker that is used in conjunction with a RFID enabled license plate can further include or be constructed out of a material that gradually degrades as the vehicle s registration approaches expiration. In this manner an up to date vehicle registration sticker is able to tune a RFID transponder in the RFID enabled license plate to the proper frequency while an expired vehicle registration sticker cannot. Consequently a vehicle cannot successfully pass through a checkpoint unless the vehicle is also properly registered and is displaying a current vehicle registration sticker.

Vehicle registration stickers are very often made out of a metallic material e.g. retro reflective foil . Therefore in some embodiments the vehicle registration sticker can be made out of a retro reflective material that degrades over time. In another embodiment the loop on the back of the vehicle registration sticker can be made out of a material that degrades over time. Finally in some embodiments the adhesive used to bond the vehicle registration sticker to a RFID enabled license plate can degrade over time.

In various embodiments where a RFID enabled license plate e.g. the RFID enabled license plates and comprises a dual frequency transponder e.g. the transponder the RFID storage medium and the transponder the RFID enabled license plate may be able to communicate with a NFC enabled device and with a UHF RFID reader device. In particular in various embodiments the RFID enabled license plate is designed to be read as a vehicle passes through a toll gate. In various embodiments where the dual frequency transponder is embedded integrated or otherwise included in the vehicle s license plate it would be preferable to install or place the toll readers in the road rather than in overhead gantries as in conventional ETC systems.
