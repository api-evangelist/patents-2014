title: System and method for call placement using a television set-top box
abstract: A call-placement service is provided for a cable television set top box (STB). The STB is interconnected to a television display and via a cable link to a server at a cable television provider head end. The STB includes an onboard application that presents a menu to the subscriber allowing access to a list of telephone numbers and downloadable content providers. The head end includes a service application that selects an appropriate telephone provider and transmits the telephone numbers to the provider. The telephone provider connects to the subscriber and detects whether the subscriber can receive an SMS message. If so, the provider connects to the target and detects whether the target can accept the call or send an SMS message. If so, the telephone system connects the call between the subscriber and the target of passes an SMS message to the user's that may contain a link for content download.

No. 11 968 283 Filed Jan. 2 2008 which claims the benefit of the U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60 883 201 filed Jan. 3 2007 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CALL PLACEMENT USING A TELEVISION SET TOP BOX the entire disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.

This invention relates to communications systems and more particularly communications systems that employ two way digital television hardware.

Cable television service has become a dominant vehicle for the delivery of electronic entertainment content throughout the United States and in many parts of the world. Modern cable systems which were originally designed to deliver analog RF television signals now largely deliver encoded digital data at very high speeds over a conventional low loss coaxial cable or a combination of fiber optic and coaxial cables with appropriate interfaces therebetween. These signals are employed in two way communication between a cable subscriber and the operator also known as the cable head end. One common form of two way communication is the cable modem generally termed DOCSIS in which signals are encoded into a network protocol such as TCP IP and transmitted between a network equipped computer and a server system at the head end that connects to a larger network such as the well known Internet via various gateway switches and routers. Other techniques for two way communication involving the receipt by a subscriber of digital television content and a return path for data from the subscriber also exist including DAVIC Satellite dial back IPTV among others.

Another increasingly common application involving both one way from head end to subscriber and two way communication is the delivery of so called digital cable service. In a digital cable implementation the subscriber receives broadcast television signals in digital form via TCP IP or another communication protocol. The digital signal is typically received at the subscriber s location by a digital set top box. The set top box is in essence a small computer that converts received digital signals into NTSC or another format signal capable of being displayed on a conventional television. Most set top boxes in fact provide a variety of output connectors that deliver the video signal to a television or display monitor in a variety of formats including S video composite and component. Such boxes also deliver audio based upon a number of outputs. This delivered audio can be encoded for delivery to a tuner capable of providing multi channel playback e.g. surround sound .

Since a set top box is a networked computing device it affords the subscriber many options not available in conventional analog cable arrangements. Taking advantage of the availability of two way digital communication over the line the set to box can act as a portal through which the subscriber can interact with the head end server and remote network beyond. In a basic application the subscriber can direct requests to the server so as to deliver for example on demand entertainment content that is accessed from the server s associated storage system or a remote storage system and streamed to the subscriber over the cable. This content can be viewed in real time or stored for buffering and or later replay in a storage medium flash memory disk etc associated with the set top box.

Of course virtually all set top boxes accommodate a remote control that transmits IR and or RF signals to the box to operate its various functions. Typically set top box functions are displayed via menu screens that often emulate the look and feel of a personal computer s graphical user interface GUI display. The remote allows the user to scroll through menu items and highlight the item of interest. Remotes often include a conventional cursor that can be moved about the screen via a four way toggle to more closely match the point and click experience of a personal computer.

Many set top boxes and cable providers now provide functioning web browsers that are accessed by the appropriate remote control buttons and or menu screens that are displayed on the television. These browsers support certain interactive functions allow entered subscriber requests to be delivered from the server s storage or from the Internet.

Give the interactive nature of currently available set top boxes or other internal and external devices with set top box two way functionality and two way digital cable or other two way digital television service it is desirable to afford the subscriber the widest range of available interactive services particularly where these services can be accommodated by existing hardware. The provision of additional services offers the service provider an opportunity to deliver a more competitive product and possibly obtain income from the provision of a new feature. The user is provided with a further convenience that improves their viewing experience and well being.

It is also recognized that television showcases new and existing goods and services and often invites the viewer to contact the advertiser to purchase these goods and services. A system and method that makes that process easier and more reliable is highly desirable.

Furthermore the use of mobile or cellular telephones is now extremely common and most available telephones support Short Message Service SMS or text messaging applications and include small graphical user interface GUI display screens for creating and reading such messages as well as other activities such as picture video viewing games and the like . An SMS message or simply SMS is convenient was to communicate without need of a voice exchange. Moreover SMS messages can include embedded hyperlinks also simply termed link s that are transmitted back to a service provider and allow responses from an Internet based content provider via the cellular network. These responses can include downloads to the cellular telephone of requested content from the provider. A technique that further facilitates downloads of such content is also desirable.

This invention overcomes the disadvantages of the prior art by providing a call placement service that is provided in connection with a cable television set top box STB or any device with STB two way receipt and transmit functions. The STB is interconnected to a television display and via a cable link typically RF coaxial to a server at a cable television provider head end. The STB includes an onboard application that presents a menu to the subscriber allowing access to a list of telephone numbers or descriptors linked to telephone numbers such as a restaurant name . These numbers can be provided via a database search using a search engine that communicates with a user interface UI of the STB. The database can be a general Internet database or can be a specific database of targets for example a list of vendors of goods and services in the subscriber s local area. When the subscriber selects a target to call his or her telephone number is provided along with the selected target s telephone number and these are delivered to the head end and an instruction on whether to connect the numbers via telephone or send an SMS message to the to the STB subscriber s target phone. This SMS message can include a link that enables the subscriber to download content listed on a selected menu of goods services and or content downloads related to the target. The head end includes a service application with a main process that selects an appropriate telephone provider to complete the call and transmits the telephone numbers to the provider in a predetermined format. The information is received by the telephone provider which connects to the subscriber and detects whether the subscriber is able and willing to accept the call or SMS message. If so and SMS is not used the provider connects to the target and detects whether the target is able and willing to accept the call. If so the telephone system connects the call between the subscriber and the subscriber and the target.

The telephone provider and or the cable provider can capture the telephone number information and other information related to the subscriber and the target to generate billing event. Billing can be based on any or all of the following subscription fees from subscribers and or selected vendors the provision of advertising messages paid for by vendors or others that are played or text messaged to telephone users before the call is completed and pay per call charges that are borne by subscribers and or selected vendors or simply delivered for free as a value added service.

In illustrative embodiments the subscriber enters his or her telephone number into the UI of the STB and this number is stored for future call placement events. The subscriber may also enter his or her location data and the search for vendors and other targets including but not limited to specific merchandise items services and or software application downloads that may or may not be limited to those in locations near the subscriber. This geographical limitation is particularly useful when contacting locally based vendors such as restaurants and home delivery based businesses. Lists of vendors and other targets can also be organized in a menu based on categories from which the subscriber can select a particular target.

As depicted the television is currently displaying an advertisement for a product or service pizza in this example that the subscriber has an interest in. Alternatively as will be described below the interest may be in a product service or telephone user that is unrelated to the presently broadcast content but that has a known telephone number or is accessible by search using Internet network searching facilities available via the STB s native browser. These interest facilities are typically delivered via the cable link from the head end using a connection to the Internet or another information network for example a local database or proxy cache server . In either case the subscriber accesses displays and manipulates a window on the television screen . In this example a remote control that transmits IR or RF signals to the STB is employed to display and manipulate the window . This window can contain a variety of data provided in a variety of graphical and organizational formats. In general the window allows the name and or telephone number of a desired vendor Internet content provider or other telephone user such as a friend relative or acquaintance or as described below a target item for SMS delivery to be displayed within the window or elsewhere on the screen . The window also contains a prompt and or button which the user can highlight and activate with his or her remote control . The user s clicking upon the screen window button allows the user to place a telephone call to the named telephone user.

The request is passed to the head end using a number of alternative methodologies and protocols described further below. At the head end a call manager provides calling instructions via a link to an off site or internal telephone service provider . The calling instructions direct the completion of a call between the telephone of a target user vendor service individual and the requesting subscriber s telephone . The process for placement and connection of the call over the network is highly variable and described further below. In general the two parties are connected in response to the user s request to place a call that is routed through the STB to the head end and hence to the telephone system .

Alternatively the request by the user via the STB can be for a predetermined content available for download to for example a cellular telephone of the user which s equipped with a display that is capable of receiving an SMS message. As shown this SMS message contains a link LINK embedded in other text that may also include promotional or advertising content by which downloadable content can be accessed and vended to the telephone . The SMS request is routed through the STB to the head end and hence to the telephone system which may define multiple providers as part of the broader land and wireless public telephone network that eventually links to the nearest cell site in the user s cellular network. Any downloadable content derived from clicking the SMS delivered link is vended from an Internet based or other source via the cell site Appropriate procedures for deriving revenue as a result of the service are also described below.

Having described a general overview of the basic system components and the generalized procedure those components will now be described in further detail. shows a generalized cable television system into which the present invention may be incorporated. In general the system transmits signals comprising video and audio information from a cable head end onto a coaxial cable transmission medium that defines the link with cable subscribers . Signal boosters not shown may be provided for amplifying and distributing the signals to the plurality of locations. At least one of the subscriber locations such as the location includes the above described call placement enabled digital STB . It should be noted that while a wired cable television system is employed in the illustrative embodiment the present invention does not require coaxial cable as the physical transmission medium as signals can alternatively be transmitted over any transmission medium including wireless means such as so called wireless cable broadcasts two way digital satellite communication duplex type communication devices e.g. satellite cable down and telephone up ipTV devices and so on so long as an adequate return path is provided for transmitting data from the subscriber back to the head end or a similar base location. To this end the term STB as used herein can be applied broadly to include any circuitry either separate from or integral with a display device e.g. built into a television or monitor that provides set top box STB functions. Such functions comprise the ability to receive and decode digital television content for display and a mechanism that allows the viewing subscriber to transmit information back to the provider of the digital television content or an entity related to the provider.

The head end includes a head end local area network LAN interconnected to a server system . In fact a number of discrete networked servers or clusters of servers can be included in this system including a download server a content server a billing server an access control server and other information servers all residing on the LAN for controlling the overall operation of the head end via an Ethernet connection to the various components therein. The head end content is sourced in a variety of ways. Digital and analog content can be received in real time via a data link that can include a satellite receiver fiber optic communication link or coaxial transmission line. Content received via RF transmission is demodulated and the demodulated digital signals are depacketized using an RF demodulator depacketizer and delivered onto the LAN or another communication channel via an appropriate interface not shown . Signals received in other forms e.g. fiber optic digital transmission are likewise depacketized . The appropriate server function directs these signals to a storage device on the LAN that stores the content for subsequent playback. Content can also be streamed by the server in real time to the subscribers without storage where appropriate. In this example the head end broadcasts digital Content to subscribers using a packetizer RF modulator which modulates the streams onto analog channels and injects the signals onto the cable transmission medium . An appropriate interface not shown connects the server system LAN with the packetizer RF modulator . Note for simplicity a single LAN is shown. With multiplexing of multiple packetized digital signals hundreds of digital channels may be injected onto a single coaxial medium although at present a mixture of analog and digital channels will likely be transmitted.

While a single universal LAN is shown connecting all parts of the system in practice a number of separate communication links can be employed each serving a particular aspect of the overall system. For example a dedicated fiber optic link can be provided between an electro optical or digital magnetic tape reader not shown that serves broadcast content and the broadcast transmission components. For simplicity such components are exemplified by the depicted universal storage system and universal LAN . Storage can be organized in any acceptable way including a plurality of magnetic disks arranged according to a network attached storage NAS or storage area network SAN organization. This can be combined with electro optical and or digital magnetic tape players where appropriate. In general the arrangement for a head end described herein is merely exemplary of a variety of possible arrangements of hardware software and communication resources that are known to those of ordinary skill.

With reference to the server system at least one server is responsible for providing the call placement service and possibly other functions of this invention. This server dashed box whose basic components are shown consists of a network interface for communication over the LAN a processor and an online memory . The memory includes an operating system OS that controls the handling of data and files by the processor and the passage of data to and from the LAN among other functions. The operating system can be based on any commercially available platform including but not limited to Linux Microsoft Windows NT Windows Professional and the like. This memory also contains the call placement service application according to an illustrative embodiment. As will be described the service application can consist of many components that reside on one or more servers within the head end. Likewise some functions may reside on the STB application as will be described below. For example some functions may require the tracking of call information for billing purposes and these functions may reside in part on a billing server. Some other functions may require the delivery of Internet search results and these may reside on a dedicated search server that receives Extensible Markup Language XML Hypertext Markup Language HTML or other delivery protocol etc. information via the Internet or another communications network through a gateway router which connects to the LAN .

The cable link supports bidirectional communication. Hence subscribers communicate via the STB using a return path that sends cable RF signals into an RF Demodulator and depacketizer . The resultant digital information is provided to the LAN using an appropriate network interface not shown and delivered to the proper application s in the server system . In the example of call placement the request to place a call is delivered to the call service and then appropriate commands are passed to the functions across the individual servers to carry out the request. The request will eventually require information to be sent over the Internet external network to selected telephone service providers in a predetermined format. This is described in detail below.

Referring now to the internal organization of a typical subscriber STB . For the purposes of this implementation the STB need not be modified or enhanced. It is desirable however that the STB comprises a type or model having the capability of accepting downloaded programming or a modified programming memory such as a FLASH memory which contains the desired call placement functionality according to this invention. The software contemplated for use in the STB includes a browser user interface UI which communicates with an operating system of the STB by placing calls through an application programming interface API as described in more detail below.

The exemplary STB includes an in band tuner and an out of band tuner along with appropriate demodulators and respectively. A microprocessor controls the tuning operation of the tuners and based on commands received from a subscriber via an input device such as a keypad or an infrared or RF remote control device as described below. To this end the set top box includes an infrared sensor connected to an infrared receiver which provides the command signaling information to the microprocessor . A memory system includes an appropriate operating system OS stored therein and may include a combination of volatile dynamic RAM and non volatile RAM NVRAM .

In accordance with digital broadcasts wherein digitized channels are multiplexed as data packets onto a six megahertz analog channel the set top box also includes at least three packet identification PID filters to extract the appropriate encoded data packets for a user selected digital channel. Based on the user selected display audio and other requirements the microprocessor writes an identification value to each of the set of PID filters and whereby the filters pass only those packets corresponding to that value. As shown one of the PID filters filter provides the filtered packets to an audio decoder which decodes the digital audio data encoded according to the AC3 format in this example while another PID filter provides filtered packets MPEG2 encoded to the video decoder . The audio and video signal can be output in a variety of other formats that are supported by appropriate circuitry connectors and decoders.

A third PID filter is provided to extract in band and out of band data directed to the operation of the set top box . A packet processor handles those packets. The set top box is also equipped with an on screen display frame buffer OSD capable of superimposing alphanumeric characters other symbols and bitmap graphics over a displayed image. To accomplish this superimposition an overlay is provided to appropriately combine the video outputs of the video decoder and the OSD .

The STB functions when the user provides an appropriate and valid command to it. For example in response to a digital channel selection command the microprocessor tunes the in band tuner to an appropriate analog channel based on the digital channel selected by the subscriber. If a digital channel was selected a table or the like stored in the memory determines the analog channel that carries the digital channel s packets along with the packet identification numbers corresponding to that channel for writing into the PID filters and . Once the PLDs have been written the audio and video decoders and will receive the appropriate packets and decode and output appropriate signals. As described below with reference to the present invention some of the packets will include images and alphanumeric data associated with the call placement service of this invention.

Manipulation of the STB is provided by the above described hand held remote control with an exemplary keypad shown in . The exemplary keypad includes four directional up down left and right cursor buttons . and respectively and a SELECT button . These buttons will generally allow the subscriber to navigate scroll through various menus and options presented including the call placement service of this invention. The typical remote control input device will also provide the normal complement of TV related buttons including the depicted volume adjustment channel adjustment mute etc. Other buttons such as those for control of a videocassette recorder also may be provided. The remote control is preferably wireless e.g. an infrared or RF based remote control but of course alternatively may be wired. The remote also includes an alphanumeric keypad that may be useful in entering requested phone number and text data. Moreover alternate input devices need not be remote but may for example be provided as a keypad not shown on the STB .

To implement the call placement service of this invention a browser application has been downloaded into the memory of the STB along with application program interfaces APIs for interfacing the browser to the operating system . The browser enables the user to interact with data servers at the head end and otherwise request data and retrieve it for display using XML HTML or other accepted protocols. For example the memory may include an implementation of a Java virtual machine running Java programming language scripts. A packetizer or other data handling mechanism is interconnected with the memory and processor via an appropriate interface bus not shown . This packetizer converts data to be sent on the return path to the head end into formatted data packets. These packets are converted by the RF modulator into an appropriate cable compatible RF signal and transmitted over the cable link to the head end for receipt by the servers.

Also placed in memory in association with the browser is the STB installed call placement service application . The application may include a provider specific API that contains majority of the instructions and data required to carry out a call placement in the manner of an internet telephony service that resides on a personal computer such as the commercially available Skype system . However more choice of providers is available to the user and cable provider where the STB application is simply an agent that carries the input data on call placement to the head end server system which then acts upon it choosing the appropriate call provider and instructing the provider to place the call. The basic information provided by the agent will be the user s telephone number which is entered upon placing the call using the screen or has been previously stored and the target phone number or some identifying information about the target that allows the head end to look up the target s telephone phone number and the type of call to be placed back to the requestor subscriber be it a voice call or an SMS message. This approach will be described in further detail below. However the basic principles are also applicable to a provider specific application loaded onto the STB memory . In an embodiment the agent can enable transmission of the information back to the head end on a reserved channel so that this information automatically becomes associated by the server system with a call placement request.

Referring now to the procedure for call placement choice of telephone service provider and tracking of billing revenue generation is now provided in further detail. The process is illustrated in view of the functional blocks residing in each of the servers shown in . A subscriber is shown. The subscriber is viewing the television display which interacts with the STB functionality . The STB call placement user interface UI is displayed on the television in response to a Run request typically transmitted via the hand held remote. An exemplary UI display is shown in . This display consists of a main video window the size of which can vary. This window displays broadcast content that is currently running on the selected channel. The main window is overlaid with peripheral panes each having particular information. The size shape placement and content of each pane are highly variable in alternate embodiments. In this example an optional bottom pane showing the name of the service provider and its company logo is displayed. The upper pane provides a plurality of user selectable icons and which allow the user to select predetermined services and content that appear for example in the left hand interactive pane . In this example the pane has been instructed to perform a call placement procedure. The underlying function that triggers the call placement is not shown but can be any acceptable button or icon. In this example the STB application is configured to store the user s phone number. In some cases such as a first time use of the service or a new STB installation the user s phone number is not stored. In such cases the application requests entry in the dialog box . The user then begins searching for a desired target phone number. in .

The UI service application provides the search pane to the UI as shown in . It includes a keyword search window into which the user can enter via the remote s alphanumeric keypad or via a data entry screen . The data entry screen buttons are navigated by arrows on the remote and clicked by the select button in a well known manner. Alternatively a keyboard style remote can be employed to enter data. Once an appropriate keyword is entered the user then clicks the search button on the search pane . This generates the resulting pane in with an information regarding the of the search target. The details of the target may be provided in the window below. Note that a number of results may be displayed in the upper window where a plurality of similar names are located. Notably the details include or can be limited to the target s phone number . This and other searched phone numbers list are provided by the UI to the user in the screen pane . The search results can be generated as a result of a conventional Internet search carried out by the Internet server at the head end or the search results can be based upon a search of internal target lists typically vendor lists that are stored within the head end s databases vendor database . Basic target lists can also be stored locally at the STB .

The service application or another function at the head end extracts step the phone number from the search results and stores it for eventual return to the head end. The capture of the phone number can be based upon its placement in a predetermined phone number field in the search results or it can be obtained by optical character recognition OCR or other available text scanning functions. At this time the user can select this target step click the calling button to place a call to this location.

Before describing the call placement process in detail further functions available to the user will now be described. Referring to the search pane a category list button is provided. By clicking the category list button the user calls up a list of predetermined categories that are displayed in the category list pane in . The categories are listed. These are either user defined categories and or defined by the cable operator as part of the vendor list. Some categories include an expansion arrow that allows a pane with multiple entries from the selected category to be displayed. The selected entry can be highlighted and the user can proceed immediately to call placement by clicking the button . Note if one or more entries do not contain phone number information then the call button may not be available in the pane requiring the user to first enter the pane of to determine whether a phone number exists or can be scanned from the search data. Where a category contains only one entry such as the exemplary pizza entry in then clicking this category places the user in the pane of which shows the details of the target and a call can be made by clicking the call button .

Searching for call targets can be narrowed based upon the user s location. The location is entered changed or checked using the select location button in for example panes and . The location pane contains fields and that allow the user to check and update his or her zip code State city and street name. This can be used by internal functions within the search engine to select only vendors within a certain range unless otherwise instructed. The use can set such limits within a preference screen not shown or the limits can be set automatically by the cable operator.

It should be clear that there are several ways for a user to locate a desired target for call placement or to place a call to a general Internet search target once located. In an exemplary embodiment search targets and their phone number information are available from a list established by the cable operator typically in cooperation with the vendors themselves. More general Internet searching to find targets may also be permitted. The extent to which a requesting subscriber is allowed to call outside an established list is often dependent upon the billing and advertisement scheme adopted by the cable operator.

In some embodiments the user may simply enter a target number a friend or relative not in a vendor list without searching or navigating categories by calling up a number entry pane as shown in . Note that the category pane may in fact include a selection for enter number. Once the user opens the pane he or she enters the desired target phone number in the box using the above described data entry techniques and requests the call by clicking the call button . Optionally the user can also access a call list via a call list button that he or she creates with names and associated phone numbers. Highlighting a name would place it in the box .

Before call placement is requested by any of the above techniques the user may optionally be presented with a confirmation pane that allows the user to confirm that he or she wishes to place a call by clicking the Yes button . By clicking No button the user cancels the call and returns to a previous pane. The pane also includes a check box that allows the user to omit the confirmation screen in the future. This pane and any further screen e.g. a Call Placed pane not shown provides visual feedback to placing a request. A further pane may be issued by the head end via the telephone service provider that confirms that the call is going through and possible displaying appropriate billing information. This part of the process will be described below in detail.

Returning again to the description of the call placement procedure once the call placement or SMS message request has been made that request is transferred from the UI through the STB service application along with the target s and requesting subscriber s phone numbers and instructions on whether to place a call or send SMS or other identifiers from which the head end can access these phone numbers . The request and phone numbers are passed by the call placement server s STB connector in the head end . In the case of an SMS request the data sent by the STB to the head end and on to the service provider s from the head end as described in further detail below contains a telephone number for the requestor subscriber cable user s mobile or cellular telephone a conventional SMS short code for the phone by which messaging can occur a content ID that indicates the requested content to be downloaded or other service and optionally an a telephone type capability code also termed an Asset ID of the SMS enabled telephone . The type capability code describes the general features available on the given mobile cellular telephone. For example if a telephone is not capable of playing games or playing back MP 3 recordings then this would be encoded in the type capability code either directly or by directing the system to a lookup table of phone types and associated capabilities and allow the system and vendors to decide whether such content types can be downloaded or even listed in the appropriate menus for the subscriber to choose from.

The STB connector selectively interfaces this subscriber with the call placement service application. The service application includes a main process that controls call placement subscriber identification transfer of billing data and other functions described herein. The main process receives the call request and applicable requesting subscriber and target phone numbers . The process resolves the phone numbers and passes them to a choice process that chooses the best provider for the particular call. Assuming multiple phone providers are available the choice process consults a provider database and derives the information necessary to make the choice. The basis of a provider choice can be based upon the provider s ability to access the target and subscriber phone numbers the rates charged for placing the call and other internal criteria such as that provider s billing relationship with the cable provider.

Once a choice of provider is made it is passed to the main process which then passes the provider choice and the requesting subscriber target phone numbers to a process that generates appropriate call instructions or SMS messaging instructions for the selected provider. The instructions may be a standardized format e.g. user telephone number SMS short code content ID optional telephone type capability code for SMS messaging or they may be formatted in a manner that is specifically adapted by the provider to handle calls placed by the call placement service. The main process may also draw appropriate information from the vendor database . The vendor phone number or other identifying information is passed to the database which returns the vendors specific data possibly including any billing parameters for that vendor alternatively these may be stored in the billing server described below . This information may be used to apply billing charges for example a pay per click type arrangement wherein a charge is applied to the vendor for each call placed and to determine whether the vendor is an accepted contact. In some cases where only accepted vendors may be contacted the main process will interrupt the call placement process and notify the requesting subscriber that the call is not permitted by issuing a message in an appropriate pane through the UI . More often the absence of a vendor in the database may result in a charge being applied to the subscriber instead of a vendor. The subscriber may be notified by an appropriate confirmation message that he or she is being charged for the call. In each case the subscriber and vendor phone numbers as well as any other needed information are passed to the billing server which contains billing information regarding subscribers and vendors. Further details relative to possible billing procedures are described below. In general the placement of a call typically creates a billing even which requires payment of a charge by the vendor the subscriber or both.

Referring again to the call instruction process when placement of the call is approved by the main process and all applicable information for billing etc. has been collected by the billing server the call placement information required by the selected provider and the requesting subscriber target phone numbers and or applicable subscriber requestor SMS data are passed to the telephone service provider s call server . This server may general purpose server or may be dedicated to the handling of calls placed by the cable company s subscribers. The server may be part of a separate telephone service provider or part of the cable company s operation. The link to the server may be a dedicated network connection or can be part of a public network such as the Internet. It is contemplated that the telephone service provider may transmit phone calls over a variety of media and may employ intermediate telephone carriers in completing the call between the subscriber and the target . Note that the internal arrangement of the telephone service provider s system is highly variable and the depicted implementation is shown only by way of example.

Upon receiving the request and the phone numbers and or SMS data the telephone service provider s server passes the information to a service application that responds to the properly issued request. The calling procedure that follows is described with reference also to the flow diagram of . The procedure begins with the service provider s service application confirming that a call can be made or an SMS received step and passing a confirmation to the Cable head end server . The main process then records the confirmation which may be used to generate billing information in the billing server . The confirmation is also passed to the STB connector confirming that the request has been successfully placed with the phone service provider step . The confirmation is then passed back to the STB to confirm that the subscriber s request has been processed successfully in the STB service application step . The UI is then instructed by a confirmation that is displayed in an appropriate pane on the television screen . This provides a visual confirmation for the user to await the call step . A confirmation is not required in some cases of this implementation. A confirmation of the SMS to be delivered can also be made where downloaded content to the subscriber s telephone is requested.

On the phone provider server side the service application issues a Start Call instruction and the phone numbers to a voice commutator process step or SMS data to mobile wireless commutator . The voice commutator process then issues a ring or the mobile commutator issues an SMS message to the telephone which can be either a conventional or cellular telephone of the requesting subscriber originator step . In the case of an SMS the mobile commutator and service application issue an appropriate link with the SMS related to the content the requester has expressed interest in. The call request and applicable information may cause the service application to generate predetermined advertisement messages which are meant to be played in conjunction with a call prompt that is provided to the requesting subscriber. This may be triggered by call information or the phone numbers SMS data . For example the advertisers may agree to pay for some or all of the call placement service in return for the inclusion of its advertisement s on the telephone. The subscriber may also enter into a plan in which he or she agrees to receive advertisements in return for no calling cost or a reduced calling cost. Likewise text messages received via SMS may include advertising or promotional content along with the requested SMS information links. When the decision to include advertising content is made decision step the service application issues an ad request step to an advertisement server which receives the request step vends the appropriate ad content to the commutator at the appropriate time or to a buffer for subsequent playback step .

The commutator then connects to the originator subscriber s telephone . The subscriber s telephone rings or a notification and text of an SMS is issued to the SMS display screen of a cellular type phone and the subscriber either picks up thereby connecting the subscriber to the telephone service step or alternatively the subscriber can click the delivered link to generate return message with the link data LINK in the form of a download request o download content associated with the link to his or her cellular mobile telephone . The download request LINK typically passes back through the requestor subscriber s cellular network via the SMS Delivery system which can be enabled employing the cell site and is returned to an appropriate Internet content provider which vends requested downloaded content via a celhilar connection the carries the downloaded content back to the subscriber requestor s cellular phone . In one embodiment as shown the clicked upon lhik data LINK is passed back up the cellular pathway via site to the provider where the mobile commutator which contains accesses the Internet address of linked providers passes it onto the Internet to be received and acted upon by the appropriate downloadable content provider . As noted above the pathways by which a call SMS request link and or download is are transmitted between the service and the subscriber. and to the target can pass through a number of different types of communication systems including a wireless system a wired switched telephone system and an IP telephony system implemented over public and private networks.

Note that vended content downloaded to the requestor s cellular phone need not be limited to software or media MP 3 music files ringtones etc. The user may also request informational items such as directions movie schedules weather reports and the like. Some of this content may be free or provided as a part of the subscriber s regular cable plan.

With reference briefly to the STB can be arranged to allow selection of SMS message based services for the user s subscriber s cellular telephone or other SMS enabled device . As part of a user setup procedure the type of telephone can be entered either the STB or head end can include a database of phone types and their available features. This can be used to derive the above described telephone capabilities type ID Asset ID which defines the telephone s available content. For example certain telephones may be equipped to play MP 3 music files while others cannot. The system can tailor the contents of the menus in the SMS service panes based upon which content and or media can be handled by the user s phone type. Any content classified as not available is either blocked from possible download or fully omitted from any menus.

In the user has selected and SMS application and navigates until he or she is presented by the STB UI with the pane . This pane contains a menu of available game types. The user can use his or her remote control to select one of the listed types of games via screen buttons . Alternatively the user can select to view all available games via the View All button . Notably the screen can contain promotions and buttons to specific games or other content being promoted as well as thumbnails naming sponsors. Each of these links can be clicked upon in one embodiment allowing content information and special promotions discounts etc to be downloaded.

In the pane has changed to indicate that the user has selected a particular game type casual as indicated in the header box . The games are sorted in a menu by an appropriate format as the user selects Alphabetical in this example by clicking menu tab . The listed games are shown as a set of buttons which the user can click to select the desired game. In this example the user has selected the first game button . The selected game is shown in the right hand box with a graphical example of the games appearance on a telephone display and a description of the game and the price of the download . It is assumed that the user has or can provide account data to complete the purchase. Of course different types of content may employ differing menu arrangements and content information. The box includes a button that allows purchase of the game. In this example there are also buttons with which the user can express an opinion as to whether he he likes or dislikes the game. This information can be used to help refine the list of future game offerings.

Pressing the Buy It button in calls up the pane in . The selected game now appears in the header box and the user is informed that he or she is about to purchase the game content along with file size price and other relevant information in the in the window . The user can confirm or reject the purchase by clicking the respective buttons or . Cancel allows the user to revert to an earlier pane.

Once the user press the Yes confirmation button in the pane the transaction has occurred and the user s account will be charged by the cable provider or another vendor who receives the data from the cable provider via a message over the Internet or by another technique . Now the user must carry out the physical process of placing the game or other purchased content into his or her telephone. To simplify the process for the user the yes button triggers transmission from the STB of the above described SMS message request with the user s cellular telephone number SMS short code requested content ID and optional telephone type capability ID. The SMS request is processed as described above and the provider transmits back the SMS message related to the vendor s content. The message contains a link to the vendor that allows the user when receiving the message on his or her telephone to easily click the link prompt the vendor to download and receive the download of the selected game or other content . In this manner the user can shop for and select games and other content from a large easy to use and graphically descriptive big screen of the television and then receive the selected game with minimum effort one click required on the actual telephone interface.

With reference again to upon answering picking up the exemplary voice call the voice commutator receives an accept signal . At this time the subscriber is provided with a special prompt step by the server . The prompt may include a message stating that a call is about to be completed to the requested target or an SMS with instructions to click to download content from a provider which the subscriber responds to by clicking. If advertisements are to be included via decision step the ad content is played or can be textually displayed at this time. The prompts issued herein may require the recipient to enter a code or press a phone key to accept the connection. This is particularly useful where a party may incur charges for the connection. The message in the prompt may include any applicable charge information. In general the acceptance may entail voice recognition to ensure that a human user has answered the call. The user may be asked to say yes or no to accept or deny the call respectively.

In the case of a voice call between subscriber requestor and target the subscriber s prompt message is complete the voice commutator then connects to the target telephone or the service provider the clicked link transmission from the subscriber s telephone step . The target s telephone rings and the target picks up thereby connecting the target to the telephone service step . Alternatively in this step the vendor receives the link information requesting a download of specific content from the subscriber s telephone. Upon answering the call the commutator receives an accept signal . At this time the subscriber is provided with a special prompt step by the server . The prompt may include a message stating that a call is about to be completed to the requesting subscriber originator. Alternatively the target vendor downloads content to the telephone of the subscriber. The target may be asked to enter a code or key. In certain instances the target may also receive an advertising message for example where both the requesting subscriber originator and the target are non business subscribers to the cable call placement service. When all messages are completed at the target side the commutator receives an accept acknowledgment . The commutator then opens communication between the parties and such communication continues until one party hangs up or optionally a time limit is reached step . Alternatively the content is received at the subscriber s telephone and the SMS transaction is complete.

It should be clear that the SMS based function of the invention is advantageous in that it allows a user to enter a transaction with a click of his or her television remote and then perform the commit to the transaction via the television SIB rather than the more cumbersome process of exchanging multiple text messages to request and download content to a telephone. That is traditional content transaction on cellular telephones employ a two stage commit process in which the user first transmits interest in a service the provider vendor then provides a first message confirming the transaction. To be certain the user must then respond to another message asking if he or she is sure of the confirmation to purchase. A second message must be transmitted back to the vendor again confirming the transaction before download begins. In the present invention the user need respond to only one text message that is initiated via the more visually rich television interface.

In an embodiment of the invention the telephone service provider may not have information on whether the subscriber telephone and or target telephone is enabled to receive calls on for example a pay per call basis. The provider may initiate a call and if the call is denied by the local telephone system servicing a party then the system may return a call access denied message to the requesting subscriber. This message may be returned by telephone or through a message passed from the phone system to the head end and back to the UI of the STB. Part of the process for determining whether a call is blocked is to use voice recognition to determine whether a human voice answers the initial call.

The procedure completes with a billing event step . In practice the act of creating a billing entry may occur at any point during the process but call connection affords a good opportunity to generate a billing entry it is now confirmed that the parties are communication. The service application may generate a bill that is administered by a pay for call server . The billing information for either the requesting subscriber or target can be provided to the server which either creates a bill to be presented to a party or retains a record and forwards the data back to cable provider s billing server which generates a bill for a selected party or otherwise attends to payment for the service. The telephone service and the cable provider typically share in the revenue generated from a bill issued either by the telephone service or by the cable provider. In alternate arrangements some or all revenue may be generated by advertisements. In other arrangements subscription fees generated by the cable provider and or the telephone service may provide revenue for the call placement service. Revenue may also be generated by charging fees to vendors to be included in the vendor database as described above. As noted above in an SMS transaction the billing event may entail a charge to the subscribers cable account or a direct charge from the content vendor with some reimbursement for the referral of business to the cable provider from the content vendor.

In summary it should be clear that a wide variety of revenue generation implementations can be adopted in connection with this novel invention. Where appropriate such implementations may track the data of individual call events and provide charges based on each event e.g. pay per click call . Other implementation may rely mainly upon subscription fees from the subscriber and or vendors others by simply providing this as a value added service still other implementations may rely upon advertising revenues or a combination of implementations may be employed.
