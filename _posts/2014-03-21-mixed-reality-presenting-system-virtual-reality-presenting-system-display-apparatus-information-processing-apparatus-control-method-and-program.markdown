The present invention relates to a system for preventing burn in of the screen of a display apparatus in a system for presenting mixed reality or virtual reality.

In recent years active researches have been performed on mixed reality MR aiming at seamless coupling of the real and the virtual spaces. An image display apparatus for presenting mixed reality has for example the following configuration. Specifically the image display apparatus superimposes onto real space images captured by an imaging apparatus such as a video camera virtual reality space images for example virtual objects text information drawn by using computer graphics generated according to the position and orientation of the imaging apparatus. For example a head mounted display HMD can be used for such an image display apparatus.

The image display apparatus is implemented also by the optical see through method for displaying on an optical see through type display mounted on a user s head a virtual space image generated according to the position and orientation of the user s viewpoint.

Meanwhile Japanese Patent Application No. 2007 281654 also discusses a method for preventing burn in when displaying an image on a display. Specifically in the method an audio video AV apparatus outputs video data to a display apparatus configured to display a video image on a display screen and a control apparatus capable of performing data communication mutually with the AV apparatus detects that the video data output from the AV apparatus is in a still image state. In a case where the control apparatus detects that the video data is in the still image state the control apparatus stops reproducing the video data and changes the state of a power source unit of the AV apparatus from an ON state to an OFF state by executing a power source changeover program thereby preventing burn in.

Japanese Patent Application No. 2002 251667 discusses a method for detecting by using a sensor whether a user wears an HMD and if the user does not wear the HMD turning OFF the power of the HMD to effectively prevent unnecessary power consumption when the HMD is not in use.

However with the method discussed in Japanese Patent Application No. 2007 281654 since the control apparatus detects that the video data is in the still image state and controls the power source there may be a case where the control apparatus stops the video data or turns OFF the power of the display while the user is experiencing mixed reality via the HMD. This case causes a problem that the mixed reality video image is suddenly interrupted to make the user unable to continue experiencing it which disturbs the user s immersive feeling.

The method discussed in Japanese Patent Application No. 2002 251667 has a problem that it cannot be easily performed because it involves the cost for adding a hardware configuration.

According to an aspect of the present invention a mixed reality presenting system includes a display apparatus and an information processing apparatus configured to generate a combined image to be displayed on the display apparatus. The display apparatus includes an imaging unit configured to capture a real space image a first output unit configured to output the captured real space image to the information processing apparatus and a display unit configured to acquire a combined image of the captured real space image and virtual space data from the information processing apparatus and to display the acquired combined image. The information processing apparatus includes a first display control unit configured to control display on the display unit and a second output unit configured to acquire the real space image captured by the imaging unit from the display apparatus to combine the real space image with the virtual space data and to output the combined image to the display apparatus. When a first time period has elapsed since the first display control unit had performed control to start display on the display unit the first display control unit displays a confirmation image on the display unit and controls display on the display unit in response to an operation performed on the confirmation image by a user of the mixed reality presenting system.

The external display apparatuses and also allow the user to confirm the image before wearing the display apparatus . As described below even in a state where display on the display units is OFF the external display apparatuses and can also be used by the user to respond to the confirmation image displayed for the user.

In step S the display control unit transmits the display panel ON signal to the apparatus control unit via the data storage unit and the communication unit . Then the processing proceeds to step S. Further to determine whether the user is using the display apparatus before transmitting the display panel ON signal the display control unit may transmit the display panel ON signal only when a camera has the stereo configuration.

In step S the position and orientation acquisition unit measures the position and orientation of the display apparatus in a world coordinate system and stores the measurement result of the position and orientation of the viewpoint in the data storage unit . Then the processing proceeds to step S.

In step S the virtual space generation unit sets the measurement result of the position and orientation of the viewpoint stored in the data storage unit as a position and orientation of the user s viewpoint in the virtual space. Then the processing proceeds to step S.

In step S the virtual space generation unit generates a virtual space based on the position and orientation of the user s viewpoint set in step and a virtual object. Then the processing proceeds to step S.

In step S the image generation unit reads the virtual space from the data storage unit generates images which can be viewed from the position and orientation of the user s viewpoint and outputs the generated images to the image distribution units and . The image distribution unit outputs the images to the external display apparatus and the apparatus control unit . The apparatus control unit outputs the images to the display units of the display apparatus . Then the processing proceeds to step .

In step S after transmitting the display panel ON signal in step S display control unit determines whether 30 minutes first time period have elapsed. When 30 minutes have not elapsed NO in step S the processing returns to step S. On the other hand when 30 minutes have elapsed the processing proceeds to step S.

In step S the display control unit displays a confirmation image on the display units . Then the processing proceeds to step S. The confirmation image according to the present exemplary embodiment refers to an image used to determine whether the user continues using the mixed reality presenting system. Specifically the confirmation image is used to determine whether the user successively uses the system after the user has experienced virtual reality for a predetermined time period since the images had been displayed on the display units . Controlling display on the display units according to whether the user performs an operation within a second time period described below since the confirmation image has been displayed enables preventing burn in due to fixed display on the display units of the display apparatus which has been taken off and left by the user. Further in the present exemplary embodiment the confirmation image includes a RESTART button for indicating that the user continues using the mixed reality presenting system. Of course the confirmation image may include a button for continuing the use and a button for ending the use.

In steps and display control unit determines whether the user presses the RESTART button displayed in the confirmation image via the input unit before 5 minutes second time period elapses since the confirmation image has been displayed. When the user presses the RESTART button before 5 minutes elapses YES in step S the processing returns to step S. On the other hand when the user does not press the RESTART button before 5 minutes elapses NO in step S YES in step S the processing proceeds to step S. In step S the display control unit transmits the display panel OFF signal to the apparatus control unit via the data storage unit and the communication unit .

In a case where the display control unit does not receive a response from the user within the second time period since the confirmation image has been displayed NO in step S YES in step S then in step S the display control unit automatically turns OFF display on the display units thereby preventing burn in due to fixed display on the display units of the display apparatus which has been taken off and left by the user. In other words the second time period is a waiting time for a response from the user.

In step S the display control unit transmits the display panel OFF signal to the apparatus control unit via the data storage unit and the communication unit and the apparatus control unit transmits the display panel OFF signal to the display units to turn OFF display on the display units first display control . Then the processing ends. Even after display on the display units is turned OFF the display control unit keeps displaying the confirmation image on the external display apparatuses and to receive a user operation made on the confirmation image. Upon reception of a RESTART instruction from the user equivalent to step S the processing returns to step S.

As described above the display units of the display apparatus can be controlled by the information processing apparatus .

In step S the apparatus control unit turns ON the power source of the display apparatus based on the signal from the apparatus control unit of the control apparatus in response to a user operation. When the power source of the display apparatus is turned ON display on the display units is also turned ON. Then the processing proceeds to step S.

In step S the apparatus control unit determines whether the display panel ON signal transmitted in step S is transmitted from the display control unit to the display units via the communication unit . When the display panel ON signal is transmitted to the display units YES in step S the processing proceeds to step S. On the other hand when the display panel ON signal is not transmitted to the display units NO in step S the processing proceeds to step S.

In step S the apparatus control unit determines whether 5 minutes fourth time period have elapsed since the processing in step S had been performed. When 5 minutes have elapsed YES in step S the processing proceeds to step S. On the other hand when 5 minutes have not elapsed NO in step S the processing returns to step S. In the processing even if the apparatus control unit does not receive the display panel ON signal from the display control unit within 5 minutes the display control unit turns ON display on the display units . Even if the user cannot confirm the image in an environment where for example the external display apparatuses and are not connected this processing allows the user to operate the information processing apparatus while wearing the display apparatus for a certain time period fourth time period .

In step S the apparatus control unit determine whether 40 minutes third time period have elapsed since it had confirmed the reception of the display panel ON signal from the display control unit in step S. When 40 minutes have elapsed YES in step S the processing proceeds to step S. On the other hand when 40 minutes have not elapsed NO in step S the processing in step S is repeated. Even if the apparatus control unit does not receive the display panel ON signal from the display control unit because for example the power of the information processing apparatus is turned OFF this processing enables the apparatus control unit to automatically turn OFF display on the display units in step second display control . In other words the second display control functions if the display control unit cannot normally control display on the display units as described with reference to . Therefore it is desirable that the third time period is longer than the sum of the first and the second time periods.

In step S the apparatus control unit of the control apparatus turns OFF display on the display units of the display apparatus . In a case where the apparatus control unit receives the display panel ON signal from the display control unit even after display on the display units is turned OFF the processing restarts from step S to turn ON display on the display units .

Referring to during the processing in steps S and S since the display panel ON signal from the display control unit is present the information processing apparatus parallelly performs the processing from step S illustrated in . For example even if the measurement of the third time period is started after the processing in step S in a case where the user responds to the confirmation image in step S the measurement of the third time period is reset. Specifically the timing to start measuring the third time period is changed from step S to step S.

In any step of the above described flowcharts the user can terminate the virtual reality presenting system via the apparatus control unit and the input unit .

Although in the present exemplary embodiment 30 5 40 and 5 minutes are set as the first second third and fourth time periods respectively the values are to be considered as examples and not limited thereto. In other words the time periods may be set to any desired values suitable for the target scene and the user. The time periods may be customized by the user via the input unit .
