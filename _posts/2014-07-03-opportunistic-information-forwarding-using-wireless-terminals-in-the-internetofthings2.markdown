The disclosure relates generally to communications and more specifically but not exclusively to communications in an Internet of Things environment.

In general the Internet of Things IoT is a computing concept in which physical objects are connected to the Internet. The physical objects may be IoT devices configured to communicate via the Internet e.g. sensors actuators controllers or the like or may be physical objects associated with IoT devices configured to communicate via the Internet. In either case the IoT devices support communications and may support various other functions e.g. discovering the existence of other IoT devices providing information negotiating service agreements and the like typically with little or no human assistance or supervision. The deployment and use of increasing numbers of IoT devices is expected to lead to a wide variety of applications which may significantly improve quality of life. For example IoT devices may be used to provide retail applications factory automation applications healthcare applications energy generation and distribution applications agricultural applications mining applications and smart city applications to name just a few. However realization of such applications is limited by the fact that most IoT devices are expected to be low power low cost devices supporting only short range wireless communications thereby preventing the ubiquitous IoT device connectivity required to fully realize many such applications.

Various deficiencies in the prior art are addressed by embodiments for supporting communications of an energy limited node.

In at least some embodiments a wireless terminal includes a first wireless communication interface configured for communication with a device using a wireless communication protocol a second wireless communication interface configured for wireless communication with a wireless access node of a wireless network and a processor configured to support opportunistic forwarding of information between the device and the wireless access node of the wireless network.

In at least some embodiments a method for use by a wireless terminal includes broadcasting a wake up signal via a first wireless communication interface configured for communication using a wireless communication protocol receiving information from a device via the first wireless communication interface configured for communication using the wireless communication protocol and propagating the information via a second wireless communication interface configured for wireless communication with a wireless access node of a wireless network.

In at least some embodiments an energy limited node includes a wake up circuit configured to detect a wake up signal from a wireless terminal where the wake up signal includes a modulated waveform signal and a communication module configured to switch based on a control signal generated by the wake up circuit from a sleep mode in which the communication module is not operable to communicate with the wireless terminal to an active mode in which the communication module is operable to communicate with the wireless terminal.

In at least some embodiments a method for use by an energy limited node includes detecting at a wake up circuit of the energy limited node a wake up signal from a wireless terminal where the wake up signal includes a modulated waveform signal and generating by the wake up circuit of the energy limited node based on detector of the wake up signal a control signal configured to cause a communication module of the energy limited node to switch from a sleep mode in which the communication module is not operable to communicate with the wireless terminal to an active mode in which the communication module is operable to communicate with the wireless terminal.

In at least some embodiments a wake up circuit includes a first element configured to receive a wake up signal from a wireless terminal and to provide a filtered or selective version of the wake up signal a second element configured to receive the filtered or selective version of the wake up signal and to integrate at least a portion of the filtered or selective version of the wake up signal that is below a cutoff frequency of the second element and a detector configured to determine whether energy received from the second element satisfies a threshold.

To facilitate understanding identical reference numerals have been used where possible to designate identical elements common to the figures.

In general a capability for opportunistic forwarding of information using terminals in an Internet of Things IoT environment is presented. In general IoT environments are expected to include IoT devices configured to communicate wirelessly. In many cases the IoT devices are expected to be low power e.g. for extended battery life and energy autonomy low cost e.g. for cost effective large scale deployment devices and thus are expected to support only short range wireless communications e.g. WiFi Zigbee Bluetooth or the like as opposed to longer range wide area wireless communications e.g. cellular communications thereby tending to limit the coverage range of the IoT devices and tending to prevent ubiquitous interconnectivity of the IoT devices. By contrast various types of wireless terminals are configured to support connectivity to wireless access networks and thus the Internet and other communication networks accessible via wireless access networks . For example cellular terminals typically support 1 short range wireless communications via which cellular terminals may communicate locally and 2 wide area wireless communications via which the cellular terminals may access cellular networks. Similarly for example other types of wireless terminals e.g. computers supporting 802.11 wireless communications or other similar wireless terminals also typically support short range wireless communications via which the wireless terminals may communicate locally including communication with wireless access points providing access to wireless access networks . Additionally as such wireless terminals are carried by an ever increasing percentage of the population and thus such wireless terminals may be considered to at least include wireless user terminals it is expected that various wireless terminals will enter the vicinities of IoT devices deployed in various types of environments. Thus in order to efficiently integrate low power low cost IoT devices to provide ubiquitous interconnectivity various types of wireless terminals e.g. cellular terminals wireless terminals supporting 802.11 wireless communications or the like may be configured to function as communication gateways between IoT devices and wireless access networks and thus the Internet and other communication networks accessible via wireless access networks . Furthermore given that many such wireless terminals are expected to be mobile including entering and leaving various environments in which IoT devices are deployed communication between the IoT devices and the access wireless network may be made opportunistic e.g. wireless terminals may support communications by IoT devices as the wireless terminals randomly enter the vicinity of the IoT devices IoT devices may be configured to include wake up circuitry such that power of the IoT devices may be conserved until the IoT devices are awakened by wireless terminals as necessary or desirable and so forth . In at least some embodiments an IoT device includes a wake up circuit configured to detect a wake up signal from a wireless terminal and a communication module e.g. wireless transceiver wireless transmitter wireless receiver or the like configured to switch based on a control signal generated by the wake up circuit from a sleep mode in which the communication module is not operable to communicate with the wireless terminal to an active mode in which the communication module is operable to communicate with the wireless terminal. In at least some embodiments a wireless terminal includes a first wireless communication interface configured for communication with a device using a wireless communication protocol e.g. WiFi Zigbee Bluetooth or the like a second wireless communication interface configured for wireless communication with a wireless access node of a wireless network e.g. WiFi cellular or the like and a processor configured to support opportunistic forwarding of information between the device and the wireless access node of the wireless network. While various embodiments are particularly well suited for latency tolerant applications e.g. environment sensing object and merchandise tracking or the like various embodiments may be used for various other applications as discussed further below. These and various other embodiments may be better understood when considered within the context of an exemplary communication system supporting an IoT environment as depicted in .

The exemplary communication system includes an access domain portion and a network and application domain portion . The access domain portion includes a set of IoT devices collectively IoT devices and a cellular terminal CT . The network and application domain portion includes a cellular network CN including a cellular base station CBS and a cellular core network CCN a communication network CN an IoT center and a set of endpoints collectively endpoints . The CT is configured to operate as a gateway supporting communications between IoT devices and CN and thus between IoT devices and various other devices accessible via CN such as IoT center endpoints or the like as discussed in additional detail below.

The IoT devices include low power low cost devices and also may be referred to herein as energy limited nodes . As discussed above since the IoT devices are low power low cost devices IoT devices support only short range wireless communications e.g. Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE 802.11 which also may be referred to as WiFi Bluetooth Zigbee or the like . Thus as illustrated an IoT device at least includes a wireless transceiver configured to support short range wireless communications by the IoT device . This is illustrated as wireless transceivers collectively wireless transceivers of the IoT devices respectively. The IoT devices may be object tags attached to or otherwise associated with physical objects sensors e.g. temperature sensors proximity sensors or the like detectors e.g. motion detectors carbon monoxide detectors or the like actuators controllers e.g. gas valve controllers a mass flow controller or the like or the like. Again generally speaking an IoT device depending on various factors may or may not include components in addition to the wireless transceiver e.g. a tag attached to a physical object may or may not include additional components whereas a temperature sensor device is expected to include a sensor subsystem a motion detector device is expected to also include a motion detection subsystem and so forth . The IoT devices may be deployed within various types of environments e.g. sensors and detectors within a home actuators and security cameras within a business location sensors and security cameras deployed on streets of a city or the like . It will be appreciated that although primarily depicted and described herein with respect to IoT devices that are low power low cost devices only supporting short range wireless communications various other IoT devices having various other capabilities e.g. IoT devices having fixed power sources and integrating cellular communications capabilities for wide area wireless communications also may be deployed in which case cellular terminals may operate as communications gateways for IoT devices with or without also operating as communications gateways for the other IoT devices having various other capabilities e.g. operating as communications gateways for the other IoT devices under various conditions such as where the fixed power source for an IoT device is unavailable or the like .

The CT as discussed above is configured to operate as a gateway supporting communications between IoT devices and CN and thus between IoT devices and various other devices accessible via CN such as IoT center endpoints or the like . The CT includes a short range wireless communication interface configured for short range wireless communication by CT with IoT devices and a long range wireless communication interface configured for wide area wireless communication by CT with CN . The functions supported by CT in operating as a gateway supporting communications between IoT devices and CN are discussed in additional detail below. The CT may be a cellular user terminal. For example CT may be a tablet computer a smartphone or any other cellular terminal including both short range and wide area wireless communication interfaces. In at least some embodiments configuration of existing devices e.g. tablet computers smartphones or the like which may be used as CT may only require changes to the operating system kernel of the terminal while the hardware of the terminal may be fully reused. It will be appreciated that although primarily depicted and described with respect to a single CT the ubiquitous availability and use of cellular terminals such as CT is expected to provide ubiquitous connectivity for ever increasing numbers of IoT devices such as IoT devices .

The CN may include any suitable type of cellular network which may operate as a communications interface between CT and CN . For example CN may be a Third Generation Partnership Project 3GPP Universal Mobile Telecommunications System UMTS network a Third Generation Partnership Project Two 3GPP2 Code Division Multiple Access 2000 CDMA 2000 network a Long Term Evolution LTE network or the like. Similarly it will be appreciated that depending on the implementation of CN CBS may be a NodeB an eNodeB or any other suitable type of cellular access node. Similarly it will be appreciated that depending on the implementation of CN CCN may be CDMA 2000 core cellular network an LTE Evolved Packet Core EPC network or the like . It will be appreciated that although primarily depicted and described with respect to use of cellular communications various other types of wireless terminals configured for various other types of wide area wireless communications may be used to provide various functions depicted and described herein and thus references herein to cellular terminal and cellular network may be read more generally as wireless terminal and wireless network .

The CN is configured to facilitate communication between CN and various devices which may be communicatively connected to CN as well as between devices which may be communicatively connected to CN . As depicted in devices that may be communicatively connected to CN may include IoT center endpoints or the like as well as various combinations thereof. The CN may include any suitable type of communication network s configured to support communications of CN . For example CN may include one or more public data networks e.g. the Internet one or more private data networks or the like as well as various combinations thereof. For example CN may include one or more wireline networks one or more wireless networks or the like as well as various combinations thereof.

The IoT center is configured to provide various functions for IoT devices e.g. discovery of IoT devices management of IoT devices collection of information from IoT devices use of IoT devices or information from IoT devices by endpoints or the like as well as various combinations thereof . The IoT center includes an IoT server and an IoT database . The IoT database stores IoT information information associated with management and use of IoT devices .

The IoT server is configured to provide various functions for IoT devices . The IoT server may support discovery of IoT devices management of IoT devices processing and storage of information provided by IoT devices processing and storage of control information intended for delivery to IoT devices delivery of control information to IoT devices or the like as well as various combinations thereof. The IoT server may be configured to manage individual IoT devices groups of IoT devices e.g. organized based on the location or environment in which the IoT devices are deployed device types of the IoT devices or the like or the like as well as various combinations thereof.

The IoT server is configured to communicate with IoT devices via CN and CN . The communication between IoT server and an IoT device may be unidirectional or bidirectional. The IoT server may communicate with IoT devices for purposes of discovering IoT devices managing IoT devices receiving information from IoT devices and processing the information from the IoT devices for storage as part of the IoT information maintained in IoT database receiving information intended for delivery to IoT devices and processing the information intended for delivery to the IoT devices for storage as part of the IoT information maintained in IoT database delivering control information to IoT devices or the like as well as various combinations thereof.

The IoT server is configured to communicate with endpoints via CN . The IoT server may communicate with endpoints for enabling endpoints to utilize IoT devices e.g. to provide endpoints within information received from IoT devices to enable endpoints to access and use information provided by IoT devices to enable endpoints to access IoT devices e.g. supporting authentication by endpoints with IoT devices to enable endpoints to control the operation of IoT devices or the like as well as various combinations thereof .

The IoT server may be configured to provide various functions associated with use of multiple CTs configured as depicted and described for CT . The IoT server may be configured to support in order delivery of data e.g. in order storage of information received from IoT devices in order delivery of information to IoT devices in order delivery of information to endpoints or the like as well as various combinations thereof . The IoT server may be configured to detect duplicate data e.g. such as where multiple CTs within the vicinity of an IoT device receive and propagate the same information associated with the IoT device and to prevent storage of duplicate data within IoT database . The IoT server may be configured to support interaction between CTs e.g. establishment of associations between CTs controlling which CTs are to wake up particular IoT devices controlling priority amongst CTs in a group of CTs or the like as well as various combinations thereof as discussed in additional detail below.

The IoT server may be deployed and managed by various entities e.g. a service provider a third party or the like . The IoT server may provide an open source application programming interface API for any qualified application which may utilize or benefit from IoT devices e.g. utilize information from IoT devices which may be retrieved from IoT devices or from IoT information maintained by IoT center interface with IoT devices for configuring or controlling IoT devices or the like as well as various combinations thereof . For example such applications may query IoT server to determine when and where a particular IoT device was most recently detected to obtain current status information associated with the IoT device to authenticate for obtaining access to the IoT device or the like as well as various combinations thereof. The use of such applications is discussed further below with respect to endpoints as at least some of the endpoints may be applications or devices hosting applications which might utilize such APIs.

The IoT database stores the IoT information associated with IoT devices . The IoT information may include IoT device registration information associated with IoT devices e.g. a device identifier an address a device type device capability information energy source information communication characteristics information or the like information provided by IoT devices e.g. status information information indicative of the most recent time the IoT device was detected energy source information communication characteristics information sensor readings detector indicators actuator status information or the like control information intended for delivery to IoT devices e.g. configuration information for configuring IoT devices control information for controlling the operation of IoT device or the like or the like as well as various combinations thereof. It will be appreciated that various portions of IoT information may be received by IoT database from the server from IoT devices or endpoints via server from one or more other devices via server from one or more administrators or the like as well as various combinations thereof. It will be appreciated that since IoT devices may be deployed in various environments or areas and may collect various types of information related to conditions in the associated environments or areas IoT information also may be considered to include environment specific or area specific information e.g. a pollen count in a particular geographic area temperature readings from a particular indoor location or the like .

The endpoints may include any endpoints which may utilize or benefit from IoT devices e.g. utilize information from IoT devices which may be retrieved from IoT devices or from IoT information maintained by IoT center interface with IoT devices for configuring or controlling IoT devices or the like as well as various combinations thereof . For example endpoints may include end user devices e.g. computers smart phones or the like application servers applications or the like as well as various combinations thereof. For example where the IoT devices are energy meters in a particular area served by an energy provider an application of the energy provider may be configured to periodically access IoT server in order to retrieve the latest energy meter readings reported by the energy meters to the IoT server for storage in the IoT database e.g. here the endpoint may be considered to be the application or a device hosting the application . For example where an IoT device is configured to lock and unlock doors and windows of a home a user may use his or her endpoint e.g. a computer at work a personal smart phone or the like to remotely access the IoT device in order to remotely lock or unlock the doors or windows. In at least some embodiments one endpoint may communicate with one or more other endpoints regarding IoT information e.g. such as where an application retrieves pollen count information from IoT server and then provides the pollen count information to end users of the application an application retrieves from IoT server environment information related to conditions in a home and provides the environment information to the homeowner via the application or the like . It will be appreciated that the foregoing examples are merely a few of the many ways in which endpoints may utilize IoT devices .

The CT as discussed above is configured to operate as a gateway supporting communications between IoT devices and CN . The CT after entering the wireless coverage range of an IoT device may participate in short range wireless communications with the wireless transceiver of the IoT device via short range wireless communication interface . The short range wireless communications between CT and IoT device may be unidirectional or bidirectional. In the case of unidirectional short range wireless communication CT may support upstream communication from IoT device to CN . For upstream communication for example CT may receive information from IoT device via short range wireless communication interface and propagate the information toward CN via the long range wireless communication interface between CT and CN e.g. for delivery to one or more of IoT server one or more of the endpoints or the like . In the case of bidirectional short range wireless communications CT in addition to supporting upstream communications from IoT device to CN as discussed above for the unidirectional case also may support downstream communication from CN to IoT device . For downstream communication for example CT may receive information from CN e.g. from one or more of IoT server one or more of the endpoints or the like via the long range wireless communication interface between CT and propagate the information toward IoT device via short range wireless communication interface between CT and IoT device .

The information communicated upstream from the IoT device to CT via the short range wireless communication interface may include association information for enabling IoT device to associate with CN e.g. a request by IoT device to establish an associated with CN authentication information for authenticating IoT device to CN e.g. a request by IoT device to be authenticated by CN which may include associated authentication credentials information stored on IoT device e.g. an identifier of IoT device an address of the IoT device status information associated with IoT device or the like information determined by IoT device e.g. one or more sensor readings where IoT device is a sensor one or more detector indicators where IoT device is a detector or the like or the like as well as various combinations thereof. As discussed above such information may be intended for delivery to one or more of IoT server e.g. for storage as part of IoT information in IoT database one or more endpoints or the like .

In the case of upstream communications from IoT device to CN the CT may propagate the received information toward CN via the long range wireless communication interface without modifying the received information e.g. CT simply functions as a pass through gateway between IoT device and CN or may modify the received information to provide modified information and then propagate the modified information toward CN via the long range wireless communication interface . The modification of received information may include supplementing the received information to include additional information. The additional information may include one or more of timestamp information location information or the like as well as various combinations thereof. The timestamp information may include a timestamp associated with the information being propagated from the IoT device to CN via CT e.g. a timestamp indicative of a time at which the CT received the information from the IoT device . The location information may include a location of the IoT device a location of the CT when the CT received the information from IoT device or the like as well as various combinations thereof. The location information may include geographic location information indoor location information or the like as well as various combinations thereof. The CT may determine the location information based on one or more of an assisted GPS capability of CT a GPS capability of CT an indoor location determination capability or the like as well as various combinations thereof. The additional information may be added in any suitable manner e.g. as one or more stamps for each block of data exchanged via appending of the information via inclusion within a protocol data unit PDU as part of a higher layer protocol e.g. at or above the transport layer as defined in the Open Systems Interconnection OSI protocol stack or the Transmission Control Protocol TCP Internet Protocol IP stack or the like as well as various combinations thereof . It will be appreciated that although primarily depicted and described with respect to embodiments in which the CT determines the additional information for upstream communications from IoT device to CN in at least some embodiments at least a portion of such additional information may be provided by the IoT device as part of the upstream communications sent by the IoT device to the CT . The modification of received information also may include any other suitable processing which CT may perform on the received information before propagating the received information toward CN e.g. formatting aggregation interpretation or the like as well as various combinations thereof .

The information communicated downstream from the CT to the IoT device via the short range wireless communication interface may include association information for enabling IoT device to associate with CN e.g. a response to a request by IoT device to establish an associated with CN authentication information for authenticating IoT device to CN e.g. a response to a request by IoT device to be authenticated by CN which may include an indication as to whether or not authentication of the IoT device was successful a request for IoT device to provide information stored on or determined by the IoT device e.g. status information associated with IoT device one or more sensor readings where IoT device is a sensor one or more detector indicators where IoT device is a detector or the like a command for IoT device to perform an action e.g. take a reading perform an actuation or the like configuration information adapted for configuring the IoT device e.g. a parameter for controlling collection of information by IoT device a parameter for modifying a threshold used by the IoT device is performing detection a software update or the like or the like as well as various combinations thereof. As discussed above such information may be received at CT from one or more of IoT server one or more endpoints or the like.

In the case of downstream communications from CN to IoT device the CT may propagate the received information toward the IoT device via the short range wireless communication interface without modifying the received information e.g. CT simply functions as a pass through gateway between CN and IoT device or may modify the received information to provide modified information and then propagate the modified information toward the IoT device via the short range wireless communication interface . The modification of received information may include any suitable processing which CT may perform on the received information before propagating the received information toward the IoT device e.g. formatting aggregation or the like as well as various combinations thereof .

The communication of information between the IoT devices and the CN and ultimately one or more devices accessible via CN may be performed using one or more existing or specifically designed higher layer protocols. Here the higher layer protocol s may include protocol s at or above the transport layer e.g. the transport layer as defined in the OSI protocol stack the TCP IP protocol stack or any other suitable protocol stack . For example the higher layer protocol s may include protocol s which may ride on top of IP e.g. at one or more of the transport layer the session layer the application layer or the like as well as various combinations thereof . The information may be transported using PDUs of the higher layer protocol s e.g. TCP segments or User Datagram Protocol UDP datagrams at the transport layer session messages at the session layer application messages at the application layer or the like as well as various combinations thereof . The higher layer protocol s may be 1 end to end e.g. between the IoT device and the end device for which the information is intended or from which the information is provided such as IoT server one or more endpoints or the like or 2 two stage e.g. a first protocol is used between the IoT device and the CT and a second protocol is used between the CT and the end device for which the information is intended or from which the information is provided such as IoT server one or more endpoints or the like. In the two stage case the first higher layer protocol between the IoT device and the CT may not be IP based and the second higher layer protocol between the CT and the end device may be IP based both the first and second higher layer protocols may be IP based although perhaps using different higher layer protocols at the same or different layers of the communication stack or the like . Various combinations of such higher layer protocol implementations are contemplated e.g. where different IoT devices or CTs may use different layers protocols PDUs or the like .

The CT may be configured to support store and forward capabilities for upstream communications from IoT device to CN and for downstream communications from CN to IoT device . The store and forward capabilities enable the CT to store information to be communicated rather than propagating the information as the information is received. The CT may be configured to store the information until a better opportunity to forward the information arises. The CT may store such information in any suitable manner e.g. by caching the information or storing the information in any other suitable manner .

In at least some embodiments for upstream communications from IoT device to CN CT may store the information received IoT device until detecting a condition indicative that the stored information should be forwarded toward CN via long range wireless communication interface . For example the condition may include a determination that CT enters a geographic area known to have relatively good wide area coverage for access to CN a determination that CT currently has relatively good wide area coverage for access to CN a determination that a threshold amount of information has been received from the IoT device or a set of IoT devices e.g. which may enable the energy overhead of establishing a connection with CN to be amortized temporal considerations receipt of an indication from CN that currently stored information from the IoT device or a set of IoT devices may be propagated via CN or the like as well as various combinations thereof.

In at least some embodiments for downstream communications from CN to IoT device CT may store the information intended for IoT device until detecting a condition indicative that the stored information should be forwarded toward the IoT device via the short range wireless communication interface . For example the condition may include a determination that the CT is or may enter an area of poor or no wide area coverage such that the CT may still opportunistically deliver the information to the IoT device despite having a poor or no connection to the CN temporal considerations a battery status of the CT or the like as well as various combinations thereof .

The CT may be configured to support connection based or connectionless communications between IoT device and CN . The CT may receive information from IoT device in a connectionless manner and propagate the received information toward CN with or without using a connection between CT and CN or an element accessible via CN . The use of connectionless communication between the IoT device and CT may minimize or even obviate the need for the IoT device to be authenticated. In at least some embodiments in which communication between the IoT device and CT is connectionless CT may be configured to perform policing of information received from the IoT device before forwarding the information toward CN in order to ensure that the information is valid e.g. to prevent malicious IoT devices from draining the battery of the CT or attacking the CN or other devices accessible via CN . The CT may propagate information toward IoT device in a connectionless manner where the propagated information may be received from the CN with or without using a connection a connection between CT and CN or an element accessible via CN . The communication of information between IoT device and CN may be performed using a single connection between the IoT device and the CN or an element accessible via CN . The communication of information between IoT device and CN may be performed using a connection between the IoT device and CT and a connection between CT the CN or an element accessible via CN such that CT may be configured to map information between the connections in order to support communication of information between IoT device and CN . The CT may be configured to support various combinations of such connection based or connectionless communications between IoT device and CN .

The CT may be configured to operate as a gateway supporting communications between IoT devices and CN in a manner that is transparent to a user of CT . The use of CT as a gateway supporting communications between IoT devices and CN is expected to consume at least some resources of CT e.g. battery resources data communication bandwidth resources processing resources or the like . Accordingly in at least some embodiments the user of CT may be provided with one or more incentives to make his or her CT available for use as a gateway supporting communications between IoT devices and CN e.g. providing free data communications for the user whenever his or her CT is set to operate as a gateway supporting communications between IoT devices and CN providing pro rated discounts on the bill of the user based on the length of time that his or her CT is set to operate as a gateway supporting communications between IoT devices and CN or the like as well as various combinations thereof . The CT may be configured to temporarily or permanently suspend operation as a gateway supporting communications between IoT devices and CN responsive to one or more conditions e.g. detection by the CT that CN is congested detection by the CT of an explicit request by CN or IoT server for operation of CT as a gateway between IoT devices and CN to be suspended or the like .

The CT may receive information from an IoT device by either being within wireless range of the IoT device when the IoT device transmits information or by initiating a signal adapted for causing the IoT device to transmit information which also may be a signal adapted for causing the IoT device to wake up and then transmit information .

In at least some embodiments an IoT device may be configured to transmit information and the CT will receive the information from the IoT device and forward the information toward CN if CT is within wireless range of the IoT device when the IoT device transmits the information. The IoT device may be configured to transmit information periodically pseudo periodically in response to a trigger condition e.g. responsive to detection that a threshold of a sensor has been satisfied responsive to detection that an actuator has been actuated or the like or the like as well as various combinations thereof. The IoT device may be configured to transmit information only after determining that a clear channel condition exists where the manner in which the clear channel condition is detected may depend on the type of short range wireless communication being used e.g. using carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance CSMA CA where WiFi Zigbee or other relevant short range wireless communication are used using other clear channel detection mechanisms for other types of short range wireless communications which may be used for communication between IoT device and CT or the like . The IoT device transmits the information to CT using short range wireless communication. In such embodiments the IoT device is configured to transmit information irrespective of whether CT or any other similarly configured terminal is within wireless range of the IoT device thereby enabling passive harvesting of information of the IoT device e.g. device identifier device address sensor readings detector readings or the like by CT as CT moves into the vicinity of the IoT device .

In at least some embodiments an IoT device may be configured to remain in an active reception mode and responsive to receiving an indication of the presence of CT within wireless range of the IoT device to communicate with CT via the short range wireless communication interface . In the active reception mode the wireless transceiver of the IoT device remains active and thus IoT device remains operable to communicate with CT via the short range wireless communication interface . The indication of the presence of CT within wireless range of the IoT device may be communicated from CT to the IoT device in any suitable manner. The indication of the presence of CT within wireless range of the IoT device may be communicated from CT to the IoT device using a presence notification signal transmitted via the short range wireless communication interface of CT . The CT may be configured to transmit the presence notification signal periodically pseudo periodically in response to a trigger condition e.g. responsive to detection that CT has entered or exited a particular geographic area or indoor area responsive to a determination that CT has battery power above a threshold or the like or the like as well as various combinations thereof. The communication between the IoT device and the CT uses short range wireless communication. In such embodiments the IoT device is configured to transmit information responsive to reception of the presence notification signal from CT or any other similarly configured terminal is within wireless range of the IoT device thereby enabling active harvesting of information of the IoT device e.g. device identifier device address sensor readings detector readings or the like by CT as CT moves into the vicinity of the IoT device .

In at least some embodiments an IoT device or at least a portion of an IoT device may be configured to remain in a sleep mode until receiving an indication of the presence of CT within wireless range of the IoT device at which point the IoT device switches from the sleep mode to an active mode. In the sleep mode the wireless transceiver of the IoT device is not active and thus the IoT device is not operable to communicate with CT using wireless transceiver rather the IoT device remains in a receive only mode for enabling the IoT device to receive from CT a signal adapted to cause the IoT device to transition from the sleep mode to the active mode. In the active mode the wireless transceiver of the IoT device is active and thus the IoT device is operable to communicate with CT using wireless transceiver . It will be appreciated that although described above within the context of the IoT device having operational modes associated therewith the wireless transceiver of the IoT device will be understood to have corresponding operational modes associated therewith as short range wireless communication by the IoT device with CT is dependent upon the operational mode of the wireless transceiver . Accordingly it also may be said that the wireless transceiver of IoT device may be configured to remain in a sleep mode until receiving an indication of the presence of CT within wireless range of the IoT device at which point the wireless transceiver of the IoT device switches from the sleep mode to an active mode in which the wireless transceiver of the IoT device is active and thus IoT device is operable to communicate with CT using wireless transceiver . As discussed above communication between the IoT device and CT while the IoT device is in the active mode may include unidirectional communications or bidirectional communications. The signal which causes the IoT device to switch from the sleep mode to the active mode also may be said to cause the IoT device to wake up and thus also may be referred to as a wake up signal. The wake up signal generated and transmitted by CT may be an electromagnetic signal e.g. a radio frequency RF signal an infrared signal a visible light signal or the like an acoustic signal or the like.

The wake up signal which is discussed in additional detail below may be any suitable modulated waveform signal which may be transmitted by CT in order to cause one or more IoT devices to transition from the sleep mode to the active mode. The Ct may generate the modulated waveform signal by varying one or more properties of a locally generated periodic source of the CT in order to convey information to one or more IoT devices . In general the modulated waveform signal may include any information which may be used by an IoT device to detect the wake up signal and switch from a sleep mode to an active mode in response to the wake up signal. For example the information of the modulated waveform signal may include information included in a frame of a wireless communication protocol at least a portion of a synchronization signal of a wireless communication protocol information included in a payload portion of a frame of a wireless communication protocol a sequence of frames of a wireless communication protocol or the like many of which are discussed in additional detail below. The generation and transmission of a modulated waveform signal by the CT may enable an IoT device to detect estimate and match the modulated waveform signal such that if a match is identified the IoT device which identified the match will transition from the sleep mode to the active mode responsive to the modulated waveform signal.

The CT may be configured to generate and broadcast the wake up signal responsive to a local determination by CT to generate and broadcast the wake up signal under direction of a network element instructing CT to generate and broadcast the wake up signal e.g. responsive to receipt of an instruction from IoT server or any other suitable device or the like as well as various combinations thereof.

The CT may be configured to generate the wake up signal using information available locally at CT based on information received from a network device e.g. information indicative of a particular characteristic s for the wake up signal such as for generating a wake up signal specific to a particular IoT device or set of IoT devices or the like as well as various combinations thereof.

The CT may be configured to generate and broadcast a generic wake up signal. In general a generic wake up signal is intended to wake all IoT devices in the short range wireless communication coverage area of CT where it will be appreciated that if any IoT devices in the short range wireless communication coverage area of CT are using a short range wireless communication protocol s different than that of CT those IoT devices will not wake up in response to the wake up signal .

The CT may be configured to generate and broadcast a device specific wake up signal. In general a device specific wake up signal is intended to wake only a single IoT device which is configured to recognize the device specific wake up signal. Here all IoT devices in the short range wireless communication coverage area of CT will receive the wake up signal but only the single IoT device for which the wake up signal is intended will transition from the sleep mode to the active mode responsive to the wake up signal the other IoT devices will remain in the sleep mode . The IoT device for which the device specific wake up signal is intended may be configured to recognize the device specific wake up signal using information stored on the IoT device e.g. content expected to be received in a payload of a frame or message characteristics of a sequence of frames or the like as well as various combinations thereof as discussed in additional detail below . For example the IoT server responsive to a determination that CT is at a particular location at which a particular IoT device was previously detected as being located may provide device specific information e.g. data to be included in a payload characteristics of a sequence of frames or the like to CT for use by CT in generating and transmitting a device specific wake up signal configured to wake only that particular IoT device thereby preventing other IoT devices in the area from becoming active and thus conserving power of the other IoT devices in the area . It will be appreciated that device specific wake up signals may be generated and transmitted by CT under various other conditions and in various other ways.

The CT may be configured to generate and broadcast a device group specific wake up signal. In general a device group specific wake up signal is intended to wake only a group of IoT devices each of which is configured to recognize the device group specific wake up signal. Here all IoT devices in the short range wireless communication coverage area of CT will receive the wake up signal but only the IoT devices in the group of IoT devices for which the wake up signal is intended will transition from the sleep mode to the active mode responsive to the wake up signal the other IoT devices will remain in the sleep mode . The IoT devices for which the device group specific wake up signal is intended may be configured to recognize the device group specific wake up signal using information stored on the IoT devices e.g. content expected to be received in a payload of a frame or message characteristics of a sequence of frames or the like as well as various combinations thereof as discussed in additional detail below . For example the IoT server responsive to a determination that CT is at a particular location at which a particular group of IoT devices was previously detected as being located may provide device group specific information e.g. data to be included in a payload characteristics of a sequence of frames or the like to CT for use by CT in generating and transmitting a device group specific wake up signal configured to wake only the IoT devices in that particular group of IoT devices thereby preventing other IoT devices in the area from becoming active and thus conserving power of the other IoT devices in the area . It will be appreciated that device group specific wake up signals may be generated and transmitted by CT under various other conditions and in various other ways.

The use of a wake up signal from CT to control the operational state of the IoT device and thus to control communication by the IoT device with CN enables the IoT device to be implemented as a low power IoT device. Various embodiments of the wake up signal generated and transmitted by CT and the wake up circuit of an IoT device that is configured to detect the wake up signal generated and transmitted by CT are described in additional detail below.

As described herein short range wireless communications between IoT devices and CT may be implemented using different short range wireless communication protocols and thus it will be appreciated that wake up signals generated by CT may use different short range wireless communication protocols.

In at least some embodiments the wake up signal that is used to wake up a wireless transceiver of an IoT device is at least a portion of a synchronization signal of the short range wireless communication protocol supported by the IoT device .

In at least some embodiments in which WiFi is used as the short range wireless communication protocol the wake up signal may be the Short Training Sequence STS portion of the WiFi preamble of a WiFi frame which has a simple periodic structure. The STS portion of the WiFi preamble is typically a repetitive sequence with 13 non zero subcarriers equally spaced between 52 subcarriers. The cyclostationary properties of the STS portion of the WiFi preamble may enable detection of the STS portion of the WiFi preamble by implementing the wake up circuit as a sub sampling receiver e.g. operating at the rate of a typical WiFi receiver .

In at least some embodiments in which Zigbee is used as the short range wireless communication protocol the wake up signal may be the preamble portion of the synchronization header SHR of the Zigbee frame.

In at least some embodiments in which Bluetooth is used as the short range wireless communication protocol the wake up signal may be at least a portion of the access code of the Bluetooth frame or at least a portion of the header of the Bluetooth frame.

In at least some embodiments in which WiFi is used as the short range wireless communication protocol the wake up signal may be both the STS and the Long Train Sequence LTS portions of the WiFi preamble of a WiFi frame. It is noted that while the LTS portion of the WiFi preamble is more complex than the STS portion of the WiFi preamble use of a combination of the STS and LTS portions of the WiFi preamble may provide higher signal to noise ratio SNR improved selectivity and better sensitivity.

In at least some embodiments the wake up signal that is used to wake up a wireless transceiver of an IoT device is at least a portion of a payload of a frame or message of the short range wireless communication protocol supported by the IoT device . For example a frame of the short range wireless communication protocol may be configured to include periodic signal components which may be detected by the wake up circuit. For example a frame of the short range wireless communication protocol may be configured to be broadcast using a particular modulation and coding which enables detection by the wake up circuit. The frame or message may be a WiFi frame a Zigbee frame a Bluetooth frame or the like. The wake up circuit of an IoT device that is configured to detect the wake up signal may be configured to compare payload data or characteristics of payload data received in the wake up signal to data or data characteristics stored by the IoT device for purposes of detecting the wake up signal. The payload data may be configured to provide generic wake up signal a device specific wake up signal e.g. where the associated IoT device for which the device specific wake up signal is defined is configured to compare the payload data received in the device specific wake up signal to a set of data stored by the IoT device for purposes of detecting the device specific wake up signal a device group specific wake up signal or the like.

In at least some embodiments the wake up signal that is used to wake up a wireless transceiver of an IoT device is a sequence of frames configured to produce a specific beat signal. The characteristics of the wake up signal may be based on one or more of the number of frames sent the duration or length of the frames the intervals between the frames or the like as well as various combinations thereof. The characteristics of the sequence of frames may enable implementation of higher sensitivity wake up detection circuits. The sequence of frames may be a sequence of WiFi STS preamble signals e.g. natively as a train of WiFi frames a sequence of Zigbee SHRs e.g. natively as a train of Zigbee frames or the like. The wake up circuit of an IoT device that is configured to detect the wake up signal may be configured to compare characteristics of the sequence of frames received in the wake up signal to characteristics stored by the IoT device for purposes of detecting the wake up signal. The sequence of frames may be configured to provide a generic wake up signal a device specific wake up signal e.g. where the associated IoT device for which the device specific wake up signal is defined is configured to compare characteristics of the sequence of frames received in the device specific wake up signal to characteristics stored by the IoT device for purposes of detecting the device specific wake up signal a device group specific wake up signal or the like.

In such embodiments as indicated above the IoT device in addition to wireless transceiver also includes a wake up circuit that is configured to detect a wake up signal from CT and responsive to detecting the wake up signal to cause wireless transceiver to transition from the sleep mode in which wireless transceiver is not operable to communicate with CT using short range wireless communication to the awake mode in which wireless transceiver is operable to communicate with CT using short range wireless communication . An exemplary IoT device including a wake up circuit is depicted and described with respect to .

As depicted in wake up circuit includes a bandpass filter an integrate and dump lowpass filter and an energy detector . The bandpass filter is configured to receive the wake up signal from an antenna of the IoT device omitted for purposes of clarity . The bandpass filter is a passive filter. The bandpass filter produces a bandpass version of the wake up signal. The output of the bandpass filter is connected to the input of the integrate and dump lowpass filter . The integrate and dump lowpass filter receives the bandpass version of the wake up signal and integrates over at least a portion of the bandpass version of the wake up signal while dumping or filtering any portion of the bandpass version of the wake up signal greater than a cutoff frequency to produce an output signal. The integration function of integrate and dump lowpass filter may be performed using an operational amplifier op amp configured to operate at a fraction of the overall bandwidth of the bandpass version of the wake up signal. The integrate and dump lowpass filter also may be viewed as a coarse sampler. The integrate and dump lowpass filter may be configured to operate at a relatively low sampling rate e.g. as compared with a convention receiver that is configured for the short range wireless communication protocol being used and thus while it may be subject to aliasing responsive to full transmission using the short range wireless communication protocol e.g. a WiFi transmission or a Zigbee transmission is expected to provide a detectable signal peak responsive to the wake up signal that is broadcast based on the short range wireless communication protocol e.g. responsive to the STS portion of the WiFi preamble where WiFi is used responsive to the preamble portion of the synchronization header where Zigbee is used or the like . The output of the integrate and dump lowpass filter is connected to the input of the energy detector . The energy detector receives the output signal from integrate and dump lowpass filter . The energy detector compares the output signal to a threshold associated with detection of the wake up signal. The energy detector based on a determination that the output signal is above the threshold associated with detection of the wake up signal outputs a control signal adapted for causing the wireless transceiver to transition from a sleep mode again in which the wireless transceiver is not operable to communicate to an active mode again in which the wireless transceiver is operable to communicate . It will be appreciated that the implementation of wake up circuit or at least some components of wake up circuit may vary within and across different types of short range wireless communication protocols which may be used for the wake up signal e.g. WiFi Zigbee Bluetooth or the like . An exemplary implementation of bandpass filter and integrate and dump lowpass filter where the STS portion of the WiFi preamble of a WiFi frame is used as the wake up signal is further illustrated in .

As noted above where the STS portion of the WiFi preamble of a WiFi frame is used as the wake up signal bandpass filter and integrate and dump lowpass filter may be implemented using specific types numbers arrangements and values of components. The bandpass filter may be implemented as a first order RC bandpass filter including a resistor and a capacitor where the resistor has a resistance of 50 ohms or approximately 50 ohms denoted as L1 500 and the capacitor has a capacitance of 8.3 pF or approximately 8.3 pF denoted as L3 8.3 pF . The integrate and dump lowpass filter may be implemented using a pair of operational amplifiers op amps and other components arranged to provide a integration function and a lowpass filtering function at a cutoff frequency of 5 MHz or approximately 5 MHz. It will be appreciated that the implementations of bandpass filter and integrate and dump lowpass filter e.g. types of components used number of components used arrangement of components values of components and so forth is merely exemplary and that various other types numbers arrangements or values of components may be used to provide implementations of bandpass filter or integrate and dump lowpass filter for various types of wake up signals e.g. other implementations where the STS portion of the WiFi preamble of a WiFi frame is used as the wake up signal embodiments in which the preamble portion of the SHR of a Zigbee frame is used as the wake up signal or the like .

As depicted in the wake up circuit includes a detector module and an IoT device identity estimator . The detector module is configured to receive the device specific wake up signal from an antenna of the IoT device omitted for purposes of clarity . The detector module may be implemented using wake up circuit of or using any other suitable detector module. The detector module outputs IoT device identity information determined from the device specific wake up signal. The output of detector module is coupled to the input of IoT device identity estimator . The IoT device identity estimator stores reference IoT device identity information for use by IoT device identity estimator in determining whether the device specific wake up signal is intended to wake the IoT device. The IoT device identity estimator is configured to compare the IoT device identity information determined from the device specific wake up signal illustratively received from detector module with the reference IoT device identity information to determine whether the device specific wake up signal is intended to wake the IoT device. The IoT device identity estimator may be configured to compare the IoT device identity information determined from the device specific wake up signal with the reference IoT device identity information to determine whether the device specific wake up signal is intended to wake the IoT device by correlating the IoT device identity information determined from the device specific wake up signal e.g. in the form of a waveform with the reference IoT device identity information e.g. also in the form of a waveform and determining whether an associated threshold is satisfied due to correlation of the IoT device identity information determined from the device specific wake up signal e.g. in the form of a waveform with the reference IoT device identity information e.g. also in the form of a waveform . The IoT device identity estimator includes an IoT device identity information correlator and a threshold detector where the IoT device identity information correlator is configured to correlated the IoT device identity information determined from the device specific wake up signal with the reference IoT device identity information and the threshold detector is configured to determine or detect whether correlated the IoT device identity information determined from the device specific wake up signal with the reference IoT device identity information satisfies a threshold. The correlation of the IoT device identity information determined from the device specific wake up signal with the reference IoT device identity information may be a correlation of a waveform indicated by or determined from the IoT device identity information determined from the device specific wake up signal with a waveform indicated by or determined from the reference IoT device identity information . If the comparison or correlation of the IoT device identity information determined from the device specific wake up signal and the reference IoT device identity information does not satisfy the threshold either a control signal is not output from the threshold detector or the control signal output from threshold detector is adapted so as not to wake the IoT device since the wake up signal received at the wake up circuit has been determined not to be intended to wake the IoT device . If comparison or correlation of the IoT device identity information determined from the device specific wake up signal and the reference IoT device identity information does satisfy the threshold a control signal is output from threshold detector and the control signal is adapted to wake the IoT device since the wake up signal received at the wake up circuit has been determined to be intended to wake the IoT device . It will be appreciated that the implementation of wake up circuit or at least some components of wake up circuit may vary within and across different types of short range wireless communication protocols which may be used for the wake up signal e.g. WiFi Zigbee Bluetooth or the like . An exemplary use of wake up circuit where a sequence of WiFi STSs is used as a device specific wake up signal is further illustrated in .

As noted above where a sequence of WiFi STSs is used as a device specific wake up signal certain characteristics of the sequence of WiFi STSs e.g. the duration or length of the STSs the intervals between the STSs or the like as well as various combinations thereof may be used as a device specific wake up signal. Here where a CT intends to wake the IoT device in which wake up circuit is disposed CT transmits a sequence of STSs illustratively a sequence of WiFi frames having certain characteristics specific to the IoT device. The detector module receives the sequence of WiFi frames and produces a corresponding STS sequence waveform . The STS sequence waveform is produced based on the sequence of WiFi frames and thus has associated characteristics which may be used by IoT device identity estimator to determine whether the wake up signal is intended for that IoT device. The reference IoT device identity information stored by IoT device identity estimator includes information indicative of a reference STS sequence waveform specific to that IoT device. The IoT device identity information correlator correlates the STS sequence waveform determined from sequence of WiFi frames with the reference STS sequence waveform specific to that IoT device. If the STS sequence waveform determined from sequence of WiFi frames and the reference STS sequence waveform specific to that IoT device do not match indicative that the wake up signal is not intended to wake the IoT device the waveforms will not be aligned or synchronized which also means that any peaks of the waveforms will not be aligned or synchronized such that correlation of the waveforms will not result in any waveform peaks which exceed the threshold of the threshold detector and thus either a control signal is not output from the threshold detector or the control signal output from threshold detector is adapted so as not to wake the IoT device again since the wake up signal received at the wake up circuit has been determined not to be intended to wake the IoT device . If the STS sequence waveform determined from sequence of WiFi frames and the reference STS sequence waveform specific to that IoT device match indicative that the wake up signal is intended to wake the IoT device the waveforms will be aligned or synchronized such that correlation of the waveforms results in one or more peaks illustratively three peaks in the example of which exceed the threshold of the threshold detector and thus the control signal output from threshold detector is adapted to wake the IoT device again since the wake up signal received at the wake up circuit has been determined to be intended to wake the IoT device .

It will be appreciated that the foregoing example represents merely one of many ways in which a device specific wake up signal may be processed by wake up circuit e.g. the device specific wake up signal and thus the corresponding information produced by detector module may be based on other types of WiFi information e.g. STS LTS payload data or the like information for other short range wireless communication protocols or the like . Accordingly references herein to the sequence of WiFi frames and the STS sequence waveform may be read more generally as references to a sequence of frames or information which may include other frame types or information types for other wireless protocols and a sequence waveform or waveform which may be different when generated based on other frame types or other information types for other wireless protocols respectively. Similarly references herein to the reference IoT device identity information and the reference STS sequence waveform may be read more generally as reference device identity information and a reference sequence waveform. Accordingly in at least some embodiments a device identity information correlator of an energy limited node may be configured to receive device identity information from a detector module based on processing of a wake up signal by the detector module compare the received device identity information and reference device identity information available to the detector module to determine whether the wake up signal is intended for the energy limited node e.g. which may include correlation of a waveform determined from or indicated by the received device identity information with a waveform determined from or indicated by the reference device identity information available to the detector module and based on a determination that the received device identity information and the reference device identity information match e.g. based on a determination that correlation of a waveform determined from or indicated by the received device identity information with a waveform determined from or indicated by the reference device identity information available to the detector module causes a threshold to be satisfied generate or activate a control signal for triggering a communication module of the energy limited node to switch from a sleep mode in which the communication module is not operable to communicate with a wireless terminal to an active mode in which the communication module is operable to communicate with the wireless terminal.

Referring again to it will be appreciated that although primarily depicted and described with respect to embodiments in which the CT is carried by a user and is the only cellular terminal operating within the vicinity of the IoT devices various other scenarios and associated embodiments may be supported as discussed further below.

It will be appreciated that although primarily depicted and described with respect to embodiments in which the CT is carried by a user in at least some embodiments the CT or a similar device or a device having similar capabilities may be installed on a vehicle. The CT may then operate as a gateway between IoT devices and CN as discussed above as the vehicle changes location. For example gateways similar to CT may be installed on public transportation vehicles e.g. buses trains or the like for gathering smart city data e.g. capacity of garbage containers parking space availability environmental information or the like as the vehicles move around different portions of the city. For example gateways similar to CT may be installed on private transportation vehicles e.g. incentivizing users to allow installation of such gateways on their vehicles . It will be appreciated that since the IoT devices are expected to use short range wireless communications communication between the IoT devices and gateways mounted on vehicles may be performed at opportunistic times e.g. when buses or cars stop at lights or stop signs when buses or cars are stuck in traffic when trains stop at train stations or the like during which there is sufficient time for short range wireless communications to be used for communication with the IoT devices . This may enable interaction with a much larger set of IoT devices .

It will be appreciated that although primarily depicted and described with respect to embodiments in which the CT is carried by a user in at least some embodiments the CT or a similar device or a device having similar capabilities may be installed at a fixed location. In this case the CT essentially operates as a short range to cellular network gateway and it is at least less likely that communication between IoT devices and CN opportunistic rather in this case communication between IoT devices and CN may be more consistent and predictable.

It will be appreciated that although primarily depicted and described with respect to embodiments in which the CT is the only cellular terminal operating within the area of IoT device it is expected that situations may arise in which multiple CTs are operating within the area of an IoT device . In at least some embodiments interaction between multiple CTs and the IoT device may be coordinated. The coordinated interaction between CTs and the IoT device may include one or more of temporal coordination spatial coordination or the like as well as various combinations thereof.

In at least some embodiments coordinated interaction between the multiple CTs and the IoT device may be supported by using a neighbor discovery capability to enable the multiple CTs to discovery each other and to establish communications so that the multiple CTs may exchange messages in order to synchronize and sequence their actions related to interaction with the IoT device .

In at least some embodiments coordinated interaction between the multiple CTs and the IoT device may be supported using spatial coordination. The spatial coordination may be based on estimated location information e.g. based on GPS triangulation or the like as well as various combinations thereof indicative of estimated relative spatial locations of the CTs . The spatial coordination may be based on channel pathloss estimates which may be used to estimate relative spatial locations of the CTs . The channel pathloss estimates may be determined during neighbor discovery or in any other suitable manner. The channel pathloss estimates may be maintained in a set of pathloss table generated and maintained on the CTs which also may be considered to be a single distributed pathloss table which may be constructed by 1 having each CT transmit a probe signal e.g. WiFi frame or the like including its identifier and its transmit power and 2 having each CT which receives a probe signal update its one hop neighbor table and broadcast the received probe signal. This iterative process results in generation of the pathloss tables of the CTs . The pathloss tables of the CTs may be exchanged and merged to form a local terminal map for the CTs where the local terminal map for the CTs may include information indicative of estimated relative spatial locations of the CTs . It will be appreciated that such estimated location information for the CTs may be determined in a distributed or centralized manner.

In at least some embodiments the coordinated interaction between CTs may include determining an ordered sequence of the CTs which represents the order in which the CTs will attempt to interact with e.g. wake up the IoT device e.g. the first CT in the ordered sequence of the CTs attempts to wake the IoT device if the first CT in the ordered sequence of the CTs fails to wake the IoT device then the second in the ordered sequence of the CTs attempts to wake the IoT device and so forth . As discussed further below the ordering of the ordered sequence of CTs may be based on the likelihood that the CTs will successfully wake the IoT device e.g. based on spatial locations of the CTs relative to the IoT device based on available battery power of the CTs or the like as well as various combinations thereof. The potential basis for the ordering of the ordered sequence of CTs is discussed further below in conjunction with a description of various benefits of using coordination between the CTs for waking and communicating with the IoT device .

In at least some embodiments the coordinated interaction between CTs may reduce interference and collisions. It may be beneficial to avoid the case where multiple CTs attempt to wake up one or more IoT devices simultaneously because if this occurs there is a high probability of interference and collisions. For example if IoT devices and CTs use WiFi technology to communicate it is likely that the hidden terminal problem will occur. A conventional way of mitigating this problem is via control message exchanges e.g. Request to Send RTS Clear to Send CTS however use of such control messages causes a high overhead which is particularly problematic for the energy limited IoT devices . Accordingly in at least some embodiments cooperative communication among CTs e.g. using temporal coordination spatial coordination or the like may be employed in order to avoid this problem. The pairing between CT and an IoT device using cooperative communication among CTs mitigates co channel interference while minimizing device energy consumption.

In at least some embodiments the coordinated interaction between CTs may reduce the number of transmissions. In at least some cases given a choice of CTs which may transmit the wake up signal it may be better to sequence the wake up attempts by the CTs starting from a CT having a highest chance of success down to a CT having a lowest chance of success. For example the ordering of the wake up attempts by the CTs may be based on terminal location information e.g. absolute locations e.g. based on GPS coordinates or relative locations e.g. based on pathloss estimates . It is noted that while the overlapping coverage area between transmissions by CTs may not be known the relative positions of the CTs may be determined and may be used ordering of the wake up attempts by the CTs . The ordering of the wake up attempts by the CTs is this manner is expected to reduce the number of wake up signal transmissions performed in order to wake IoT devices .

In at least some embodiments the coordinated interaction between CTs may be improved or optimized based on spatial coordination. For example the ordering of the wake up attempts by the CTs may be based on spatial locations of the CTs . For convenience consider a set of CTs arranged in a line. In one embodiment an edge CT may transmit a wake up signal first. If no IoT device responds to the wake up signal another edge CT may transmit a wake up signal. If no IoT device responds to the wake up signal a central CT may attempt to wake any IoT device within its wireless coverage range. If no IoT device responds to the wake up signal then any CTs that are midway between the central CT and the edge CTs may transmit wake up signals. The attempts may proceed in this manner until the IoT device is finally awakened. It will be appreciated that while it may be unlikely that the CTs will be arranged along a line the technique may be applied to any spatial arrangement of CTs .
