The present invention relates generally to precision positioning stage systems and more particularly relates to a method and high precision robot arm system.

A traditional way to perform diffraction measurement is to use a diffractometer. In carrying out diffraction measurement using a small focused beam or so called nanodiffraction using a conventional diffractometer faces three major instrument challenges. First rotation motion of the sample typically has a large 10 microns run out error known as a sphere of confusion. Second the circles for the detector are mechanically coupled to the sample causing unwanted displacement of the sample position when the detector is rotated. Third some X ray microscopes used for micro or nanodiffraction use a large vacuum enclosure making it virtually impossible to use a conventional diffractometer.

U.S. Pat. No. 7 331 714 by Deming Shu Jorg M. Maser Barry Lai Stefan Vogt Martin V. Holt Curt A. Preissner Robert P. Winarski and Gregory B. Stephenson entitled Optomechanical Structure for a Multifunctional Hard X Ray Nanoprobe Instrument discloses a multifunctional hard X ray nanoprobe instrument for characterization of nanoscale materials and devices includes a scanning probe mode with a full field transmission mode. The scanning probe mode provides fluorescence spectroscopy and diffraction contrast imaging. The full field transmission mode allows two dimensional 2 D imaging and tomography. The nanoprobe instrument includes zone plate optics for focusing and imaging. The nanoprobe instrument includes a stage group for positioning the zone plate optics. The nanoprobe instrument includes a specimen stage group for positioning the specimen. An enhanced laser Doppler displacement meter LDDM system provides two dimensional differential displacement measurement in a range of nanometer resolution between the zone plate optics and the sample holder. A digital signal processor DSP implements a real time closed loop feedback technique for providing differential vibration control between the zone plate optics and the sample holder.

There are many synchrotron radiation instrument applications that require a very high reproducibility for multidimensional linear positioning systems for example with nanometer resolution. For X ray microdiffraction and nanodiffraction studies precision is a key to success. More precise probes and robotic arms are needed to get better results. Thus it is desirable to provide a method and high precision robot arm system suitable for X ray nanodiffraction with X ray nanoprobe.

These and other objects aspects and advantages of the present disclosure will become better understood with reference to the accompanying description and claims.

In brief a method and high precision robot arm system are provided for example for X ray nanodiffraction with an X ray nanoprobe. The robot arm includes duo vertical stages and a kinematic linkage system. A two dimensional 2D vertical plane ultra precision robot arm supporting an X ray detector provides positioning and manipulating of the X ray detector. A vertical support for the 2D vertical plane robot arm includes spaced apart rails respectively engaging a first bearing structure and a second bearing structure carried by the 2D vertical plane robot arm.

In accordance with features of the invention the robot arm system includes a 3D fast scanning stages group provided with the robot arm.

In accordance with features of the invention the high precision robot arm system enables effective positioning and manipulating of an x ray detector for an X ray nanodiffraction experimental station at a hard X ray nanoprobe HXN beamline. In accordance with features of the invention the robot arm system includes duo vertical stages and a kinematic linkage system providing high load capacity with micron level positioning repeatability.

The following description is provided to enable any person skilled in the an to use the invention and sets forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor for carrying out the invention. Various modifications however will remain readily apparent to those skilled in the art since the principles of the present invention are defined herein specifically to provide a method and high precision robot arm system are provided for example for X ray nanodiffraction with an X ray nanoprobe.

For the X ray microscope for the Hard X ray nanoprobe HXN Beamline at the National Synchrotron Light Source II NSLS II of Brookhaven National Laboratory which is designed for X ray microscopy capabilities with an initial spatial resolution of 10 nm a novel design approach now is taken for nanodiffraction. In the new design the detector positioning system is completely de coupled from the sample stage stack together with the use of a high precision robot arm system in generating full spherical coordinate motions for an array detector. These motion degrees of freedom include the horizontal diffraction angle the vertical diffraction angle and the sample to detector distance called detector distance in the following description. When performing Bragg crystallography adjusting detector distance is important because it defines the maximum range of diffraction angle which contributes to the special resolution limit of the reconstruction.

For example the instrument requirement for the NSLS II HXN beamline is to achieve a horizontal diffraction angular range from 5 to 45 and the sample to detector distance from 0.25 to 0.54 m 0.25 to 1.5 m with base station positioning . The horizontal diffraction angle is produced by using a 2 D horizontal base stage plus an in plane goniometer. The vertical diffraction angle is achieved using a vertical plane robot arm structure of the invention. In addition a 3 D fast scanning stages group of the invention is used to generate the detector distance plus the capability to raster the area detector in order to achieve a larger q range.
