title: Encoding and using information about distributed group discussions
abstract: Techniques are described for analyzing user-supplied information, including to predict future aspects of additional related information that will be supplied by users. The user-supplied information may include distributed group discussions that involve numerous users and occur via user comments and other content items supplied to one or more social networking sites and/or other computer-accessible sites. The analysis of user-supplied information may, for example, include determining particular topics that are of interest for a specified category during one or more periods of time, summarizing and encoding information about multiple selected factors for comments supplied for particular topics or a category during each period of time (such as to quantify an amount of user interest), predicting future values for the selected factors for the topics and category during one or more future period of times, and taking one or more further actions based on the predicted information.

This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 785 411 filed Mar. 14 2013 and entitled Encoding And Using Information About Distributed Group Discussions which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The following disclosure relates generally to techniques for analyzing user supplied information such as to assess distributed group discussions and to predict future aspects of the discussions.

Discussions of current topics of interest by various distributed users are increasingly occurring via social networking sites and other computer accessible sites that are available to the users whether by users replying to and commenting on information supplied by other users or by various users independently submitting information that in aggregate reflects topics of interest. In some situations a particular distributed group discussion may occur between a particular selected subset of users e.g. users that are members of a common group club service etc. while in other situations a distributed group discussion may include any user with access to one or more sites via which that discussion occurs.

Information about discussions that have occurred and or are occurring may have value to various types of entities. However various problems exist with obtaining and disseminating such information in a timely manner including due to the distributed nature of the discussions.

Techniques are described for analyzing user supplied information in various ways including in some embodiments to predict future aspects of additional related information that is expected to be supplied by users such as during one or more future time periods. In at least some embodiments the user supplied information that is analyzed corresponds to distributed group discussions that involve numerous users and occur via user comments made to one or more computer accessible sites such as one or more social networking services. The analysis of user supplied information may in at least some embodiments include determining particular topics that are being discussed for a specified category during one or more periods of time quantifying an amount of user interest in particular topics and the category during the period of time from the discussion and predicting future amounts of user interest in the particular topics and the category as part of an expected future discussion during one or more future period of times. As one illustrative example millions of user Twitter tweets user posts to social networking sites and other user supplied comments or other content items may be analyzed over a prior window of time e.g. the last 72 hours in a real time or near real time manner and changes in information corresponding to particular topics and categories of interest may be automatically predicted for a future span of time e.g. the next 24 hours with various types of further actions then being taken based on the predicted information. Additional details related to analyzing user supplied information in particular manners are described below and some or all of the described techniques are performed in at least some embodiments by automated operations of a Group Discussion Prediction GDP system.

The user comments and other user supplied information that are obtained and analyzed may have various forms in various embodiments such as to reflect information that is supplied by human users and made available to other users. For example the user supplied information may in at least some embodiments include posts and other user submissions to sources of such user supplied information generally referred to as comment data sources herein that include one or more social networking services or sites such as tweets to the Twitter service and or posts to Facebook MySpace Google LinkedIn etc. In addition in at least some embodiments and situations the user supplied information may include comments or other content items submitted to various other types of computer accessible sites that may act as comment data sources such as Instagram Pinterest Flickr Picasa YouTube 43 Things etc. In other embodiments and situations any type of user supplied information that is made available to one or more other users may be analyzed and used including in text form audio form and or video form such as user emails SMS Short Message Service messages Internet chat messages telephone voice messages and other audio recordings video recordings search engine searches news articles and other news releases commerce related submissions e.g. user wish lists or gift registries user shopping carts etc. Wiki based submissions e.g. to Wikipedia etc. and is generally referred to herein as a user supplied comment or user comment. 

By gathering such user supplied information during one or more time periods of interest information may be assessed about distributed group discussions that occur during those time periods including for discussions in which users actively review and respond to comments of others and more generally for discussions that occur via various user comments that each reflects independent thoughts or opinions of a user that is not in response to any other particular user comment of another user. Such assessed information may correspond to one or more selected factors about one or more distributed group discussions including one or more of the following factors for user comments or other content items being supplied with respect to one or more topics of interest a quantity of user comments or other content items for the topic s that are supplied during a time period or another measure of distributed user interest in those topics rather than content item quantity subsets of such an overall quantity or other measure of distributed user interest supplied during a time period for the topic s that are associated with particular geographic locations or geographic areas and or with particular author users and or with particular content item data sources changes in assessed values for one or more such factors between two or more time periods etc. In addition such assessed information corresponding to one or more selected factors for the topic s may be used to predict future information about user comments or other content items that will be supplied for the topic s such as predicted future values for a particular one or more of the selected factors for each of one or more future time periods or instead for other types of predicted future information. Additional details related to assessing values for factors of interest and using such information to make corresponding predictions are included below.

In some embodiments the predictions of future information e.g. about user comments or other content items that will be supplied with respect to one or more topics of interest during one or more future time periods involves for each of multiple time periods determining summarizing and encoding information about multiple selected factors for the content items supplied for the topic s during the time period. The encoded summary information for the multiple time periods during a time window of interest is then aggregated such an aggregation may include for example a succession of the encoded summary information for the selected factors for each of multiple successive time periods during the time window. Such aggregated encoded summary information may then be used in various manners including to predict future information for related future groups of content items such as with respect to one or more of the selected factors. In at least some embodiments such prediction may include matching such aggregated encoded summary information to a prediction template that similarly includes encoded summary information for multiple prior time periods for some or all of the same selected factors and then using an additional portion of encoded summary information for that prediction template e.g. for later time periods to enable the prediction while in other embodiments such prediction may be performed in other manners e.g. for each selected factor having summarized values for multiple successive time periods during the time window doing a trend analysis on those summarized values in order to predict future summarized values for that selected factor for one or more future time periods . Additional details related to such encoding of summary information and use of encoded summary information for prediction purposes is included herein including with respect to .

As part of the operation of the GDP service it may further analyze the user supplied content items to identify particular topics and other attributes of the content items and to store corresponding information . The content item information and topics information may further be used to create corresponding comment groups and to store corresponding information . The GDP service may also use the comment group information to determine particular topics that are associated with a particular category during one or more periods of time such as based on the created comment groups associated with those topics and then store corresponding category information . The GDP service may further quantify the user supplied content items included in a particular comment group and or associated with a particular category and use such information for one or more time periods to predict expected additional content items that will be received over one or more later time periods with corresponding information being stored with the comment group information and or the category information in some embodiments the quantified information for one or more of the comment groups and or categories about constituent content items for a time period may include encoded summary information for that time period such as with respect to one or more encoding schemes specified in the comment group encoding information . As part of performing the prediction the GDP service may use one or more defined prediction templates from information and may further generate and store such prediction templates for later use based on actual content items that are received in some embodiments the prediction template information may include an aggregation of encoded summary information for constituent content items that are part of a comment group and or category for each of multiple time periods e.g. consecutive time periods during a time window of interest such as to be matched to aggregated encoded summary information from the comment group information and or the category information . In addition the GDP service may further take a variety of types of automated actions based on analyzed and or predicted information such as in accordance with client instructions or other client specified criteria. Additional details related to operation of the GDP service in particular embodiments are included herein.

The one or more networks may for example be a publicly accessible network of linked networks possibly operated by various distinct parties such as the Internet. In other embodiments at least one of the network s may be a private network such as for example a corporate or university network that is wholly or partially inaccessible to non privileged users. In still other embodiments at least one of the network s may include one or more private networks with access to and or from the Internet. In the illustrated embodiment the GDP service may include one or more modules that perform particular operations as discussed in greater detail with respect to and the GDP service and any such modules may each include software instructions that execute on one or more computing systems not shown to configure those computing systems to perform some or all of the described techniques.

Thus user supplied information of interest may be obtained in various manners in various embodiments including by the GDP service or system accessing a particular comment data source to retrieve information from that comment data source e.g. periodically when the data is needed for analysis etc. . For example a GDP service may obtain information from a particular comment data source in various manners such as via an API application programming interface provided by that data source by retrieving information stored in a database or other storage mechanism by scraping one or more Web pages of a Web site provided by the comment data source etc. The GDP service may further obtain some or all of the available data from a particular comment data source such as for one or more particular users and or time periods for all users and or time periods for users and or information that meet specified criteria e.g. publicly available information that does not have privacy restrictions etc. In other embodiments and situations at least some comment data sources may perform actions to supply at least some user supplied information to the GDP service such as in response to one or more prior requests of the GDP service e.g. via an RSS or Really Simple Syndication feed or other subscription request of the GDP service . In addition in some embodiments and situations at least some user supplied comments may be received directly from a user that supplied them to one or more comment data sources such as if a mobile application executing on a client device of the user also sends the comments to the GDP service. Furthermore in some embodiments and situations information that was initially supplied to one or more comment data sources may be available to the GDP service from another source such as from an aggregator service that combines information from multiple comment data sources. In other embodiments other types of user supplied information may be obtained and or other types of comment data sources may be used and additional details are included below about obtaining user supplied information of interest to analyze.

Once user supplied information has been obtained for a particular time period the user supplied information may be analyzed in various manners. In some embodiments the analysis includes analyzing user comments or other user supplied content items to create corresponding comment groups for the time period. For example each user supplied content item may be analyzed to identify any topics of interest in the content such as terms or phrases hashtags links to other data or other n grams and optionally for topics that are determined to be of sufficient importance or relevance to the content item e.g. by using a TF IDF or term frequency inverse document frequency analysis or other content analysis technique . In addition each user supplied content item may be analyzed to identify any other types of attributes of interest that are associated with the content item e.g. in the contents of the content item in metadata associated with the content item etc. such as a location of where the content item was submitted from an author user who generated or otherwise supplied the content item a comment data source from which the content item was obtained any n grams from metadata associated with the content item etc. After topics or other attributes of interest are identified a comment group is created for each such topic or other attribute or for a selected subset such as to reflect a percentage or fixed quantity of the most relevant topics or other attributes for a time period with the created comment group including any analyzed content items from the time period that include the associated attribute for the comment group. In addition in at least some embodiments if additional user supplied content items are available that were not used in the initial analysis e.g. from one or more additional or supplemental comment data sources additional such user supplied content items that were supplied during the time period are retrieved and additional content items that include the topic or other associated attribute for each created comment group are added to that comment group. Thus each created comment group may be considered to represent its associated topic or other associated attribute for that time period. In other embodiments information about content items may be analyzed and grouped in other manners and additional details are included below about analyzing user comments or other user supplied content items to create corresponding comment groups for a time period.

The analysis of user supplied information for a time period may also include determining current topics that correspond to a particular content category for the time period. For example a definition for a category of interest may be supplied or otherwise determined such as to include one or more terms or other attributes corresponding to the category. User supplied content items for the time period that include one or more of the definition terms or other definition attributes for the category are then identified e.g. content items having one of the definition attributes or all of the definition attributes or a minimum defined quantity or percentage of the definition attributes and the created comment groups to which those identified content items belong are then determined with those determined comment groups being candidates to be associated with the content category for the time period. At least some of the determined comment groups are then excluded in some embodiments and situations such as to remove comment groups that are under inclusive or over inclusive with respect to the subject matter relevant to the content category. The topics or other attributes associated with the remaining determined comment groups may then be identified as being the current topics for the content category during the time period. In at least some embodiments the determination of candidate comment groups to exclude includes determining for each candidate comment group the frequency that its included user supplied content items are in the identified content items for the content category. An average frequency and a standard deviation may then be determined across the candidate comment groups and used to establish lower and or upper boundaries for the content category such as to define a minimum exclusion threshold that is the average frequency minus half the standard deviation and or to define a maximum exclusion threshold that is the average frequency plus half the standard deviation. In other embodiments comment groups to include for a content category may be determined in manners other than based on frequency of included user supplied content items and additional details are included below about determining current topics that correspond to a particular content category for a time period.

The analysis of user supplied information for a time period may further include predicting information about expected additional content items that will be supplied by users for a comment group and or content category such as during each of one or more future time periods of interest. For example the analysis may include quantifying information about the user supplied content items included in the comment group and or associated with the content category for the time period such as based on a quantity of such user supplied content items or more generally for each of one or more selected factors of interest. In some situations the quantification is further performed for particular subsets of the user supplied content items included in the comment group and or associated with the content category for the time period such as to correspond to an intersection of that comment group and or content category with a particular geographical location for those content items supplied from each of one or more geographical locations to correspond to an intersection of that comment group and or content category with a particular author user for those content items supplied by each of one or more author users to correspond to an intersection of that comment group and or content category with a particular comment data source for those content items supplied to each of one or more comment data sources etc. Such quantification information for the constituent content items supplied during the time period may then be combined with other corresponding quantification information for other related time periods such as for all of the time periods during a sliding time window of interest e.g. for every 30 minute time period during a 72 hour time window and used to generate a histogram or other aggregation of that combined quantification information. In some embodiments the quantification of information for a time period includes summarizing and encoding information about multiple selected factors for the constituent content items supplied during the time period and the aggregation of that combined quantification information that is generated for multiple time periods during a time window of interest includes a succession of the encoded summary information for the selected factors for each of multiple successive time periods during the time window. The aggregated quantification information may then be used to generate predicted information about expected additional content items that will be supplied by users for the comment group or content category or particular intersection corresponding to the aggregated quantification information such as with respect to one or more of the selected factors that are quantified and optionally summarized and encoded.

For example a non exclusive list of types of information that may be predicted with respect to a corresponding selected factor for a comment group and or a category include the following a predicted amount or change in total quantity of the comments included in the comment group and or associated with the category or particular intersection in one or more future time periods a predicted direction of increase or decrease in the quantity of the comments included in the comment group and or associated with the category or particular intersection in one or more future time periods a predicted change in which topics or other attributes will be associated with the category in one or more future time periods a predicted amount or change of influence of one or more author users who supply content items included in the comment group and or associated with the category or particular intersection in one or more future time periods a predicted amount or change of one or more types of sentiment in the content items included in the comment group and or associated with the category or particular intersection in one or more future time periods a predicted amount or change of comments from one or more geographical locations that are included in the comment group and or associated with the category or particular intersection in one or more future time periods a predicted direction of increase or decrease in the quantity of the comments from one or more geographical locations that are included in the comment group and or associated with the category or particular intersection in one or more future time periods a predicted amount or change of comments from one or more comment data sources that are included in the comment group and or associated with the category or particular intersection in one or more future time periods a predicted direction of increase or decrease in the quantity of the comments from one or more data sources that are included in the comment group and or associated with the category or particular intersection in one or more future time periods etc.

In some embodiments and situations the generating of the prediction information includes performing trend prediction based on the aggregated quantification information for a comment group and or category or particular intersection such as by doing a 2degree polynomial least squares fit to the quantification information in the generated histogram or other aggregation e.g. using weighting to reflect time and or one or more other factors for the quantification information in the generated histogram or other aggregation and using the resulting trend line to determine the predicted information. In other embodiments and situations the generating of the prediction information includes matching a generated histogram or aggregation of encoded summary information or other quantification aggregation to a portion of a defined prediction template e.g. to an initial subset of an additional histogram that is based on quantified information for prior actual user supplied content items that have been received and using an additional portion of the defined prediction template e.g. a later subset of the additional histogram a later portion of the aggregation of encoded summary information etc. to indicate the predicted information. In other embodiments other types of information may be quantified and used to generate prediction information for a comment group and or content category or particular intersection and additional details are included below about predicting information about expected additional content items that will be supplied by users for a comment group and or content category or particular intersection .

The analysis of user supplied information for a time period may further include generating a prediction template that reflects actual user supplied content items that are received over time for a comment group and or content category such as for later use in predicting information about expected additional content items that will be supplied by users. For example a histogram or aggregation of encoded summary information or other aggregation of quantification information that is generated to reflect user supplied content items received for a comment group and or a content category or particular intersection may be analyzed to determine if the histogram or aggregation of encoded summary information or other quantification aggregation is successful in predicting other expected content items that will be received in other situations. In addition or alternatively trend prediction information that is generated based on a generated histogram or aggregation of encoded summary information or other quantification aggregation for a comment group and or a content category may be analyzed to determine if the corresponding predicted information reflects later user supplied content items that are actually received for the comment group or content category. When a generated histogram or aggregation of encoded summary information or other quantification aggregation and or corresponding trend prediction information is found to be successful in predicting other user supplied content items it may be put into use as a prediction template in predicting additional future user supplied content items that will be received such as to further evaluate its performance. In other embodiments prediction templates may be generated in other manners and additional details are included below about generating a prediction template for later use in predicting information about expected additional content items that will be supplied by users.

After the analysis of user supplied information for one or more time periods is performed various types of resulting automated actions may be taken such as based on analyzed information about the user supplied content items that have already been received and or based on predictions about additional user supplied content items that are expected to be received. For example information from the analysis may be provided to one or more clients of the GDP service such as users or other entities who pay fees to receive information about specified content categories of interest. In addition in some embodiments and situations information from the analysis is used by the GDP service to take automated actions to supply additional content items that correspond to a comment group or category of interest e.g. additional comments that are generated by the GDP service and made available to users or to otherwise supply information corresponding to the comment group or category e.g. initiating or changing related Internet based advertising or other advertising optionally in accordance with instructions or other criteria specified by one or more clients of the GDP service such additional information may in some situations alter or otherwise affect future direction of a particular distributed group discussion such as by including additional supplemental information to further support particular topics and conversations by including additional information to refute or otherwise alter a discussion about particular topics etc. In other embodiments various other types of actions may be taken by the GDP service in appropriate circumstances and additional details are included below about taking automated actions based on information generated from the analysis of user supplied information for one or more time periods.

In addition other types of analysis of user supplied information for one or more time periods may be performed in at least some embodiments such as to generate additional types of information related to distributed group discussions. As a first example information about users who supply content items in one or more comment groups and or associated with one or more categories during one or more time periods may be analyzed such as to determine particular author users who have a high or low amount of influence within the comment groups or categories e.g. relative to other author users for the same or other comment groups and or categories such as to be able to direct how a discussion evolves or changes. As a second example information about content items in one or more comment groups and or associated with one or more categories during one or more time periods may be analyzed such as to perform a sentiment analysis with respect to contents of the content items e.g. by using term symbol list matching topic decomposition and subspace projection Bayesian classification or other classification techniques such as using training data from human annotated sentiment assignments of particular user comments etc. . Such additional types of discussion related information for one or more comment groups and or one or more categories over one or more time periods may be used in various manners including to encode summary information about one or more such additional types of discussion related information for one or more corresponding selected factors to take some or all of the same types of automated actions as discussed above or instead to take other types of automated actions. In other embodiments various other types of analyses may be performed by the GDP service to generate various other types of additional discussion related information and additional details are included below about performing analyses with respect to author user influence and or sentiment analysis.

For illustrative purposes some embodiments are described below in which specific types of user supplied information is analyzed to provide particular types of resulting information related to distributed group discussions in specific ways including to predict various types of information about expected future user supplied information that will be received. However it will be understood that such information related to distributed group discussions may be generated in other manners and using other types of input data in other embodiments that the described techniques may be used in a wide variety of other situations for other types of data that other types of information related to distributed group discussions may similarly be generated and used in various ways and that the invention is thus not limited to the exemplary details provided.

In particular illustrates several example user comments along with information about some corresponding initial comment groups that may be created based at least in part on these user comments. In this example the user comments include comments supplied by different users to a single comment data source referred to in this example as comment data source XXX such as the Twitter social networking service although user supplied information from multiple sources may be obtained and analyzed when creating initial comment groups in some embodiments. In addition in this example the illustrated user comments are submitted during a single time period e.g. within a 30 minute time period although particular timing information is not illustrated.

In particular in this example a first user comment is shown which includes various metadata and other content which in this example includes a title and accompanying textual content . The metadata that is available to the GDP service in this example includes an author user name an author user source specific identifier information about a geographical location from which the comment was supplied and information about the comment data source to which the user comment was supplied at least some such information may not be displayed to other users however such as the geographical location information and or the comment data source information . In this example an analysis of the user comment may identify a variety of topics or other attributes that may be used for subsequent analysis including in some embodiments and situations to treat each word or phrase in the contents as a topic and to include each of the indicated types of metadata information and as a comment attribute. Examples of topics that may be used from the comment s contents include words in the title e.g. republican words in the content body e.g. president Obama are the etc. and phrases e.g. debt limit . In other embodiments a subset of the words phrases and other attributes may be selected using one or more of a variety of types of information analysis techniques such as to eliminate words that are too common to be useful in identifying the subject matter of the comment e.g. the of etc. and to ignore differences in capitalization hyphenation stemming etc.

The user comments and similarly include metadata and other contents and include various types of information that may be used as topics or other attributes for those comments. For example user comment includes the term Obama in a manner similar to term of comment as well as various other terms e.g. eagle and 10860 . Comment is also illustrated as including two in line metadata hashtags that may be used as topics for the comment which in this example are OvalOffice and Obama . In some embodiments and situations terms such as Obama and Obama may be grouped together and treated as the same topic while in the illustrated embodiment the terms are handled separately. User comment similarly includes various terms which in this example includes a user selectable link e.g. an HTML hyperlink in some embodiments such links and or associated metadata for the links e.g. terms that are included as part of the link tags or other metadata associated with the link etc. may be used as topics and in some embodiments contents of such a link may be retrieved and analyzed for use as contents and or metadata of user comment in a manner similar to other inline contents while in other embodiments one or more both such types of information may not be used. In some embodiments a user comment may further have additional information supplied by other users that may similarly be used as a topic or attribute for the comment e.g. hashtags such as president or gunny other types of tags such as funny or like or useful or etc. although such types of additional information are not illustrated in this example. It will be appreciated that the identification of topics or other attributes for one or more user comments may be performed in a variety of manners in various embodiments. For example in some embodiments the analysis is performed in a language neutral manner e.g. when extracting n grams from the contents of a user comment and thus the user comments may include comments in multiple languages in some such embodiments translation capabilities may further be employed to translate at least some user comments into one or more target languages before the identification of topics or other attributes for those user comments. As one non exclusive example of a particular set of techniques for identifying at least some topics or other attributes for at least some user comments the following steps may be employed n grams are extracted from comment title and body text by first converting the text to a collection of n grams e.g. bi grams or tri grams the n grams containing predefined common words in at least some positions are removed from consideration a most significant set of X n grams are then selected based on scoring e.g. via a pointwise mutual information or PMI algorithm with X being a configurable predefined number or otherwise being determined based on the available data e.g. a specified percentage and changes in significance of the n grams are tracked as more comments containing them are identified.

After the topics and other attributes are identified for a variety of user comments being analyzed comments groups may be created for each of some or all of the topics and other attributes. A few example comment groups are illustrated along with information about particular example comments included in each comment group. For example the President comment group is based on the term president and includes at least comments and since those comments include terms and respectively that match the term but does not include comment in this example despite its contents being related to the president of the United States since the term president is not included in comment . Comment groups and correspond to the terms Obama and Obama respectively and the comment group based on the term the reflects that most or all comments may include such common terms. Comment groups and provide examples of comment groups corresponding to comment attributes that may be from metadata rather than contents of at least some user comments such as for comment group corresponding to a particular geographical location in this example the city of Philadelphia and including any comments supplied from that geographical location with other comment groups not shown corresponding to other geographical locations and for comment group corresponding to a particular author user in this example user Andy Jones and including any comments supplied by that author user with other comment groups not shown corresponding to other author users . It will be appreciated that geographical locations and users may be represented in a variety of manners in various embodiments including at differing degrees of specificity e.g. to represent geographical locations by individual addresses GPS coordinates neighborhoods cities regions counties states countries etc. and to represent users via legal names source specific login names or screen names or other identifiers numeric or other unique identifiers etc. . While not illustrated here comment groups may also be created for each of multiple distinct comment data sources to include comments supplied to those comment data sources.

In the example of additional user comments are obtained from two additional comment data sources referred to in this example as comment data source YYY as shown in information and comment data source ZZZ as shown in information . For example comment data source YYY may include primarily textual comments in a manner similar to that comment data source XXX e.g. posts to the Facebook social networking service while the comment data source ZZZ may include primarily non textual comments that include some textual tags or other commentary e.g. images posted to the Pinterest or Instagram social networking sites . Various other types of comments and content items may be analyzed in other embodiments as discussed in greater detail elsewhere.

In this example the additional user comment from comment data source YYY includes an additional comment from author user Andy Jones who also supplied comment of although the metadata available to the GDP service from comment data source YYY does not include geographical location information or a source specific identifier. Nonetheless if the GDP service is able to identify the two users as the same person such as by creating maintaining and using a mapping between different identifiers for a particular user the Andy Jones comment group is modified to include this comment as shown in the modified comment group information of alternatively in some embodiments such a comment would be added to the comment group without attempting to verify a common identity such as based on the author name matching for both comments. Comment is also added to the Obama comment group based on its inclusion of a Obama hashtag in its comments.

Additional user comment from comment data source ZZZ includes a photo and related supplementary text and is added to the Obama comment group based on the term being included in the textual commentary and the Philadelphia geographical location comment group based on geographical location information for the comment . While not illustrated here in some embodiments an analysis of data in a user comment may be performed to identify additional attributes that may be used to associate the user comment with one or more appropriate comment groups. For example with respect to the example user comment an image recognition process and or other analysis of the photo may be performed to identify additional metadata attributes e.g. based on identified objects people locations etc. for the user comment illustrative examples include the following to recognize President Obama within the photo and thus associate the user comment with comment group even if the provided commentary was absent to recognize Washington D.C. or the Capitol building from the photo and associate the user comment with corresponding comment groups to examine location and time metadata embedded in the photo or otherwise associated with the photo and use the location data to associate the user comment with a corresponding comment group etc. In some embodiments a comment group will include both comments that are supplied from the geographical location of Philadelphia and comments that include the term Philadelphia in the contents or other attributes of the comment while in other embodiments the comment group will only include comments that are supplied from the geographical location of Philadelphia. The modified comment group information further illustrates an example of a data source comment group in this example which corresponds to comment data source XXX although such a comment group would not be modified in this supplemental operation in this example since the additional user comments are not from the comment data source XXX. In addition if new topics or attributes are included in the additional user comments that were not present in the initially analyzed user comments e.g. comments from author user Jenny Smith new comment groups may be created for such new topics or attributes in some embodiments while in other embodiments such new comment groups will not be created.

After the matching user comments are associated with a category in section all of the created comment groups to which those matching user comments belong are then identified as shown in part in section for the President Obama category. It will be appreciated that each user comment may be associated with multiple comment groups and thus a large number of comment groups may be initially identified for a category. In the example of section the identified comment groups are then analyzed to determine their relevance to the associated user comments shown in section . In particular in this example the frequency is determined for each identified comment group that the associated user comments in section are included within that comment group. As an example information illustrates that 10 000 user comments have been identified as being associated with the President Obama category in section although only a small fraction are shown in section . Using the The comment group discussed in as an example of the 10 000 user comments that are associated with the President Obama category in section almost all of those associated user comments include the term the and are thus included in the The comment group. In this example the identified comment groups for the President Obama category are listed in section in order of decreasing frequency with the The comment group having the highest listed frequency and a Chip Kelly comment group having a lowest listed frequency of 5 comments of the 10 000 associated user comments. For example user comment of represents one of those 5 comments since it includes the terms Chip Kelly and president causing it to be included in the associated user comments in section but to have only 4 other comments in this time period that included both Chip Kelly and one of the category definition terms as topics or other attributes of those user comments.

Additional processing is then performed to select a subset of the identified comment groups as being associated with the President Obama category for this time period. In particular as shown in information an average frequency is determined for the identified comment groups and frequency based minimum and maximum inclusion thresholds are determined based in part on the average frequency. As one example the standard deviation not shown may be further determined for the frequency values and the minimum and maximum inclusion thresholds may be determined based in part on the standard deviation. In this example the lines and in section denote the lines for the maximum and minimum inclusion thresholds respectively. Accordingly a term such as the is excluded in this example as being too ubiquitous or general for the category and a term such as Chip Kelly is excluded as being too rare or specific or irrelevant for the category. The topics or other attributes of the remaining identified comment groups may then be identified as topics that are relevant to the President Obama category for this time period including topics such as Obama President democrat inauguration debt limit and republican as well as geographical location attributes Washington D.C. and Chicago while no author user attributes or comment data source attributes are illustrated in this example it will be appreciated that such attributes may similarly be identified and included. It will further be appreciated that some of the identified topics for this category may be fairly constant over different time periods e.g. President and democrat while other identified topics may change over time to reflect subject matter that is or is not of sufficient current interest at a given time e.g. such that inauguration and or debt limit may not be included in this category during some time periods .

While such quantified information may be of use to reflect recent events and status such quantified information may further be used to predict information about additional user comments that are expected to be received including changes with respect to topics that are part of a category and or changes with respect to how many when where and by whom that expected future user comments will be received for a particular comment group or content category. further illustrates one example of how such prediction may be performed based on the histogram graph which involves matching the histogram graph to a defined prediction template . The prediction template may for example be one of multiple defined prediction templates that are available to be used with some or all such defined prediction templates being based at least in part on prior actual user comments have been received. In particular in this example a portion of the histogram graph is matched to a corresponding portion of a prediction histogram that is part of the template such matching may be performed in various manners such as by measuring differences for values for corresponding time periods in the two histograms being compared or more generally using techniques to compare two curves or other shapes. It will be appreciated that the matching of a histogram graph to a prediction template may be performed in a variety of manners in various embodiments. A non exclusive list of techniques that may be used as part of the matching includes the following root mean square RMS error or deviation vector inner product absolute difference information theoretic measures e.g. the Kullback Leibler divergence etc. In addition in some embodiments the prediction templates are selected in a manner that is not specific to particular categories and or comment groups such as to instead identify and use patterns over time that are repeatedly observed across comment groups and or categories e.g. by promoting and using the prediction templates that are successful over time while decreasing and removing the use of prediction templates that are not successful . Furthermore in some embodiments and situations a histogram template of a given length of time e.g. 72 hours with data points for each time period of interest e.g. 30 minutes may consider one or more prediction templates with respect to each data point e.g. with each such prediction template being for the same given length of time .

Based on the match to portion of prediction template some or all of the additional portion of the prediction template may be used to predict additional expected future comments that will be received for the comment group or category represented by histogram graph such as after any appropriate scaling is performed. In particular in this example the additional portion of the prediction template may be used to predict that the quantity of user comments will continue to fall for five more time periods and to then level off for about eight additional time periods after which the quantity will rise again somewhat before gradually decreasing. It will be appreciated that a variety of types of shapes may be represented by prediction templates in a variety of manners such as to reflect a variety of types of distributed group behavior related to an underlying discussion that is occurring.

By generating such quantified information for each determined comment group for a content category and by predicting additional corresponding information for each such comment group a variety of types of information may be determined for the content category. As one example if the quantity of comments that are predicted to occur for a first comment group decreases sufficiently while the comments that are predicted to occur for a second comment group increases the increasing influence of the topic for the second comment group to the content category may be determined. In addition the time at which a particular topic will stop and or start being a sufficiently relevant topic for a content category may be predicted. Based on such information the GDP service or a client that receives such information may be able to take various types of corresponding actions such as to reduce or stop activities related to topics that are losing relevance to increase or start activities to try to increase interest in a topic of importance that is otherwise losing relevance to target additional activities related to topics that are increasing in relevance etc. In addition when such quantified information is generated for geographical location attributes comment data source attributes and or author user attributes that are determined topics for a content category and when additional corresponding expected future information is predicted for such attribute based comment groups a variety of additional types of information may be determined for the content category. For example not only can relative differences be determined in the relevance of different topics to a category but such differences can similarly be tracked and predicted across different geographical areas e.g. this topic is increasing in relevance in location A but remaining constant in location B different comment data sources and or different author users. Differences across other types of attributes may similarly be tracked and predicted and such information about attribute based comment groups may similarly be used by the GDP service or a client that receives such information to take various types of corresponding actions.

In addition to using a trend line prediction to generate prediction information for future time periods the same or similar types of trend line prediction information may be used to assist in generating new defined prediction templates. For example considering the histogram graph various portions of the histogram graph may be selected for additional analysis such as the last 24 hours the portion labeled 72 that includes histogram data the last 48 hours the portions labeled 48 and 72 that include histogram data the first 24 hours the portion labeled 24 that includes histogram data the first 48 hours the portions labeled 24 and 48 that include histogram data etc. For each such portion of the histogram a prediction trend line may be generated based on the data in that portion and the subsequent portions of data about actual user comments may be used to determine if the prediction trend line accurately predicted information about those actual user comments. If the prediction trend line for a portion of the histogram does accurately predict such information that portion of the histogram may be selected to be used or evaluated as a prediction template for performing future predictions and or that portion of the histogram plus the later actual matching predicted data may be selected for use as such a prediction template. In the example of a prediction trend line has been generated to correspond to the portion of the histogram for the first 24 hours a prediction trend line has been generated to correspond to the portion of the histogram for the second 24 hours and a prediction trend line has been generated to correspond to the portion of the histogram for the third or last 24 hours although neither of the prediction trend lines and appear to accurately predict data for the next 24 hour period in this example. When evaluating a prediction trend line that uses the most recent actual data e.g. trend lines or the evaluation based on actual data may be deferred until a future time when that actual data is available such as after an additional 24 hours have passed. It will be appreciated that such matching of a predicted trend line to actual user comment data may be performed in various manners such as by measuring differences for values for one or more time periods between the predicted values and the actual values or more generally using techniques to compare two curves or other shapes. It will also be appreciated that the matching of a trend line to a histogram graph may be performed in a variety of manners in various embodiments including in some embodiments to use techniques similar to those previously described with respect to matching histogram graphs and prediction templates.

In particular illustrates an example of various types of information that may be quantified for an example comment group or other group of related content items . An example table is illustrated in with each of the rows corresponding to a different successive time period e.g. successive 30 minute time periods and including various types of quantified information for the example comment group during that time period. In this example the types of quantified information include a total quantity of content items smaller quantities that represent a subset of the total quantity of content items at each of multiple different geographical locations of interest other smaller quantities that represent a subset of the total quantity of content items supplied via each of multiple different data sources other smaller quantities that represent a subset of the total quantity of content items supplied by each of multiple different author users information to indicate an assessed aggregate sentiment for the comment group e.g. using an automated sentiment analysis and information to indicate an assessed most influential author for the comment group it will be appreciated that various other types of information may be quantified in some embodiments whether instead of or in addition to the illustrated types of quantified information.

A comparison or other analysis of the quantified information in the table provides various information about the changes of the quantified information over time including the following non exclusive examples a change in total quantity of content items over successive time periods such as may be measured in an absolute number or percentage change e.g. to determine that the total quantity increases in amount by approximately the same quantity between each of the first four time periods which are time period N through time period N 3 as shown in rows but the increase slows in time period N 4 changes between different geographical locations over time e.g. to reflect that location 1 initially has much larger quantities than location 2 but that the quantities for location 1 begin to decrease in time period N 2 while the quantities continue to grow for location 2 until time period N 3 and surpass the quantities for location 1 in time period N 2 changes between different data sources over time e.g. to reflect that data source 1 initially has much larger quantities than data source 2 but that the quantities for data source 1 begin to decrease in time period N 2 while the quantities continue to grow for data source 2 until time period N 3 and surpass the quantities for data source 1 in time period N 3 changes between different author users over time e.g. to reflect that author user 1 initially supplies larger quantities than author user 2 but that the quantities for author user 1 begin to decrease in time period N 2 while the quantities continue to grow for author user 2 until time period N 3 and surpass the quantities for author user 1 in time period N 3 changes in aggregate user sentiment such as to reflect that user sentiment changes from positive with value 3 to neutral with value 2 in time period N 3 and to negative with value 1 in time period N 5 changes in the most influential author user such as to reflect that author user 1 continues to be the most influential in time period N 3 despite not supplying the most content items during that time period and that author user 2 surpasses author user 1 as the most influential in time period N 4 etc. It will be appreciated that various other types of information may be determined in some embodiments from analyses of quantified information whether instead of or in addition to the discussed types of information.

Furthermore prediction template 3 reference number illustrates that different prediction templates may include different amounts of data for the additional portions such as if prediction templates 1 and 2 are used to predict future information for up to 6 future time periods and prediction template 3 is used to predict future information for an additional number of future time periods e.g. up to 24 up to 48 up to 72 up to 144 etc. in other embodiments all of the prediction templates may include the same amounts of data for the additional portions but different subsets of the additional portion data may be selected and used e.g. if the additional portion includes data for 144 time periods but at times only the next six time periods may be selected and used . In addition prediction template 4 reference number illustrates that different prediction templates may include summary data that is encoded using different encoding schemes such as to include an initial portion and additional portion whose summary data is encoded using encoding scheme 2.

The initial portions of one or more of the prediction templates may be matched to the aggregation in various manners in various embodiments in this example matching information is illustrated for prediction templates 1 and 2 using a bitwise comparison with a binary yes or no determination of a match. Thus in comparing the first encoded summary value 25313 of the aggregation to the first encoded summary value 23276 of the initial portion of prediction template 1 a matching value of YY results with Y representing a binary yes and representing a binary no based on the initial 2 of each of the values matching the next 5 of each of the values matching the next 3 of the aggregation not matching the next 2 of the prediction template the next 1 of the aggregation not matching the next 7 of the prediction template and the next 3 of the aggregation not matching the next 6 of the prediction template. Similar matching values are shown for the remaining part of the initial portion of prediction template 1 as well as for the initial portion of prediction template 2. In other embodiments a degree of match between two pieces of encoded summary information may be made in manners other than a binary yes or no e.g. for a selected factor whose values are enumerated with multiple numerical values to determine a numerical difference between two values .

Given multiple candidate prediction templates such as prediction templates 1 and 2 a best match to the aggregation may be determined in various manners in various embodiments. In some embodiments the overall degree of match between the entire aggregation and the entire initial portion may be used which in this example results in prediction template 2 being a better match to aggregation than prediction template 1 in particular prediction template 2 has a 70 degree of overall match 21 matches out of 30 possible values while prediction template 1 has only a 33 degree of overall match 10 matches out of 30 possible values . If prediction template 2 is selected e.g. based on being the best match based on having a degree of match above a defined threshold such as 65 etc. some or all of the additional portion of prediction template 2 may be used to predict future information for one or more of the selected factors represented by encoding scheme 1 as discussed in greater detail with respect to .

In other embodiments the degree of match between a subset of the aggregation and a subset of a prediction template s initial portion may instead be assessed. For example encoding scheme 1 includes information about 5 selected factors but only 1 factor may currently be of interest such as factor a discussed in corresponding to total quantity information. If so only the subset of each encoded summary value that corresponds to that selected factor may be considered which in this example is the first value encoded for each time period using such a comparison in this example prediction template 1 is a better match than prediction template 2 as prediction template 1 has a 100 degree of match for factor a between the six time periods of the aggregation and of the initial portion of prediction template 1 6 matches out of 6 possible while prediction template 2 has only a 50 degree of match for factor a 3 matches out of 6 . If prediction template 1 is selected for use with respect to factor a some or all of the additional portion of prediction template 1 that corresponds to factor a may be used to predict future information for that selected factor as is also discussed in greater detail with respect to . In addition in some embodiments prediction templates may be discarded from consideration if they do not have the same encoding scheme as a current aggregation or if a subset of 1 or more particular factors are being individually considered if the encoding schemes used by the discarded prediction templates do not also use those 1 or more particular factors along with the same or compatible data summarization value quantification rules such as to discard at least template X in the example of and in some embodiments an encoding scheme to use may be selected based at least in part on available prediction templates e.g. to use encoding scheme 1 of because multiple available prediction templates use that encoding scheme such as templates 1 and 2 of .

Based on prediction template 2 of being selected as the best overall match to the aggregation the columns illustrate the values from the encoded summary information shown for the additional portion of prediction template 2 for each of the six successive time periods. Thus with respect to column corresponding to factor a rows illustrate the encoded summary information for the total quantity information in time periods N through N 5 corresponding to encoded versions of the quantification information in column and rows of and rows illustrate the encoded summary information for the total quantity information that is predicted for future time periods N 6 through N 11 based on the corresponding values in the additional portion of prediction template 2. Accordingly the values in column for rows represent predictions for the total quantity of content items in the example comment group that will be supplied during each of the next six time periods based on prediction template 2. In a similar manner the information in columns for rows illustrate predictions for the values corresponding to the other 4 selected factors represented in encoding scheme 1 for each of the next six time periods based on prediction template 2.

The information for column corresponding to factor a and for rows illustrate alternative predicted information that may be generated with respect to the next six time periods for the total quantity of content items in the example comment group. In particular if prediction template 1 of is selected as a best match for this particular selected factor the corresponding values for this factor from the additional portion of prediction template 1 may be extracted and used to generate predictions for this factor whether instead of or in addition to the prediction information in rows for column . It will be appreciated that predicted information from prediction templates may be displayed and used in other manners in other embodiments.

It will be appreciated that the details discussed with respect to the examples of are provided for illustrative purposes and that the described techniques may be used with a variety of other types of user supplied information and may be performed in a variety of other ways.

In at least some embodiments some or all of the category definition information in database may similarly be received from clients such as to analyze information about a particular specified content category on behalf of a client who specifies a definition and or other information about the content category. When such clients exist the GDP system may further provide various types of information to the clients e.g. by sending the information to the client computing systems and or take various other types of automated actions on behalf of such clients such as in accordance with specified client instructions or other specified criteria. While not illustrated here in other embodiments some or all of the GDP system may execute on behalf of a single client or a single entity e.g. an organization with multiple employees or other members .

The Comment Group Creation Manager module may perform automated operations to analyze various user supplied textual comments or other user supplied content items that have been supplied for one or more time periods e.g. as may be stored in database on storage or in one or more other locations such as to group content items based on common topics in their contents or based on other comment attributes that they share and to optionally store corresponding comment topic information in database on storage and comment group information in database on storage .

In doing so the module may use information stored in comment information database comment group database comment topic database and category definition database stored on storage and may store corresponding determined category information in category information database stored on storage . In some embodiments quantified category information that is stored in database may including for one or more of the categories encoded summary information about constituent content items in the category e.g. for all content items in the category for content items in an intersection of the category and a particular constituent comment group etc. for each of one or more time periods such as with respect to one or more encodings specified in comment group encoding information on storage .

The Comment Prediction Manager module may perform automated operations to quantify user supplied comments or other content items that are associated with particular comment groups and categories and to use such quantified information for a category or comment group to predict information about additional user supplied comments or other content items that are expected to be supplied for the category and or comment group. In some situations the predictions are performed by generating prediction trends and in other situations the predictions are performed using previously generated prediction templates. In doing so the module may use information stored in comment group database category information database and or prediction template database stored on storage and may store quantified information about content items associated with particular comment groups and categories in comment group database and or category information database and may store corresponding generated prediction information in comment group database and category information database or instead in one or more other prediction information databases not shown in other embodiments .

The Prediction Template Generation Manager module may use quantified information about supplied comments or other content items associated with a category and or with comment groups and or may use predicted information about additional user supplied comments or other content items that are expected to be supplied for the category and or comment groups such as to identify or generate a histogram or other template of information that accurately reflects comments or other content items actually supplied for a category and or comment groups and that may be used as a template to predict information about additional user supplied comments or other content items that are expected to be supplied for the category and or comment groups. In doing so the module may use information stored in comments database comment group database and or category information database stored on storage and may store corresponding new prediction templates in prediction template database .

The routine begins at block where information or a request is received. The routine continues to block to determine if information has been received about one or more user comments or other user supplied content items such as for user comments that have recently or concurrently been supplied to one or more comment sources and sent to the routine by the comment source s e.g. in response to one or more previous requests from the routine such as with respect to blocks or . If so the routine continues to block to store some or all of the received information for later analysis. If it is instead determined in block that the received information or request of block is not user comment information the routine continues instead to block to determine to retrieve user comments or other user supplied content items from one or more external comment sources such as to do so on a periodic basis or when the information is needed for a corresponding analysis. If so the routine continues to block to initiate the retrieval of user comments or other user supplied content items from one or more external comment sources such as one or more social networking services or other publicly accessible sites at which users may supply information. In the illustrated embodiment the retrieval of the user comments in block is performed in an asynchronous manner by initiating requests to those external comment sources and later receiving corresponding responses although in other embodiments the routine may instead complete the retrieval of particular user comments from particular comment sources in block before continuing.

After blocks or or if it is instead determined in block that the information or request received in block is not to retrieve user comments the routine continues to block . In block the routine determines whether the information or request received in block is to analyze user comments or other user supplied content items to create corresponding comment groups such as for information just received with respect to block e.g. for a current time period or instead for a prior time period of a specified length e.g. 30 minutes . If so the routine continues to block to execute a Comment Group Creation Manager routine to perform the analysis and creation of the comment groups with one example of such a routine being described in greater detail with respect to .

After block or if it is instead determined in block that the information or request received in block is not to analyze comments the routine continues to block to determine whether the information or request received in block is to analyze user comments or other user supplied content items and comment groups to determine current topics for one or more categories and one or more time periods optionally with respect to comment groups that were just created in block and or for user comments just received in block . If so the routine continues to block to execute a Category Analysis Manager routine to determine the current topics for the category ies for the one or more time periods with one example of such a routine being described in greater detail with respect to .

After block or if it is instead determined in block that the information or request received in block is not to determine current topics for one or more categories the routine continues instead to block to determine whether the information or request received in block is to predict information about future user comments or other user supplied content items that are expected to be received for one or more comment groups and or categories such as for one or more future time periods and optionally based on comment groups that were just created in block and or for user comments just received in block and or for category information that was just determined in block . If so the routine continues to block to execute a Comment Prediction Manager routine to quantify one or more aspects of the user comments or other user supplied content items for the comment groups and or the category ies and to generate corresponding predictions based on such quantified information with one example of such a routine being described in greater detail with respect to .

After block or if is instead determined in block that the information or request received in block is not to predict information about future user comments the routine continues instead to block to determine whether the information or request received in block is to generate one or more prediction templates based on prior distributed group discussions and corresponding analyses. Such generation of one or more prediction templates may be performed for example with respect to information about actual user comments or other user supplied content items comment groups and categories determined in blocks and or and or with respect to information about future comments or other user supplied content items that are predicted in block . If so the routine continues to block to execute a Prediction Template Generation Manager routine to generate one or more such prediction templates with one example of such a routine being described in greater detail with respect to .

After block or if it is instead determined in block that the information or request received in block is not to generate prediction templates the routine continues instead to block to determine whether a request corresponding to one or more other operations has been received. If so the routine continues to block to perform one or more other indicated operations as appropriate. Such other indicated operations may include for example one or more of the following non exclusive list receiving and storing definitions and other information about categories of interest receiving and storing information about particular comment sources of interest e.g. how to obtain comments or other user supplied content items from them timing for obtaining comments or other user supplied content items from them types of comments or other user supplied content items available from them etc. receiving and storing information about clients of the service e.g. categories of interest to the client criteria under which to notify the client of discussion predictions and or current discussion information of interest types of automated actions to take under specified circumstances with respect to one or more categories of interest etc. etc.

After block or if it is instead determined in block that the information or request received in block is not to perform other indicated operations the routine continues instead to block to determine whether to continue such as until an explicit indication to terminate is received. If it is determined to continue the routine returns to block and otherwise continues to block and ends. In at least some embodiments the routine may execute in a continuous or near continuous manner such as to gather and store information about comments or other user supplied content items as they become available and to analyze such user comment information during each time period of an indicated length e.g. every 30 minutes .

The illustrated embodiment of the routine begins at block where user comment information for an indicated time period is retrieved such as for information received and stored with respect to block of . The routine then continues to block to analyze each user comment to identify any topics of interest in the content and or any other attributes of interest corresponding to the comment such as a location of where the comment was submitted from an author user who generated or otherwise supplied the user comment a comment data source from which the user comment was obtained any n grams in the contents of the user comment including any hashtags etc.

After block the routine continues to block to for each topic or other attribute that is identified in any of the user comments create a corresponding comment group for the indicated time period that includes user comments matching that topic or other attribute for that time period. The routine then continues to block to if additional user information sources are available retrieve additional comments or other user supplied information from the additional sources that correspond to the topic or other attribute for each created comment group and to add any such additional retrieved user supplied information to the corresponding created comment groups.

In some embodiments the routine may further perform additional optional activities with respect to block to determine additional information about some or all of the created comment groups such as to analyze the user comments included in some or all comment groups to determine particular author users who have high or low influence for the comment group e.g. relative to other author users for the same comment group and or for other comment groups to analyze the user comments included in some or all comment groups to enable performance of a sentiment analysis with respect to contents of the comments etc. Information generated by such optional additional activities may be stored and or used in various manners including to provide some or all of the generated information to clients to take additional automated actions based on the generated information to use some or all of the generated information as part of other analyses and determinations performed by the group discussion prediction service etc. Additional details related to such additional optional activities are discussed in greater detail elsewhere.

After block the routine continues to block to determine whether to encode summary quantified information for one or more of the created content groups. If so the routine continues to block to retrieve information about one or more encoding schemes that are available to use and optionally to indicate particular comments groups that are associated with particular encoding schemes. After block the routine in block further for each encoding scheme and any associated comments groups or in some embodiments for each comment group uses the encoding scheme to generate encoded summary information that quantifies information about constituent content items of the comment group for the time period.

After block or if it was instead determined in block not to generate any encoded summary information the routine continues to block to store information about the created comment groups for later use along with any associated determined and or generated information for such comment groups such as for information generated in blocks and block and block .

After block the routine continues to block to determine whether to continue such as until an explicit indication to terminate is received. If it is determined to continue the routine returns to block such as to wait until the next time period of an indicated length is completed or until corresponding user comment information for such a next time period is available. If it is determined in block to not continue the routine continues to block and returns such as to return to block of .

The illustrated embodiment of the routine begins at block where category definition information is retrieved for one or more categories of interest. In block the routine then retrieves user comment information for an indicated time period. In block the routine then for each category of interest identifies user comments that have topics or other attributes matching the definition for the category optionally using a specified minimum certainty threshold. As one example in some embodiments a category definition may include one or a small number e.g. four of definition terms and a user comment is identified as satisfying the category definition if it includes at least one of those definition terms while in other embodiments the user comment may need to include all of the indicated definition terms or a specified minimum number of the definition terms to satisfy the minimum certainty threshold with respect to the category.

After block the routine continues to block to for each category of interest determine all the comment groups that include any of the user comments that were identified for the category and to then analyze those determined comment groups based on one or more metrics. After the analysis the determined comment groups are ranked with respect to the one or more metrics. As one example the metrics may include the frequency in which comments of each determined comment group appear in the identified user comments for the category such as to assess a relevance of each comment group to the category. The analysis of the determined comment groups based on the metric s may further include in at least some embodiments determining an average and a standard deviation with respect to the frequencies for the determined comment groups.

After block the routine continues to block to determine information about a maximum inclusion threshold and or a minimum inclusion threshold for each category such as in some embodiments to be based on the information about the determined average frequency for determined comment groups of the category and standard deviation information e.g. to have the maximum inclusion threshold be one half of the standard deviation above the average and or to have the minimum inclusion threshold be one half of the standard deviation below the average frequency . After the maximum inclusion threshold and or minimum inclusion threshold are determined the determined comment groups for each category that are above the maximum or below the minimum inclusion thresholds are removed from the category with the remaining determined comment groups reflecting current topics and other attributes that are currently most relevant for the category. Information about the determined comment groups for the category is then stored for later use. In some embodiments only one of a maximum inclusion threshold and a minimum inclusion threshold may be used.

In some embodiments the routine may further perform additional optional activities with respect to block to determine additional information about some or all of the categories such as to analyze the user comments associated with the category to determine particular author users who have high or low influence for the category e.g. relative to other author users for the same category and or for other categories to analyze the user comments associated with the category to enable performance of a sentiment analysis with respect to contents of the user comments etc. Information generated by such optional additional activities may be stored and or used in various manners including to provide some or all of the generated information to clients to take additional automated actions based on the generated information to use some or all of the generated information as part of other analyses and determinations performed by the group discussion prediction service etc. Additional details related to such additional optional activities are discussed in greater detail elsewhere.

After block the routine continues to block to determine whether to continue such as until an explicit indication to terminate is received. If it is determined to continue the routine returns to block such as to wait until the next time period of an indicated length is completed or until corresponding comment group information for such a next time period is available. If it is determined in block to not continue the routine instead continues to block and returns such as to return to block of .

The illustrated embodiment of the routine begins at block where information is retrieved about created comment groups for one or more indicated time periods. In block information is then retrieved about the comment groups that have been determined to be relevant for one or more categories for the indicated time periods. After block the routine continues to block to select some or all of the determined comment groups for further analysis including in some embodiments to select some or all intersections of the determined comment groups with corresponding categories locations author users and or data sources. For each selected comment group and or intersection the routine in block then quantifies information about the associated user supplied comments for the selected comment group and or intersection such as by determining a quantity of matching comments for each of the indicated time periods of interest.

After block the routine continues to block to determine whether to use encoded summary comment group information for the selected comment groups and or intersections to predict future information for those selected comment groups and or intersections such as if such encoded summary information is available for those selected comment groups and or intersections e.g. with respect to block of and if the available prediction template information includes encoded summary information to use for matching purposes. If so the routine continues to block . Otherwise or if it is instead determined in block that there are no template matches the routine continues to block to predict future information for those selected comment groups and or intersections by generating and using histogram information for those selected comment groups and or intersections.

In particular in block the routine continues to optionally retrieve additional determined comment quantity information for the selected comment groups and or intersections such as for prior time periods within a sliding time window e.g. the last 72 hours . In block the routine then for each selected comment group and intersection generates a histogram for some or all of the sliding time window using the determined comment quantities for the indicated time periods and any corresponding retrieved determined comment quantities for prior time periods such as to have a separate value in the histogram for each time period of an indicated length during the sliding time window and optionally removing any information from a previous histogram for time periods that are no longer part of the sliding time window .

After block the routine continues to block to retrieve information about any defined prediction templates that are available for use in performing predictions. The routine then continues to block to select the next generated histogram beginning with the first. In block the routine then attempts to match the selected generated histogram to one or more of the defined prediction templates. In block it is determined if any of the prediction templates had a sufficient match for the selected histogram and if so the routine then continues to block to select the best matching prediction template and to use additional portions of the prediction template to predict future comment quantities for one or more future time periods corresponding to the selected histogram. If it is instead determined in block that there were not any matching prediction templates or no prediction templates were available to attempt to match the routine continues instead to block to perform a time weighted trend prediction of future comment quantities for one or more future time periods based on the comment quantities in the generated histogram. It will be appreciated that the matching of a histogram to a prediction template the use of an additional portion of a matching template to predict future quantities and the time weighted trend prediction may each be performed in various manners in various embodiments as discussed in greater detail elsewhere.

After blocks or the routine continues to block to store the predicted future comment quantity information for subsequent use. In block it is then determined if any additional histograms generated in block remain to be analyzed and if so returns to block to select a next such generated histogram. Otherwise the routine continues to block to optionally perform one or more additional activities. Such additional activities may in at least some embodiments include providing information about predicted comment quantities and or about determined current quantities for a generated histogram to one or more corresponding clients or other information sources that previously requested such information optionally in accordance with any specified criteria by such clients or other information sources. In addition in at least some embodiments the routine may in block further take one or more other automated actions for a generated histogram in accordance with defined criteria and client instructions based at least in part on predicted comment quantities and or on determined current comment quantities such as to initiate and add one or more comments to one or more comment sources that include information relevant to a discussion for a category or a comment group associated with the generated histogram e.g. to provide additional information corresponding to the category or to the topic of the comment group or to otherwise influence a direction in which the discussion may take place in the future .

If it is determined in block to use encoded summary comment group information for the selected comment groups and or intersections to predict future information for those selected comment groups and or intersections the routine continues to block . In block the routine retrieves encoded summary information for the selected comment groups and or intersections for prior time periods within a sliding time window e.g. the last 72 hours such as for information generated in block of . If any of the selected comment groups and or intersections lack stored encoded summary information the routine further retrieves for each such selected comment groups and or intersection information about the constituent content items for the selected comment group or intersection for the time periods of the time window and generates encoded summary information for the time window using each of one or more encoding schemes such as in a manner similar to that described with respect to blocks and of . For example with respect to an intersection of a comment group with a category content items that are part of the comment group and are associated with the category may be identified and encoded summary information may be quantified for an aggregation of those constituent content items. The routine then for each of the selected comment groups and or intersections aggregates the encoded summary information for the prior time periods during the time window in block such as by included the encoded summary information for each time period in succession in the aggregation.

After block the routine continues to block to retrieve information about any defined prediction templates that are available for use in performing predictions and that include aggregated encoded summary information for multiple time periods corresponding to at least a portion of the time window. For example if the summary information for a comment group and or intersection is encoded to represent information about five types of attributes for the constituent content items of the comment group and or intersection during each of multiple prior time periods the aggregated group of summary information for the retrieved matching prediction template similarly encodes information about those five types of attributes in at least some embodiments. The routine then continues to block to select the next aggregated group of encoded summary information for one of the selected comment groups and or intersections beginning with the first. In block the routine then attempts to match the selected aggregated group of encoded summary information to one or more of the defined prediction templates. In block it is determined if any of the prediction templates had a sufficient match for the selected aggregated group of encoded summary information and if so the routine then continues to block to select the best matching prediction template and to use additional encoded summary information from the prediction template to predict future information for one or more future time periods corresponding to the selected aggregated group of encoded summary information. For example if the summary information for a comment group and or intersection is encoded to represent information about five types of attributes for the constituent content items of the comment group and or intersection during each of multiple prior time periods and the aggregated group of summary information for a matching prediction template similarly encodes information about those five types of attributes the additional information from the matching prediction template is used to predict future information about one or more of those five types of attributes. If it is instead determined in block that there were not any matching prediction templates the routine continues instead to block . It will be appreciated that the matching of an aggregated group of encoded summary information to a prediction template the use of additional encoded summary information of a matching prediction template to predict future information may each be performed in various manners in various embodiments as discussed in greater detail elsewhere with the examples discussed with respect to providing one example of such prediction.

After block the routine continues to block to store the predicted future information for subsequent use. In block it is then determined if any additional aggregated groups of encoded summary information generated in block remain to be analyzed and if so returns to block to select a next such generated aggregated group of encoded summary information. Otherwise the routine continues to block to optionally perform one or more additional activities including to provide information about predicted future information to one or more clients or other information sources and or to further take one or more other automated actions in accordance with defined criteria and client instructions such as in a manner previously described with respect to block .

After blocks or the routine continues to block to determine whether to continue such as until an explicit indication to terminate is received. If it is determined to continue the routine returns to block such as to wait until the next time period of an indicated length is completed or until corresponding to wait until additional information about created comment groups and or about determined comment groups for categories for such a next time period is available. If it is instead determined in block not to continue the routine instead continues to block and returns such as to return to block of .

In particular illustrates an example flow diagram of an embodiment of a Prediction Template Generation Manager routine that uses histograms and associated trend curves to predict future information and to assess the accuracy of such predictions. While the illustrated embodiment of the routine uses histograms and associated trend curves for non encoded data for one or more selected factors e.g. using numerical values of a quantity of comments or other content items for a particular comment group and or intersection of a category and comment group for each of multiple time periods in a time window other embodiments of the routine may perform similar activities using histograms and associated trend curves for encoded summary values with respect to each of one or more selected factors. The illustrated embodiment of the routine begins at block where information is retrieved about one or more generated histograms for one or more comment groups or categories such as for histograms generated in block of routine . The routine then continues to block to select the next generated histogram beginning with the first. In block the routine then separates the generated histogram into multiple overlapping portions such as the initial portion of the generated histogram the initial portion of the generated histogram and the entire portion of the generated histogram thus if the histogram covers for example a sliding time window of 72 hours or 3 days the multiple overlapping portions may correspond to the first day the first and second days and all 3 days. In other embodiments and situations other types of histogram portions and time lengths may be used.

In blocks and each of the histogram portions is analyzed to determine whether the information in that histogram portion is able to accurately predict additional user comments that will be received such as if the user comment information represented in that histogram portion represents a typical or otherwise repeated pattern of user comments. In particular in block for all but the last of the histogram portions a time weighted trend prediction is performed using the information in the histogram portion and additional information about actual user comments received e.g. from other later portions of the generated histogram is used to determine whether that trend prediction is consistent with that actual user comment information. In block for the last of the histogram portions a time weighted trend prediction is performed using the information in the histogram portion and additional information about actual user comments received e.g. from one or more time periods after the sliding time window corresponding to the generated histogram is used to determine whether that trend prediction is consistent with that actual user comment information in some situations such as if the selected histogram was just completed and represents the most current comment information that is available the performance of the analysis of block may be deferred until additional user comment information is received and analyzed. The time weighted trend predictions performed in blocks and may for example be similar to or the same as that performed in block of routine and the determination of whether the trend prediction is consistent may be performed with respect to a specified degree of error.

After block the routine continues to block to for each histogram portion having a prediction that is consistent with actual information store information about the histogram portion and optionally the subsequent additional information used to verify the prediction as a candidate histogram template for later use in generating other predictions such as with respect to block of routine .

In some embodiments the routine may further perform additional optional activities with respect to block to assess whether one or more prior predictions made from use of a prediction template for the histogram were accurate such as with respect to block of routine and to corresponding alter use of the prediction template. For example if the prior use of a prediction template was accurate an accuracy rate for that prediction template may be increased accordingly and the prediction template may continue to be used optionally with an increased confidence in its accuracy based on the increased accuracy rate. Conversely if the prior use of a prediction template was not accurate an accuracy rate for that prediction template may be decreased accordingly optionally with a corresponding decreased confidence in its accuracy based on the increased accuracy rate and the prediction template may be taken out of use if its accuracy rate is too low. The prior use of a prediction template that may be assessed may in some situations include waiting until later actual information is available about user comments that are received for comparison to the prior prediction made for the histogram. After block the routine continues to block to determine whether more generated histograms are available and if so returns to block to select a next such histogram.

If it is instead determined in block that no more histograms are available the routine continues to block to determine whether to continue such as until an explicit indication to terminate is received. If it is determined to continue the routine returns to block such as to wait until additional information about generated histograms and or corresponding actual comment information corresponding to predictions are available. If it is instead determined in block not to continue the routine instead continues to block and returns such as to return to block of .

In block the routine then separates the generated aggregation into one or more initial portions that each correspond to a time window having a time length of one or more indicated lengths including to optionally have multiple initial overlapping portions such as an initial 6 hours of the aggregation an initial 24 hours of the aggregation an initial 48 hours of the aggregation and an initial 72 hours of the aggregation thus if the aggregation includes for example a sliding time window of at least 72 hours or 3 days the multiple overlapping portions may correspond to the first day the first and second days and all 3 days. In other embodiments and situations other types of aggregation portions and time lengths may be used. The routine further identifies one or more additional subsequent portions of the aggregation for each of the initial portions with each additional subsequent portion having a time length of one or more indicated prediction lengths such as a next 6 hours of the aggregation a next 24 hours of the aggregation a next 48 hours of the aggregation and a next 72 hours of the aggregation. Thus as one example the initial portion may be for 72 hours and the additional subsequent portion may be for the subsequent 72 hours such as if at least 144 hours of encoded summary information are available in the aggregation. Other non exclusive examples include the following the initial portion is for 72 hours and the additional subsequent portion is for the subsequent 24 hours the initial portion is for 24 hours and the additional subsequent portion is for the subsequent 24 hours thus the additional subsequent portion in this example may be part of the initial portion in the prior example in which the initial portion is for 72 hours the initial portion is for 24 hours and the additional subsequent portion is for the subsequent 6 hours the initial portion is for 24 hours and the additional subsequent portion is for the subsequent 72 hours etc.

In block each of the initial portion and additional subsequent portion combinations is optionally analyzed to determine whether the information in that additional portion is able to accurately predict additional user content items that will be received after data matching the initial portion has occurred such as by comparing that combination to other prior actual data having a matching initial portion to see if the additional portion of the combination matches subsequent actual data from that prior actual data such a comparison may show for example whether the combination being considered represents a typical or otherwise repeated pattern of user comments or other content items. The degree of match between corresponding initial portions and or corresponding additional portions of a current candidate combination and prior actual data may be performed in various manners as discussed in greater detail elsewhere if the comparison of block is performed a current candidate combination may be retained as a candidate only if it sufficiently matches a specified quantity e.g. one more than one etc. of prior sets of actual data such as with respect to a specified degree of error.

After block the routine continues to block to for each combination of an initial portion and an additional subsequent portion that is determined in block to be sufficiently representative or for each combination of an initial portion and an additional subsequent portion determined in block if the comparison in block is not performed store information about the combination of aggregated encoded summary information for use as part of a candidate prediction template for later use in generating other predictions such as with respect to block of routine . After block the routine continues to block to determine whether more generated aggregations are available and if so returns to block to select a next such aggregation.

In some embodiments the routine may further perform additional optional activities with respect to block if no more aggregations are determined in block to be available in order to assess whether one or more prior predictions made from use of a prediction template using aggregated encoded summary information were accurate such as with respect to block of routine and to corresponding alter use of that prediction template. For example if the prior use of a prediction template was accurate an accuracy rate for that prediction template may be increased accordingly and the prediction template may continue to be used optionally with an increased confidence in its accuracy based on the increased accuracy rate. Conversely if the prior use of a prediction template was not accurate an accuracy rate for that prediction template may be decreased accordingly optionally with a corresponding decreased confidence in its accuracy based on the increased accuracy rate and the prediction template may be taken out of use as a candidate if its accuracy rate is too low.

After block the routine continues to block to determine whether to continue such as until an explicit indication to terminate is received. If it is determined to continue the routine returns to block such as to wait until additional information about generated aggregations and or corresponding actual comment information corresponding to predictions are available. If it is instead determined in block not to continue the routine instead continues to block and returns such as to return to block of .
