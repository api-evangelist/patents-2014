The present disclosure relates generally to archival of email and more particularly to techniques for determining ownership of files and or email messages.

As the use of email grows the need to archive or migrate email from client terminals to remote servers increases. Archiving or migration of email messages may be needed as a result of increased data usage and limited client computing capabilities eDiscovery requirements or compliance requirements. In some instances email messages may be stored as part of a Personal Storage Table .pst file associated with Microsoft Exchange. As part of an email archive system all or a portion of a .pst file may be backed up from a client terminal to at least one remote server. Determining the proper owner of a .pst file for archival purposes is critical to ensure that the email messages are associated with the proper user and accurately stored for future retrieval. Traditional techniques for determining the owner of a .pst file require a network administrator to manually assign an owner or are based on various file or folder permissions. However traditional techniques for determining the proper owner of a .pst file are time consuming and can be inaccurate.

In view of the foregoing it may be understood that there may be significant problems and shortcomings associated with traditional email message ownership determination.

Techniques for determining ownership of files and or email messages are disclosed. In one embodiment the techniques may be realized as a method for determining file ownership comprising determining using at least one processor a distribution of a plurality of email messages within a file selecting a preset number of email messages based on the determined distribution of the plurality of email messages within the file extracting metadata from each of the preset number of email messages classifying each of the preset number of email messages based on the extracted metadata determining an owner of each of the preset number of email messages based on the classification of each email message by analyzing the metadata of each of the preset number of email messages calculating statistics for the preset number of email messages based on the determined owner of each of the preset number of email messages and assigning ownership to the file based on the calculated statistics.

In accordance with other aspects of this embodiment the plurality of email messages may be arranged in at least one folder of the file.

In accordance with additional aspects of this embodiment the file may contain a plurality of folders and each folder contains at least one of the plurality of email messages.

The message access module may access email messages within an email system. For example the message access module may access email messages within a Microsoft Exchange email system implemented within a network. In addition the message access module may access email messages within the email system across a plurality of user accounts as part of an archival and backup email system. In some embodiments only email messages within a specific email server environment may be accessed for further analysis by the owner determination module . Further the message access module may also access .pst files containing email messages for further analysis by the owner determination module .

The message distribution analysis module may analyze email messages accessed by the message access module to determine how those messages are distributed across one or a plurality of folders. For example the message distribution analysis module may analyze email messages stored in a .pst file to determine the folder structure e.g. inbox outbox sent messages folders subfolders etc. and how many email messages are arranged within that folder structure. In some instance the message distribution analysis module may determine the number of email messages arranged in each folder or subfolder.

The message sampling module may select and sample a subset of the email messages accessed by the message access module . In some instances the message sampling module may randomly select the subset of email messages to determine additional aspects about the email messages. Following selection the message sampling module may sample or exact information relevant to the owner from the email message. In particular metadata associated with the email messages may be collected. In some instances the metadata sampled by the message sampling module may be Messaging Application Programming Interface MAPI properties. describes various aspects of the MAPI properties collected by the message sampling module and used to determine the owner of the message.

In some embodiments the sampling of email messages may be restricted by a maximum scanning cap. For example the message sampling module may only analyze a maximum of 10 of the total number of email messages identified by message distribution analysis module . In another example the message sampling module may only analyze a maximum of 10 of the total number of email messages identified by message distribution analysis module within a .pst file. The message sampling module may also give weight to certain folders over others. For example the message scanning module may sample more items in the inbox and or the sent messages folder.

The message classification module may classify each message sampled by the message sampling module as sent or received. In some instance the message classification module may classify the messages based on the metadata sampled by the message sampling module . In some embodiments the metadata may be MAPI properties of the email messages. For example if an email message contains the MAPI property PR RECEIVED BY NAME then that email message has been received by some email messaging user and the email message may be classified as received. If an email message does not contain the MAPI property PR RECEIVED BY NAME then that email message has been sent by some messaging user and the email message may be classified as sent. Additional details of the MAPI properties are described below with respect to .

The message owner determination module may determine an owner for each email message based on the metadata sampled by the message sampling module and the classification of the message from the message classification module . In some instances the metadata used to determine the owner may be MAPI properties of email messages. For example for messages classified as sent PR SENDER NAME PR SENDER EMAIL ADDRESS PR SENT REPRESENTING NAME PR SENT REPRESENTING EMAIL ADDRESS properties may be used to extract owner information. For messages classified as received PR RCVD REPRESENTING NAME PR RCVD REPRESENTING EMAIL ADDRESS PR RECEIVED BY NAME PR RECEIVED BY EMAIL ADDRESS properties may be used to extract owner information.

The statistics generation module may generate statistics regarding the email messages analyzed. In some instances these statistics may be used to determine users that may be owners e.g. candidate owners of the analyzed email messages. For example the statistics generation module may generate statistics regarding a .pst file to determine an owner of the .pst file. In some embodiments the statistics generation module may generate statistics relating to the assigned owner of the email message from the message owner determination module the email address of the email message the number of email messages associated with that assigned owner and the percentage of email messages associated with an assigned owner in relation to the total number of sampled email messages.

The option determination module may provide a variety of configuration settings used to implement the owner determination processes as described herein. For example the option determination module may receive user inputs via the user interface to specify whether to utilize the owner determination process as part of a message archiving process a minimum number of messages to be sampled and a maximum number of messages to be sampled. The chart below provides various examples of configuration settings that may be managed by the option determination module 

The owner selection module may select and assign an owner to a collection of email messages analyzed by the owner determination module . In some embodiments the owner selection module may select and assign an owner to a .pst file analyzed by the various modules of the owner determination module as described above. In some instances the owner determination module may select an owner of the .pst file as the user with the maximum percentage share of email messages sampled in the .pst file and identified by the statistics generation module .

The user interface may provide a user or administrator with an interface to control any aspect to the processes described herein. For example the user interface may display information about the owner of a .pst file assigned by the owner assignment module the selected options of the option determination module statistics generated by the statistics generation module message owners determined by the message owner determination module message classifications determined by the message classification module and message distributions determined by the message distribution analysis module .

At block a distribution of email messages may be determined. In some embodiments the distribution of email messages may be determined by the message distribution analysis module . Email messages may be distributed across one or a plurality of folders and subfolders for a particular set of emails under analysis. In some instances the email messages may be contained with a .pst file. The distribution of messages within the .pst file may be analyzed to determine the folder structure of the .pst file e.g. inbox outbox sent messages folders subfolders etc. and how many email messages are arranged within that folder structure. The total number of email messages within the .pst file t may also be determined. described below shows one example of a folder structure within a .pst file. described below shows one example of a distribution of emails within the folder structure of the .pst file. After the distribution of email messages has been determined the overall process may then proceed to block .

At block a subset or percentage of the email messages may be selected for analysis at block . In some embodiments email messages may be selected by the message sampling module . The sample percentage s of the emails to be analyzed may be a percentage of the total emails t identified at block . The sample percentage s may also be set by a user or administrator. Additional configuration settings for sampling e.g. maximum number of sampled email messages may be specified by a user as described above with respect to the option determination module . In some instances email messages to be analyzed or sampled may be randomly selected from each folder and subfolder identified at block . The number of messages selected from each folder may vary. For example a larger number of messages may be selected from the inbox and sent messages folders so as to give more weight to the messages within these folders.

In some embodiments certain messages may be excluded from the subset of messages selected. For example only email messages originating from and received an Exchange server environment may be sampled. Messages originating from outside of the Exchange server environment may accordingly be excluded from the sampling.

As part of the email message selection MAPI properties of the email messages may also be utilized to filter or excluded certain email messages and folders within a .pst file from further analysis. Such email messages and folders may yield an inaccurate owner result if included in the analysis. A .pst file may contain many types of folders and messages. To reduce the number of email messages necessary for analysis certain folders may be excluded in the sampling. For example the PR CONTAINER CLASS MAPI property may be used to identify folders in a container class of IPM.Note. Folders having this container class may be included from the subset of messages selected for further analysis while folders not having this container class may be excluded. In addition where the PR CONTAINER CLASS MAPI property for a particular folder does not exist that folder may also be excluded from the subset.

To further reduce the number of email messages to be analyzed certain types of email messages may be excluded from the subset of messages selected for further analysis. For example if the MAPI property PR MESSAGE CLASS for a particular message is IPM.Note then that message may be included in the subset of messages for further analysis while the remaining message classes may be excluded. In addition unsent messages may be excluded. Some message types that extend from the IPM.Note class may also be excluded. For instance Microsoft Office Communicator chat histories within the IPM.Note.Microsoft.Conversation class may be excluded. After the subset of the subset of email messages has been selected the overall process may proceed to block .

At block the selected subset of messages may be classified. In some embodiments the messages may be classified by the message classification module . In particular each selected message may be classified as either sent or received. Metadata may be extracted from the subset of email messages and analyzed to determine whether the message has been sent or received with respect to the .pst file. In some embodiments the metadata may be MAPI properties. For example if an email message has both receiver properties and sender properties then it may be classified as received. However if the email message has only sender properties then it may be classified as sent with respect to the .pst file. After the messages have been classified the overall process may then proceed to block .

At block an owner for each classified message may be determined. In some embodiments the message owner determination module may determine the owner of each classified message from block . The message owner may be determined in accordance with the classification assigned at block . For example messages classified as sent may have owner information extracted from one set of metadata while messages classified as received may have owner information extracted from another set of metadata. In particular the MAPI properties may be used to extract certain owner information. described in detail below provides one example of how the MAPI properties may be used to determine an owner for each message. After the owner for each classified message has been determined the overall process may then proceed to block .

At block message statistics may be calculated. In some embodiments the statistics generation module may generate the message statistics. In particular statistics relating to owner names email addresses email message counts and percentage of total sampled email messages may be calculated. After the message statistics have been calculated the process may proceed to block .

At block ownership of the email messages may be assigned. In some embodiments the owner assignment module may assign an owner to the email messages. In some instances the candidate who simply has the maximum percentage share of items in the .pst file may be selected as the owner of the .pst file. In other instances a success criteria sc may be utilized in the assignment process. The success criteria may indicate a minimum percentage of emails that must belong to a same owner in order to identify that user as the owner of the .pst file. For example it may be determined that user A owns 55 of the messages within the .pst file and the success criteria is 40 . In this case user A may be assigned as the owner and user A s email address or display name may be matched with available Exchange mailbox users. Accordingly the .pst file may be migrated to user A s archive.

However if user A owns the highest share of email messages within a .pst file at 35 ownership user A s ownership percentage would be below the success criteria of 40 . In this instance an owner of the .pst file may not be assigned and the information generated in the previous blocks may be displayed to a user or administrator. Additionally this information may be stored as part of the .pst file analyzed.

In another instance it may be determined that user A and user B each own 40 of the email messages within .pst file. In this situation an owner of the .pst file may not be assigned and the information generated in the previous blocks may be displayed to a user or administrator. Additionally this information may be stored as part of the .pst file.

In a further situation user A may be identified as the owner of the .pst file. However a comparison of the owner of the .pst file with available email address and display name information associated with email archives may reveal that no archive exists for user A or that user A does not have archive privileges. In this case the owner information may be displayed to a user or administrator and or stored as part of the .pst file.

During the message analysis multiple owner candidates may be identified that own approximately the same amount of email messages within the .pst file. For example user A may own 37 user B may own 39 and user C may own 24 of the subset of email messages analyzed. In this case user A and user B have similar percentages of ownership and are within a predefined percent delta range e.g. 5 . This may happen either because of randomness of email selection or a true distribution of ownership. As a result a retry may be performed such that the overall process may proceed back to block and blocks may be performed on a different set of email messages within the .pst file. If the retry results in a user having ownership greater than the predefined percent delta range e.g. user A has 42 while user B has 32 then that user may be selected as the owner of the .pst file owner. However if the retry does not result in a user having ownership greater than the predefined percent delta range e.g. user A has 39 while user B has 35 then no user may be selected as the owner of the .pst file owner or another retry may be performed.

After the ownership of the email messages has been assigned the process may proceed to block . The overall process may then repeat periodically or continuously. In particular the overall process may be implemented with respect to a plurality of .pst files at one time or sequentially.

At block a Personal Storage Table .pst file may be accessed. In some embodiments the message access module may access the .pst file. The .pst file may contain a plurality of email messages stored in various folders and subfolders as described herein. In some instances the .pst file may be stored at a client terminal and utilized by one or a plurality of email users. After accessing the .pst file the process may proceed to block .

At block is may be determined whether the .pst file accessed at block is password protected. In some embodiments the message access module may determine whether the .pst file is password protected. If it is determined that the .pst file is password protected the overall process may proceed to block . However if it is determined that the .pst file is not password protected the overall process may proceed to block .

At block it may be determined whether the password may be overridden. In some embodiments the message access module may determine whether the .pst password may be overridden. In particular it may be determined that a network administrator implementing the process may override the .pst password. If it is determined that the password cannot be overridden the overall process may proceed to block . However if it is determined that the password may be overridden the overall process may proceed to block .

At block a distribution of the messages within the accessed .pst file may be determined. In some embodiments the distribution of email messages may be determined by the message distribution analysis module . The analysis of the distribution of the messages within the .pst file is similar to the analysis performed in block as described above. In particular the distribution of messages within the .pst file may be analyzed to determine the folder structure of the .pst file e.g. inbox outbox sent messages folders subfolders etc. and how many email messages are arranged within that folder structure. After the message distribution has been determined the process may proceed to block .

At block a subset or percentage of the email messages analyzed at block may be selected sampled and classified. In some embodiments email messages may be selected by the message sampling module . The selection of the subset or percentage of email messages is similar to the selection described above with respect to block and below with respect to . In particular messages may be randomly selected. Additionally each folder and subfolder identified at block may have a certain number or percentage of email messages selected for sampling. In some embodiments certain folders such as the inbox and sent messages may be weighted such that a greater percentage or sampling set may be selected from those folders.

After the subset of email messages has been selected the selected messages may be classified. For example the selected messages may be classified as either sent or received based on metadata. In some instances the metadata may be MAPI properties of the messages. Classification of the email messages at block is similar to the classification of the messages described above with respect to block . In particular each selected message may be classified as either sent or received based on metadata extracted from each email message. After the subset of the email messages has been classified the overall process may proceed to block .

At block an owner for each scanned message may be determined. In some embodiments the message owner determination module may determine the owner of the scanned messages. The owner may be determined based on MAPI properties of the messages. Determination of the owner for each messages at block is similar to that described above with respect to block and described below with respect to . In particular messages classified as sent may have owner information extracted from one set of metadata while messages classified as received may have owner information extracted from another set of metadata. After the owner for each scanned message has been determined the overall process may then proceed to block .

At block message statistics may be generated. In some embodiments the statistics generation module may generate the message statistics. In particular statistics relating to owner names email addresses email message counts and percentage of total sampled email message may be calculated. After the message statistics have been calculated the process may proceed to block .

At block it may be determined whether an owner selection option has been enabled. In some embodiments the option determination module may determine whether an owner selection option has been enabled. As described above a user or administrator may select various options or configurations with respect to determining the owner of a .pst file. One such owner selection option or configuration setting is the Always Select Most Likely Owner setting. This setting overrides the success criteria sc setting and always assigns the user with the highest percent share of messages in a .pst file as the owner of the .pst file. If it is determined that the owner selection option has not been selected the overall process may proceed to block . However if it is determined that an owner selection option has been selected the overall process may proceed to block .

At block it may be determined whether any owner candidate has a total count percentage greater than a predefined success criteria sc . In some embodiments the owner assignment module may determine whether any owner candidate has a total count percentage greater than the success criteria. This determination is similar to the analysis described above with respect to block . In particular if it is determined that no candidate owners have a total count percentage greater than the success criteria the overall process may proceed to block . However if it is determined that at least one candidate owners has a total count percentage greater than the success criteria the overall process may proceed to block .

At block the candidate owner with the maximum percentage of messages is selected as the owner for the .pst file. This candidate owner is selected even if the percentage ownership is less than the success criteria used at block based on the owner selection option being enabled. After the candidate owner with the maximum percentage of messages is selected as the owner for the .pst file the process may proceed to block .

The overall process may then repeat periodically or continuously. In some instances various elements of the overall process may be performed concurrently or sequentially. In particular the overall process may be implemented with respect to a plurality of .pst files at one time or sequentially. For example an email archive application implemented across a plurality of client terminals may concurrently implement the process on each client with respect to .pst files stored on the client terminals as part of a remote email archiving workflow.

Each folder may be sampled at the same rate of 10 . However in this instance the inbox is weighted greater while less weight is applied to the remaining folders. In particular the inbox may be sampled at 12.5 instead of 10 such that 250 messages are sampled instead of 200. As a result the remaining folders may be sampled less frequently.

Based on the sampling of the messages within the .pst file two candidate owners may be identified. Candidate owner John Smith may be determined as the owner of 789 emails out of the 1000 sampled. Accordingly John Smith is determined to own 78.9 of the .pst file. Another candidate owner John Doe may be determined as the owner of 211 emails out of the 1000 sampled. Accordingly John Doe is determined to own 21.1 of the .pst file. Based on the statistics calculated John Smith will be selected as the owner of the .pst file based on the percent share exceeding the success criteria of 50 and the .pst file will be migrated into John Smith s email archive.

In at least one embodiment extracting owner information for each message may be based in the MAPI properties described above. In addition each message may be classified as either sent or received based on the MAPI properties. Particularly if an email message contains the MAPI property PR RECEIVED BY NAME then this email message has been received by a messaging user and the message may be classified as received. If an email message doesn t have PR RECEIVED BY NAME property then the email message is classified as sent.

Owner information may be read from the email message based on the classification of sent or received. In particular for messages classified as sent PR SENDER NAME PR SENDER EMAIL ADDRESS PR SENT REPRESENTING NAME PR SENT REPRESENTING EMAIL ADDRESS properties may be used to extract owner information. For messages classified as received PR RCVD REPRESENTING NAME PR RCVD REPRESENTING EMAIL ADDRESS PR RECEIVED BY NAME PR RECEIVED BY EMAIL ADDRESS properties may be used to extract owner information.

For an email message which is being transported through delegate functionality identification of the owner may be based on difference in value of properties. For messages classified as sent if PR SENDER NAME and PR SENT REPRESENTING NAME have different values then the message is sent by a user on behalf of another user and the owner may be selected as the value of PR SENT REPRESENTING NAME. For messages classified as received if PR RECEIVED BY NAME and PR RCVD REPRESENTING NAME have different values then the message is received by user on behalf of another user and the owner may be selected as the value of PR RCVD REPRESENTING NAME.

At this point it should be noted that determining ownership of files and or email messages in accordance with the present disclosure as described above may involve the processing of input data and the generation of output data to some extent.
