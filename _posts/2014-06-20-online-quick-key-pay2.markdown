This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 879 803 filed Sep. 10 2010 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The present invention generally relates to on line payments and more particularly to quick and easy on line payments.

More and more consumers are purchasing items and services over electronic networks such as the Internet. Consumers routinely search for and purchase products and services from merchants and individuals alike. The transactions can take place directly between an on line merchant or retailer and the consumer where payment is typically made by entering credit card or other financial information. Transactions can also take place with the aid of an on line payment provider such as PayPal Inc. of San Jose Calif. Such payment providers can make transactions easier and safer for the parties. Purchasing through the Internet from the convenience of a consumer s home office or virtually anywhere with mobile devices is one main reason why on line purchases are growing faster and faster.

Typical payment flows with on line purchases provide the consumer with a payment or checkout button or link that is selected when the consumer is ready for payment. Once selected such as by clicking the consumer is taken to a new checkout or payment page. The consumer then enters any requested information and confirms payment. One disadvantage to this payment flow is that the consumer is taken away from the merchant or product page which may lessen the consumer experience and preclude further shopping or browsing on the page. Another disadvantage is that the consumer may be required to enter information such a user name email address password PIN credit card number billing address etc. which may be cumbersome and time consuming.

These problems may be even more prevalent in small mobile devices such as phones having small screen sizes and keyboards or keypads. With mobile devices the consumer may want to remain on the merchant or product application page because Internet navigation is more difficult. Furthermore the small keyboards keypads make it more inconvenient to enter information onto a payment page.

Thus there is a need for a more effective way of making on line payments without the disadvantages discussed above.

In accordance with an embodiment of the invention a user can select a payment option on a merchant site which pops up a smaller payment window on the site. The payment window gives the user an option of doing a quick pay by simply entering in a user known identifier such as a two number sequence. If the identifier is confirmed with a payment provider the payment is processed and the payment screen disappears.

The payment provider compares the received identifier with a user identifier which is obtained from the user s device or merchant site. If the transaction amount or other transaction details are within limits for the quick pay account the payment provider processes the payment request.

In one embodiment the user has the same identifier for different merchants where different merchants can have different payment limits different expiration dates different funding sources etc. The payment provider is able to automatically determine the account restrictions from a user identifier based on merchant information transmitted with the payment request.

As a result the user can make payments quickly and easily by simply entering one piece of information a user identifier without leaving the merchant page. In addition the user is able to make payments to different merchants with different account limits and restrictions using the same user identifier which gives the user more control over payments without requiring the user to remember different identifiers for each merchant.

These and other features and advantages of the present invention will be more readily apparent from the detailed description of the embodiments set forth below taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Embodiments of the present disclosure and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure and not for purposes of limiting the same.

Once the item s are located the consumer proceeds to a checkout or payment at step . In one embodiment the merchant page or application detail page includes a payment button or link that the user can select when ready for checkout or payment. Selection can be made by tapping or clicking on the button. The payment button may include the name of the payment provider such as PayPal Inc. of San Jose Calif. Upon selecting the button a determination is made at step whether the user has a quick pay account with the payment provider. If not the user is taken to a page where the user can sign up for an account at step . This may include opening a new window for the payment provider site which may be a pop up window a new window or in a new tab. Note that if the user does not have any account with the payment provider the user may be asked to create an account through a typical flow.

The window for user sign up may include the user entering or selecting a user identifier and a maximum transaction amount for the quick pay feature. Other information may also be requested such as maximum amount over a certain period a maximum number of transactions allowed an expiration date of the account etc. Details of creating the quick pay account will be discussed in more detail below.

In one embodiment once the quick pay account is created the user can enable this feature for subsequent transactions and payment for the current transaction is made through the user s regular account at step .

If the user has a quick pay account as determined at step a smaller pop up payment window appears on the merchant site at step . The payment window includes a field where the user can enter a user identifier for quick pay. In one embodiment the payment window also has a field for the user to enter a user a user name or email and or password or PIN. In another embodiment the user s name is included by the payment provider such that the user need only enter the user identifier. The user name may be determined from the user device the user login information for the merchant site or other means. If the user name is not correct the user may enter the correct user information. The payment window may also allow the user to select payment through the regular account instead of through quick pay.

Assuming the user name is correct and the user wants to use the quick pay option the user enters the identifier for quick pay and submits the information at step to the payment provider. The payment provider processes the information at step to determine whether to approve the payment. The processing which will be described in more detail in may include matching the received user identifier with the user name determining the merchant or recipient of the payment and determining whether the payment amount is within the limits of the user quick pay settings associated with the particular merchant. The payment provider may also compare information about the device the request was transmitted from such as a phone number from a mobile device to information corresponding to an authorized account.

If for some reason the payment request through quick pay cannot be authorized as determined at step the payment provider informs the user at step . This step is dependent on the reason or reasons why the payment request was not authorized. For example if the user identifier did not match the user may be requested to enter the identifier again. If the requested payment amount exceeds the quick pay limit the user may be notified and asked to pay through the user s regular account or through a different funding instrument.

After the user is informed at step the payment receives a response from the user and determines whether to authorize or approve the payment request at step . If approved the payment is processed at step . If the request is still not approved the transaction is terminated. A notification may be sent to the user in either situation.

If the determination at step results in an authorized payment using quick pay the user is returned fully to the merchant page at step . In one embodiment the payment window simply disappears and the user proceeds with any interactions on the merchant page. In another embodiment the payment window is replaced with a confirmation message to that the payment has been approved where the confirmation message may automatically disappear after a certain period or the user may close the message manually.

Next at step the payment is processed. For example a user account with the payment provider may be debited and funds transferred or credited to a merchant account. Note that if the merchant has an account with the payment provider the payment provider can simply process the payment using information conveyed in the transaction or payment request. If the merchant does not have an account the payment provider may ask that the merchant create an account to receive payment or credit the amount to a third party merchant account using information provided by the merchant.

An optional confirmation may be sent to the merchant and or the user at step such as in the form of a text message email voice message or the like.

If the purchased item is a downloadable item such as an application or an add on or enhancement to an application the download or purchased features may be transferred automatically as soon as the payment is approved or sent. After the download is completed the user will have the item on the device. If the purchased item is a physical good the merchant can deliver the item by a suitable method such as shipping or arranging a physical pick up.

The payment provider then receives at step information provided by the user in response to the payment page. Information may include in various embodiments a request to make the payment through the user s regular account a user identification and transaction limit amount for the quick pay feature an expiration date for the quick pay feature a list of merchants for which this quick pay feature limits and expiration would apply to and a request that the quick pay feature be enabled the next time the user goes through a check out or payment process with the payment provider. In one embodiment the limits set would only be for that particular merchant i.e. the merchant associated with the current transaction.

The payment is then processed at step . For example the payment provider transfers the payment from the user s account and credits the merchant s account through a normal payment flow. After payment the payment provider closes or allows the user to close the payment window at step so that the user can continue on the merchant site. The payment provider may also send at step a notification or confirmation to the user and or the merchant that a payment has been made.

Referring back to step if the user has a quick pay account the payment provider sends quick pay payment screen to the user device at step . In one embodiment the payment screen is a smaller pop up window on the merchant page. In other embodiments the payment screen may be opened up in a new window or tab. The payment window may request the user enter the user identifier for the quick pay feature if the user wishes to pay using quick pay or for the user to elect to pay through the regular user account if the user desires.

In another embodiment the quick pay account for the user is different with different merchants even though the user identifier is the same. In that case the payment provider first determines whether the user has a quick pay account for the particular merchant. If not the payment provider may present the user with an option of using the same limits and settings as another one of the user quick pay accounts or setting new limits and conditions for this current merchant.

Once the payment provider receives the user response a determination is made at step whether the payment is to be authorized. The payment provider may first check whether the user is correctly associated with the quick pay user identifier. If so the payment provider may also check whether the requested payment amount is within the limits set for the quick pay account and or whether the quick pay account has expired.

If the payment cannot be authorized the payment provider may send the user a message at step in an attempt to resolve the request. The message content may depend on the reason or reasons for not authorizing the request. For example if it is because the amount requested is too high the user may be asked if he wants to raise the limit on the quick pay account or make the payment through a normal payment flow. A raised limit may be effective immediately or not until the next transaction. If the reason for not authorization is because the quick pay has expired the user may be asked to make the payment through a normal payment flow or set a new expiration date. Similar to the limit increase the new expiration date may be effective immediately i.e. for the current transaction or not until the next transaction.

The payment provider then processes the payment or denies the request at step depending on the response received from the user.

If the payment can be authorized as determined at step the payment provider processes the payment at step . In one embodiment the payment provider transfers the payment amount from the user s account into an account of the merchant or recipient minus any fees that may be incurred . If the merchant has an account with the payment provider or the payment provider has merchant account information from a third party such as bank the payment provider may obtain the account information through merchant information communicated in the transaction request from the user. If the merchant does not have an account with the payment provider the payment provider may send a message to the merchant informing the merchant that there is a payment waiting and to open an account to receive the payment. The merchant may also request the merchant to provide account information from a third party such as a merchant bank account so that the payment provider can transfer the funds to the designated account.

Once processed the payment provider may remove the payment window from the merchant site at step such that the user can continue with activity on the merchant site. As a result the user may quickly make a payment with minimal interruption from the merchant site. In one example the user only needs to enter a user identifier which if confirmed with the transaction merchant user data to process and complete the payment. The payment screen then disappears and the user proceeds on the merchant site along with any downloads or access from the payment.

The pop up screen also allows the user to pay through a regular payment process Buy with PayPal or through the quick pay feature Pay with KwiKiPay . If the user devices to pay using the normal payment flow the user may be directed to a login page where a password or PIN is entered a review page is presented and a receipt or confirmation is shown. However if the user devices to pay with quick pay the user enters the quick pay user identifier. In this example the user enters a first PIN X and a second PIN Y . Note that the PIN can be one or more numbers letters and or characters. Other types of user identifiers may also be possible such as a single PIN a phrase or other known types of user identifiers.

The payment provider processes the user identifier the user name and the transaction details to determine if the payment can be approved. In this example the payment provider determines the limits of the quick pay account by accessing the account through the user name and the user identifier. If the account is merchant specific the payment provider determines the limits for this particular merchant i.e. Farmville. Once the account is accessed the payment provider determines if the payment amount 20 is within the account limits. If it is and the account has not expired the payment provider approves and processes the payment. The pop up screen then disappears. A separate confirmation be shown in some embodiments.

The user is also given the option of using the quick pay option for subsequent transactions. The user can choose to enable quick pay by simply checking a box. One or more PINs are entered by the user along with a maximum transaction amount. Note that other information may also be requested or requested in place of what is shown in . Examples include requesting an expiration date whether the information applies to just this merchant to a select group of merchants or to all merchants providing different options for PINs etc.

A first part of the management page allows the user to select one of three different types of user identifiers. The first Key PIN allows the user to select a set of three digit X and Y coordinates. In other embodiments there can be more or less coordinates more or less digits and different combinations of digits letters symbols and or characters. The second type Key Note allows the user to enter a phrase or word. The third type Random PINs provides the user with a set of six randomly generated three digit numbers along with their associated letter identifiers. In other embodiments the set can be less or more the digits can be less or more the digits can be of different lengths and or format and the PINs need not be restricted to digits. If the user selects this type each time the user is ready to make a payment using quick pay the user is asked to enter one or more of the numbers associated with one or more letters provided by the payment provider. Examples include entering X and Y numbers B and Y numbers the C number A B and D numbers etc. Each time the request may be random.

In addition to a user identifier type the user may also be asked to select an expiration date for the quick pay account such as month and year. This can provide additional security for the user. When the account is set to expire the user may be notified to set or select new PINs set a new expiration date and make any other changes as desired or requested.

On this page the user can also set a limit for the quick pay account. Here it is a per transaction limit. However other limits may also be set such as number of transactions in a given period e.g. a month total amount of payments in a given period e.g. a week or month etc. The user may also enter additional information in different embodiments as desired by the user or requested by the payment provider.
