The Sequence Listing text file attached hereto created Jan. 17 2013 size 13kilobytes and filed herewith as filename 6137NIAID10PUS12 SEQ 20140917 ST25.txt is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Aspects of the present invention concern the discovery of a gene that encodes Aegyptin a protein that interacts with collagen and inhibits platelet adhesion activation and aggregation. Novel biological tools prophylactics therapeutics diagnostics and methods of use of the foregoing are embodiments.

Blood sucking arthropod saliva is a rich source of molecules that affect hemostasis including vasodilatorsand inhibitors of blood coagulationand platelet aggregation.Among the platelet inhibitors salivary lipocalins bind to and remove pro aggregatory amines such as ADP epinephrine and scrotonin while RGD containing peptides block integrin interaction with fibrinogen.In addition enzymes such as apyrases and lipid acethyl hydrolases degrade biologically active molecules such as ADP and PAF respectively.Further specific antagonists of collagen induced platelet aggregation adhesion have been found in salivary glands of ticks and other hematophagous animals such as leeches.

Most salivary components have been identified through classical procedures where a given function was used to isolate an active molecule.Using sequence similarities transcriptome and proteomics analyses have also been used to identify arthropod saliva compounds.For example Ixolaris from was initially identified by its sequence similarity to a tissue factor pathway inhibitor and has been found to have a potent anticoagulant activity in vitroand antithrombotic effects in vivo.Nevertheless a large number of salivary gland transcript encoded products have no similarity to proteins deposited in databases. Accordingly annotation and functional assignment for these proteins has proven difficult.For example the family of 30 kDa salivary allergens found in different blood sucking arthropods including sp sp and sp.While these proteins are major salivary components that display significant sequence similarity and many investigators have spent considerable effort their function has remained elusive thus far.In this disclosure it is shown that Aegyptin is a specific ligand or binding partner for collagen.

For all of the above reasons it is important to identify antithrombogenic molecules which block platelet adhesion activation and aggregation.

A new family of structurally distinctive proteins identified by their acidic N terminal region and basic C terminal region Aegyptins has been discovered. One member of this family have been identified cloned sequenced and characterized. Aegyptin binds to collagens I V and interferes with its interaction with major physiological ligands GPVI integrin 2 1 and vWf. Notably Aegyptin blocks GPVI interaction with collagen and inhibits platelet aggregation and adhesion.

Collagen is a matrix protein that plays a pivotal role in the process of primary hemostasis at sites of vascular injury it initiates recruitment of circulating platelets and triggers platelet activation cascade required to stimulate thrombus growth.The first step in platelet recruitment to collagen occurs indirectly via binding of platelet glycoprotein GP Ib to collagen bound von Willebrand factor vWf which plays a critical role in tethering of platelets at high shear levels.The rapid off rate of GPIb vWf interactions results in platelet translocation at the site of injury allowing adhesive interactions with slower binding kinetics such as the platelet collagen receptors glycoprotein VI GPVI and integrins to mediate platelet adhesion and activation.The relative contributions of these two receptors to collagen mediated platelet responses are under intense investigation and different models have been proposed in an attempt to explain how platelets are activated by collagen.

Collagen is a triple helical protein that constitutes the major structural component of the extracellular matrix ECM . Damage to the blood vessel endothelium results in the exposure of fibrilar collagen I and III both abundant in the subendothelial space. Interaction of circulating platelets with collagen is a multistage process involving several receptors and the relative contribution of each of them has been intensely investigated. Accordingly the initial tethering of platelet to the ECM is mediated by the Interaction of platelet receptor glycoprotein GP Ib and von Willebrand Factor vWF bound collagen particularly at high shear rates. This interaction allows the binding of the collagen receptor GPVI to its ligand and to initiate cellular activation a process that is reinforced by locally produced thrombin and soluble mediators released from platelets. These events lead to the shift of beta integrins on the platelet surface from a low to a high affinity state thereby enabling them to bind their ligands and to mediate firm adhesion spreading coagulant activity and aggregation.

A number of successful strategies targeting platelets activation have been tested experimentally and therapeutically in humans and shown to affect thrombus formation in vivo Davi G. and Patrono C. 2007 357 2482 2494 . Among these drugs aspirin is well known to prevent thrombus formation by a mechanism that is mediated by inhibition of cyclooxygenase. More recently ADP receptor antagonists were shown to effectively prevent platelet aggregation according to a number of clinical trials Wiviott S. D. et al. 2007 357 2001 2015 . Additionally molecules such as epitifibatide Integrilin which were designed based on integrin antagonists from snake venoms Fox J. W. and Serrano S. M. 13 2927 2934 are currently approved for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Notably exogenous secretion from snake venom and blood sucking invertebrates such as mosquitoes ticks and leeches are rich sources of modulators of hemostasis and the immune system Fox J. W. and Serrano S. M. 2007 13 2927 2934 Ribeiro J. M. and Francischetti I. M. 2003 48 73 88 Maritz Olivier C. et al. 2007 23 397 407 . Recently it was shown that salivary gland expresses Aegyptin a potent collagen binding protein that prevents its interaction with three major ligands namely GPVI vWF and integrin 2 1 Calvo E. et al. 2007 282 26928 26938 . Aegyptin displays sequence and functional similarities to AAPP a collagen binding protein from the salivary gland of Yoshida S. et al. 2008 111 2007 2014 . The aim of this study was to understand the molecular mechanism by which Aegyptin prevents platelet aggregation and also to investigate its potential antithrombotic properties in vivo. It was found that Aegyptin inhibits platelet activation by a novel and unusual mechanism recognition of specific binding sequences involved in collagen interaction with major physiological ligands and unwinding of the triple helical molecule.

Aegyptin is a 30 kDa mosquito salivary protein which displays GEEDA SEQ ID NO 7 repeats and specifically binds to collagen I V. Aegyptin has unique biophysical properties and the molecular mechanism by which it inhibits platelet activation is identified. Light scattering plot shows that Aegyptin displays a monomeric elongated form which explains the apparent molecular weight of 110 kDa estimated by gel filtration chromatography. Atomic force microscopy reveals that collagen exposed to Aegyptin is accompanied by global unwinding of the rope like structure of the triple helix without cleavage and circular dichroism confirms that collagen undergoes a dramatic structural change upon binding to Aegyptin as estimated by a decrease in ellipticity. In addition surface plasmon resonance shows that Aegyptin binds to peptide sequences which mediate collagen interaction with GPVI GPO SEQ ID NO 10 integrin GFOGER SEQ ID NO 8 and particularly with von Willebrand Factor RGQOGVMGFO SEQ ID NO 9 . Aegyptin also binds with high affinity to heat denatured collagen suggesting that the inhibitor recognizes primary sequences of collagen molecule that results in a tight interaction. Truncated forms of Aegyptin were engineered and a peptide containing the C terminus domain devoid of GEEDA SEQ ID NO 7 repeats was shown to interact with collagen and to attenuate platelet aggregation. Notably. Aegyptin prevents laser induced carotid thrombus formation in the presence of Rose Bengal in vivo without observable bleeding in rats. Aegyptin is a potentially useful molecule to develop specific inhibitors of collagen mediated pathological processes.

Additionally methods of preparing the polypeptide embodiments by chemical synthesis and recombinant techniques are disclosed. Approaches to creating genetically altered organisms that express either a wild type or mutant Aegyptin transgene i.e. Aegyptin transgenic or knockout animals are also provided.

Several embodiments also include antibodies that recognize wild type and mutant Aegyptins. Approaches to manufacture monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies are disclosed.

Approaches to rational drug design are also provided and these methods can be used to isolate new Aegyptin family members and to identify molecules that interact with the Aegyptins referred to as binding partners . Several computer based methodologies are discussed which involve three dimensional modeling of the Aegyptin nucleic acid and or protein sequences and the nucleic acid and protein sequences encoding known or suspected binding partners e.g. antibodies and collagen .

Aegyptin characterization assays are also described. These assays test the functionality of an Aegyptin molecule and identify binding partners that interact with the Aegyptins. Some functional assays involve the use of multimeric Aegyptins and or binding partners which are Aegyptins hybrids or binding partners disposed on a support such as a resin bead lipid vesicle or cell membrane. These multimeric agents are contacted with candidate binding partners and the association of the binding partner with the multimeric agent is determined. Successful binding agents can be further analyzed for their effect on Aegyptin function by using cell based assays. One such assay evaluates the effect of Aegyptins hybrids and binding partners on the activation of mitogen activated kinase RAS or the phosphorylation of myelin basic protein. Other Aegyptin characterization assays involve molecular biology techniques designed to identify protein protein interactions e.g. two hybrid systems .

Several pharmaceutical embodiments described herein include medicaments that contain Aegyptins Aegyptin like hybrids and binding partners which interact with Aegyptins. These medicaments can be prepared in accordance with conventional methods of galenic pharmacy for administration to organisms in need of treatment. A therapeutically effective amount of an Aegyptin molecule Aegyptin like hybrid molecule or a binding partner of Aegyptin can be incorporated into a pharmaceutical composition with or without a carrier. Routes of administration of the pharmaceuticals of the invention include but are not limited to topical intranasal transdermal parenteral gastrointestinal transbronchial and transalveolar. Electroporation of Aegyptin nucleic acids e.g. SEQ ID NOS 1 and 3 or fragments thereof as described herein is also contemplated e.g. Medpulsar . These pharmaceuticals can be provided to organisms in need of treatment for platelet adhesion activation and aggregation and other thrombosis related disorders. The section below describes several of the nucleic acid embodiments of the invention.

A new family of structurally distinctive molecules designated Aegyptins has been discovered. These molecules can be identified by their acidic N terminal region and basic C terminal region. Several nucleic acid embodiments described herein include nucleotides encoding Aegyptin molecules and fragments thereof and variants such as spliced variants allelic variants synonymous sequences and homologous or orthologous molecules. Some embodiments for example include genomic DNA RNA and cDNA encoding Aegyptins. Aegyptins can be present in many different organisms including but not limited to plants insects animals and mammals. Further molecules that resemble Aegyptins by the organization of their structure e.g. a molecule having an acidic N terminal region and a basic C terminal region and hybrid molecules having one or more of the aforementioned domains are embodiments of the invention.

The discovery of Aegyptin was made while examining sequences of clones generated from a cDNA library from mosquito saliva. See Example 1 . The coding sequence of Aegyptin cDNA and Aegyptin protein are provided in the Sequence Listing SEQ ID NOS. 1 and 2 respectively.

Data presented infra demonstrate that Aegyptin is a low molecular weight approximately 30 kDa protein Example 2 . In addition Aegyptin displays remarkably tight interaction to collagen types I and III Example 5 . It was also found that Aegyptin prevents collagen induced platelet aggregation Example 4 and can inhibit platelet adhesion to collagen Examples 8 10 .

The Aegyptin nucleotide sequences also include a the DNA sequences shown in the sequence listing SEQ ID NOS 1 and 3 b nucleotide sequences encoding the amino acid sequences shown in the sequence listing SEQ ID NO 2 c any nucleotide sequence that hybridizes to the complement of the DNA sequences shown in the sequence listing SEQ ID NOS 1 and 3 under stringent conditions e.g. hybridization to filter bound DNA in 0.5 M NaHPO 7.0 sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS 1 mM EDTA at 50 C. and washing in 0.2 SSC 0.2 SDS at 50 C. and d any nucleotide sequence that hybridizes to the complement of the DNA sequences that encode an amino acid sequence provided in the sequence listing SEQ ID NO 2 under less stringent conditions e.g. hybridization in 0.5 M NaHPO 7.0 sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS 1 mM EDTA at 37 C. and washing in 0.2 SSC 0.2 SDS at 37 C.

Embodiments also include Aegyptins that are isolated from other organisms e.g. plants molds yeast insects animals and mammals and mutant Aegyptins whether naturally occurring or engineered. Approaches to isolate Aegyptin homologs in other species are provided infra. Embodiments also include fragments modifications derivatives and variants of the sequences described above. Desired embodiments for example include nucleic acids having at least 9 consecutive nucleotides of an Aegyptin or a sequence complementary thereto and preferred fragments of the invention include at least 9 consecutive nucleotides of Aegyptin or a sequence complementary thereto. In this regard the nucleic acid embodiments of the invention can have from 9 to approximately 822 consecutive nucleotides for Aegyptin. Some DNA fragments of the invention for example comprise consist or consist essentially of a nucleic acid with less than or equal to 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 125 150 175 200 250 300 350 400 500 550 600 650 700 750 800 and 822 consecutive nucleotides of an Aegyptin gene e.g. a sequence of SEQ ID NOS 1 and 3 or a complement thereof . Preferably the nucleic acid embodiments however comprise at least 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 or 19 consecutive nucleotides of a sequence of SEQ ID NOS 1 and 3 or complement thereof. More preferably the nucleic acid embodiments comprise at least 20 30 consecutive nucleotides or complement thereof.

The nucleic acid embodiments can also be altered by mutation such as substitutions additions or deletions that provide for sequences encoding functionally equivalent molecules. Due to the degeneracy of nucleotide coding sequences other DNA sequences that encode substantially the same Aegyptin amino acid sequence as depicted in SEQ ID NO 2 can be used in some embodiments of the present invention. These include but are not limited to nucleic acid sequences comprising all or portions of Aegyptin or nucleic acids that complement all or part of Aegyptin that have been altered by the substitution of different codons that encode a functionally equivalent amino acid residue within the sequence thus producing a silent change or a functionally non equivalent amino acid residue within the sequence thus producing a detectable change.

The mutant Aegyptin nucleic acids also include nucleic acids encoding Aegyptin polypeptides or peptides having a nonconservative change that affects the functionality of the molecule e.g. modulates platelet adhesion activation and aggregation . Additional mutant Aegyptins include nucleic acids encoding molecules in the Aegyptin acidic N terminal region or basic C terminal region domain is deleted. Further some Aegyptin mutant nucleic acids encode one or more Aegyptin domains combined in a novel fashion so as to create an Aegyptin like hybrid molecule also referred to as a hybrid . These hybrids can be used to modulate i.e. inhibit or enhance platelet adhesion activation and aggregation for example. Some nucleic acids also encode multimerized Aegyptins or hybrids which are characterized by a structure having at least two of the same domain e.g. a hybrid having two acidic regions or two basic regions . Several assays can be employed to evaluate these molecules for their ability to modulate platelet adhesion activation and aggregation and many are discussed in detail infra. The Aegyptin like hybrids that are identified for their ability to modulate platelet adhesion activation and aggregation can be used in biotechnological assays and can be formulated in pharmaceuticals for the treatment of diseases and abnormalities in various organisms.

The nucleotide sequences encoding the full length Aegyptin protein or fragments thereof can be modified to generate sequences optimized for expression in human cells without altering the encoded polypeptide sequences. Computer algorithms are available for codon optimization. For example web based algorithms e.g. Sharp et al. 1988 Nucleic Acids Res. 16 8207 11 hereby incorporated by reference can be used to generate a nucleotide sequence with optimized expression in a suitable host e.g. human horse dog cat pig chicken or rodent .

Some mutant Aegyptin nucleic acid embodiments include nucleic acids encoding Aegyptin like hybrids wherein one or more regions of the protein are swapped with synthetic polypeptides. For example nucleic acids encoding the Aegyptin acidic region or basic region can be joined to a nucleic acid encoding a synthetic hydrophobic domain e.g. poly leucine so as to create a reagent that better associates with a membrane. Similarly the nucleic acids encoding the various domains of Aegyptin can be swapped with nucleic acids encoding domains from other proteins besides Aegyptins involved in platelet adhesion activation and aggregation. In this manner many different nucleic acids encoding designer peptides can be created and these molecules can be used to modulate specific cellular events for example. The nucleic acid sequences described above also have biotechnological and diagnostic use e.g. in nucleic acid hybridization assays Southern and Northern Blot analysis etc.

By using the Aegyptin nucleic acid sequences disclosed herein e.g. SEQ ID NOS 1 and 3 probes that complement Aegyptin can be designed and manufactured by oligonucleotide synthesis. Desirable probes comprise a nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NOS 1 and 3 that is unique to Aegyptins with preferred probes comprising a nucleic acid fragment of SEQ ID NOS 1 and 3 that is unique to Aegyptin. These probes can be used to screen cDNA or genomic libraries from various organisms e.g. plants molds fungi yeast insects animals and mammals so as to isolate natural sources of the nucleic acid embodiments described herein. Screening can be by filter hybridization for example using duplicate filters. The labeled probe preferably contains at least 15 30 base pairs of a nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NOS 1 and 3 that are unique to Aegyptin. The hybridization washing conditions used are preferably of a lower stringency when the cDNA library is derived from an organism different from the type of organism from which the labeled sequence is originated.

With respect to the cloning of an Aegyptin homolog using murine Aegyptin probes for example hybridization can be performed in 0.5M NaHPO 7.0 sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS 1 mM EDTA at 37 C. overnight and washing can be performed in 0.2 SSC 0.2 SDS at 37 C. Various stringency conditions are well known to those of skill in the art and will vary predictably depending on the specific organisms from which the library and the labeled sequences are derived. For guidance regarding such conditions see for example Sambrook et al. 1989 Cold Springs Harbor Press N.Y. and Ausubel et al. 1989 Green Publishing Associates and Wiley Interscience N.Y.

Further sequences from nucleic acids complementing Aegyptin or portions thereof can be used to make oligonucleotide primers by conventional oligonucleotide synthesis for use in isolation and diagnostic procedures that employ the Polymerase Chain Reaction PCR or other enzyme mediated nucleic acid amplification techniques. An Aegyptin gene homolog can be isolated from a nucleic acid of the organism of interest by performing PCR using two degenerate oligonucleotide primer pools designed on the basis of amino acid sequences within the Aegyptin gene products disclosed herein. The template for the reaction can be cDNA obtained by reverse transcription of mRNA prepared from for example cells or tissue of an organism known or believed to express an Aegyptin. A variety of PCR techniques are familiar to those skilled in the art. For a review of PCR technology see Molecular Cloning to Genetic Engineering White B. A. Ed. in 67 Humana Press Totowa 1997 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and the publication entitled PCR Methods and Applications 1991 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

For amplification of mRNAs it is within the scope of the invention to reverse transcribe mRNA into cDNA followed by PCR RT PCR or to use a single enzyme for both steps as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 322 770 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Another technique involves the use of Reverse Transcriptase Asymmetric Gap Ligase Chain Reaction RT AGLCR as described by Marshall R. L. et al. 4 80 84 1994 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Briefly RNA is isolated following standard procedures from an appropriate cellular or tissue source. A reverse transcription reaction is performed on the RNA using an oligonucleotide primer specific for the most 5 end of the amplified fragment as a primer of first strand synthesis. The resulting RNA DNA hybrid is then tailed with guanines using a standard terminal transferase reaction. The hybrid is then digested with RNAse H and second strand synthesis is primed with a poly C primer. Thus cDNA sequences upstream of the amplified fragment are easily isolated. For a review of cloning strategies which can be used see e.g. Sambrook et al. 1989 supra.

In each of these amplification procedures primers on either side of the sequence to be amplified are added to a suitably prepared nucleic acid sample along with dNTPs and a thermostable polymerase such as Taq polymerase Pfu polymerase or Vent polymerase. The nucleic acid in the sample is denatured and the primers are specifically hybridized to complementary nucleic acid sequences in the sample. The hybridized primers are then extended. Thereafter another cycle of denaturation hybridization and extension is initiated. The cycles are repeated multiple times to produce an amplified fragment containing the nucleic acid sequence between the primer sites. PCR has further been described in several patents including U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 683 195 4 683 202 and 4 965 188 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

The primers are selected to be substantially complementary to a portion of the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NOS 1 and 3 that is unique to Aegyptin thereby allowing the sequences between the primers to be amplified. Preferably primers are 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 and 30 nucleotides in length. The formation of stable hybrids depends on the melting temperature Tm of the DNA. The Tm depends on the length of the primer the ionic strength of the solution and the G C content. The higher the G C content of the primer the higher is the melting temperature because G C pairs are held by three H bonds whereas A T pairs have only two. The G C content of the amplification primers of the present invention preferably ranges between 10 and 75 more preferably between 35 and 60 and most preferably between 40 and 55 . The appropriate length for primers under a particular set of assay conditions can be empirically determined by one of skill in the art.

The spacing of the primers relates to the length of the segment to be amplified. In the context of the present invention amplified segments carrying nucleic acid sequence encoding fragments of Aegyptin can range in size from at least about 25 bp to 35 kb. Amplification fragments from 25 1000 bp are typical fragments from 50 1000 bp are preferred and fragments from 100 600 bp are highly preferred. It will be appreciated that amplification primers can be of any sequence that allows for specific amplification of a region of an Aegyptin and can for example include modifications such as restriction sites to facilitate cloning.

The PCR product can be subcloned and sequenced to ensure that the amplified sequences represent the sequences of an Aegyptin gene. The PCR fragment can then be used to isolate a full length cDNA clone by a variety of methods. For example the amplified fragment can be labeled and used to screen a cDNA library such as a bacteriophage cDNA library. Alternatively the labeled fragment can be used to isolate genomic clones via the screening of a genomic library. The identification and characterization of genomic clones from many different organisms particularly humans is helpful for designing diagnostic tests and clinical protocols for treating and preventing aberrations or diseases involving defects in platelet adhesion activation and aggregation and other thrombosis related disorders. For example sequences derived from regions adjacent to the intron exon boundaries of human Aegyptin genes can be used to design primers for use in amplification assays to detect mutations within the exons introns splice sites e.g. splice acceptor and or donor sites etc. that can be used in diagnostics.

The Aegyptin gene sequences can additionally be used to isolate mutant Aegyptin gene alleles. Such mutant alleles can be isolated from organisms either known or proposed to have a genotype that contributes to a disorder involving aberrant platelet adhesion activation and aggregation. Mutant alleles and mutant allele products can then be utilized in the therapeutic and diagnostic systems described below. Additionally such Aegyptin gene sequences can be used to detect Aegyptin gene regulatory e.g. promoter or promotor enhancer defects that can affect platelet adhesion activation and aggregation.

A cDNA of a mutant Aegyptin gene can be isolated for example by using PCR. In this case the first cDNA strand can be synthesized by hybridizing an oligo dT oligonucleotide to mRNA isolated from tissue known or suspected to be expressed in an individual putatively carrying the mutant Aegyptin allele and by extending the new strand with reverse transcriptase. The second strand of the cDNA is then synthesized using an oligonucleotide that hybridizes specifically to the 5 end of the normal gene. Using these two primers the product is then amplified via PCR cloned into a suitable vector and organismed to DNA sequence analysis through methods well known to those of skill in the art. By comparing the DNA sequence of the mutant Aegyptin allele to that of the normal Aegyptin allele the mutation s responsible for the loss or alteration of function of the mutant Aegyptin gene product can be ascertained.

Alternatively a genomic library can be constructed using DNA obtained from an organism suspected of or known to carry the mutant Aegyptin allele or a cDNA library can be constructed using RNA from a tissue known or suspected to express the mutant Aegyptin allele. The normal Aegyptin gene or any suitable fragment thereof can then be labeled and used as a probe to identify the corresponding mutant Aegyptin allele in such libraries. Clones containing the mutant Aegyptin gene sequences can then be purified and subjected to sequence analysis according to methods well known to those of skill in the art.

Additionally an expression library can be constructed utilizing cDNA synthesized from for example RNA isolated from a tissue known or suspected to express a mutant Aegyptin allele in an organism suspected of or known to carry such a mutant allele. In this manner gene products made by the putatively mutant tissue can be expressed and screened using standard antibody screening techniques in conjunction with antibodies raised against the normal Aegyptin gene product. For screening techniques see for example Harlow E. and Lane eds. 1988 Cold Spring Harbor Press Cold Spring Harbor. By using conventional antibody screening techniques and the anti Aegyptin antibody described in Example 4 one can isolate Aegyptin from expression libraries of various organisms. In cases where an Aegyptin mutation results in an expressed gene product with altered function e.g. as a result of a missense or a frameshift mutation a polyclonal set of antibodies against Aegyptin are likely to cross react with the mutant Aegyptin gene product. Library clones detected via their reaction with such labeled antibodies can be purified and subjected to sequence analysis according to methods well known to those of skill in the art.

The invention also encompasses a DNA vectors that contain any of the foregoing Aegyptin coding sequences and or their complements i.e. antisense or RNAi vectors b DNA expression vectors that contain any of the foregoing Aegyptin coding sequences operatively associated with a regulatory element that directs the expression of the coding sequences and c genetically engineered host cells that contain any of the foregoing Aegyptin coding sequences operatively associated with a regulatory element that directs the expression of the coding sequences in the host cell. These recombinant constructs are capable of replicating autonomously in a host cell. Alternatively the recombinant constructs can become integrated into the chromosomal DNA of a host cell. Such recombinant polynucleotides typically comprise an Aegyptin genomic or cDNA polynucleotide of semi synthetic or synthetic origin by virtue of human manipulation. Therefore recombinant nucleic acids comprising Aegyptin sequences and complements thereof that are not naturally occurring are provided by embodiments of this invention.

Although nucleic acids encoding an Aegyptin or nucleic acids having sequences that complement an Aegyptin gene as they appear in nature can be employed they will often be altered e.g. by deletion substitution or insertion and can be accompanied by sequence not present in humans. As used herein regulatory elements include but are not limited to inducible and non inducible promoters enhancers operators and other elements known to those skilled in the art that drive and regulate expression. Such regulatory elements include but are not limited to the cytomegalovirus hCMV immediate early gene the early or late promoters of SV40 adenovirus the lac system the trp system the TAC system the TRC system the major operator and promoter regions of phage A the control regions of fd coat protein the promoter for 3 phosphoglycerate kinase the promoters of acid phosphatase and the promoters of the yeast mating factors.

In addition recombinant Aegyptin encoding nucleic acid sequences and their complementary sequences can be engineered so as to modify processing or expression of the Aegyptin. For example and not by way of limitation the Aegyptin gene can be combined with a promoter sequence and or ribosome binding site or a signal sequence can be inserted upstream of Aegyptin encoding sequences to permit secretion of the Aegyptin and thereby facilitate harvesting or bioavailability. Additionally a given Aegyptin nucleic acid can be mutated in vitro or in vivo to create and or destroy translation initiation and or termination sequences or to create variations in coding regions and or form new restriction sites or destroy preexisting ones or to facilitate further in vitro modification. Any technique for mutagenesis known in the art can be used including but not limited to in vitro site directed mutagenesis. Hutchinson et al. 253 6551 1978 herein incorporated by reference .

Further nucleic acids encoding other proteins or domains of other proteins can be joined to nucleic acids encoding an Aegyptin so as to create a fusion protein. Nucleotides encoding fusion proteins can include but are not limited to a full length Aegyptin a truncated Aegyptin or a peptide fragment of an Aegyptin fused to an unrelated protein or peptide such as for example a transmembrane sequence which better anchors the Aegyptin peptide fragment to the cell membrane an Ig Fc domain which increases the stability and half life of the resulting fusion protein e.g. Aegyptin Ig or an enzyme fluorescent protein luminescent protein which can be used as a marker e.g. an Aegyptin Green Fluorescent Protein Aegyptin GFP fusion protein . The fusion proteins are useful as biotechnological tools or pharmaceuticals or both as will be discussed infra. The section below describes several of the polypeptides of the invention and methods of making these molecules.

Aegyptins Aegyptin polypeptides fragments of these molecules and chemicals that resemble these molecules including but not limited to peptidomimetics modified Aegyptins and derivatives or variants of Aegyptins are also embodiments. Aegyptin polypeptides can be present either naturally or through genetic engineering in a number of organisms e.g. plants insects amphibians reptiles birds other animals cats dogs rodents primates humans and other mammals . The Aegyptin family members have a novel structure that contains an acidic N terminal region and a basic C terminal region.

Aegyptin has a cleaved N terminal signal peptide that allows for insertion into membranes via a conventional ER to Golgi routing .

The nucleic acids encoding an Aegyptin or fragments thereof described in the previous section can be manipulated using conventional techniques in molecular biology so as to create recombinant constructs that express Aegyptin protein or fragments of Aegyptin protein. The Aegyptin polypeptides or derivatives thereof include but are not limited to those containing as a primary amino acid sequence all of the amino acid sequence substantially as depicted in the Sequence Listing SEQ ID NO 2 and fragments of SEQ ID NO 2 at least three amino acids in length including altered sequences in which functionally equivalent amino acid residues are substituted for residues within the sequence resulting in a silent change. Preferred fragments of a sequence of SEQ ID NO 2 are at least three amino acids and comprise amino acid sequence unique to Aegyptins including altered sequences in which functionally equivalent amino acid residues are substituted for residues within the sequence resulting in a silent change. The Aegyptin peptide fragments can comprise consist or consist essentially of peptides that are less than or equal to 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 115 130 150 175 200 225 250 270 or 273 amino acids in length.

Embodiments encompass proteins that are functionally equivalent to the Aegyptins encoded by the nucleotide sequences described in SEQ ID NO 2 as judged by any of a number of criteria including but not limited to the ability to bind collagen the binding affinity for a particular matrix protein the resulting biological effect of Aegyptin interaction e.g. change in platelet adhesion activation and aggregation. Such functionally equivalent Aegyptins include but are not limited to additions or substitutions of amino acid residues within the amino acid sequence encoded by the Aegyptin nucleotide sequences described above but which result in a silent change thus producing a functionally equivalent gene product. For example embodiments include Aegyptins that have one or more amino acid residues within the Aegyptin polypeptide of SEQ ID NO 2 and fragments of SEQ ID NO 2 that are substituted by another amino acid of a similar polarity that acts as a functional equivalent resulting in a silent alteration. Substitutes for an amino acid within the sequence can be selected from other members of the class to which the amino acid belongs. For example the non polar hydrophobic amino acids include alanine leucine isoleucine valine proline phenylalanine tryptophan and methionine. The polar neutral amino acids include glycine serine threonine cysteine tyrosine asparagine and glutamine. The positively charged basic amino acids include arginine lysine and histidine. The negatively charged acidic amino acids include aspartic acid and glutamic acid. The aromatic amino acids include phenylalanine tryptophan and tyrosine.

Additional embodiments include mutant Aegyptins e.g. Aegyptin wherein one or more amino acid residues within the Aegyptin polypeptide of SEQ ID NO 2 and fragments of SEQ ID NO 2 are substituted by another amino acid resulting in a non conservative change. While random mutations can be made to Aegyptin DNA using random mutagenesis techniques well known to those skilled in the art and the resulting mutant Aegyptins tested for activity site directed mutations of the Aegyptin coding sequence can be engineered using site directed mutagenesis techniques well known to those skilled in the art to generate mutant Aegyptins with increased function e.g. higher binding affinity for a specific matrix protein and or greater fibrinolysis promotion capability or decreased function e.g. lower binding affinity for a particular matrix protein and or decreased fibrinolysis promotion capability.

Non conservative changes can be engineered at these variable positions to alter function e.g. collagen binding affinity or capability to inhibit platelet adhesion activation and aggregation promotion or both. Alternatively where alteration of function is desired deletion or non conservative alterations of the conserved regions can be engineered. For example deletion or non conservative alterations substitutions or insertions of amino acid residues in regions of the polypeptide can be engineered to produce a mutant Aegyptin that binds collagen but does not inhibit platelet adhesion activation and aggregation.

Other embodiments include polypeptides that have homology to an Aegyptin and function as a membrane bound modulator of platelet adhesion activation and aggregation. The term homology to Aegyptin is meant to include nucleic acid or protein sequence homology or three dimensional homology. Several techniques exist to determine nucleic acid or protein sequence homology and or three dimensional homology of proteins. These methods are routinely employed to discover the extent of homology that one sequence domain or model has to a target sequence domain or model. Because the region of Aegyptin that modulates fibrinolysis can be quite small e.g. 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 15 18 20 22 25 30 amino acids in length embodiments of the invention can exhibit a vast degree of homology to full length Aegyptin. For example a fusion protein having a small region of Aegyptin can exhibit a low degree of overall homology to Aegyptin yet retain the ability to function as a modulator of platelet adhesion activation and aggregation equivalent to Aegyptin. Thus some embodiments can have from 1 homology to 100 homology to full length Aegyptin. That is embodiments can comprise consist or consist essentially of 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 10.0 11.0 12.0 13.0 14.0 15.0 16.0 17.0 18.0 19.0 20.0 21.0 22.0 23.0 24.0 25.0 26.0 27.0 28.0 29.0 30.0 31.0 32.0 33.0 34.0 35.0 36.0 37.0 38.0 39.0 40.0 41.0 42.0 43.0 44.0 45.0 46.0 47.0 48.0 49.0 50.0 51.0 52.0 53.0 54.0 55.0 56.0 57.0 58.0 59.0 60.0 61.0 62.0 63.0 64.0 65.0 66.0 67.0 68.0 69.0 70.0 71.0 72.0 73.0 74.0 75.0 76.0 77.0 78.0 79.0 80.0 81.0 82.0 83.0 84.0 85.0 86.0 87.0 88.0 89.0 90.0 91.0 92.0 93.0 94.0 95.0 96.0 97.0 98.0 99.0 and 100.0 homology to a full length Aegyptin e.g. Aegyptin .

Therefore embodiments include polypeptides varying in size from 3 amino acids up to and including the full length Aegyptin protein that have 1 100 homology to an Aegyptin and exhibit the ability to function as a membrane bound modulator of platelet adhesion activation and aggregation. Several homology searching programs based on nucleic acid or amino acid sequence are known in the art and can be used to identify molecules that are homologous to Aegyptin. Some approaches to identify molecules homologous to Aegyptins are provided infra.

The Aegyptins and Aegyptin like hybrids can be prepared by chemical synthesis methods such as solid phase peptide synthesis using techniques known in the art such as those set forth by Merrifield et al. 85 2149 1964 Houghten et al. 82 51 32 1985 Stewart and Young Pierce Chem Co. Rockford Ill. 1984 and Creighton 1983 W. H. Freeman Co. N.Y. herein incorporated by reference. Such polypeptides can be synthesized with or without a methionine on the amino terminus. Chemically synthesized Aegyptin and fragments of Aegyptin can be oxidized using methods set forth in these references to form disulfide bridges. Aegyptins and fragments of Aegyptin can be employed as biologically active or immunological substitutes for natural purified Aegyptin and fragments of Aegyptin.

While the Aegyptins and hybrids can be chemically synthesized it can be more effective to produce these polypeptides by recombinant DNA technology using techniques well known in the art. Such methods can be used to construct expression vectors containing the Aegyptin nucleotide sequences for example and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals. These methods include for example in vitro recombinant DNA techniques synthetic techniques and in vivo genetic recombination. Alternatively RNA capable of encoding an Aegyptin nucleotide sequences can be chemically synthesized using for example synthesizers. See for example the techniques described in 1984 Gait M. J. ed. IRL Press Oxford which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

In several embodiments Aegyptins fragments of Aegyptins and Aegyptin like hybrids are expressed in a cell line. For example some cells are made to express the Aegyptin polypeptide of SEQ ID NO 2 or fragments of SEQ ID NO 2. The sequences constructs vectors clones and other materials comprising the present invention can advantageously be in enriched or isolated form. As used herein enriched means that the concentration of the material is at least about 2 5 10 100 or 1000 times its natural concentration for example advantageously 0.01 by weight preferably at least about 0.1 by weight. Enriched preparations from about 0.5 1 5 10 and 20 by weight are also contemplated. The term isolated requires that the material be removed from its original environment e.g. the natural environment if it is naturally occurring . For example a naturally occurring polynucleotide present in a living animal is not isolated but the same polynucleotide separated from some or all of the coexisting materials in the natural system is isolated. It is also advantageous that the sequences be in purified form. The term purified does not require absolute purity rather it is intended as a relative definition. Isolated proteins have been conventionally purified to electrophoretic homogeneity by Coomassie staining for example. Purification of starting material or natural material to at least one order of magnitude preferably two or three orders and more preferably four or five orders of magnitude is expressly contemplated.

A variety of host expression vector systems can be utilized to express the Aegyptins of the invention. Where the Aegyptin or hybrid is a soluble derivative e.g. hybrids having a truncated or deleted hydrophobic domain it can be recovered from the culture i.e. from the host cell in cases where the peptide or polypeptide is not secreted and from the culture media in cases where the peptide or polypeptide is secreted by the cells. However the expression systems also encompass engineered host cells that express the Aegyptin or functional equivalents in situ i.e. anchored in the cell membrane. Purification or enrichment of the Aegyptin from such expression systems can be accomplished using appropriate detergents and lipid micelles and methods well known to those skilled in the art. However such engineered host cells themselves can be used in situations where it is important not only to retain the structural and functional characteristics of the Aegyptin but to assess biological activity e.g. in drug screening assays.

The expression systems that can be used for purposes of the invention include but are not limited to microorganisms such as bacteria e.g. or transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing Aegyptin nucleotide sequences yeast e.g. transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing the Aegyptin nucleotide sequences insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors e.g. baculaovirus containing the Aegyptin sequences plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors e.g. cauliflower mosaic virus CaMV tobacco mosaic virus TMV or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors e.g. Ti plasmid containing Aegyptin nucleotide sequences or mammalian cell systems e.g. COS CHO BHK 293 3T3 harboring recombinant expression constructs containing promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells e.g. metallothionein promoter or from mammalian viruses e.g. the adenovirus late promoter the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter .

In bacterial systems a number of expression vectors can be advantageously selected depending upon the use intended for the Aegyptin gene product being expressed. For example when a large quantity of such a protein is to be produced for the generation of pharmaceutical compositions of Aegyptin protein or for raising antibodies to the Aegyptin protein for example vectors which direct the expression of high levels of fusion protein products that are readily purified can be desirable. Such vectors include but are not limited to the expression vector pUR278 Ruther et al. 2 1791 1983 in which the Aegyptin coding sequence can be ligated individually into the vector in frame with the lacZ coding region so that a fusion protein is produced pIN vectors Inouye Inouye 13 3101 3109 1985 Van Heeke Schuster 264 5503 5509 1989 and the like. pGEX vectors can also be used to express foreign polypeptides as fusion proteins with glutathione S transferase GST . In general such fusion proteins are soluble and can be purified from lysed cells by adsorption to glutathione agarose beads followed by elution in the presence of free glutathione. The PGEX vectors are designed to include thrombin or factor Xa protease cleavage sites so that the cloned target gene product can be released from the GST moiety.

In an insect system nuclear polyhedrosis virus AcNPV is used as a vector to express foreign genes. The virus grows in cells. The Aegyptin gene coding sequence can be cloned individually into non essential regions for example the polyhedrin gene of the virus and placed under control of an AcNPV promoter for example the polyhedrin promoter . Successful insertion of Aegyptin gene coding sequence will result in inactivation of the polyhedrin gene and production of non occluded recombinant virus i.e. virus lacking the proteinaceous coat coded for by the polyhedrin gene . These recombinant viruses are then used to infect cells in which the inserted gene is expressed. E.g. see Smith et al. 46 584 1983 and Smith U.S. Pat. No. 4 215 051 .

In mammalian host cells a number of viral based expression systems can be utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector the Aegyptin nucleotide sequence of interest can be ligated to an adenovirus transcription translation control complex e.g. the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene can then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination. Insertion in a non essential region of the viral genome e.g. region E1 or E3 will result in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing the Aegyptin gene product in infected hosts. E.g. See Logan Shenk 81 3655 3659 1984 . Specific initiation signals can also be required for efficient translation of inserted Aegyptin nucleotide sequences. These signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. In cases where an entire Aegyptin gene or cDNA including its own initiation codon and adjacent sequences is inserted into the appropriate expression vector no additional translational control signals are needed.

However in cases where only a portion of the Aegyptin coding sequence is inserted exogenous translational control signals including perhaps the ATG initiation codon should be provided. Furthermore the initiation codon should be in phase with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert. These exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be of a variety of origins both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression can be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements transcription terminators etc. See Bittner et al. 153 516 544 1987 .

In addition a host cell strain can be chosen which modulates the expression of the inserted sequences or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Such modifications e.g. glycosylation and processing e.g. cleavage of protein products are important for the function of the protein. Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post translational processing and modification of proteins and gene products. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed. To this end eukaryotic host cells that possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript glycosylation and phosphorylation of the gene product can be used. Such mammalian host cells include but are not limited to CHO VERO BHK HeLa COS MDCK 293 3T3 and WI38.

For long term high yield production of recombinant proteins stable expression is preferred. For example cell lines that stably express the Aegyptin sequences described above can be engineered. Rather than using expression vectors that contain viral origins of replication host cells can be transformed with DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements e.g. promoter enhancer sequences transcription terminators polyadenylation sites etc. and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA engineered cells are allowed to grow for 1 2 days in an enriched media and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn are cloned and expanded into cell lines. This method is advantageously used to engineer cell lines which express the Aegyptin gene product. Such engineered cell lines are particularly useful in screening and evaluation of compounds that affect the endogenous activity of the Aegyptin gene product.

A number of selection systems can be used including but not limited to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase Wigler et al. 11 223 1977 hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase Szybalska Szybalski 48 2026 1962 and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase Lowy et al. 22 817 1980 genes can be employed in tk hgprt or aprt cells respectively. Also antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for the following genes dhfr which confers resistance to methotrexate Wigler et al. 77 3567 1980 O Hare et al. 78 1527 1981 gpt which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid Mulligan Berg 78 2072 1981 neo which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G 418 Colberre Garapin et al. 150 1 1981 and hygro which confers resistance to hygromycin Santerre et al. 30 147 1984 .

Alternatively any fusion protein can be readily purified by utilizing an antibody specific for the fusion protein being expressed. For example a system described by Janknecht et al. allows for the ready purification of non denatured fusion proteins expressed in human cell lines. Janknecht et al. 88 8972 8976 1991 . In this system the gene of interest is subcloned into a vaccinia recombination plasmid such that the gene s open reading frame is translationally fused to an amino terminal tag consisting of six histidine residues. Extracts from cells infected with recombinant vaccinia virus are loaded onto Ninitriloacetic acid agarose columns and histidine tagged proteins are selectively eluted with imidazole containing buffers. Example 2 provides a more detailed description of methods to express the proteins encoded by the nucleic acids of the invention.

The Aegyptin gene products can also be expressed in plants insects and animals so as to create a transgenic organism. Plants and insects of almost any species can be made to express an Aegyptin fragments of Aegyptin or Aegyptin like hybrid. Desirable transgenic plant systems having an Aegyptin fragments of Aegyptin or Aegyptin like hybrid include maize and . Desirable insect systems an Aegyptin fragments of Aegyptin or Aegyptin like hybrid include for example and . Animals of any species including but not limited to amphibians reptiles birds mice rats rabbits guinea pigs pigs micro pigs goats dogs cats and non human primates e.g. baboons monkeys and chimpanzees can be used to generate Aegyptin transgenic animals. Transgenic organisms of the invention desirably exhibit germline transfer of wild type or mutant Aegyptins fragments of Aegyptin or Aegyptin like hybrids. Other transgenic organisms are engineered to express human Aegyptins fragments of Aegyptins or Aegyptin like hybrids. Still other transgenic organisms of the invention exhibit complete knockouts or point mutations of one or more existing Aegyptin genes. For example in one embodiment a transgenic animal comprises a knockout of Aegyptin and in another embodiment a transgenic animal comprises at least one point mutation in Aegyptin.

Any technique known in the art is preferably used to introduce the Aegyptin transgene into animals to produce the founder lines of transgenic animals or to knock out or replace existing Aegyptin genes. Such techniques include but are not limited to pronuclear microinjection Hoppe P. C. and Wagner T. E. 1989 U.S. Pat. No. 4 873 191 retrovirus mediated gene transfer into germ lines Van der Putten et al. 82 6148.6152 1985 gene targeting in embryonic stem cells Thompson et al. 56 313 321 1989 electroporation of embryos Lo 3 1803 1814 1983 and sperm mediated gene transfer Lavitrano et al. 57 717 723 1989 etc. For a review of such techniques see Gordon 115 171 229 1989 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

Aspects of the invention provide for transgenic animals that carry an Aegyptin transgene in all their cells as well as animals that carry the transgene in some but not all their cells i.e. mosaic animals. The transgene can be integrated as a single transgene or in concatamers e.g. head to head tandems or head to tail tandems. The transgene can also be selectively introduced into and activated in a particular cell type by following for example the teaching of Lasko et al. Lasko M. et al. 89 6232 6236 1992 . The regulatory sequences required for such a cell type specific activation will depend upon the particular cell type of interest and will be apparent to those of skill in the art.

When it is desired that the Aegyptin gene transgene be integrated into the chromosomal site of the endogenous Aegyptin gene gene targeting is preferred. Briefly when such a technique is to be utilized vectors containing some nucleotide sequences homologous to the endogenous Aegyptin gene are designed for the purpose of integrating via homologous recombination with chromosomal sequences into and disrupting the function of the nucleotide sequence of the endogenous Aegyptin gene. The transgene can also be selectively introduced into a particular cell type thus inactivating the endogenous Aegyptin gene in only that cell type by following for example the teaching of Gu et al. Gu et al. 265 103 106 1994 . The regulatory sequences required for such a cell type specific inactivation will depend upon the particular cell type of interest and will be apparent to those of skill in the art.

Once transgenic animals have been generated the expression of the recombinant Aegyptin gene can be assayed utilizing standard techniques. Initial screening can be accomplished by Southern blot analysis or PCR techniques to analyze animal tissues to assay whether integration of the transgene has taken place. The level of mRNA expression of the transgene in the tissues of the transgenic animals can also be assessed using techniques which include but are not limited to Northern blot analysis of tissue samples obtained from the animal in situ hybridization analysis and RT PCR. Samples of Aegyptin gene expressing tissue can also be evaluated immunocytochemically using antibodies specific for the Aegyptin transgene product.

In addition to the naturally occurring Aegyptins or peptide based hybrids embodiments include derivative or modified molecules that produce a more desirable cellular response. For example a derivative Aegyptin can include a polypeptide that has been engineered to have one or more cystine residues incorporated into the protein so as to promote the formation of a more stable derivative through disulfide bond formation. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 908 773 . In the past investigators have employed computers and computer graphics programs to aid in assessing the appropriateness of potential cystine linkage sites. Perry L. J. Wetzel R. 226 555 557 1984 Pabo C. O. et al. 25 5987 5991 1986 Bott R. et al. European Patent Application Ser. No. 130 756 Perry L. J. Wetzel R. 25 733 739 1986 Wetzel R. B. European Patent Application Ser. No. 155 832 . The introduction of a cystine residue in a polypeptide can be accomplished using conventional molecular biology techniques.

Additional Aegyptin and hybrid derivatives include peptidomimetics that resemble a polypeptide of interest. The naturally occurring amino acids employed in the biological production of peptides all have the L configuration. Synthetic peptides can be prepared employing conventional synthetic methods utilizing L amino acids D amino acids or various combinations of amino acids of the two different configurations. Synthetic compounds that mimic the conformation and desirable features of a particular peptide e.g. an oligopeptide once such peptide has been found but that avoids the undesirable features e.g. flexibility loss of conformation and bond breakdown are known as a peptidomimetics . See e.g. Spatola A. F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Amino Acids. Peptides and Proteins Weistein B Ed. Vol. 7 pp. 267 357 Marcel Dekker New York 1983 which describes the use of the methylenethio bioisostere CHS as an amide replacement in enkephalin analogues and Szelke et al. In peptides Structure and Function Proceedings of the Eighth American Peptide Symposium Hruby and Rich Eds. pp. 579 582 Pierce Chemical Co. Rockford Ill. 1983 which describes renin inhibitors having both the methyleneamino CHNH and hydroxyethylcne CHOHCH bioisosteres at the Lou Val amide bond in the 6 13 octapeptide derived from angiotensinogen .

In general the design and synthesis of a peptidomimetic involves starting with the amino acid sequence of the peptide and conformational data e.g. geometry data such as bond lengths and angles of a desired peptide e.g. the most probable simulated peptide . That data is then used to determine the geometries that should be designed into the peptidomimetic. Numerous methods and techniques are known in the art for performing this step any of which could be used. See e.g. Farmer P. S. Ariens E. J. ed. Vol. 10 pp. 119 143 Academic Press New York London Toronto Sydney and San Francisco 1980 Farmer et al. in TIPS 9 82 pp. 362 365 Verber et al. in TINS 9 85 pp. 392 396 Kaltenbronn et al. in 33 838 845 1990 and Spatola A. F. in Vol. 7 pp. 267 357 Chapter 5 Peptide Backbone Modifications A Structure Activity Analysis of Peptides Containing Amide Bond Surrogates. Conformational Constraints and Relations B. Weisten ed. Marcell Dekker New York pub. 1983 Kemp D. S. Peptidomimetics and the Template Approach to Nucleation of beta sheets and alpha helices in Peptides Tibech Vol. 8 pp. 249 255 1990 . Additional teachings can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 288 707 5 552 534 5 811 515 5 817 626 5 817 879 5 821 231 and 5 874 529. The section below describes antibodies of the invention and methods of making these molecules.

Following synthesis or expression and isolation or purification of the Aegyptin protein or a portion thereof the isolated or purified protein can be used to generate antibodies and tools for identifying agents that interact with Aegyptin and fragments of Aegyptin. Depending on the context the term antibodies can encompass polyclonal monoclonal chimeric single chain Fab fragments and fragments produced by a Fab expression library. Antibodies that recognize Aegyptin and fragments of Aegyptin have many uses including but not limited to biotechnological applications therapeutic prophylactic applications and diagnostic applications.

For the production of antibodies various hosts including goats rabbits rats mice etc. can be immunized by injection with Aegyptin or any portion fragment or oligopeptide that retains immunogenic properties. Depending on the host species various adjuvants can be used to increase immunological response. Such adjuvants include but are not limited to Freund s mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide and surface active substances such as lysolecithin pluronic polyols polyanions peptides oil emulsions keyhole limpet hemocyanin and dinitrophenol. BCG Calmette Guerin and are also potentially useful adjuvants.

Peptides used to induce specific antibodies can have an amino acid sequence consisting of at least three amino acids and preferably at least 10 to 15 amino acids. Preferably short stretches of amino acids encoding fragments of Aegyptin are fused with those of another protein such as keyhole limpet hemocyanin such that an antibody is produced against the chimeric molecule. While antibodies capable of specifically recognizing Aegyptin can be generated by injecting synthetic 3 mer 10 mer and 15 mer peptides that correspond to a protein sequence of Aegyptin into mice a more diverse set of antibodies can be generated by using recombinant Aegyptin purified Aegyptin or fragments of Aegyptin.

To generate antibodies to Aegyptin and fragments of Aegyptin substantially pure Aegyptin or a fragment of Aegyptin is isolated from a transfected or transformed cell. The concentration of the polypeptide in the final preparation is adjusted for example by concentration on an Amicon filter device to the level of a few micrograms ml. Monoclonal or polyclonal antibody to the polypeptide of interest can then be prepared as follows 

Monoclonal antibodies to Aegyptin or a fragment of Aegyptin can be prepared using any technique that provides for the production of antibody molecules by continuous cell lines in culture. These include but are not limited to the hybridoma technique originally described by Koehler and Milstein 256 495 497 1975 the human B cell hybridoma technique Kosbor et al. 4 72 1983 Cote et al 80 2026 2030 1983 and the EBV hybridoma technique Cole et al. Alan R. Liss Inc New York N.Y. pp 77 96 1985 . In addition techniques developed for the production of chimeric antibodies the splicing of mouse antibody genes to human antibody genes to obtain a molecule with appropriate antigen specificity and biological activity can be used. Morrison et al. 81 6851 6855 1984 Neuberger et al. Nature 312 604 608 1984 Takeda et al. 314 452.454 1985 . Alternatively techniques described for the production of single chain antibodies U.S. Pat. No. 4 946 778 can be adapted to produce Aegyptin specific single chain antibodies. Antibodies can also be produced by inducing in vivo production in the lymphocyte population or by screening recombinant immunoglobulin libraries or panels of highly specific binding reagents as disclosed in Orlandi et al. 86 3833 3837 1989 and Winter G. and Milstein C 349 293 299 1991 .

Antibody fragments that contain specific binding sites for Aegyptin can also be generated. For example such fragments include but are not limited to the F ab fragments that can be produced by pepsin digestion of the antibody molecule and the Fab fragments that can be generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of the F ab fragments. Alternatively Fab expression libraries can be constructed to allow rapid and easy identification of monoclonal Fab fragments with the desired specificity. Huse W. D. et al. 256 1275 1281 1989 .

By one approach monoclonal antibodies to Aegyptin or fragments thereof are made as follows. Briefly a mouse is repetitively inoculated with a few micrograms of the selected protein or peptides derived therefrom over a period of a few weeks. The mouse is then sacrificed and the antibody producing cells of the spleen isolated. The spleen cells are fused in the presence of polyethylene glycol with mouse myeloma cells and the excess unfused cells destroyed by growth of the system on selective media comprising aminopterin HAT media . The successfully fused cells are diluted and aliquots of the dilution placed in wells of a microtiter plate where growth of the culture is continued. Antibody producing clones are identified by detection of antibody in the supernatant fluid of the wells by immunoassay procedures such as ELISA as originally described by Engvall E. 70 419 1980 and derivative methods thereof. Selected positive clones can be expanded and their monoclonal antibody product harvested for use. Detailed procedures for monoclonal antibody production are described in Davis L. et al. Elsevier New York. Section 21 2.

Polyclonal antiserum containing antibodies to heterogenous epitopes of a single protein can be prepared by immunizing suitable animals with the expressed protein or peptides derived therefrom described above which can be unmodified or modified to enhance immunogenicity. Effective polyclonal antibody production is affected by many factors related both to the antigen and the host species. For example small molecules tend to be less immunogenic than others and can requite the use of carriers and adjuvant. Also host animals vary in response to site of inoculations and dose with both inadequate or excessive doses of antigen resulting in low titer antisera. Small doses ng level of antigen administered at multiple intradermal sites appears to be most reliable. An effective immunization protocol for rabbits can be found in Vaitukaitis J. et al. 33988 991 1971 .

Booster injections can be given at regular intervals and antiserum harvested when antibody titer thereof as determined semi quantitatively for example by double immunodiffusion in agar against known concentrations of the antigen begins to fall. See for example Ouchterlony O. et al. Chap. 19 in D. Wier ed Blackwell 1973 . Plateau concentration of antibody is usually in the range of 0.1 to 0.2 mg ml of serum about 12 M . Affinity of the antisera for the antigen is determined by preparing competitive binding curves as described for example by Fisher D. Chap. 42 in 2d Ed. Rose and Friedman Eds. Amer. Soc. For Microbiol. Washington D.C. 1980 . Antibody preparations prepared according to either protocol are useful in quantitative immunoassays that determine concentrations of antigen bearing substances in biological samples they are also used semi quantitatively or qualitatively e.g. in diagnostic embodiments that identify the presence of Aegyptin in biological samples . In the discussion that follows several methods of molecular modeling and rational drug design are described. These techniques can be applied to identify additional Aegyptin family members compounds that resemble an Aegyptin or fragment or derivative thereof and molecules that interact with Aegyptins and thereby modulate their function.

Rational drug design involving polypeptides requires identifying and defining a first peptide with which the designed drug is to interact and using the first target peptide to define the requirements for a second peptide. With such requirements defined one can find or prepare an appropriate peptide or non peptide that meets all or substantially all of the defined requirements. Thus one goal of rational drug design is to produce structural or functional analogs of biologically active polypeptides of interest or of small molecules with which they interact e.g. agonists antagonists null compounds in order to fashion drugs that are for example more or less potent forms of the ligand. See e.g. Hodgson 9 19 21 1991 . An example of rational drug design is shown in Erickson et al. 249 527 533 1990 . Combinatorial chemistry is the science of synthesizing and testing compounds for bioactivity en masse instead of one by one the aim being to discover drugs and materials more quickly and inexpensively than was formerly possible. Rational drug design and combinatorial chemistry have become more intimately related in recent years due to the development of approaches in computer aided protein modeling and drug discovery. See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 908 773 5 884 230 5 873 052 5 331 573 and 5 888 738 .

The use of molecular modeling as a tool for rational drug design and combinatorial chemistry has dramatically increased due to the advent of computer graphics. Not only is it possible to view molecules on computer screens in three dimensions but it is also possible to examine the interactions of macromolecules such as enzymes and receptors and rationally design derivative molecules to test. See Boorman 70 18 26 1992 . A vast amount of user friendly software and hardware is now available and virtually all pharmaceutical companies have computer modeling groups devoted to rational drug design. Molecular Simulations Inc. for example sells several sophisticated programs that allow a user to start from an amino acid sequence build a two or three dimensional model of the protein or polypeptide compare it to other two and three dimensional models and analyze the interactions of compounds drugs and peptides with a three dimensional model in real time. Accordingly in some embodiments of the invention software is used to compare regions of Aegyptins e.g. Aegyptin and molecules that interact with Aegyptins collectively referred to as binding partners e.g. anti Aegyptin antibodies and collagen and fragments or derivatives of these molecules with other molecules such as peptides peptidomimetics and chemicals so that therapeutic interactions can be predicted and designed. See Schneider December page 20 1998 Tempczyk et al. April 1997 and Butenhof August 1998 .

For example the protein sequence of an Aegyptin or binding partner or domains of these molecules or nucleic acid sequence encoding these polypeptides or both can be entered onto a computer readable medium for recording and manipulation. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that a computer readable medium having these sequences can interface with software that converts or manipulates the sequences to obtain structural and functional information such as protein models. That is the functionality of a software program that converts or manipulates these sequences includes the ability to compare these sequences to other sequences or structures of molecules that are present on publicly and commercially available databases so as to conduct rational drug design.

The Aegyptin or binding partner polypeptide or nucleic acid sequence or both can be stored recorded and manipulated on any medium that can be read and accessed by a computer. As used herein the words recorded and stored refer to a process for storing information on computer readable medium. A skilled artisan can readily adopt any of the presently known methods for recording information on a computer readable medium to generate manufactures comprising the nucleotide or polypeptide sequence information of this embodiment. A variety of data storage structures are available to a skilled artisan for creating a computer readable medium having recorded thereon a nucleotide or polypeptide sequence. The choice of the data storage structure will generally be based on the component chosen to access the stored information. Computer readable media include magnetically readable media optically readable media or electronically readable media. For example the computer readable media can be a hard disc a floppy disc a magnetic tape zip disk CD ROM DVD ROM RAM or ROM as well as other types of other media known to those skilled in the art. The computer readable media on which the sequence information is stored can be in a personal computer a network a server or other computer systems known to those skilled in the art.

Embodiments of the invention utilize computer based systems that contain the sequence information described herein and convert this information into other types of usable information e.g. protein models for rational drug design . The term a computer based system refers to the hardware software and any database used to analyze an Aegyptin or a binding partner nucleic acid or polypeptide sequence or both or fragments of these biomolecules so as to construct models or to conduct rational drug design. The computer based system preferably includes the storage media described above and a processor for accessing and manipulating the sequence data. The hardware of the computer based systems of this embodiment comprise a central processing unit CPU and a database. A skilled artisan can readily appreciate that any one of the currently available computer based systems are suitable.

In one particular embodiment the computer system includes a processor connected to a bus that is connected to a main memory preferably implemented as RAM and a variety of secondary storage devices such as a hard drive and removable medium storage device. The removable medium storage device can represent for example a floppy disk drive a DVD drive an optical disk drive a compact disk drive a magnetic tape drive etc. A removable storage medium such as a floppy disk a compact disk a magnetic tape etc. containing control logic and or data recorded therein can be inserted into the removable storage device. The computer system includes appropriate software for reading the control logic and or the data from the removable medium storage device once inserted in the removable medium storage device. The Aegyptin or binding partner nucleic acid or polypeptide sequence or both can be stored in a well known manner in the main memory any of the secondary storage devices and or a removable storage medium. Software for accessing and processing these sequences such as search tools compare tools and modeling tools etc. reside in main memory during execution.

As used herein a database refers to memory that can store an Aegyptin or binding partner nucleotide or polypeptide sequence information protein model information information on other peptides chemicals peptidomimetics and other agents that interact with Aegyptin proteins and values or results from functional assays. Additionally a database refers to a memory access component that can access manufactures having recorded thereon Aegyptin or binding partner nucleotide or polypeptide sequence information protein model information information on other peptides chemicals peptidomimetics and other agents that interact with Aegyptins and values or results from functional assays. In other embodiments a database stores an Aegyptin functional profile comprising the values and results e.g. ability to associate with collagen or modulate platelet adhesion activation and aggregation from one or more Aegyptin functional assays as described herein or known in the art and relationships between these values or results. The sequence data and values or results from Aegyptin functional assays can be stored and manipulated in a variety of data processor programs in a variety of formats. For example the sequence data can be stored as text in a word processing file an ASCII file a html file or a pdf file in a variety of database programs familiar to those of skill in the art.

A search program refers to one or more programs that are implemented on the computer based system to compare an Aegyptin or binding partner nucleotide or polypeptide sequence with other nucleotide or polypeptide sequences and agents including but not limited to peptides peptidomimetics and chemicals stored within a database. A search program also refers to one or more programs that compare one or more protein models to several protein models that exist in a database and one or more protein models to several peptides peptidomimetics and chemicals that exist in a database. A search program is used for example to compare one Aegyptin functional profile to one or more Aegyptin functional profiles that are present in a database. Still further a search program can be used to compare values or results from Aegyptin functional assays and agents that modulate platelet adhesion activation and aggregation.

A retrieval program refers to one or more programs that can be implemented on the computer based system to identify a homologous nucleic acid sequence a homologous protein sequence or a homologous protein model. A retrieval program can also used to identify peptides peptidomimetics and chemicals that interact with an Aegyptin protein sequence or an Aegyptin protein model stored in a database. Further a retrieval program is used to identify a specific agent that modulates Aegyptin mediated inhibition of platelet adhesion activation and aggregation to a desired set of values results or profile. That is a retrieval program can also be used to obtain a binding partner profile that is composed of a chemical structure nucleic acid sequence or polypeptide sequence or model of an agent that interacts with an Aegyptin and thereby modulates inhibits or enhances platelet adhesion activation and aggregation. Further a binding partner profile can have one or more symbols that represent these molecules and or models an identifier that represents one or more agents including but not limited to peptides and peptidomimetics referred to collectively as peptide agents and chemicals and a value or result from a functional assay.

As a starting point to rational drug design a two or three dimensional model of a polypeptide of interest is created e.g. Aegyptin or a binding partner such as a collagen or an antibody . In the past the three dimensional structure of proteins has been determined in a number of ways. Perhaps the best known way of determining protein structure involves the use of x ray crystallography. A general review of this technique can be found in Van Holde K. E. Physical Biochemistry Prentice Hall N.J. pp. 221 239 1971 . Using this technique it is possible to elucidate three dimensional structure with good precision. Additionally protein structure can be determined through the use of techniques of neutron diffraction or by nuclear magnetic resonance NMR . See e.g. Moore W. J. Physical Chemistry 4Edition Prentice Hall NJ. 1972 .

Alternatively protein models of a polypeptide of interest can be constructed using computer based protein modeling techniques. By one approach the protein folding problem is solved by finding target sequences that are most compatible with profiles representing the structural environments of the residues in known three dimensional protein structures. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 436 850 . In another technique the known three dimensional structures of proteins in a given family are superimposed to define the structurally conserved regions in that family. This protein modeling technique also uses the known three dimensional structure of a homologous protein to approximate the structure of a polypeptide of interest. See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 557 535 5 884 230 and 5 873 052 . Conventional homology modeling techniques have been used routinely to build models of proteases and antibodies. Sowdhamini et al. 10 207 215 1997 . Comparative approaches can also be used to develop three dimensional protein models when the protein of interest has poor sequence identity to template proteins. In some cases proteins fold into similar three dimensional structures despite having very weak sequence identities. For example the three dimensional structures of a number of helical cytokines fold in similar three dimensional topology in spite of weak sequence homology.

The recent development of threading methods and fuzzy approaches now enables the identification of likely folding patterns and functional protein domains in a number of situations where the structural relatedness between target and template s is not detectable at the sequence level. By one method fold recognition is performed using Multiple Sequence Threading MST and structural equivalences are deduced from the threading output using a distance geometry program that constructs a low resolution model. A full atom representation is then constructed using a molecular modeling package.

According to this 3 step approach candidate templates are first identified by using the novel fold recognition algorithm MST which is capable of performing simultaneous threading of multiple aligned sequences onto one or more 3 D structures. In a second step the structural equivalences obtained from the MST output are converted into interresidue distance restraints and fed into the distance geometry program together with auxiliary information obtained from secondary structure predictions. The program combines the restraints in an unbiased manner and rapidly generates a large number of low resolution model confirmations. In a third step these low resolution model confirmations are converted into full atom models and organismed to energy minimization using the molecular modeling package. See e.g. Asz di et al. Proteins Structure Function and Genetics Supplement 1 38 42 1997 .

In a preferred approach a commercially available program Molecular Simulations Inc. and accompanying modules are used to create a two and or three dimensional model of a polypeptide of interest from an amino acid sequence. A three dimensional graphics program that can interface with several modules that perform numerous structural analysis and enable real time rational drug design and combinatorial chemistry is commercially available. Modules allow one to rapidly create a two dimensional or three dimensional model of a polypeptide carbohydrate nucleic acid chemical or combinations of the foregoing from their sequence or structure. The modeling tools associated with these programs support many different data file formats including Brookhaven and Cambridge databases AMPAC MOPAC and QCPE programs Molecular Design Limited Molfile and SD files Sybel Mol2 files VRML and Pict files.

Additionally the techniques described above can be supplemented with techniques in molecular biology to design models of the protein of interest. For example a polypeptide of interest can be analyzed by an alanine scan Wells Methods in Enzymol. 202 390 411 1991 or other types of site directed mutagenesis analysis. In alanine scan each amino acid residue of the polypeptide of interest is sequentially replaced by alanine in a step wise fashion i.e. only one alanine point mutation is incorporated per molecule starting at position 1 and proceeding through the entire molecule and the effect of the mutation on the peptide s activity in a functional assay is determined. Each of the amino acid residues of the peptide is analyzed in this manner and the regions important for the modulation of platelet adhesion activation and aggregation for example are identified. These functionally important regions can be recorded on a computer readable medium stored in a database in a computer system and a search program can be employed to generate a protein model of the functionally important regions.

Once a model of the polypeptide of interest is created it can be compared to other models so as to identify new members of the Aegyptin family and binding partners. By starting with the amino acid sequence or protein model of Aegyptin or a binding partner for example molecules having two dimensional and or three dimensional homology can be rapidly identified. In one approach a percent sequence identity can be determined by standard methods that are commonly used to compare the similarity and position of the amino acid of two polypeptides. Using a computer program such as BLAST or FASTA two polypeptides can be aligned for optimal matching of their respective amino acids either along the full length of one or both sequences or along a predetermined portion of one or both sequences . Such programs provide default opening penalty and a default gap penalty and a scoring matrix such as PAM 250 a standard scoring matrix see Dayhoff et al. in Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure Vol. 5 Supp. 3 1978 can be used in conjunction with the computer program. The percent identity can then be calculated as 

Accordingly the protein sequence corresponding to an Aegyptin or a binding partner or a fragment or derivative of these molecules can be compared to known sequences on a protein basis. Protein sequences corresponding to an Aegyptin or a binding partner or a fragment or derivative of these molecules are compared for example to known amino acid sequences found in Swissprot release 35 PIR release 53 and Genpept release 108 public databases using BLASTP with the parameter W 8 and allowing a maximum of 10 matches. In addition the protein sequences are compared to publicly known amino acid sequences of Swissprot using BLASTX with the parameter E 0.001. The molecules identified as members of the family of Aegyptins or candidate binding partners desirably have at least 35 homology and preferably have 40 45 50 or 55 or greater homology to Aegyptin The Aegyptin family members and candidate binding partners that interact with an Aegyptin can have the following degrees of homology or identity to Aegyptin or both for example 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 or 99 . The Aegyptin family members and candidate binding partners having greater than or equal to 35 homology are identified and are subsequently examined using an Aegyptin functional assay.

In another embodiment computer modeling and the sequence to structure to function paradigm is exploited to identify more members of the Aegyptin family candidate binding partners. By this approach first the structure of an Aegyptin e.g. Aegyptin or a candidate binding partner e.g. somatomedin domain or antibody having a known response in a characterization assay is determined from its sequence using a threading algorithm which aligns the sequence to the best matching structure in a structural database. Next the protein s active site i.e. the site important for a desired response in the characterization assay is identified and a fuzzy functional form FFF a three dimensional descriptor of the active site of a protein is created. See e.g. Fetrow et al. 282 703 711 1998 and Fetrow and Skolnick 281 949 968 1998 .

The FFFs are built by iteratively superimposing the protein geometries from a series of functionally related proteins with known structures. The FFFs are not overly specific however and the degree to which the descriptors can be relaxed is explored. In essence conserved and functionally important residues for a desired response are identified and a set of geometric and conformational constraints for a specific function are defined in the form of a computer algorithm. The program then searches experimentally determined protein structures from a protein structural database for sets of residues that satisfy the specified constraints. In this manner homologous three dimensional structures can be compared and degrees e.g. percentages of three dimensional homology can be ascertained. The ability to search three dimensional structure databases for structural similarity to a protein of interest can also be accomplished by employing commercially available modules.

By using this computational protocol genome sequence data bases such as maintained by various organizations can be rapidly screened for specific protein active sites and for identification of the residues at those active sites that resemble a desired molecule. Several other groups have developed databases of short sequence patterns or motifs designed to identify a given function or activity of a protein. Many of these databases can use short stretches of sequence information to identify sequence patterns that are specific for a given function thus they avoid the problems arising from the necessity of matching entire sequences.

By a similar approach a candidate binding partner can be identified and manufactured as follows. First a molecular model of one or more molecules that are known to interact with an Aegyptin or portions of these molecules that interact with an Aegyptin are created using one of the techniques discussed above or as known in the art. Next chemical libraries and databases are searched for molecules similar in structure to the known molecule. That is a search can be made of a three dimensional data base for non peptide organic structures e.g. non peptide analogs and or dipeptide analogs having three dimensional similarity to the known structure of the target compound. See e.g. the Cambridge Crystal Structure Data Base Crystallographic Data Center Lensfield Road Cambridge CB2 1EW England and Allen F. H. et al. . B35 2331 2339 1979 . The identified candidate binding partners that interact with Aegyptins can then be analyzed in a functional assay e.g. a platelet adhesion aggregation assay or both and new molecules can be modeled after the candidate binding partners that produce a desirable response. By cycling in this fashion libraries of molecules that interact with Aegyptins and produce a desirable or optimal response in a functional assay can be selected.

It is noted that search algorithms for three dimensional data base comparisons are available in the literature. See e.g. Cooper et al. . 3 253 259 1989 and references cited therein Brent et al. . 2 311 310 1988 and references cited therein. Commercial software for such searches is also available from vendors such as Day Light Information Systems Inc. Irvine Calif. 92714 and Molecular Design Limited 2132 Faralton Drive San Leandro Calif. 94577. The searching is done in a systematic fashion by simulating or synthesizing analogs having a substitute moiety at every residue level. Preferably care is taken that replacement of portions of the backbone does not disturb the tertiary structure and that the side chain substitutions are compatible to retain the receptor substrate interactions.

By another approach protein models of binding partners that interact with an Aegyptin e.g. a collagen molecule or an antibody can be made by the methods described above and these models can be used to predict the interaction of new molecules. Once a model of a binding partner is identified the active sites or regions of interaction can be identified. Such active sites might typically be ligand binding sites. The active site can be identified using methods known in the art including for example from the amino acid sequences of peptides from the nucleotide sequences of nucleic acids or from study of complexes of the Aegyptin with a ligand such as a collagen molecule or specific matrix proteins. In the latter case chemical or X ray crystallographic methods can be used to find the active site by finding where on the Aegyptin the complexed ligand is found. Next the three dimensional geometric structure of the active site is determined. This can be done by known methods including X ray crystallography which can determine a complete molecular structure. On the other hand solid or liquid phase NMR can be used to determine certain intra molecular distances. Any other experimental method of structure determination can be used to obtain partial or complete geometric structures. The geometric structures can be measured with a complexed ligand natural or artificial which may increase the accuracy of the active site structure determined.

If an incomplete or insufficiently accurate structure is determined the methods of computer based numerical modeling can be used to complete the structure or improve its accuracy. Any recognized modeling method can be used including parameterized models specific to particular biopolymers such as proteins or nucleic acids molecular dynamics models based on computing molecular motions statistical mechanics models based on thermal ensembles or combined models. For most types of models standard molecular force fields representing the forces between constituent atoms and groups are necessary and can be selected from force fields known in physical chemistry. The incomplete or less accurate experimental structures can serve as constraints on the complete and more accurate structures computed by these modeling methods.

Finally having determined the structure of the active site of the known binding partner either experimentally by modeling or by a combination candidate binding partners can be identified by searching databases containing compounds along with information on their molecular structure. Such a search seeks compounds having structures that match the determined active site structure and that interact with the groups defining the active site. Such a search can be manual but is preferably computer assisted.

Alternatively these methods can be used to identify improved binding partners from an already known binding partner. The composition of the known binding partner can be modified and the structural effects of modification can be determined using the experimental and computer modeling methods described above applied to the new composition. The altered structure is then compared to the active site structure of the compound to determine if an improved fit or interaction results. In this manner systematic variations in composition such as by varying side groups can be quickly evaluated to obtain modified modulating compounds or ligands of improved specificity or activity.

A number of articles review computer modeling of drugs interactive with specific proteins such as Rotivinen et al. 1988 Acta Pharmaceutical Fennica 97 159 166 Ripka New Scientist 54 57 Jun. 16 1988 McKinaly and Rossmanm 1989 Annu.

Other computer programs that screen and graphically depict chemicals are available from companies such as BioDesign Inc. Pasadena Calif. Allelix Inc. Mississauga Ontario Canada and Hypercube Inc. Cambridge Ontario . Although these are primarily designed for application to drugs specific to particular proteins they can be adapted to design of drugs specific for the modulation of platelet adhesion activation and aggregation and other Aegyptin functions.

Many more computer programs and databases can be used with embodiments of the invention to identify new members of the Aegyptin family and binding partners that modulate Aegyptin function. The following list is intended not to limit the invention but to provide guidance to programs and databases that are useful with the approaches discussed above.

Once candidate binding partners have been identified desirably they are analyzed in a functional assay. Further cycles of modeling and functional assays can be employed to more narrowly define the parameters needed in a binding partner. Each binding partner and its response in a functional assay can be recorded on a computer readable media and a database or library of binding partners and respective responses in a functional assay can be generated. These databases or libraries can be used by researchers to identify important differences between active and inactive molecules so that compound libraries are enriched for binding partners that have favorable characteristics. The section below describes several Aegyptin functional assays that can be used to characterize new Aegyptin family members and candidate binding partners.

The term Aegyptin characterization assay or Aegyptin functional assay or functional assay the results of which can be recorded as a value in a Aegyptin functional profile include assays that directly or indirectly evaluate the presence of an Aegyptin nucleic acid or protein in a cell and the ability of an Aegyptin to modulate platelet adhesion activation and aggregation. Examples 5 6 and 8 10 teach assays that are considered for the purposes of this disclosure to be Aegyptin functional assays. Many more are provided in the discussion below.

Some functional assays involve binding assays that utilize multimeric agents. One form of multimeric agent concerns a manufacture comprising an Aegyptin hybrid binding partner or fragment thereof disposed on a support. These multimeric agents provide the Aegyptin hybrid binding partner or fragment thereof in such a form or in such a way that a sufficient affinity is achieved. A multimeric agent having an Aegyptin hybrid or binding partner or fragment thereof is obtained by joining the desired polypeptide to a macromolecular support. A support can be a termed a carrier a protein a resin a cell membrane or any macromolecular structure used to join or immobilize such molecules. Solid supports include but are not limited to the walls of wells of a reaction tray test tubes polystyrene beads magnetic beads nitrocellulose strips membranes microparticles such as latex particles animal cells Duracyte artificial cells and others. An Aegyptin hybrid or binding partner or fragment thereof can also be joined to inorganic carriers such as silicon oxide material e.g. silica gel zeolite diatomaceous earth or aminated glass by for example a covalent linkage through a hydroxy carboxy or amino group and a reactive group on the carrier.

In several multimeric agents the macromolecular support has a hydrophobic surface that interacts with a portion of the Aegyptin hybrid or binding partner or fragment thereof by a hydrophobic non covalent interaction. In some cases the hydrophobic surface of the support is a polymer such as plastic or any other polymer in which hydrophobic groups have been linked such as polystyrene polyethylene or polyvinyl. Additionally an Aegyptin hybrid or binding partner or fragment thereof can be covalently bound to carriers including proteins and oligo polysaccarides e.g. cellulose starch glycogen chitosane or aminated sepharose . In these later multimeric agents a reactive group on the molecule such as a hydroxy or an amino group is used to join to a reactive group on the carrier so as to create the covalent bond. Additional multimeric agents comprise a support that has other reactive groups that are chemically activated so as to attach the Aegyptin hybrid or binding partner or fragment thereof. For example cyanogen bromide activated matrices epoxy activated matrices thio and thiopropyl gels nitrophenyl chloroformate and N hydroxy succinimide chlorformate linkages or oxirane acrylic supports are used. Sigma .

Additionally a cell based approach can be used characterize new Aegyptin family members or Aegyptin hybrids or to rapidly identify binding partners that interact with an Aegyptin and thereby modulate fibrinolysis. Preferably molecules identified in the support bound Aegyptin assay described above are used in the cell based approach however randomly generated compounds can also be used.

Other Aegyptin characterization assays take advantage of techniques in molecular biology that are employed to discover protein protein interactions. One method that detects protein protein interactions in vivo the two hybrid system is described in detail for illustration only and not by way of limitation. Other similar assays that can be adapted to identify binding partners include 

An adaptation of the system described by Chien et al. 1991 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88 9578 9582 herein incorporated by reference which is commercially available from Clontech Palo Alto Calif. is as follows. Plasmids are constructed that encode two hybrid proteins one plasmid consists of nucleotides encoding the DNA binding domain of a transcription activator protein fused to a nucleotide sequence encoding an Aegyptin or fragment thereof and the other plasmid consists of nucleotides encoding the transcription activator protein s activation domain fused to a cDNA encoding an unknown protein that has been recombined into this plasmid as part of a cDNA library. The DNA binding domain fusion plasmid and the cDNA library are transformed into a strain of the yeast that contains a reporter gene e.g. HBS or lacZ whose regulatory region contains the transcription activator s binding site. Either hybrid protein alone cannot activate transcription of the reporter gene the DNA binding domain hybrid cannot because it does not provide activation function and the activation domain hybrid cannot because it cannot localize to the activator s binding sites. Interaction of the two hybrid proteins reconstitutes the functional activator protein and results in expression of the reporter gene which is detected by an assay for the reporter gene product.

The two hybrid system or related methodology can be used to screen activation domain libraries for proteins that interact with the bait gene product. By way of example and not by way of limitation Aegyptins can be used as the bait gene product. Total genomic or cDNA sequences are fused to the DNA encoding an activation domain. This library and a plasmid encoding a hybrid of a bait gene encoding the Aegyptin product Aegyptin fused to the DNA binding domain are cotransformed into a yeast reporter strain and the resulting transformants are screened for those that express the reporter gene. For example and not by way of limitation a bait gene sequence encoding an Aegyptin can be cloned into a vector such that it is translationally fused to the DNA encoding the DNA binding domain of the GAL4 protein. These colonies are purified and the library plasmids responsible for reporter gene expression are isolated. DNA sequencing is then used to identify the proteins encoded by the library plasmids.

A cDNA library of the cell line from which proteins that interact with bait Aegyptin are to be detected can be made using methods routinely practiced in the art. According to the particular system described herein for example the cDNA fragments can be inserted into a vector such that they are translationally fused to the transcriptional activation domain of GAL4. This library can be co transformed along with the bait Aegyptin gene GAL4 fusion plasmid into a yeast strain which contains a lacZ gene driven by a promoter which contains GAL4 activation sequence. A cDNA encoded protein fused to GAL4 transcriptional activation domain which interacts with bait Aegyptin gene product will reconstitute an active GAL4 protein and thereby drive expression of the lacZ gene. Colonies that express lacZ can be detected and the cDNA can then be purified from these strains and used to produce and isolate the binding partner by techniques routinely practiced in the art. In the section below several diagnostic embodiments are described.

The Aegyptins hybrids binding agents and fragments thereof are suitable for incorporation into pharmaceuticals that treat organisms in need of a compound that modulates platelet adhesion activation and aggregation. These pharmacologically active compounds can be processed in accordance with conventional methods of galenic pharmacy to produce medicinal agents for administration to organisms e.g. plants insects mold yeast animals and mammals including humans. The active ingredients can be incorporated into a pharmaceutical product with and without modification. Further the manufacture of pharmaceuticals or therapeutic agents that deliver the pharmacologically active compounds of this invention by several routes are aspects of the invention. For example and not by way of limitation DNA RNA and viral vectors having sequence encoding the Aegyptins hybrids binding partners or fragments thereof are used with embodiments. Nucleic acids encoding Aegyptins hybrids binding partners or fragments thereof can be administered alone or in combination with other active ingredients.

The compounds described herein can be employed in admixture with conventional excipients i.e. pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic carrier substances suitable for parenteral enteral e.g. oral or topical application that do not deleteriously react with the pharmacologically active ingredients of this invention. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include but are not limited to water salt solutions alcohols gum arabic vegetable oils benzyl alcohols polyetylene glycols gelatine carbohydrates such as lactose amylose or starch magnesium stearate talc silicic acid viscous paraffin perfume oil fatty acid monoglycerides and diglycerides pentaerythritol fatty acid esters hydroxy methylcellulose polyvinyl pyrrolidone etc. Many more suitable vehicles are described in Pharmaceutical Sciences 15th Edition Easton Mack Publishing Company pages 1405 1412 and 1461 1487 1975 and The National XIV 14th Edition Washington American Pharmaceutical Association 1975 herein incorporated by reference. The pharmaceutical preparations can be sterilized and if desired mixed with auxiliary agents e.g. lubricants preservatives stabilizers wetting agents emulsifiers salts for influencing osmotic pressure buffers coloring flavoring and or aromatic substances and the like that do not deleteriously react with the active compounds.

The effective dose and method of administration of a particular pharmaceutical formulation having Aegyptins hybrids binding partners or fragments thereof can vary based on the individual needs of the patient and the treatment or preventative measure sought. Therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals e.g. ED50 the dose therapeutically effective in 50 of the population . For example the Aegyptins hybrids binding partners or fragments thereof discussed above can be administered to the knockout mice of the invention and the effect on platelet adhesion activation and aggregation can be determined. The data obtained from these assays is then used in formulating a range of dosage for use with other organisms including humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with no toxicity. The dosage varies within this range depending upon type of Aegyptin hybrid binding partner or fragment thereof the dosage form employed sensitivity of the organism and the route of administration.

Normal dosage amounts of various Aegyptins hybrids binding partners or fragments thereof can vary from approximately 1 to 100 000 micrograms up to a total dose of about 10 grams depending upon the route of administration. Desirable dosages include 250 g 500 g 1 mg 50 mg 100 mg 150 mg 200 mg 250 mg 300 mg 350 mg 400 mg 450 mg 500 mg 550 mg 600 mg 650 mg 700 mg 750 mg 800 mg 850 mg 900 mg 1 g 1.1 g 1.2 g 1.3 g 1.4 g 1.5 g 1.6 g 1.7 g 1.8 g 1.9 g 2 g 3 g 4 g 5 6 g 7 g 8 g 9 g and 10 g.

In some embodiments the dose of Aegyptins hybrids binding partners or fragments thereof preferably produces a tissue or blood concentration or both from approximately 0.1 M to 500 mM. Desirable doses produce a tissue or blood concentration or both of about 1 to 800 M. Preferable doses produce a tissue or blood concentration of greater than about 10 M to about 500 M. Preferable doses are for example the amount of Aegyptins hybrids binding partners or fragments thereof required to achieve a tissue or blood concentration or both of 10 M 15 M 20 M 25 M 30 M 35 M 40 M 45 M 50 M 55 M 60 M 65 M 70 M 75 M 80 M 85 M 90 M 95 M 100 M 110 M 120 M 130 M 140 M 145 M 150 M 160 M 170 M 180 M 190 M 200 M 220 M 240 M 250 M 260 M 280 M 300 M 320 M 340 M 360 M 380 M 400 M 420 M 440 M 460 M 480 M and 500 M. Although doses that produce a tissue concentration of greater than 800 M are not preferred they can be used with some embodiments of the invention. A constant infusion of the Aegyptins hybrids binding partners or fragments thereof can also be provided so as to maintain a stable concentration in the tissues as measured by blood levels.

The exact dosage is chosen by the individual physician in view of the patient to be treated. Dosage and administration are adjusted to provide sufficient levels of the active moiety or to maintain the desired effect. Additional factors that can be taken into account include the severity of the disease age of the organism and weight or size of the organism diet time and frequency of administration drug combination s reaction sensitivities and tolerance response to therapy. Short acting pharmaceutical compositions are administered daily whereas long acting pharmaceutical compositions are administered every 2 3 to 4 days every week or once every two weeks. Depending on half life and clearance rate of the particular formulation the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are administered once twice three four five six seven eight nine ten or more times per day.

Routes of administration of the pharmaceuticals of the invention include but are not limited to topical intranasal transdermal parenteral gastrointestinal transbronchial and transalveolar. Transdermal administration is accomplished by application of a cream rinse gel etc. capable of allowing the pharmacologically active compounds to penetrate the skin. Parenteral routes of administration include but are not limited to electrical or direct injection such as direct injection into a central venous line intravenous intramuscular intraperitoneal intradermal or subcutaneous injection. Gastrointestinal routes of administration include but are not limited to ingestion and rectal. Transbronchial and transalveolar routes of administration include but are not limited to inhalation either via the mouth or intranasally.

Examples of suitable creams ointments etc. can be found for instance in the Physician s Desk Reference. Examples of suitable transdermal devices are described for instance in U.S. Pat. No. 4 818 540 issued Apr. 4 1989 to Chinen et al. herein incorporated by reference.

Compositions having the pharmacologically active compounds of this invention may be administered by parenteral administration including but not limited to electrical or direct injection. Accordingly nucleic acids encoding Aegyptin or fragments thereof and preferably codon optimized nucleic acids or fragments thereof to optimize expression in a suitable host e.g. human horse dog cat pig chicken or rodent can be administered by electroporation or direct injection. Suitable systems for delivery of the above described nucleic acids include electroporation systems such as the MEDPULSAR electroporation therapy system microneedle injection devices and powder injection ballistic gene transfer devices which are commercially available.

Once the pharmaceutical comprising the Aegyptin hybrid binding partner or fragment thereof has been obtained it can be administered to an organism in need to treat or prevent a defect in platelet adhesion activation and aggregation.

Various nucleic acid based vaccine therapeutics are known and it is contemplated that these compositions and approaches to immunotherapy can be used in a number of animals. By one approach for example a gene encoding one of the Aegyptin proteins can be optimized for expression in a particular animal e.g. domestic animals such as dogs cats or horses or humans see Example 12 . By one approach SEQ ID NO. 1 is cloned into an expression vector capable of expressing the polypeptide when introduced into a subject. The expression construct is introduced into the subject in a mixture of an adjuvant. For example the adjuvant is administered shortly after the expression construct at the same site. Alternatively RNA encoding the Aegyptin polypeptide antigen of interest is provided to the subject in a mixture with ribavirin or in conjunction with an adjuvant.

Where the antigen is to be DNA e.g. preparation of a DNA vaccine composition suitable promoters include Simian Virus 40 SV40 Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus MMTV promoter Human Immunodeficiency Virus HIV such as the HIV Long Terminal Repeat LTR promoter Moloney virus ALV Cytomegalovirus CMV such as the CMV immediate early promoter Epstein Barr Virus EBV Rous Sarcoma Virus RSV as well as promoters from human genes such as human actin human myosin human hemoglobin human muscle creatine and human metalothionein can be used. Examples of polyadenylation signals useful with some embodiments especially in the production of a genetic vaccine for humans include but are not limited to SV40 polyadenylation signals and LTR polyadenylation signals. In particular the SV40 polyadenylation signal which is in pCEP4 plasmid Invitrogen San Diego Calif. referred to as the SV40 polyadenylation signal is used.

Delivery of said DNA vaccines preferably codon optimized DNA vaccines for optimized expression in a suitable host e.g. human horse dog cat pig chicken or rodent can be accomplished using a variety of methods e.g. MEDPULSAR electroporation therapy system microneedle injection devices and ballistic gene transfer devices such as powder injection devices which are commercially available. Constructs comprising Aegyptin nucleic acids or fragments thereof e.g. SEQ ID NO 3 codon optimized for expression in human can be provided for any one or more of the uses described herein because the host animal can produce the protein from the nucleic acid. Accordingly treatments such as nucleic acid based vaccine therapeutics can be accomplished by delivering a construct comprising one or more of the nucleic acids described herein.

In addition to the regulatory elements required for gene expression other elements may also be included in a gene construct. Such additional elements include enhancers. The enhancer may be selected from the group including but not limited to human actin human myosin human hemoglobin human muscle creatine and viral enhancers such as those from CMV RSV and EBV. Gene constructs can be provided with mammalian origin of replication in order to maintain the construct extrachromosomally and produce multiple copies of the construct in the cell. Plasmids pCEP4 and pREP4 from Invitrogen San Diego Calif. contain the Epstein Barr virus origin of replication and nuclear antigen EBNA 1 coding region which produces high copy episomal replication without integration. All forms of DNA whether replicating or non replicating which do not become integrated into the genome and which are expressible can be used. Preferably the genetic vaccines comprise an adjuvant and a nucleic acid encoding Aegyptin or a fragment or mutant thereof SEQ ID NOS 1 and 3 . Example 12 below describes the preparation of a genetic vaccine suitable for use in humans.

Methods of Blocking Integrin Cell Receptor Interaction Preventing Metastasis and or Inhibiting Angiogenesis

Several embodiments also concern methods of blocking integrin cell receptor interaction and or preventing metastasis comprising providing to a subject a therapeutically effective dose of an Aegyptin disclosed herein. Preventing metastasis includes partially or fully preventing metastasis.

Without being bound by theory an Aegyptin inhibits extracellular surface proteins such as cellulose which interact with integrins which are involved in cellular or tissue proliferation. In addition without being bound by theory an Aegyptin acts as an anti angiogenic agent that may work through a variety of mechanisms including but not limited to inhibiting integrin receptors expressed on proliferating endothelial cells. Integrins regulate the cell cycle. These integral membrane proteins are attached to the cellular plasma membrane through a single transmembrane helix.

Integrin plays a role in the attachment of cells to other cells and also plays a role in the attachment of a cell to the material part of a tissue that is not part of any cell the extracellular matrix . Besides the attachment role integrin also plays a role in signal transduction a process by which a cell transforms one kind of signal or stimulus into another. The signal that the integrin converts comes from the extracellular matrix to the cell.

There are many types of integrin and many cells have multiple types on their surface. Integrins are of vital importance to all animals and have been found in many animals tested from sponges to mammals. Integrins have been extensively studied in humans.

An Aegyptin such as an Aegyptin polypeptide or nucleic acid is useful in blocking integrin cell receptor interaction inhibiting the metastasis of proliferative cells or tissues and inhibiting angiogenesis. Inhibition may occur for example as a direct result of administering an Aegyptin such as an Aegyptin polypeptide or nucleic acid or antibodies directed to an Aegyptin polypeptides as described elsewhere herein or indirectly such as activating the expression of proteins known to inhibit metastasis for example integrins. Such therapeutic affects of the present invention may be achieved either alone or in combination with small molecule drugs or adjuvants.

Medical devices such as stents catheters and the like may be treated with Aegyptin alone or in combination with another antithrombogenic agent. The approach by which an antithrombogenic agent is incorporated into or onto some or all of a medical device is not limiting and may be selected from any of a number of methods available in the art some illustrative examples of which are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 528 107 the entirety of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein.

For example U.S. Pat. No. 5 679 659 assigned to Medtronic Inc. the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference describes a method for making a heparinized medical device. In this method heparin is reacted with a periodate compound and this mixture is reacted and then applied to immobilized amine groups on a medical device surface. The application to the immobilized amine groups causes a reaction between the aldehyde groups on the heparin and the immobilized amine groups to form a Schiff base. A mild reducing agent is used to stabilize the Schiff base into a secondary amine.

Other methods for providing antithrombogenic surfaces for example as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 512 329 and 5 741 551 the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference and other related patents assigned to BSI Corporation relate to methods for modifying substrate surfaces by bonding molecules e.g. protein molecules to substrates through external activation of latent reactive groups carried on the molecules. The latent reactive groups are groups which respond to specific applied external stimuli to undergo active specie generation with resultant covalent bonding to an adjacent support surface. Latent reactive groups are those groups of atoms in a molecule which retain their covalent bonds unchanged under conditions of storage but which upon activation form covalent bonds with other molecules. The latent reactive groups generate active species such as free radicals nitrenes carbenes and excited states of ketones upon absorption of external electromagnetic or kinetic thermal energy. Latent reactive groups are generally well known and may be chosen to be responsive to various portions of the electromagnetic spectrum.

In addition to the examples described above many other antithrombogenic treatment methods are similarly known and available to the skilled individual in the art for use in conjunction with the compositions of this invention including but not limited to methods for providing substrate surfaces with agents such as heparin e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 3 511 684 3 585 647 4 254 180 4 331 697 4 676 974 4 526 714 4 634 762 4 678 660 4 678 671 and 5 877 263 phospholipids e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 556 632 chitosan e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 326 532 antithrombogenic polymers e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 521 564 4 600 652 and 4 642 242 and others e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 973 493 4 979 959 5 263 992 5 414 075 5 512 329 and 5 741 551 the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.

Aegyptin displays sequence similarity to members of 30 kDa salivary allergens found in salivary glands of blood sucking arthopods whose function has remained elusive so far.Extensive sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis have been reported for this family of proteins. shows a diagram displaying highly acidic N terminus containing 28 negatively charged amino acids Glu or Asp and 5 Gly Glu Glu Asp Ala GEEDA SEQ ID NO 7 repeats. The repeats are followed by 19 residues of Glu or Asp and a high content of Gly. The C terminus is typically basic and display 25 positive amino acids Arg or Lys and 18 negative residues. Overall Gly Asp and Glu content of aegyptin is 45 while Arg and Lys represent 11.5 of the protein which also displays 4 cysteines.

In order to characterize the function of aegyptin salivary glands of 20 female mosquitoes non blood fed were dissected. Total RNA was extracted with TRIZOL reagent Invitrogen San Diego Calif. and specific cDNA was amplified using OneStep RT PCR kit Qiagen Chatsworth Calif. and the gene specific primers Aegyptin For 5 AGGCCCATGCCCGAAGATGAAGAACCAG 3 SEQ ID NO 4 and Aegyptin Rev 5 TTAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGACGTCCTTTGGATGAAA CAC 3 SEQ ID NO 5 . These two primers were designed based on Aegyptin sequence NCBI accession number gi 94468546 presented herein as the DNA sequence SEQ ID NO 1 encoding the protein sequence SEQ ID NO 2 to amplify the DNA fragment encoding the mature protein and a 6 His tag before the stop codon. The PCR amplified product was cloned into VR2001 TOPO vector modified version of the VR1020 vector Vical Incorporated. San Diego Calif. and sequence and orientation verified by DNA sequencing. Approximately 1 mg of plasmid DNA VR2001 Aegyptin construct was obtained using GeneElute HP endotoxin free plasmid MEGA prep kit Sigma . The plasmid was purified through a 0.22 m filter.

The following example describes expression and purification of Aegyptin for further use in studies to characterize its function.

In an attempt to identify the function of aegyptin cDNA was cloned in a VR2001 expression vector subsequently used for transfection of 293 F cells as follows. Recombinant protein was produced by transfecting FreeStyle 293 F cells Invitrogen with 240 g of purified VR2001 Aegyptin plasmid following manufacturer s recommendations Invitrogen . After 72 hours transfected cell culture was harvested. Supernatant containing the secreted recombinant protein was centrifuged 100 g 15 minutes frozen and stored at 30 C. until use.

Medium containing the secreted recombinant protein was centrifuged and supernatant loaded in a Ni column and eluted with a buffer containing increments of imidazole concentration as follows. 293 F cells supernatant containing the recombinant protein was loaded onto a Ni column 5 ml bed volume Amersham Biotech Piscataway N.J. following the manufacturer s directions. Fractions were eluted with 10 40 and 300 mM imidazole in 50 mM Tris 300 mM NaCl pH 8.0 and the fraction eluted at 300 mM was pooled and concentrated in an Amicon 10 MWMCO to 1 mL and then loaded onto a size exclusion column Superdex 75 HR10 30 Amersham Biotech using the AKTA purifier system Amersham Biotech . Proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml minute in 50 mM Tris 150 mM NaCl pH 7.4.

The results of the gel filtration chromatography are shown in . Purified Aegyptin was analyzed by NU PAGE and the gel stained with Coomassie blue. The gel revealed purified Aegyptin as a pure material of 30 kDa inset .

Purified recombinant protein was submitted to automated Edman degradation for N terminal sequencing. The amino terminal obtained by Edman degradation yielded the sequence RPMPEDEEVAEG SEQ ID NO 6 which is in agreement with the N terminus predicted for the mature protein according to the corresponding cDNA.

Concentration of purified Aegyptin NCBI accession number gi 94468546 presented herein as SEQ ID NO 2 was estimated by its absorbance at 280 nm using a NanoDrop ND1000 spectrophotometer NanoDrop Technologies Wilmington Del. and corrected according to the molar extinction coefficient 5600 M cm A 1 mg mL 0.220. Other calculated parameters are M 27038.09 pI 3.96. Prediction of N linked glycosylation sites was obtained at http ca.expasy.org tools.

With purified Aegyptin proteins functional assays were performed as set forth in the following examples.

Because Aegyptin has no significant matches to proteins with known function in the databases and considering that this protein is female specificand therefore potentially involved with blood feeding capabilities of the mosquito screening using anticoagulant assays was initially carried out. A series of experiments demonstrated that Aegyptin does not affect coagulation tests partial prothrombin time prothrombin time and thrombin time esterolytic activity of purified enzymes e.g. FXa FIXa FXIa FXIIa kallikrein and multimolecular coagulation complex assembly extrinsic Xase intrinsic Xnase and prothrombinase data not shown . Preliminary experiments also demonstrated that Aegyptin was without effect on platelet aggregation induced by thrombin ADP and thromboxane A2 mimetic U46619 however inhibition was observed when collagen was tested as a platelet agonist suggesting that Aegyptin could operate either as a platelet receptor antagonist or as collagen binding protein.

Therefore experiments were performed to investigate whether recombinant Aegyptin could directly interact with collagen using Surface Plasmon Resonance SPR experiments. Aegyptin was found to bind to soluble collagen I III but no interaction was observed with other matrix proteins including laminin vitronectin fibronectin vWf and fibrinogen . It was concluded that recombinant Aegyptin inhibits platelet aggregation because it specifically binds to collagen thus preventing its interaction with platelets.

Female Swiss Webster mice 8 12 weeks old were purchased from the Division of Cancer Treatment National Cancer Institute NIH. Mice were maintained in the NIAID Animal Care Facility under pathogen free conditions. Three mice were anesthetized with 100 l of 20 mg ml ketamine HCl Fort Dodge IA Animal Health and immunized with DNA plasmids intradermally in the right car using a 29.5 gauge needle. DNA plasmids 1 g d were injected in 10 l volume 3 times at 2 week intervals. Two weeks after the last DNA immunization sera were collected and stored at 30 C. until use. Western blot was performed using anti Aegyptin antibodies at 1 200 dilution.

To determine whether the salivary gland homogenate of contains a collagen binding activity 100 pairs were sonicated and centrifuged and supernatant was loaded in a gel filtration column as described below.

One hundred salivary gland extracts were loaded onto a size exclusion column Superdex 75 HR 10 30 Amersham Biotech using the AKTA purifier system Amersham Biotech . Proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml minute in HBS N 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4 150 mM NaCl . The active fraction detected by surface plasmon resonance see below containing the collagen binding protein was further purified by ion exchange chromatography using a MonoQ column HR 5 5 Amersham Biotech Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl 0 1M over 60 minute at a flow rate of 0.5 ml minute. Eluted proteins were again tested for collagen binding activity as described below.

Fractions were tested for collagen binding activity by SPR and the active fraction found at a retention volume of 8.5 ml . For comparative purposes recombinant Aegyptin was applied to the same column and also eluted at 8.5 ml retention volume. In an attempt to isolate native Aegyptin from salivary glands the active fractions obtained above were combined concentrated and loaded in an anion exchange column. The active fraction was eluted at approximately 0.4 M NaCl which was the same salt concentration needed to elute recombinant Aegyptin . In addition Edman degradation of native Aegyptin present in the active fraction identified three amino acids Arg Pro and Met which are identical to the N terminus for the mature protein as predicted by cDNA. Finally western blot analysis of the salivary gland homogenate using a polyclonal antibody generated by DNA vaccination identified a protein of 30 kDa whose migration pattern is identical to that of recombinant aegyptin. Therefore it was concluded that Aegyptin is expressed in salivary glands of and behaves as a collagen binding protein. In addition both recombinant and native inhibitor display identical chromatographic and functional properties. These results validated use of recombinant Aegyptin for further experimentation.

The effect of Aegyptin on collagen induced human platelet aggregation was tested using test tube stirring conditions as follows. Human platelet rich plasma 2 10 ml was incubated with increasing concentrations of Aegyptin for 1 minute followed by addition of platelet agonists as indicated. Platelet aggregation was estimated by turbidimetry under test tube stirring conditions. Washed human platelets were used when thrombin was used as an agonist. shows that Aegyptin inhibits collagen induced platelet aggregation but does not inhibit platelet aggregation induced by other agonists ADP PMA ristocetin araquidonic acid U46619 convulxin TRAP and thrombin.

The results show that Aegyptin dose dependently inhibits onset time for shape change and decreases the extent of platelet aggregation and ATP secretion with an ICof 50 nM . Additionally Aegyptin 300 nM did not affect platelet aggregation induced by ADP PMA ristocetin araquidonic acid U46619 convulxin TRAP and thrombin .

To investigate binding kinetics of aegyptin collagen interaction SPR experiments were performed as follows. All SPR experiments were carried out in a T100 instrument Biacore Inc. Uppsala Sweden following the manufacturer s instructions. This instrument features an integrated degasser allowing problem free kinetic measurements at temperatures up to 45 C. as well as a temperature controlled flow cell and sample compartment. The Biacore T100 evaluation software was utilized for kinetic and thermodynamic evaluation. Sensor CM5 amine coupling reagents and buffers were also purchased from Biacore Inc Piscataway N.J. . HBS P 10 mM Hepes pH 7.4 150 mM NaCl and 0.005 v v P20 surfactant was used as the running buffer for all SPR experiments. All SPR experiments were carried out three times.

Immobilization and Kinetic Analysis. Collagen type I or type III 30 g ml in acetate buffer pH 4.5 was immobilized over a CM5 sensor via amine coupling. The immobilization target was aimed to 1500 resonance units RU resulting in a final immobilization of 1737.5 RU for collagen type I and 1613.3 RU for collagen type III. Blank flow cells were used to subtract the buffer effect on sensorgrams. Kinetic experiments were carried out with a contact time of 180 seconds at a flow rate of 30 l min at 25 C. Aegyptin collagen I III complex dissociation was monitored for 1800 seconds and the sensor surface was regenerated by a pulse of 20 seconds of 10 mM HCl at 40 l minute. Sensorgrams were fitted using the two state reaction conformational change interaction model and a linked reactions control experiment was carried out to confirm the multiphase binding kinetics of aegyptin collagen I interaction.

Typical sensorgrams obtained for recombinant Aegyptin interaction with collagen I and III respectively are shown in . In both cases the best fit was attained using a two state reaction model Table 1 suggesting that Aegyptin undergoes a conformational change after interaction with collagens. Using this model Kd of 1.22 nM for collagen type I and Kd of 1.40 nM for collagen III was calculated Table 1 . Aegyptin also binds to soluble collagen types II IV and V data not shown . Next saliva was collected from mosquitoes and the secretion obtained by salivation was used to verify whether it contains collagen binding properties.

Identification of Collagen Binding Protein from Salivary Gland Homogenate and Saliva. In some experiments saliva was used as an analyte. Saliva from female mosquitoes was collected by oil induced salivation. An aliquot of 10 l obtained after size exclusion or anion exchange chromatographies were dissolved in 100 l of HBS P 10 mM Hepes pH 7.4 150 mM NaCl 0.05 surfactant P 20 and injected over collagen type I and III immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip for 120 seconds at a flow rate of 20 l minute. Complex dissociation was monitored for 400 seconds and the sensor chip surface was regenerated with a 10 second pulse of 10 mM HCl at 30 l minute.

Thermodynamic parameters for aegyptin collagen type I interaction were obtained from independent kinetic experiments using the Thermo Wizard assay program. Briefly different concentrations of recombinant Aegyptin 0.1 to 3 nM were injected over immobilized collagen type I at 15 C. 20 C. 25 C. 30 C. 35 C. and 40 C. The sample compartment was kept at 25 C. Contact time dissociation time and regeneration of the sensor surface were done as described above. Resulting sensorgrams were fitted to the two state reaction conformational change interaction model with local Rmax. The association Ka and dissociation Kd rate constants as well as the affinity constant KD were obtained and fitted to a linear form of the van t Hoff and Eyring equations to estimate the H and S as well as H and S respectively.

Affinity and kinetic data two state binding model collected at 5 temperatures 15 20 25 30 35 and 40 C. were fitted using Biacore evaluation software to obtain equilibrium and transition state thermodynamic parameters for the aegyptin collagen interaction. The van t Hoff plot is linear over a temperature range of 15 40 C. and the calculated free energy difference G of 48 0.013 kJ mol indicates that the binding reaction occurs spontaneously. Both entropic and enthalpic components of the interaction are favorable as indicated by a positive value for T S 28 0.83 kJ mol and a negative value for H 20 0.85 kJ mol . This suggests that both hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions contribute significantly to the aegyptin collagen binding reaction. Table 3 summarizes the results.

GPVI plays a crucial role in platelet responses to collagen and directly participates in platelet activation and supports platelet adhesionascertain whether Aegyptin interferes with GPVI collagen interaction GPVI was immobilized in a CM5 chip followed by injection of collagen I in the flow cell previously incubated with or without inhibitor.

Solution Competition Assays. Experiments were performed in an attempt to detect whether Aegyptin blocks collagen interaction with GPVI. Recombinant GPVI 25 g ml in acetate pH 4.5 buffer was immobilized on a CM5 sensor with a final surface density of 1753.2 RU. A blank flow cell was used to subtract any effect of buffer in the refractory index change. Then different concentrations 3.175 6.125 12.5 25 and 50 g ml of collagen I alone control or previously incubated 15 minutes at room temperature with 500 nM of Aegyptin in HBS P buffer was injected over immobilized GPVI for 120 seconds at 20 l minute. Complex dissociation was monitored for 400 seconds. Sensor surface was regenerated between runs with by a 30 second pulse of glycine solution pH 1.5. To verify that immobilized GPVI was still active after all the injection regeneration cycles 50 g ml of collagen I was injected for 120 seconds at a flow rate of 20 l minute and the resulting sensorgram compared with the one obtained before. Additionally a control experiment was carried out using convulxin at different concentrations 2.5 5 and 10 nM incubated with buffer or saturating concentrations of Aegyptin 500 nM followed by injection of the mixture over immobilized GPVI as described above.

Integrin 2 1 is known to mediate adhesion in Mg dependent manner. It is now recognized that the type of collagen largely determines the requirement for 2 1. Whereas 2 1 is essential for platelet adhesion and activation on monomeric type I collagen in stasis and flow it is dispensable for these processes on native fibrillar collagen.To investigate whether Aegyptin blocks integrin 2 1 collagen interaction platelets were added to coverslips coated with either fibrillar or soluble collagen.

Coverslips 22 22 mm no. 0 were treated with HSO HO 4 1 for 20 minutes to remove contaminants followed by ultrasonic washing with deionized water and ultravioletcleaning. Coverslips were coated with fibrillar 100 g ml Chronolog Par or soluble collagen type I 100 g ml for 10 minutes rinsed in deionized water and incubated overnight with denaturated BSA 7 mg ml . Coverslips were treated with 100 l of Aegyptin 0 3 M for 15 minutes and inhibitor was removed by inverting and touching the borders of coverslips with precision wipes Kimberly Clark Ontario Canada . Platelets 200 l 2 10 ml were applied to coverslips incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature followed by washing in Tyrode BSA and mounted for imaging. Differential interference contrast images were obtained with a Leica DMI6000 microscope Leica Microsystems Inc. Bannockburn Ill. using 100 objective with NA 1.30 and an ORCA ER digital camera Hamamatsu Photonic Systems Bridgewater N.J. . Image acquisition and the digital camera were controlled by ImagePro 5.1 software Media Cybernetics Silver Spring Md. . Extent of platelet adhesion was expressed as percent area covered by platelets.

Platelet collagen interactions are believed to have the greatest significance at the medium and high shear rates found in arteries. At the very high shear rates found in small arteries and arterioles the rapid onset of interaction between GPIb V IX and vWf immobilized on collagen is crucial for initial tethering or capture of flowing platelets.Interaction between vWf and GPIb IX V however is rapidly reversible and insufficient for stable adhesion. At low shear rates or static condition vWf plays a secondary role but interactions can be detected using in vitro assays. In order to determine whether Aegyptin interferes with vWf interaction the following experiments were performed with collagen III under static and flow conditions.

To estimate the effects of Aegyptin in vWf collagen interaction an ELISA assay was optimized as follows. Polystyrene plates were coated with 100 l of collagen type III 3 g ml or a 2 w v solution of bovine serum albumin BSA diluted in PBS for 2 hours at 37 C. After washing twice with PBS to remove unbound protein residual binding sites were blocked by adding 5 mg ml denatured BSA overnight at 4 C. After washing 3 times with 50 mM Tris HCl 150 mM NaCl and 0.05 v v Tween 20 pH 7.4 TBS T increasing concentrations of recombinant Aegyptin ranging from 0.0015 to 1.5 M was added to the well and incubated at 37 C. for 1 hour. Wells were washed again and incubated with 3 nM of vWf factor VIII free Haematologic Technologies Inc in TBS T supplemented with 2 w v BSA. After 1 hour at 37 C. wells were washed 3 times with TBS T and a polyclonal rabbit anti human vWf DakoCytomation Glostrup Denmark was added 1 500 in TBS T and incubated for 1 hour at 37 C. After 3 washes with TBS T an alkaline phosphatase conjugate anti rabbit IgG whole molecule Sigma was added 1 10000 and incubated at 37 C. for 45 minutes. Before adding the stabilized p nitrophenyl phosphate liquid substrate Sigma wells were washed 6 times with TBS T. After 30 minutes of substrate conversion the reaction was stopped with 3 N NaOH and absorbance read at 405 nm using a Thermomax microplate reader Molecular Devices Sunnyvale Calif. . Net specific binding was obtained by subtracting optical density values from wells coated only with BSA from the total binding measured as described above. All experiments were performed in triplicate. The results presented in show that Aegyptin dose dependently inhibits vWf interaction with soluble collagen III with an ICof 50 nM.

Next the effects of Aegyptin in platelet adhesion to collagen under flow conditions were evaluated as follows. Glass slides were coated with fibrillar collagen 300 l 100 g ml for 10 min washed in TBS and incubated overnight with denatured BSA 7 mg ml . Coated slides were treated with Aegyptin 300 l in Tyrode BSA 0 3 M for 15 minutes and excess removed by inversion. The slides was placed in the bottom of the parallel plate flow chamber Glycotech Rockville Md. and a silicone rubber gasket determined the flow path height of 254 m as described.Anticoagulated blood 50 M PPACK was mixed with Aegyptin and aspirated using a infusion withdrawal pump with multi speed Transmission Model 940 Harvard Apparatus Dover Mass. through the flow chamber at a flow rate of 0.65 ml minute producing a shear rate of 1 500 s.Blood was perfused for 240 seconds followed by immediate perfusion with Tyrode BSA 0.65 ml min for 120 sec to remove blood and slides subsequently washed in Tyrode BSA.

Twelve day old chick eggs are cracked and the embryo is removed from its surroundings. The chick ventral is arranged side up and the head is removed. Tweezers are used to lift the tissue above the breastbone and scissors are used to trim the tissue above the thoracic cavity to exposure the heart and the aortic arch. The heart and aortic arch are carefully removed and placed in PBS plus 1 Penstrep. Under the dissection microscope excess tissue is removed and the clean arches are cut into 0.8 mm pieces as described in Brassard D. L. Maxwell E. Malkowski M. Nagabhushan T. L. Kumar C. C. and Armstrong L. Integrin alpha v beta 3 mediated activation of apoptosis. Exp Cell Res. 1999 251 33.45 and Ingber D. E. 1990. Fibronectin controls capillary endothelial cell growth by modulating cell shape. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87 3579 3583. Because the ends of the aortas are held by forceps during the cleaning and cutting and may become damaged they are discarded. Plates 96 well are coated with 3 l of Matrigel after gelling rings are placed into the wells and sealed in place with a 2 10 l overlay of Matrigel. Then 100 l EBM 2 with 1 Pentrep is added followed by addition of saliva or salivary gland up to 10 l . Sprouting is observed for 3 days and pictures are taken using a digital camera coupled to an inverted microscope. Each data point is assayed in triplicate and each experiment is repeated at least three times. A blinded observer scores outgrowth by comparing responses with media alone positive control to that observed with saliva. Results are scored as follows or 100 sprouting comparable to positive control or 75 significant sprouting but lower than positive control or 25 significant sprouting above background levels or 10 low levels of sprouting and 

The sprouting of vessels from aortic ring explants is used next to determine whether the Aegyptin inhibited in vitro angiogenesis. Chick aortic rings are placed in Matrigel and incubated with EBM 2 100 l . Aegyptin inhibits sprouting formation.

The nucleotide sequences encoding the full length Aegyptin protein was modified to generate sequences optimized for expression in human cells without altering the encoded polypeptide sequences according to Sharp et al. 1988 Nucleic Acids Res. 16 8207 11 hereby incorporated by reference. The optimized sequence for Aegyptin SEQ ID NO 3 bears 74 identity to the original sequence.

An expression plasmid is designed to express aegyptin SEQ ID NO 2 . The aegyptin coding sequence SEQ ID NO 1 is inserted into plasmid A so that it is under the transcriptional control of the CMV promoter and the RSV enhancer element. See U.S. Pat. No. 6 235 888 to Pachuk et al. herein expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety . Plasmid backbone A is 3969 base pairs in length it contains a PBR origin of replication for replicating in and a kanamycin resistance gene. Inserts such as aegyptin are cloned into a polylinker region which places the insert between and operably linked to the promoter and polyadenylation signal. Transcription of the cloned inserts is under the control of the CMV promoter and the RSV enhancer elements. A polyadenylation signal is provided by the presence of an SV40 poly A signal situated just 3 of the cloning site. An Aegyptin containing vaccine composition is then made by mixing 500 g of the Aegyptin construct with 1 mg of ribavirin.

Said vaccine composition can be used to raise antibodies in a mammal e.g. mice or rabbits or can be injected intramuscularly into a human so as to raise antibodies. The recipient preferably receives three immunization boosts of the mixture at 4 week intervals as well. By the third boost the titer of antibody specific for Aegyptin will be significantly increased.

An in vivo experiment is performed in rabbits to demonstrate the dose response of aegyptin either alone or in combination with t PA. Thrombolytic activities are determined in rabbits using an extracorporeal shunt which contains a thrombus labeled with 1 125 fibrinogen. Lysis is measured by the disappearance of radioactivity measured by an external sodium iodine crystal. Wild type t PA is given as a 10 bolus with the remainder of the dose infused over the following 90 min. Aegyptin is tested at single dose of 0.1 mg kg using a 0.05 mg kg bolus followed by an infusion of 0.05 mg kg for 90 min. All lysis is determined at the end of the 90 min. infusion.

The results will show that aegyptin has a surprisingly high clot lysing activity and enhances the clot lysing activity of tPA.

Aegyptin may be parenterally administered to subjects suffering from cardiovascular diseases or conditions including acute thrombosis. Dosage or dose rate may parallel that currently in use in clinical investigations of other cardiovascular thrombolytic agents e.g. about 1 2 mg kg body weight as an intravenous or intra arterial dose over 1.5 12 hours in patients suffering from conditions such as myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism.

A human patient is diagnosed with cardiovascular disease. During an angioplasty procedure a drug eluting mesh stent impregnated with aegyptin and tPA is placed in an occluded artery. The treated artery is monitored periodically after the procedure and the patient will experience improved cardiovascular health.

Although the invention has been described with reference to embodiments and examples it should be understood that various modifications can be made without departing from the spirit of the invention. Accordingly the invention is limited only by the following claims. All references cited herein are hereby expressly incorporated by reference.

The predicted molecular weight of Aegyptin mature peptide predicted by cDNA is 27 kDa Calvo. E. Andersen J. Francischetti I. M. de L. C. M. deBianchi A. G. James A. A. Ribeiro J. M. and Marinotti O. 2004. The transcriptome of adult female salivary glands. 13 73 88 . However it elutes as a higher molecular weight protein of 112 kDa retention time 14.75 min when loaded on a gel filtration column . In an attempt to obtain further insights related to Aegyptin structure a series of experiments were designed. SEC MALS QELS HPLC was used to analyze the hydrodynamic radius R of the recombinant Aegyptin given the significant increase in the apparent weight average mass. Multi angle light scattering conformed its presence as a monomer of 33 kDa 1.67 with a hydrodynamic radius of 4.8 nm 0.29 indicating that it is a non globular protein with a molecular mass of 33.4 kDa. This result also indicates that Aegyptin is highly extended compared to a more typical globular protein such as BSA R3.4 nm . The CD spectrum shows that Aegyptin contains 50 of helices 20 of sheet and 25 unordered structures . depicts a plot using the PONDR VL XT software which identified that Aegyptin has unordered structures mostly found in the N terminus of the molecule. The elongated pattern with high contents of helix and sheet was also predicated by Phyre v 0.2 algorithm .

The interaction of Aegyptin with collagen is visualized using atomic force microscopy AFM . AFM is particularly useful technique to visualize the morphology of molecules and cells under aqueous environment without fixation and has previously been used to dissect the structure of collagen. The AFM images of collagen fibrils in control shows D banding pattern and features characteristic of a rope like structure. Bozec L van der Heijden G. and Horton M. 2007. Collagen fibrils nanoscale ropes. 92 70 75 and Aegyptin 0.5 M depicts the phenomenon of the so called birdcaging of a rope when Aegyptin is present in which the strands making up the rope separate and open up in the presence of the inhibitor. In the absence of Aegyptin the apparent average diameter of collagen was calculated as 0.614 nm 0.1 while in the presence of Aegyptin it was of 1.022 0.3 . show the surface plot of selected areas of . To confirm that Aegyptin induces unwinding by a second and independent technique CD spectra of collagen in the presence of Aegyptin were performed and compared with the spectra of heat denatured collagen. shows CD spectra of Aegyptin 3 M and native collagen type I 3 M at 25 C. and the spectrum of the mixture containing Aegyptin and collagen. The calculated spectrum is just the sum of the first two. As expected there is a sizeable loss of signal in the collagen region but not at longer wavelengths. also shows the CD spectra of soluble collagen type I at 65 C. denatured where most of the CD signal is lost. Assuming that the change of collagen ellipticity at 200 nm in this figure 44.2 mdegs shows complete unfolding then the amount of signal lost in the Aegyptin collagen complex 14.9 mdegs suggests that 34 of the collagen is unfolded in the complex by reduction in poly proline II structure resembling the CD spectrum of denatured collagen.

Aegyptin Interacts with Specific Sequences Involved in Collagen Interaction with GPVI vWF and Integrin 2 1

In an attempt to identify the binding sequences involved in collagen interaction with Aegyptin a series of peptides based on collagen sequences which reportedly mediate collagen interaction with physiological ligands were synthesized. The peptides GPO SEQ ID NO 10 GFOGER SEQ ID NO 8 and RGQOGVMGFO SEQ ID NO 9 were then cross linked and used for SPR experiments and functional assays in vitro as described hereinabove. shows typical sensorgrams of Aegyptin binding to GPO . The data was fitted with a two state binding model and yields a Kof 5.01 M. Functionally Aegyptin prevents collagen induced platelet aggregation under test tube stirring conditions with an IC50 100 nM see Example 5 above but was ineffective to inhibit GPO induced platelet aggregation consistent with a low affinity interaction. demonstrates that Aegyptin recognizes the integrin binding site in collagen with a Kof 2.4 M and shows that Aegyptin prevents platelet adhesion to immobilized collagen in a dose dependent manner but was ineffective when GFOGER SEQ ID NO 8 was immobilized due to low affinity. shows that Aegyptin interacts with RGQOGVMGFO SEQ ID NO 9 with a calculated Kof 0.1 M while shows that the inhibitor prevents vWF interaction with the peptide with an IC 300 nM. Table 4 summarizes the kinetic findings.

Individual collagen molecules maintain their integrity by non covalent bonds and denaturation leads to unraveling of the coiled coil and dissociation of the three chains. Heating the collagens above a critical temperature causes denaturation reflected in a rapid loss of the triple helical structure. Khoshnoodi J. Cartailler J. P. Alvares K. Veis A. and Hudson B. G. 2006. Molecular recognition in the assembly of collagens terminal noncollagenous domains are key recognition modules in the formation of triple helical protomers. 281 38117 38121 Heino J. 2007. The collagen family members as cell adhesion proteins. 29 1001 1010. Therefore experiments were performed to determine whether the triple helical structure of collagen is needed for high affinity binding. shows that Aegyptin binds to heat denatured collagen with affinity comparable to the native molecule Table 4 indicating that the primary sequence is sufficient for the interaction. To determine the pattern of aegyptin binding to collagen fiber Aegyptin was labeled with FITC as described in Methods. shows the collagen fibers detected by DIC and demonstrates that Aegyptin FITC interacts throughout with fibrillar Horm collagen which was confirmed by bright field microscopy observed under DIC not shown . Specificity was checked using 25 molar excess of unlabeled Aegyptin and no auto fluorescence was detectable for collagen alone not shown .

Next an independent experiment was performed to confirm that Aegyptin interacts with multiple binding sites in collagen. Sensorgrams in show that Aegyptin binding to immobilized collagen is followed by slow dissociation phase as described previously Calvo E. Tokumasu F. Marinotti O. Villeval J. L. Ribeiro J. M. and Francischetti I. M. 2007 . Aegyptin a novel mosquito salivary gland protein specifically binds to collagen and prevents its interaction with platelet glycoprotein VI integrin alpha2beta1 and von Willebrand factor. 282 26928 26938 . Notably however when Aegyptin was immobilized in the sensor chip and collagen used as an analyte interaction displayed irreversible binding see Discussion below .

It was of interest to identify the inhibitor motifs that account for the collagen binding properties. A number of mutants corresponding to the N terminus 1 39 a C terminus 1 113 as C terminus 2 137 aa Mid sequence 132 aa and GEEDA repeats 50 aa of Aegyptin were expressed and purified. A diagram for each mutant is shown in . Among all mutants tested only C terminus 2 SEQ ID NO 22 was shown to interact with collagen with a K 60 nM . shows that C terminus 2 prevents collagen induced platelet aggregation with IC 3 M.

Next it was asked whether Aegyptin displays in vivo antithrombotic properties using a laser induced model of carotid injury in rats as described by Rosen E. D. Raymond S. Zollman A. Noria F. Sandoval Cooper M. Shulman A. Merz J. L and Castellino F. J. 2001 . Laser induced noninvasive vascular injury models in mice generate platelet and coagulation dependent thrombi. 158 1613 1622 . With photochemical injury dye e.g. Rose Bengal is infused into the circulation. Photo excitation leads to oxidative injury of the vessel wall and subsequent thrombus formation. shows that the blood flow of control non treated animals stopped in 20 minutes. On the other hand the time for thrombus formation in animals treated with 50 g kg Aegyptin was 50 min while in the presence of 100 g kg Aegyptin thrombus formation was delayed more than 80 minutes. Notably no bleeding was noticed in the presence of effective anti thrombotic concentrations of Aegyptin.

The molecular mechanism has been investigated by which Aegyptin prevents platelet activation induced by collagen a highly thrombogenic protein of the vessel wall together with tissue factor. The data presented herein provide compelling evidence to conclude that Aegyptin inhibits platelet aggregation by a novel and dual mechanism. The first mechanism is explained by Aegyptin interaction with the collagen sequences which mediate its interaction with GPVI vWF and integrin 2 1. Aegyptin binding to each synthetic peptide tested alone occurs in the M range as described for the interaction of CRP GPO with GPVI estimated by SPR Miura Y. et al. 2002277 46197 46204 . Since binding of Aegyptin to native collagen occurs at nM concentrations Calvo E. et al. 2007282 26928 26938 it is plausible that multiple binding sites exist for Aegyptin in collagen resulting in a remarkably high affinity between both molecules as observed for the tight interaction between bifunctional or multivalent proteins and their respective ligands 30 32 Francischetti I. M. et al. 200299 3602 3612 Richardson J. L. et al. 200019 5650 5660 Bergum P. W. et al. 2001276 10063 10071 . This assumption is supported by the SPR experiments which show irreversible binding of collagen to immobilized Aegyptin and also by the fact that Aegyptin prevents platelet function associated with different ligands Calvo E. et al. 2007282 26928 26938 . The discovery that Aegyptin targets at least three distinct collagen sequences is novel and distinguishes it from other platelet inhibitors described so far Harsfalvi. J. et al. 199585 705 711 Connolly T. M. et al. 1992267 6893 6898 Barnes C. S. et al. 2001 27 337 348 Lasser G. et al. 2006107 423 430 Harsfalvi J. et al. 1995 85 705 711 Connolly T. M. et al. 1992 267 6893 6898 Barnes C. S. et al. 2001 27 337 348 Lasser G. et al. 2006 107 423 430 . It is also in agreement with the elongated structure found for Aegyptin according to gel filtration chromatography light scattering plot and a prediction model.

The finding that Aegyptin preferentially interacts with the RGQOGVMGFO SEQ ID NO. 9 peptide and also blocks its function is particularly relevant taking into account the critical role of vWF in the initiation of platelet adhesion and thrombus formation through tethering the platelet to site of injury through binding to the platelet GPIb and collagen particularly at high shear rates Nieswandt B. et al. 2003 192 449 461 Ruggeri Z. M. 2002 8 1227 1234 . Accordingly platelet tethering along the injured vessel wall is reduced by 80 in mice deficient in vWF moreover mutants of vWF with impaired binding to collagen causes a delay of several minutes in thrombus formation in vivo Denis C. et al. 1998 95 9524 9529 Marx I. et al. 2008 . Likewise deficiency of GPIb has a remarkable antithrombotic effect Konstantinides S. et al. 2006 4 2014 2021 and recent studies have shown that inhibition of GPIb with antibodies profoundly protects mice from ischemic stroke without increasing the risk of intracranial hemorrhage Kleinschnitz C. et al. 2007 115 2323 2330 . In this regard the experiments using a laser induced carotid artery model in the presence of Rose Bengal Rosen E. D. et al. 2001 158 1613 1622 a model that resembles FeCl induced thrombus formation which occurs primarily through the collagen GPVI axis Sachs U. J. and Nieswandt B. 2007 100 979 991 Furie B. and Furie B. C. 2005 115 3355 3362 confirms that Aegyptin is an effective anti thrombotic agent in vive and major bleeding was not observable.

Concerning other collagen like sequences the results presented herein demonstrate that Aegyptin binds to GPO and GFOGER peptide SEQ ID NO 8 with low affinity but it is conceivable that these or related sequences together contribute to Aegyptin interaction with collagen. The main argument in support of this notion is the fact that Aegyptin effectively prevents GPVI integrin 2 1 and vWF interaction with the native collagen in vitro and blocks the corresponding platelet responses with similar IC Sachs U. J. and Nieswandt B. 2007 100 979 991 . It is important to recognize that platelet adhesion and activation in primary hemostasis and in thrombus formation occurs as a result of the interaction of a number of molecules with collagen including plasma vWF and platelet receptors such as integrin 2 1 and GPVI. In fact it has now become clear that integrin and GPVI synergistically mediate platelet adhesion and aggregation while GPVI is primarily involved in cell activation and outside in signaling including integrin 2 1 activation the integrin contributes to additional GPVI collagen interaction and stable thrombus formation. Therefore recognition of distinct sequences by Aegyptin appears to be an effective strategy for inhibition of platelet function. The fact that Aegyptin recognizes the GPO and also prevents GPVI binding to collagen is particularly relevant vis vis the role of GPVI in thrombus formation. For example monkeys who have been treated with anti GPVI antibodies have thrombotic events inhibited ex vivo. Li H. et al. 2007 27 1199 1205 Ohlmann P. et al. 2008 2005 105 1492 1499 without increase in the bleeding time. Likewise GPVI knock out mice Massberg S. Gawaz M. Gruner S. Schulte V. Konrad I.

The sensorgrams showing the high affinity binding of Aegyptin to RGQOGVMGF peptide SEQ ID NO 9 confirms that Aegyptin recognizes specific sequences in collagen and no minimal number of GPP GPO stretches is necessary for binding. Moreover because Aegyptin binds to heat denatured collagen it is concluded that the triple helical structure is not a prerequisite for binding. Similar conclusions have been reported for Keratinocyte Growth Factor Nieswandt B. et al. 2001 193 459 469 Oncostatin M Somasundaram R. et al. 2002 277 3242 3246 Interleukin 2 Somasundaram R. et al. 2000 275 38170 38175 and PDGF Somasundaram R. and Schuppan D. 1996 J Biol Chem 271 26884 26891 binding to collagen which is not prevented by reduction and alkylation or heat denaturation. Notably collagen is thermally unstable at body temperature and has been reported to display a random coil rather then triple helix structure only. Further denatured collagen modulates the function of fibroblasts and promotes wound healing indicating it is biologically active Egles C. et al. 2008 . Therefore it is plausible that Aegyptin recognizes specific primary sequences found in native or denatured triple helical collagen molecule in vivo resulting in tight complex formation. Actually this effect appears to have potential therapeutic implications taking into account the role of matrix collagen associated cytokine and mitogens in angiogenesis inflammation and fibrosis in one hand and thrombus formation and atherosclerosis on the other.

Notably the results presented herein unambiguously show that the second mechanism by which Aegyptin prevents platelet aggregation is through unwinding of the collagen triple helix. This conclusion is supported by CD experiments which demonstrated a conformational change of the collagen molecule herein identified as a reduction in poly proline II structure resulting in a remarkable decrease of ellipticity. Similar conclusions were attained by AFM which reveals that the pattern of spiral disposition typical of collagen is globally affected by Aegyptin with important changes in height and width of the molecule. It is concluded that the strands making up the rope shaped structure that characterize collagen separate and open up in the presence of the inhibitor. While the relative contribution of unwinding versus interaction of specific sequences for the inhibition of platelet functions by Aegyptin remains to be determined a working hypothesis emerges where Aegyptin binding to collagen is accompanied by global unwinding without cleavage resulting in loss of collagen interaction with major physiological ligands. This is a unique inhibitory mechanism described so far for a platelet aggregation inhibitor. On the other hand collagenase metalloprotease MMP 1 or gelatinase MMP 2 causes a local unwinding of the triple helical before peptide bond hydrolysis occurs by a mechanism intensely debated. It is therefore remarkable that evolutionary pressure took place in mosquitoes salivary glands to produce a protein like Aegyptin and AAPP and the results presented herein also underscore the critical role of collagen in physiology in general and hemostasis in particular. Further protein sequences compatible with the collagen molecule have been identified by mass spectrometry in mammoths and also in dinosaurs Asara J. M. et al. 316 280 285 a species displaying rudimentary platelets thrombocytes Brass L. F. 2005 115 3329 3331 and which coexisted with blood sucking mosquitoes reportedly found at least 50 million years ago.

The use of recombinant proteins as antithrombotic in vive is often hampered by antigenicity or high molecular weight of the proteins. In an attempt to reduce the potential antigenicity and the molecular weight of Aegyptin and also to identify a binding domain responsible for its activity a series of mutants were engineered. The rationale for choosing specific mutants was based on the repetitive sequence GEEDA found in Aegyptin the pattern of cysteines and the characteristics of the N terminus and C terminus of the inhibitor. The findings presented herein clearly show that the GEEDA motif that provides a signature for Aegyptin does not play a major role in collagen binding properties when tested alone. Likewise the N terminus mid sequences and C terminus 1 displaying all 4 cysteines but without GEEDA repeats were devoid of activity. However the C terminus 2 of Aegyptin that display 24 aa more than C terminus 1 plus a TY sequence highly conserved in the members of the 30 kDa family of proteins Jariyapan N. et al. 200643 867 874 Cazares Raga F. E. et al. 2007 16 187 198 Francischetti I. M. et al. 2002 205 2429 2451 was relatively effective for binding to and inhibition of collagen induced platelet activation. Therefore it was concluded that the GEEDA repeats have an accessory role in mediating Aegyptin collagen interaction but it is not per se a fundamental sequence that mediates inhibitor collagen interaction. Interestingly the C terminus of Aegyptin has been identified as a highly ordered region which is often associated with molecular recognition. Accordingly it is plausible to envisage Aegyptin as a molecule or as a prototype to develop inhibitors of collagen interaction with physiological ligands in a number of pathological conditions.
