This application is a continuation in part of U.S. application Ser. No. 14 151 653 filed on Jan. 9 2014 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application 61 750 789 entitled Flexible Thermal Energy Storage for Transportation Refrigeration filed Jan. 9 2013 the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.

This invention relates to thermal energy storage devices refrigeration systems and methods. More specifically this invention relates to thermal energy storage and power systems for transport cooling and refrigeration at a desired temperature range or set point over extended periods of time.

A number of systems have been developed over the years to provide multi temperature refrigeration for the transport of perishable or temperature sensitive goods in large trailers or containers. The systems are generally designed to work both while the trailer is parked and during operation on the road. These systems referred to as trailer refrigeration units TRU in the trucking industry are predominantly vapor compression cycle VCC refrigeration units driven by diesel auxiliary power unit APU engines directly or through a gen set for large 53 foot trailers. On smaller trucks the refrigeration systems may be powered by truck alternator produced electrical energy or by APU diesel engines. The temperature ranges required for transport of the most common refrigerated goods generally range from about 20 F. to about 40 F. The cooling capacity must be provided for at least several hours when operating over the road.

Existing VCC TRU systems with diesel APUs have been used for many years. However APU powered TRU systems have some significant shortcomings. First these systems are characterized by high operating costs due to their large consumption of diesel fuel. Second operation by use of diesel fuel raises a number of regulatory issues including noise restrictions and proven health critical emissions from the diesel engines.

Electrical trailer refrigeration units powered by truck alternators are another one of the systems providing multi temperature refrigeration but these systems have been generally limited to smaller trucks and box trucks. In other applications such as with a large 53 foot trailer these systems have proven nonviable because of the constraints of delivering power from the truck to the trailer due to impractical power transfer and operational logistics issues. The impracticalities in power transfer from the truck include the significant power generation cost and issues in packaging the systems on the truck itself. There are also significant concerns with transferring high voltage or current from the truck to the trailer. In the shipping industry there is often a split in the ownership of the vehicle and the container it is transporting. For example with semi trucks one party often owns the truck or tractor while another party owns the trailer. This split ownership creates operational logistics problems for the delivery of power from the truck to the trailer. And trailers outnumber trucks by a factor of two or three to one. Therefore implementing truck to trailer power becomes impractical as the truck must be properly equipped to power the refrigeration system employed by the trailer. And there would need to be sufficient numbers of trucks to power all trailers needing power.

Eutectic solid plate or cold plate refrigeration systems are another type of system employed by smaller delivery trucks. Cold plate systems rely on heat transfer to large solid plates with the heat absorbed by the cold plate cooling the surrounding air. Cold plate systems are charged by shore power driven i.e. electric plug vapor compression cycle refrigeration systems. These systems are often used for trucks designed for local delivery and are characterized by much less precise temperature control. These systems have many short comings including their limited heat absorbance capacity long recharge times for the eutectic plates the limited temperature control features of the systems and the excessively heavy weights of the plates. This has generally limited the application of cold plates systems to smaller local delivery trucks.

Battery powered trailer refrigeration units represent a third type of system though with more limited application than the truck alternator powered TRU or cold plates. Battery powered trailer refrigeration units could be charged by shore power and many other means including power provided by the truck APU. While these systems enable diesel free operation over the road their initial cost is prohibitively expensive they are impractically heavy to use for large refrigerated trailer systems and battery replacement cost further limit their economic feasibility.

Large refrigerated containers such as sea containers generally utilize VCC refrigeration units that are powered by high voltage electricity supplied by the vessel when aboard ships and can be powered from shore power during transit at ports. Sea containers using electrically powered VCC place a particularly large current demand on the system s electrical grid aboard ship or from shore power when the unit cycles. The sea container systems also require significant steady state power requiring oversized power networks or very complex systems to manage the number of units operating and the timing of the cycling.

The considerations described above highlight the economic importance of developing more efficient cooling systems. In addition to these economic factors regulatory restrictions will create additional incentives to adopt more efficient systems. Recent regulatory activity in the U.S. relating to the diesel engine on TRU units has resulted in additional administrative and economic burdens for fleets operating diesel powered TRU units. Specifically the environmental protection agency EPA and the Air Resources Board of California CARB have enacted legislation requiring reporting and upgrading the diesel engines and or emission after treatment equipment used on trailer refrigeration units. California law as adopted in the CARB EPA tier IV requirements of 2013 requires the business entities that arrange hire contract for or dispatch TRU equipped trucks trailers shipping containers or railcars for transport of perishable goods on California highways and railways to require the motor carriers to dispatch only TRUs that comply with the TRU Regulation. This legislation in addition to the direct operational fuel costs and indirect emission and noise impacts provide significant incentives for the elimination of the diesel engine from the TRU.

Given the number of short comings of the systems currently in operation including the reliance of many systems on diesel power the coupling of the trailer to the truck for power generation and the high weight of some systems there exists a strong and well defined need for more efficient cooling systems for the transport of perishable or temperature sensitive goods in large trailers or containers. The present invention provides systems to meet these important needs as detailed in the following disclosure.

The present invention provides a hybrid refrigeration and thermal energy storage system that enables the elimination of the diesel engine or auxiliary power unit APU from a TRU or other refrigeration unit in a refrigerated trailer boxcar or other cooled air transport space. The hybrid refrigeration and thermal energy storage system provides the required discharge of refrigerated air for cooling of cargo or passengers in large compartments. The system can be employed in a large compartment such as the trailer of a semi truck without the need for a dedicated TRU diesel engine or other APU. The system can directly power a conventional VCC unit such as an electric only TRU with high voltage over the road to cool the refrigerated space. The system can simultaneously power the VCC unit and charge a battery energy storage BES and or thermal energy storage TES systems over the road. The present invention also as provides cooling capability when the vehicle is stationary or parked using its TES and BES sub system. For extended periods when the vehicle is not in motion plug in grid power provides the power for VCC cooling and can also provide TES BES charging.

While TESS and BESS systems provide the potential to eliminate the diesel engine from the TRU the present invention in the form of hybrid refrigeration thermal storage or hybrid thermal storage system HTESS is particularly advantageous as it provides capability to minimize the size of the TESS and BESS systems minimize or eliminate the grid power plug in requirement and at the same time avoids the cost weight emission and regulatory impacts of the diesel APU.

The present invention employs a unique combination of components in a system that derives power from the rotational motion of the wheels of a vehicle and directly uses this high voltage energy for cooling a compartment while simultaneously enabling the storage of energy from the motion in the form of chemical and thermal storage. The generated power may be produced in various forms. In one embodiment high voltage i.e. over 60 volts alternating current AC or high voltage direct current DC and low voltage i.e. below 60 volts DC are produced. The dynamically produced energy that is not used directly by the electric powered VCC unit to cool the space can be stored as chemical energy in the low voltage DC BESS and or stored as thermal energy capacity produced through a secondary loop of the onboard VCC or TRU cooling system. The high voltage power electrical energy can be produced through a novel constant velocity output wheel axle power generation system of the present invention or by more conventional means such as a hybrid vehicle wheel motor or conventional direct drive gen set.

In one embodiment the high voltage AC or DC can be used to power an electric only TRU VCC or other refrigeration system to directly cool the cargo area while at the same time providing power and refrigeration capacity into the novel thermal energy storage TES and chemical battery energy storage BES systems of the present invention. Additionally the primary electromagnetic electricity generating system provided by the trailer axle wheel rotation may be complemented by a supplementary secondary power generating system that converts solar energy into electricity. This provides renewable electrical power to charge the BESS or to power the TESS electrical systems directly when the vehicle is not in motion and cannot generate primary power. When these primary and secondary power elements are combined with chemical and thermal energy storage elements the systems can be coupled together in such a way that a significant synergistic benefit is derived. More simply put both the primary and secondary electricity generators as well as VCC refrigeration TESS and BESS work together to produce a sum of directly available electrical power and refrigeration capacity that may be more advantageously utilized than the systems considered on an individual and separate basis. The inclusion of the primary and secondary electrical power systems facilitate significant reductions in the thermal energy storage TES system and the chemical or battery energy storage BES system size weight and cost. Further the inclusion of the primary and secondary power systems integrated with onboard VCC BESS and TESS reduces and in most transport use cases can eliminate the need for grid based charging of the BESS and TESS systems. For example trailers in continuous duty would remain thermally and electrically charged or could be quickly restored to full charge on the road without plugging in to the grid. This over the road charging capability for the TESS and BESS is especially effective for refrigerated transport logistics where vehicle wait time can be limited and where providing multiple grid power points is operationally prohibitive or expensive.

As discussed above the present invention provides significant synergistic benefits through the application of the primary wheel or axle power to directly power the electric VCC while in motion. Due to the novel combination of components and supply of power and its availability over the road the TES and BES system size and weight can be minimized and the diesel APU engine and fuel tank can be eliminated from the TRU. Eliminating the diesel APU reduces weight and the need for diesel APU emissions compliance reporting and regulated engine and engine emission system upgrades. Since the primary electric power system supports the use of conventional or other electric only TRU VCC systems while in motion the BES and TES can be sized to support only the refrigeration and electrical power needs of the transport refrigeration vehicle when the vehicle is not in motion or not plugged into the grid. The HTESS therefore minimizes the TESS and BESS size and eliminates the diesel APU engine and fuel tank to facilitate reduced weight and space envelope which results in higher fuel and freight efficiently for the trailer system. Further with the use of secondary solar power the BES system size weight and cost can be further minimized and energy efficiency improved through the use of renewable power.

In addition to the weight and package envelope reductions achieved through eliminating the diesel TRU APU engine significant cost and administrative advantages to refrigerated trailer operators are also realized. For example the HTESS TRU would no longer be subject to Environmental Protection Agency and California Air Resources Board stipulated upgrades and reporting on diesel engines providing a significant operational cost advantage over and beyond the diesel fuel savings.

An additional synergistic advantage of the HRTESS system is the use of the available ABS brake communication or other signal inputs to identify conditions for charging the TESS and BESS systems which much like a hybrid car can recover otherwise wasted deceleration energy. Unlike many battery hybrid systems however the HRTESS system can absorb high levels of energy and power during deceleration or braking events. Over the road the thermal and chemical energy TESS and BESS can be controlled to be fully charged quickly for maximum coverage of idle periods or can be partially discharged and recharged over the road to take advantage as much as possible of the recovered vehicle deceleration energy events. The discharge recharge feature while broadly applicable can be especially useful for city transit busses which start and stop frequently and even on hybrid electric busses may have limits on what electrical energy is recoverable during braking events due to limited battery capability to absorb the power quickly. The HTESS even when applied to a non hybrid bus for air conditioning can provide significant energy recovery fuel savings as air conditioning loads can contribute to over 40 of hot weather fuel consumption. For critical refrigeration cargo on the other hand it may be desirable to maintain TESS and BESS fully charged and take less advantage of energy recovery deceleration events. In this scenario the HTESS still provides significant fuel savings because the incremental power increase needed from the truck engine to power an active HTESS primary power generation system is a very small load compared to the amount of power used to pull the loaded trailer. Accordingly the incremental increase in power needed from the truck engine does not significantly impact its overall fuel consumption.

The TES system can charge quickly and provide multi temperature cooling over the road without diesel APU noise and undesirable emissions. The system operates at a reduced weight and cost compared to eutectic or battery only powered systems. The HTESS is not applicable to seagoing vessels in the same manner as road vehicles however in sea going applications a TES system according to aspects of the invention can extend the window in which sea container refrigeration systems must be operated with high power VCC thereby reducing the complexity of the control systems the peak power demand and the ultimate capacity of the power supply system.

In further aspects the present invention provides defrost systems with a novel reverse flow approach to minimize defrost energy while maintaining the cooling power delivered to the refrigerated space.

These and other features aspects and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with reference to the following drawings descriptions and claims.

The present invention provides a hybrid powered thermal energy storage system HTESS that enables the discharge of refrigerated air for cooling cargo or passengers in large compartments such as the trailer of a semi truck a transit bus or a rail container for typical shift service life periods and indefinitely while in motion over the road or while plugged into shore power. The HTESS system is able to provide refrigeration without the use of a conventional TRU diesel APU engine during the entire service use or the entire time a 53 foot refrigerated the truck or transit bus is traveling over the road. Additionally HTESS can provide cooling without operating the VCC system or the truck bus engine for several hours while the trailer or bus is parked or is idling in traffic.

The HTES system can charge quickly via shore power or trailer wheel axle motor power over the road and provide multi temperature cooling over the road and while stationary thereby eliminating the diesel APU and associated undesirable noise and emissions. The system operates at a net zero or at a reduced weight when compared to conventional TRU systems and at a substantially lower weight than current eutectic or battery only powered systems. In sea going applications only the TES system is applicable and according to aspects of the invention can extend the window in which sea container refrigeration systems must be operated with high power VCC thereby reducing the complexity of the control systems the peak power demand and the ultimate capacity of the power supply system.

In further aspects the present invention provides constant speed mechanical output power to a high power onboard alternating current AC gen set through a constant output velocity mechanical device CVMD such as a constant velocity continuously variable transmission CVCVT or a hydraulic pump and motor set powered by the trailer or bus axles. This is advantageous in that high power AC gensets employed to power VCC systems are very efficient means to power electric motor driven VCC systems and are most efficient operating at a specific operating speed. While it can be seen that the HTESS CVCVT design could be used without a TESS in a battery only trailer application the battery only application suffers from higher initial cost and higher battery replacement maintenance costs. In another advantageous embodiment high power direct current is provided by a hybrid wheel motor as developed originally for passenger cars. The advantage of applying the wheel motor wheel motor generator developed for hybrid cars and light trucks to the TESS system is that the controls and safety systems for managing power are designed and verified.

In still further aspects the present invention provides low power charging through the aforementioned high power sources converted or inverted to low power to charge the TESS low power battery electric system BES and to power its low power pumps and fans over the road. In further aspects a solar power unit or low power APU provides low power charging and TES system power during idle periods on the road or while parked staging.

In yet further aspects the present invention provides for novel heating of the conditioned space while the high power systems are not available through thermo chemical battery dc electric heating or in another embodiment more conventional heating methods such as propane gas or high power electric only heat. Over the road the HTESS AC or DC power facilitates conventional high powered heating methods such as AC or DC high power resistive heating coils.

In another aspect the HTESS can also provide non HPS high power system heating via more conventional means such as direct gas lpg gasoline diesel heating or thermal storage of electrical or otherwise generated heat in the PCM reservoir.

The present invention provides systems and methods for a Hybrid Thermal Energy Storage System HTES system or HTESS that is characterized by rapid charging of the TESS and then providing portable self powered multi temperature refrigeration control for large mobile transport enclosures without the use of diesel APU. The TES system of the invention is capable of providing efficient refrigeration control across a wide range of temperatures including the temperature range of 40 F. to 20 F. as required in many important refrigerated cargo applications and also has application for passengers or other cooling in large compartments such transit bus or a sea container. HTESS provides cooling confidently for typical shift service life periods and indefinitely while in motion over the road or while plugged into shore power. The HTES system is able to provide refrigeration without operating a conventional TRU diesel APU engine during the entire portion of the period of the typical range of time that a 53 foot refrigerated the truck or transit bus is traveling over the road allowing the elimination of the diesel engine and fuel tanks from the TRU. Additionally HTESS can provide cooling without operating the VCC system for several hours while the trailer or bus is parked or is idling in traffic. To accomplish this the HTESS is thermally charged via a VCC which is powered by high voltage shorepower or over the road with a novel constant velocity mechanical device CVMD such as a constant velocity continuously variable transmission or a hydraulic pump and hydraulic motor set driven by the truck through the trailer wheels or axle and regulated to provide constant speed to a alternating current gen set. The HTESS is thermally charged by shore power or the CVMD. The CVMD of the HTESS provides power to the VCC motor for VCC direct load cooling over the road with the AC genset power. The CVMD and VCC also thermally charges the TESS to maintain maximum TESS capacity. The low power TESS battery system is also charged by the CVMD and AC genset through power supplies which step down the voltage and convert AC to DC Power. In an advantageous embodiment this DC power is configured to be compatible with solar power units such that while parked or in motion solar panels on the top of the truck can augment charging of the TESS BES system and to provide power for TESS functions such as fans and pumps directly. Solar or other battery charge controllers are used to manage the interface power needs and charging of TESS pump fan loads and BES system charging.

In an exemplary configuration the HTES system employs a high power source HPS from both high voltage shorepower SPHPS and over the road high power OTRHPS through the application of a novel on board constant velocity mechanical device CVMD such as a constant velocity continuously variable transmission CVCVT or a hydraulic pump and hydraulic motor set. The CVMD is powered by energy derived from the truck engine through the trailer wheels or axle and speed regulated to provide constant speed for efficient power from typical OTRHPS alternating current AC gen sets. The OTRHPS or shorepower high power source SPHPS provides direct power to the HTESS onboard VCC motor fans heaters and controls to thermally and electrically charge the TESS system and or provide direct heating cooling to the conditioned space. While parked and plugged into SPHPS or moving over the road using OTRHPS HPS is available to power the high power VCC functions. The HTESS system also employs a low power system for providing TESS electrical needs and recharging the TESS battery electric system BES . The TESS BES system is recharged over the road through OTRHPS or while plugged in using SPHPS through power supply conversion of high voltage AC to the appropriate level of low power DC. Additionally the TESS battery energy storage BES system can be recharged or TESS low power functions directly powered through solar panels on the top of the trailer or alternately if desired via a small low power APU.

The HTESS has an advantage over the TESS system due to the OTRHPS availability to provide a large share of the cooling needs such that the HTESS thermal storage size and BES size can be sized only for the vehicle idle portions of the duty cycle such as staging or idling in traffic. Additionally with the HTESS the TESS thermal charging need not be fully completed using shore power as the OTRHPS can thermally and electrically charge the TESS over the road.

The HTESS can further employ overhead solar panels and solar power controllers ECU to power the TESS and continuously charge the BES system allowing further reduction in BES size. For example the system can employ a solar controller battery charger which thinks the inverted low voltage 24 volts from the OTRHPS is a solar panel. This is advantageous because photovoltaic PV solar panel system s controller battery chargers have been developed and optimized to manage the direct use of the power and the battery charging storage will likely have a different optimization based on the battery type. The PV panels put out 24 volts generally. For the TESS the solar provided 24 volts can be used while parked and driving to run the TESS fans and or pumps directly and to charge the batteries of the TES system. Additionally the over the road system can also be used do this to direct drive the TESS system as needed running pumps to charge or with special controls as described herein to manage use of deceleration energy to charge.

The present HTESS invention further proposes the use of an a novel heating system to provide heating when HPS is not immediately available such as when idling or staging in cold weather and not plugged in. The novel HTESS heating system uses a combined electrical and chemical heating system or a battery based combined heat and power system. In cold weather when non HPS heating is anticipated the HTESS employs high temperature batteries HTB such as sodium nickel chloride batteries Zebra in a high temperature battery heating system HTBHS to provide heating. When use is anticipated such as ambient temperatures dropping below a set point electric heater driven by the OTRHPS the SPHPS or the HTB itself is commanded by the ECU to preheat or maintain heat of the HTESS HTB cooling reservoir of the HTBHS to achieve operating temperature of the battery which is otherwise inert as it begins electrical operation at 300 C. . During non HPS operating periods the HTB provides direct air heating to the conditioned space through a DC resistance heater and its own exothermic reaction to the HTB cooling reservoir and heat exchanger. The HTB stores electrical and heat energy at a significantly higher energy density KJ KG KJ m3 than any known hot PCM material. It has several key advantages in addition to the energy storage density. Unless preheated it is inert and retains a charge for very long periods of time so for example during hot seasonal periods of time when the HTB heating energy is not required to heat the conditioned space the HTB remains off. During heating season the HTB takes several days to cool off and can maintain its own temperature reducing the need for active charging. In an advantageous embodiment a zebra HTB converts electrical to heat energy at 100 efficiency and although electrical discharge efficiencies are in the 75 range when used as a combined heat and power device an HTB can provide well over 85 efficiency.

The operation of large cargo shipping containers whether they are trucks trains planes buses ships etc. can be divided into two phases 1 time spent actually in transit and 2 time spent with the cargo goods or passengers where the vehicle is not in transit but the cargo is nevertheless under the control of the vehicle such as a ship in dock or a truck at a truck stop. During these non transit times external power sources or shorepower high power source SPHPS will often be available that can be used to re charge the systems and at a fraction of the cost of using the on board power systems. These non transit power sources are referred to herein as shorepower which includes the traditional definition of the provision of shoreside electrical power to a ship at berth while its main and auxiliary engines are turned off but applies more generally to the provision of power by an external power source to recharge the cooling system of the vehicle.

While these shorepower high power source SPHPS occasions often are presented in trucking and other operations making this a requirement for example for a diesel free TESS system does present a significant logistical constraint for the use of TESS in various applications. For example recharge time may be prohibitively short or travel time may become too long for TESS to be practical without over the road high power system OTRHPS availability for refrigeration and recharging The Hybrid TESS HTESS overcomes the need for the diesel backup TRU to cover all conditions by providing a practical over the road high power source OTRHPS to power VCC heating functions and fully charge the TESS for occasions when shorepower time will not be adequate. The system further provides a low power solar or other system to extend the TESS electrical system operating period when not powered by a high power system HPS such as shorepower or OTRHPS. With the OTRHPS and solar power of the HTESS the TESS system and its associated battery system may be also downsized significantly making it more attractive for significantly broader customers in markets of mobile transportation heating refrigeration and climate control. With the displacement of the diesel engine and its associated 60 120 gallon tank the HTESS also offers a net zero or net negative lower weight than a conventional TRU unit.

Turning to the figures provides an overview of an exemplary TES mobile refrigeration system . The TES system includes a discharging loop and a charging loop . The discharging loop and the charging loop share an insulated ESPCM reservoir containing an ESPCM which is stored as a slurry in the ESPCM reservoir . By ice slurry or slurry it is meant a mixture of small ice particles and carrier liquid. Ideally the slurry is a homogenous mixture of small ice particles and carrier liquid dispersed throughout the reservoir but in practice the mixture is often stratified with the ice tending towards the top of the reservoir. The liquid can be either pure freshwater or a binary solution consisting of water and a freezing point depressant. Sodium chloride ethanol ethylene glycol and propylene glycol are four most commonly used freezing point depressants in industry. The generation and application of ice slurries is discussed in more detail by Kauffled M. et al. Int J Refrig. 2010 Dec. 1 33 8 1491 1505. The ESPCM will be in a semi liquid state due to a temperature at roughly the transition point between solid and liquid. The discharging loop uses the ESPCM to absorb heat from the surroundings thereby allowing the ESPCM to effect the cooling of a cargo during shipment while the charging loop absorbs heat from the ESPCM usually while the system is plugged into shorepower or otherwise not in transit to facilitate the further use of the ESPCM in the discharging loop . The ESPCM in the reservoir surrounds and is in contact with an ESPCM slurry generator also referred to as a working fluid reservoir and contains a working fluid . Facilitating heat transfer from the WF to the ESPCM and consequent charging of the ESPCM within the ESPCM reservoir is a WF to ESCPM heat exchanger also referred to as the PCM WF heat exchanger which maintains separation of the PCM and WF and increases the surface area over which heat exchange between the two can occur.

The ESPCM reservoir forms a starting point of reference for moving through the discharging loop . The ESPCM reservoir is in fluid communication with an ESPCM fluid pump a bypass valve a reversing valve and an ESPCM AIR heat exchanger . A fan system and a defrost system are located in proximity to the ESPCM AIR heat exchanger . The components of the discharging loop are powered by a battery electric system or other appropriate source of power. The details of the discharging loop are described in more detail with reference to below.

The ESPCM slurry generator forms a starting point of reference for the charging loop and the generator in fluid communication with a reversing valve a VCC to working fluid heat exchanger a conventional on board VCC system and a working fluid charging pump . The VCC to working fluid heat exchanger and the conventional on board VCC system in combination form the TESS VCC loop . Power is provided to the charging loop by electrical shore power or other suitable electrical source such as via truck alternator power a small auxiliary power unit or through a wheel motor generator. Shore power also recharges the battery electric system while the TES system is in charging mode. The details of the charging loop are described in more detail with reference to below.

Both the discharging loop and the charging loop are under the control of an electronic control unit . Additionally a state of charge detection module monitors the temperature and or pressure of the ESPCM in the ESPCM reservoir during both the charging mode and the discharging mode.

The heating system H uses high power OTRHPS power to power conventional resistive heaters directly when traveling over the road and employs a novel high temperature battery HTB heating system to provide heating power while high power systems OTRHPS and shore power high power system SPHPS are not available.

The 3 phase electric gen set provides high voltage AC to an AC DC power supply an AC electric heater an AC electric motor and a charge pump . The AC DC converter can then supply power to the battery charge load controller which in turn provides power to the battery electric system the fan and the discharge pump of the TESS system . The battery charge load controller can also supply power to a low voltage VCC system which can be used to provide back up cooling to both the TESS system and the conditioned space i.e. the space containing the cargo . The AC electric heater provides heat to the conditioned space and provides electric defrosting for the TESS system including the TESS system s heat exchangers. The AC electric motor powers the primary VCC system which is used to provides cooling for the TESS system and can be used to directly cool the conditioned space when needed. The system of also includes a CAN Bus data module that interfaces with the HTESS electronic control unit . The identification of decelerations or energy recovery mode events can be accomplished using CAN Bus data that data including vehicle speed acceleration deceleration events and brake applications. The HTESS ECU can use the data to switch between energy recovery mode from deceleration events and energy supply from the mechanical constant output speed mechanical device .

Turning to heating systems are shown in more detail. In the high power over the road and shorepower portion of the heating system is presented. The OTRHPS or SPHPS provide power to resistive heaters and provide direct heating to the conditioned space over the road or while plugged in.

In the novel idle heating system is presented. To provide heating when HPS is not immediately available such as when idling or staging in cold weather and not plugged in the novel HTESS idle heating system uses a combined electrical and chemical heating system also called a battery based combined heat and power system. This combined heat and power battery system is shown at the high temperature battery pack level. In cold weather when non HPS heating is anticipated the HTESS controller employs high temperature batteries HTB such as sodium nickel chloride batteries Zebra in a high temperature battery heating system HTBHS to provide heating. When use is anticipated such as ambient temperatures dropping below a set point the electric heater driven by the OTRHPS the SPHPS or the HTB itself is commanded by the ECU to preheat or maintain heat of the HTESS HTB cooling reservoir of the HTBHS to achieve operating temperature of the battery which is otherwise inert as it begins electrical operation at 300 C . A sodium nickel chloride battery for example has to be maintained at an internal operating temperature of between 270 C. and 350 C. for efficient operation. While the battery is being used this causes no energy penalty since the internal resistance of the Zebra battery coverts resistive losses to heat with 100 efficiency. All batteries have internal resistance and in all batteries this internally generated heat has to be removed by a cooling system to prevent overheating. Therefore in the case of the Zebra battery the heat generated during operation can be used to maintain the temperature as well as external heating. During non HPS operating periods the HTB provides direct air heating to the conditioned space through a dc resistance heater and its own exothermic reaction to the HTB cooling reservoir and an air or other heat exchanger. The HPS stores electrical and heat energy at a significantly higher energy density KJ KG KJ m3 than any known hot PCM material. The HTB also has several key advantages in addition to the energy storage density. Unless preheated it is inert and retains a charge for very long periods of time so for example during hot seasonal periods of time when the HTB heating energy is not required to heat the conditioned space the HTB remains off. During heating season the HTB takes several days to cool off and can maintain its own temperature eliminating the need for any active charging. In an advantageous embodiment a zebra HTB converts electrical to heat energy at 100 efficiency and although discharge efficiencies are in the 75 range when used as a combined heat and power device an HTB can provide well over 85 efficiency. While not completely ideal it can be seen that the SPHPS and OTRHPS heating element could also be provided to the TESS reservoir for use as thermal storage in a more conventional fashion.

The HTESS offers numerous advantages over a system using only a TESS. The HTESS fully eliminates the diesel engine from TRU while maintaining virtually unlimited range over the road. The HTESS also provides a net zero or net reduction in trailer weight and consumed volume. While stationary HTESS provides a 1 3 hr. cooling and heating window where the TRU or VCC power does not need to be plugged in. For continuous operations with short duration loading no plug in is needed. For extended shorepower refrigeration periods the HTESS extends the range whereby the compressor does not need to cycle on. This simplifies the shorepower load demand management. The HTESS allows practical over the road electrical heating function for trailers during cold weather. TESS BES System is capable to provide only defrost Advantages over systems prior to the development of the TES system herein include that the HTESS does not require diesel APU. It also does not require expensive heavy large battery systems or a connection to the truck. The HTESS provides heating and cooling functions for the necessary entire service period without plugging in. It also provides high voltage and power source over the road capable to drive existing type electric TRU VCC systems.

By adopting an HTESS system as an enhancement to a TES system the Battery Electric System BES can be made smaller due to over the road power and solar power. The HTESS also allows for direct power of VCC for charging of the TESS and cooling cabin with conventional VCC. A redesigned compressor system for smaller capacity is also possible due to HTESS capacity. The HTESS also includes additional controls to manage state of charge and power from various sources.

The HTESS provides a novel high voltage over the road power source using a wheel axle motor generator. In one embodiment a hydraulic axle pump or driveshaft pump develops hydraulic pressure to drive hydraulic motor which drives gen set to power VCC TESS. Alternatively a mechanical constant speed drive system for genset through CVCVT can be employed. Constant speed velocity output of axle or driveshaft through continuously variable transmission can result in a steady source of power. Also a commercial wheel motor product for hybrid vehicles Protein Electric can be adopted. DC power can be applied to a second DC motor to mechanically drive VCC refrigeration components such as the compressor TESS. A low voltage system can be provided through a DC DC inverter to power TESS and BES functions. A high voltage hybrid truck power or genset power can also be used as a high voltage power source but these are not optimal embodiments as they require tethering to a mating truck at all times for operation.

Hybrid vehicles such as hybrid automobiles often recapture energy only upon braking. Under such a scenario power such as to charge the TES system would only be made during braking events. The present hybrid TES system would charge the BES batteries and TESS PCM with the truck engine making power. So again traditional hybrid vehicles will not charge batteries when the engine is making power only while decelerating.

So for example according to aspects of the present invention a TES system could first utilize a grid based charge up. Once the system is charged. The TES system could operate in a mixed mode charge depleting and charge sustaining or a singular charge sustaining mode. The charge sustaining mode could be utilized for critical cargo. It would maintain a fully charged system over the road and would ignore the possibility for recovering energy due to deceleration. Truck power or deceleration power would be used mechanically drive the generator. Some small incremental fuel expense at the truck is used to charge the TESS.

An alternative mixed mode would have charge depleting with a charge sustaining setpoint. This would allow for a normal or high efficiency operation.

Under normal efficiency the TES system can be fully charged from grid power. The TESS then cools the conditioned space until 70 charge level is reached for example. Over the road power would then maintain a minimum target TESS state of charge e.g. 70 always. Truck power could be used if needed but the HTESS can take advantage of deceleration energy between the setpoint e.g. 70 and 100 . Deceleration events are allowed to charge the TESS back to 100 . Below 70 the truck power would also charge the HTES system along with deceleration charging the HTESS. This creates less chance for truck power fuel to be used.

Under a high efficiency mode initial charging could occur using grid power and use only deceleration events to charge TESS to lower setpoint under normal operating conditions. The controller would allow the system to deplete the majority of the TESS energy before using truck power to charge the system and to the extent that the deceleration events were not sufficient to maintain the system within the desired range. Such a management scenario should maximize the savings but with the risk that the TESS storage runs low. Under this scenario a low charge sustaining value could be set e.g. 20 which can cover normal operational variation which would require a good knowledge of the operating conditions for a particular application to insure that TESS storage is adequate. This creates a minimal chance for using truck power for the lowest fuel usage and consumption.

The identification of deceleration or energy recovery mode from can be accomplished using CAN Bus data including vehicle speed acceleration deceleration events and brake applications such as are defined in truck trailer CAN definitions. SAE J1939 ISO 11992 1.

Charge sustaining Critical Cargo Fully charge and maintain the HTESS at full charge immediately over the road so ignores the possibility for recovering energy due to deceleration. Truck power is used to pull the generator and uses some small incremental fuel at the truck. Charge Sustaining Normal Maintain a minimum target TESS state of charge e.g. 70 always. Uses truck power if needed but takes advantage of deceleration energy. Allows more efficient operation. If fully charged from grid power TESS cools the load until 70 charge is achieved for example. Deceleration events are allowed to charge the TESS back to 100 and below 70 truck power charges the TESS. Charge Sustaining High Efficiency Charge using grid and use only deceleration events to charge TESS. Deplete the Majority of the TESS energy before using truck power to charge. Should maximize the savings with some risk that the TESS storage runs low. Likely to set a low charge sustaining value e.g. 20 which can cover normal operational variation .

Components are also provided for low voltage stationary and over the road power. This can be accomplished via wheel axle high power conversion or inversion and provides volt power to battery load and charge controller which charges the BES and directly may power the TESS elements except generally the VCC refrigeration compressor motor . Solar power can be used to augment the wheel axle motor power and directly power TESS elements at idle and therefore further minimize BES system size and cost. A small APU can be provided as backup for low voltage functions. Low voltage truck alternator power can also be used but is not the optimal solution for reasons such as those disclosed herein.

Also provided in the context of the HTES system is a high temperature battery HTB system employing a battery such as zebra battery sodium nickel chloride whereby electrical energy is taken for use in a resistance heater from the HTB and thermal electrochemical energy is also taken from HTB for heating. An electrochemical combined heat and power system. The sodium nickel chloride battery also known as ZEBRA today is being used successfully in many applications.

ZEBRA has a nominal cell voltage of 2.58 volts and an specific energy of 90 120 Wh kg a level comparable with Li manganese and Li phosphate. The service life is about eight years and 3 000 cycles. It can be fast charged is non toxic and the raw materials are abundant and low cost. ZEBRA batteries come in large sizes of 10 kWh or higher and typical applications are forklifts railways ships submarines and electric cars. Over the road high power system OTRHPS or SPHPS provides the initial heat energy and the batteries take 2 3 days to cool which for well managed fleet use in cold climates means very little cycling. This allows direct heating the air of the container with high voltage coils over the road with traditional TRU methods high power heating element . Alternatively electric or gas or other more conventional direct heating of cold PCM or other storage medium can be employed. Not PCM in Heat Mode .

The present invention provides systems and methods for a Thermal Energy Storage System TES system or TESS that is characterized by rapid charging of the TESS and then providing portable self powered multi temperature refrigeration control for large mobile transport enclosures. The TES system of the invention is capable of providing efficient refrigeration control across a wide range of temperatures including the temperature range of 40 F. to 20 F. as required in many important refrigerated cargo applications. To accomplish this cooling a fan system passes air over a heat exchanger containing flowing eutectic slurry phase change material ESPCM so as to cool the air prior to it being provided into the compartment of the mobile refrigerated transport truck. The ESPCM flow rate is managed by a system of pumps and valves to control the forced convection cooling effect in a closed loop fashion.

The system is presented in the context of a large refrigerated truck trailer units which are typically rectangular cuboids 53 feet in length 99 inches in width and 110 inches in height with a cubic capacity of 1 050 feet but the system will find application in a wide variety of large mobile enclosures requiring efficient cooling such as sea containers box trucks rail systems and buses and for the transport of cargo and passengers.

In an exemplary configuration the TES system employs a Eutectic Slurry Phase Change Material ESPCM at least one air to liquid heat exchanger ESPCM AIR at least one ESPCM slurry generator ESPCM GEN a battery energy storage system BES system or BESS a fan system a working fluid WF two circulation pumps for circulating the ESPCM and the working fluid and an Electronic Control Unit ECU to manage the operation of the system.

The TES system employs phase change materials PCMs to store and deliver cooling power. The TES system has a charging side and a discharging side. The charging side charges the ESPCM when heat is absorbed by the WF from the PCM. The discharging side discharges by cooling the cargo and absorbing heat.

On the discharging side of the TES system the ESPCM is stored as a slurry in an ESPCM reservoir. The reservoir is in fluid communication with an ESPCM air to liquid heat exchanger allowing ESPCM slurry liquid to circulate between the reservoir and the heat exchanger. The ESPCM pump drives the circulation of the ESPCM liquid. The return ESPCM liquid from the exchanger to the reservoir is sprayed on top of the ESPCM slurry to provide nearly infinite heat transfer. The fan system and pump systems are powered by the BES system. Temperature control is provided by increasing and decreasing the ESPCM pump flow through the ESPCM AIR exchanger and by controllably adjusting the fan speed. Defrost energy is minimized by reversing the flow of the ESPCM liquid across the ESPCM AIR exchanger and managing ESPCM flow rate and direction. A high density battery energy storage BES system in combination with an electronic control unit ECU can provide electrical power and operational control for the ESPCM pump air fans ECU controls and defrost heat as necessary.

As mentioned above the TES system employs phase change materials PCMs to store and deliver cooling effect or power. One advantageous aspect of the system is its ability to apply a variety of PCMs but without ongoing adjustment of PCM materials to achieve various target temperatures once a PCM is applied. When used for a large refrigerated truck trailer unit where the duration between charges may be around 8 hours the TES system provides the necessary electric power and thermal cooling to cool the load during shipment without the use of a combustion engine auxiliary power unit APU . The term charge as used herein refers not only to the more traditional notion of energizing a battery or other electrical storage device by passing a current through it in the direction opposite to discharge but also to charging the thermal energy storage device through the removal of heat from the PCM which then allows the PCM to remove heat from the surroundings in discharge mode by absorbing heat such as from the compartment of a trailer. In the context of longer duration applications such as found in shipping using sea containers where goods may be stored for long durations with cooling using electrically powered refrigeration the TES system enables improved power management during transport and minimizes peak electrical power requirements by providing cooling during interim periods where the electrically powered refrigeration system is shut down or in stand by. The duration of cooling for any given TES system will be influenced by a number of factors including the target temperature the volume of space to be refrigerated and the amount and state of charge of the ESPCM.

The present invention further proposes the use of efficient slurry systems for trailer and transport refrigeration with the slurry generated onboard via a slurry generator heat exchanger and appropriate PCM material and additives or a combination heat exchanger mechanical device slurry generator. The slurry generator in an advantageous embodiment of the present invention consists of a PCM to working fluid heat exchanger and associated PCM and working fluid flow controls. To generate slurry during charging of the TESS in this advantageous embodiment the highly chilled working fluid is passed through the slurry generator which is a ESPCM to WF heat exchanger. The heat exchanger designed for high levels of heat transfer and slurry ice formation along with the intrinsic nature of the selected PCM material work in combination to form ice crystals on the ESPCM side of the heat exchanger. Most of these crystals due to their buoyancy float away from the heat exchanger surface into the bulk ESPCM slurry in the ESPCM storage and are held beneath the slurry surface by a mesh screen or other means. Some of the ice crystals will have a tendency to remain on the ESPCM WF heat exchanger. While some formation is acceptable large crystal formations will reduce the efficiency of heat transfer between the working fluid and the ESPCM and are therefore undesirable.

The flow control of the slurry generator is designed to manage the systematic removal of sticking ice crystals. This is managed via two flow control paths. On the working fluid side flow reversal and flow regulation control is performed periodically. On the ESPCM side the flow is managed to cause ice crystals to be removed by the mechanical flow work of the moving ESPCM slurry. The working fluid flow control takes advantage of the intrinsic nature of tube and fin heat exchangers in which the outlet of the exchanger is slightly warmer than the outlet due to heat absorption. When the WF flow is reversed ice crystals forming at one end of the exchanger will have a reduced propensity to stick to the heat exchanger surface due to the slight change in the surface temperature. The WF flow rate can also be managed to insure that the process is effective. The ESPCM flow management in the slurry generator takes advantage of the kinetic energy of the PCM slurry flow to remove the crystals from the surface and to improve the homogeneity of the mixture. In the figures this flow path of the ESPCM is through the pump across the bypass valve and returning directly to the ESPCM storage .

In a possible embodiment of the present invention slurry generator a dissolved gas system such as COcan be incorporated into the ESPCM slurry generator. See e.g. The dissolved gas system would consist of a high pressure and low pressure dissolved gas tank a compressor and associated valves and controls. When the ESPCM is nearly discharged the dissolved gas system would expose the ESPCM to high pressure gas to saturate it. Using COand water as an example the dissolved COgas would provide sub cooling capability for the water ESPCM due to its physical effect on water and other liquids. COsaturated water for example freezes at a lower temperature than non COsaturated water. The sub cooled ESPCM at high COpressure would then be reduced to a lower pressure causing immediate slurry formation as the sub cooling effect is lost. The release of the COfrom the liquid causes this effect. The lower pressure COwould be captured in the low pressure COstorage and pumped into the high pressure COstorage. Alternately while not the most optimal embodiment COor COimpregnated PCM could be purchased commercially in high pressure containers and vented to atmosphere during slurry generation eliminating the pumping loop complexity. This dissolved gas slurry generator can also be applied to typical land based TES systems which use water to improve their PCM charge density and thus footprint. Most land based TES freeze water on tubes leaving much unfrozen water which reduces the cooling storage density. The dissolved gas slurry system can provide higher thermal charge density as well as higher and more stable heat transfer rates due to the nature of slurry discharge.

Another possible embodiment of the present invention slurry generator is the use of anti freeze proteins or other sub cooling additives to the ESPCM to sub cool and make homogeneous the ESPCM slurry. Antifreeze proteins are used to suppress the freezing temperature of liquids and have been used commercially with FDA approved ice cream indicating the food safe nature. By suppressing the freezing temperature and retaining the melting temperature of liquids the proteins provide a hysteresis temperature window for charging and discharging the ESPCM which can improve the cooling state of charge or charge density and simplify the cooling state of charge detection.

While ESPCM WF heat exchangers are generally the smallest and lightest approach to slurry generation they are also generally more complex and relatively more expensive than other slurry generation systems which employ mechanical ice scraping. In one advantageous embodiment of the present invention slurry generation of the TESS system can justify relatively higher cost slurry generating heat exchangers due to the critical mobile need for minimized weight high cooling density charging speed efficiency and large cooling capacity. The conventional land and marine based slurry generation systems generally have the objective of slurry output capacity vs. cost and less focus on weight and slurry state of charge or slurry density. The non mechanical slurry generator is therefore is not generally used for ground based and ship based systems which have much broader space and weight constraints. These land and ship based systems generally use mechanical slurry generators or choose even lower cost non slurry systems as a conscious trade off for system simplicity.

While the non mechanical slurry generator is an advantageous embodiment other mechanical slurry generators are also possible embodiments to the slurry generator of the present invention. Another possible embodiment of the slurry generator is taking the cooling energy to generate slurry directly from the VCC refrigeration instead of through the present inventions working fluid path.

In an alternate embodiment to the present invention the slurry generator would have a working fluid to ESPCM heat exchanger which also includes a mechanical ice scraper function. In this embodiment the ice and ice crystal formation on the ESPCM WF exchanger would be augmented by mechanical ice scraping. The mechanical ice scraper would be driven by an electric motor powered by shore power or other high power system. The mechanical system could also be powered by alternative power systems.

In another embodiment the slurry generator heat exchanger of the present invention could be directly coupled to the VCC system. This provides the advantage of one less cooling loop temperature drop but has some potential drawbacks such as high use of VCC refrigerant and limited ability to manage ice removal at the evaporator surface without mechanical means. VCC refrigerants are expensive and becoming regulated worldwide to limit their use due to harmful effects to the environment. Large amounts of VCC refrigerant are needed to bring the cooling to the load in multi zone distributed systems so it is desirable to use a TESS WF approach to minimize the VCC fluid use. Additionally the need for mechanical work to remove the ice crystals from the VCC evaporator in a direct VCC ESPCM exchanger adds weight and complexity to the system. Recognizing their disadvantages these direct VCC coupled embodiments may be desirable if it is desired to maximize temperature performance by eliminating the working fluid cooling loop. Each heat exchanger loop generally requires a delta T or temperature difference to insure heat exchanger efficiency so more loops in the system results in less usable temperature capacity in the cooled space. A typical minimum delta T is about 10 C.

Ice slurry systems produce small particles of ice within a solution often using additives such as glycol and water in the solution. The resulting ice slurry solution is a slushy mixture that retains aspects of its fluid characteristics such that it can be pumped through a system. Because of its characteristics ice slurry generators do not suffer from the thermal charging efficiency degradation seen in many other systems that occurs as ice builds up on an evaporator surface.

In ice slurry systems ice particles are generated by passing a weak glycol water or other PCM solution through tubing that is surrounded by an evaporating refrigerant or as in the preferred embodiment of the invention a highly cooled working fluid ice particles form as the glycol water or other PCM solution is cooled by the evaporating refrigerant or the WF flow The resulting slush can either form in or drop directly into a storage tank or be pumped into a storage tank depending on the system configuration. Ice free glycol water or other PCM solution can then be pumped from the storage tank. Discharge is accomplished by pumping the cool solution from the tank either directly through the cooling load or through an intermediate heat exchanger that isolates the cooling load from the ice slurry system. The resulting solution that has been warmed such as by passing through a heat exchanger is then returned to the top of the tank and distributed over the ice slurry via multiple spray nozzles.

One characteristic of ice slurry is the small size of the resulting particle. Due to the small size of the particle the ice slurry can result in better heat transfer between the solution and the ice when compared to either ice harvesting or ice on coil systems which are typically used in marine or land based TES. Like an ice harvester ice slurry systems have relatively high fixed costs associated with the evaporator or ice generator component but relatively low incremental costs as storage capacity is added.

A VCC refrigeration system can be used to charge the ESPCM. The VCC refrigeration system can be onboard the trailer for a self contained system or use off board communication with a multistage refrigeration device for higher Coefficient of Performance COPR and the possibility to take advantage of off peak charging. A liquid working fluid WF interfaces between the VCC and the ESPCM to charge the ESPCM thus providing the cooling capacity transfer function between the VCC and the ESPCM. The WF is supplied as a pumped liquid which simplifies and expedites the onboard and off board charging function maximizing the flow and heat transfer with forced convection to the ESPCM while reducing the cost of the pumping system for on and off board systems.

The operation of large cargo shipping containers whether they are trucks trains planes buses ships etc. can be divided into two phases 1 time spent actually in transit and 2 time spent with the cargo goods or passengers where the vehicle is not in transit but the cargo is nevertheless under the control of the vehicle such as a ship in dock or a truck at a truck stop. During these non transit times external power sources will often be available that can be used to re charge the systems and at a fraction of the cost of using the on board power systems. These non transit power sources are referred to herein as shorepower which includes the traditional definition of the provision of shoreside electrical power to a ship at berth while its main and auxiliary engines are turned off but applies more generally to the provision of power by an external power source to recharge the cooling system of the vehicle. While the system is plugged into shorepower the BES can rapidly charge and the ESPCM slurry can be quickly produced by the ESPCM slurry generator. Charging cooling capacity is provided by a vapor compression cycle VCC refrigeration system or other means on board or off board the trailer . The fully charged ESPCM and the BES system can then provide effective multi temperature cooling to the refrigerated space during transport without the operation of the VCC refrigeration system or the need for power from the TRU APU.

Many hours of cooling capacity and significant refrigeration temperature control for space cooling can be achieved using a flowing eutectic slurry phase change material ESPCM with a very low freezing temperature. The addition of a dedicated high energy density KJ KG BES system such as Li ion batteries can allow for independent operation and multi temperature control without the need for VCC operation or truck engine power during over the road during transport. The system is practical to use with current PCMs and the high energy mass and power density lithium ion BES system can be sized to power fans and accessory electric heating defrost elements depending upon the application.

Turning to the figures provides an overview of an exemplary TES mobile refrigeration system . The TES system includes a discharging loop and a charging loop . The discharging loop and the charging loop share an insulated ESPCM reservoir containing an ESPCM which is stored as a slurry in the ESPCM reservoir . By ice slurry or slurry it is meant a mixture of small ice particles and carrier liquid. Ideally the slurry is a homogenous mixture of small ice particles and carrier liquid dispersed throughout the reservoir but in practice the mixture is often stratified with the ice tending towards the top of the reservoir. The liquid can be either pure freshwater or a binary solution consisting of water and a freezing point depressant. Sodium chloride ethanol ethylene glycol and propylene glycol are four most commonly used freezing point depressants in industry. The generation and application of ice slurries is discussed in more detail by Kauffled M. et al. Int J Refrig. 2010 Dec. 1 33 8 1491 1505. The ESPCM will be in a semi liquid state due to a temperature at roughly the transition point between solid and liquid. The discharging loop uses the ESPCM to absorb heat from the surroundings thereby allowing the ESPCM to effect the cooling of a cargo during shipment while the charging loop absorbs heat from the ESPCM usually while the system is plugged into shorepower or otherwise not in transit to facilitate the further use of the ESPCM in the discharging loop . The ESPCM in the reservoir surrounds and is in contact with an ESPCM slurry generator also referred to as a working fluid reservoir and contains a working fluid . Facilitating heat transfer from the WF to the ESPCM and consequent charging of the ESPCM within the ESPCM reservoir is a WF to ESCPM heat exchanger also referred to as the PCM WF heat exchanger which maintains separation of the PCM and WF and increases the surface area over which heat exchange between the two can occur.

The ESPCM reservoir forms a starting point of reference for moving through the discharging loop . The ESPCM reservoir is in fluid communication with an ESPCM fluid pump a bypass valve a reversing valve and an ESPCM AIR heat exchanger . A fan system and a defrost system are located in proximity to the ESPCM AIR heat exchanger . The components of the discharging loop are powered by a battery electric system or other appropriate source of power. The details of the discharging loop are described in more detail with reference to below.

The ESPCM slurry generator forms a starting point of reference for the charging loop and the generator in fluid communication with a reversing valve a VCC to working fluid heat exchanger a conventional on board VCC system and a working fluid charging pump . The VCC to working fluid heat exchanger and the conventional on board VCC system in combination form the TESS VCC loop . Power is provided to the charging loop by electrical shore power or other suitable electrical source such as via truck alternator power a small auxiliary power unit or through a wheel motor generator. Shore power also recharges the battery electric system while the TES system is in charging mode. The details of the charging loop are described in more detail with reference to below.

Both the discharging loop and the charging loop are under the control of an electronic control unit . Additionally a state of charge detection module monitors the temperature and or pressure of the ESPCM in the ESPCM reservoir during both the charging mode and the discharging mode.

Turning to there is shown the discharging loop of the TES system of . The discharging loop includes the ESPCM reservoir containing an ESPCM . The ESPCM reservoir is in fluid communication with the ESPCM fluid pump . The ESPCM fluid pump pumps the ESPCM slurry liquid through the discharging loop under the control of the electronic control unit and under the power of the battery electric system . The ESPCM fluid is pumped from the ESPCM fluid pump to the bypass valve . From the bypass valve the ESPCM is directed to either the reversing valve or back into the ESPCM reservoir . The option of flowing back to the ESPCM reservoir is useful when the TESS system is in charging mode. By flowing the ESPCM partially through the discharging loop during charging of the ESPCM solid ice formation on the PCM WF heat exchanger in the ESPCM reservoir can be minimized. The bypass valve is under the control of the electronic control unit .

When the TES system is in cooling discharge mode and the discharging loop is active the ESPCM slurry is pumped from the bypass valve through the reversing valve to the inlet of the ESPCM AIR heat exchanger . The inlets and outlets of the heat exchanger are described in more detail below with reference to . As the ESPCM travels through the ESPCM AIR heat exchanger the fan system effects the circulation of ambient air from the storage compartment across the large surface area of the heat exchanger. The circulating ESPCM absorbs heat from the air as it passes over the heat exchanger thereby resulting in a cooling of the air within the storage compartment. By varying the flow of the ESPCM through the heat exchanger and or the speed fan system using the electronic control unit the TES system in conjunction with monitoring the temperature in the compartment is able to control the refrigeration of the space providing multi temperature control for the trailer or other enclosure.

The ESPCM AIR heat exchanger can be referred to more generally as an ESPCM to target heat exchanger in those situations where the ultimate conditioned space to be cooled is something other than refrigerated cargo air. For example the target for cooling could be air or liquids for a city bus or boat air conditioner through liquids such as water and seawater. Additionally the target could be a chilled bulk load such as milk juice compressed gasses etc.

The ESPCM therefore enters the ESPCM AIR heat exchanger at the heat exchanger inlet and supplies cooling effect absorbing heat energy from the air. Under some controlled ESPCM flow conditions and storage compartment temperatures the ESPCM enters the ESPCM AIR heat exchanger at a cooler temperature than it exits the exchanger s outlet. The increase in temperature of the ESPCM results in a temperature gradient across the heat exchanger. In cooling discharge mode the ESPCM is pumped from the outlet of the ESPCM AIR heat exchanger back through another path of the reversing valve to and is returned to the ESPCM reservoir as a liquid that is sprayed on top of the ESPCM slurry in the reservoir. The diverter valve and consequently the pathways taken by the ESPCM through the valve is under the control of the electronic control unit . Flow of ESPCM through the discharging loop and between the components in the discharging loop is in the direction indicated by the arrows in .

The TESS slurry ESPCM cooling loop is capable of controllably operating in a multi temperature environment in either an independent cooling mode or a blended VCC TESS cooling mode. The TES system operates with high efficiency due to the slurry generator producing eutectic slurry of a phase change material. The slurry phase change base material is advantageously a food safe product and is selected to have the proper temperature characteristics to manage multi temperature refrigeration applications. One particularly useful application will be in the transport of perishable food. The ESPCM material also may contain additives such as antifreeze proteins propylene glycol dissolved COor other means to provide rapid and homogenous slurry formation with the novel heat exchanger design avoiding the need for mechanical ice scraping work and less durable apparatus. Alternately it can be seen that traditional VCC mechanical slurry designs used for industrial manufacture of ice slurry could be adapted for onboard slurry generation. Non exclusive examples of food safe PCM materials which resist icing include propylene glycol various Dynalene products and CaCl salt brines. For transport applications the use of ice crystal slurries in dynamic ice systems offer inherent advantages in energy efficiency capacity and ESPCM transportation. The ice crystals do not adhere to the WF to ESPCM heat exchanger ESPCM Slurry Generator surface or are continuously removed from the surface by mechanical means so a heat cycle defrost circuit is not required for the VCC loop. The compressor delivers its full capacity to the load at a consistently high efficiency. Furthermore the ice slurry can be pumped as a liquid or slurry so the location of the slurry generator is not restricted to a particular location in the tank reducing the structural requirements and storage tank costs.

Managing frost buildup in the ESPCM to Air exchanger is critical to performance. Ice is formed when moisturized air passes the air cooler evaporator or in the present invention ESPCM Air exchanger of refrigeration machinery. This effect needs to be kept at a minimum as it has an adverse impact on the cooling performance of the refrigeration machinery. Refrigeration machineries provide different options of ice removal via defrost cycles. The usual defrost cycle is defrost on demand auto defrost which minimizes defrosting activity and maximizes performance. For traditional VCC defrost on demand measures the ice formation via pressure drops or cooling performance changes as determined for instance by the bulk air temperature or air pressure drop across the evaporator. Heating coils energize to remove the ice. This is a large electrical load especially for a battery system to provide. Vapor compression cycle refrigeration systems do not usually reverse to operate in heat pump mode as this is too energy and time consuming compared to electrical coils. The current invention can be flow limited to prevent ice formation and reversed to melt without resorting to electrical coils and the large energy consumption associated with electrical coils.

Frost buildup on the ESPCM to Air exchanger is managed by a flow management system defrost system which slows and or reverses the ESPCM flow through the ESPCM to Air exchanger using ECU control of the ESPCM fluid pump flow and or reversing valve when ice formation is detected or predicted. Ice formation on the airflow path can be detected when air path inlet and outlet pressures or air path temperatures across the ESPCM to Air exchanger exceed established limits for example or by other traditional or nontraditional means. Traditional means of frost detection are assessment of pressure drops across the air path of the heat exchanger or the change in temperature from one side of the air flow path of heat exchanger to the other side for a given set of conditions. The reverse flow defrost feature takes advantage of the large heat exchanger design and liquid ESPCM. During certain operating conditions especially in the temperature range where frost will form the ESPCM to Air exchanger can be controlled by the ESPCM fluid pump to have a much higher ESPCM outlet temperature than ESPCM inlet temperature resulting in an ESPCM temperature gradient from one end of the heat exchanger to the other. This is especially true for example when conditioned space temperatures are above freezing and there are large amounts of water in the air of the conditioned space. The ESPCM inlet end of the heat exchanger air path may be frosting up while the ESPCM outlet side is at a higher temperature which will not support frost. By reversing the flow the outlet becomes the inlet and the frost is removed or avoided altogether. Alternatively the defrost system can measure pressure drops across the ESPCM to Air exchanger . Pressure drops across the ESPCM to Air exchanger are a result of ice or frost formation on the air path of the heat exchanger . The management and reversal of flow which is possible with liquid ESPCM and not easily managed with traditional VCC systems can result in melting of ice formed on the surface of the outlet sections of the ESPCM to Air exchanger while still facilitating cooling at the inlet portion of the exchanger. During conditions of minimal or no frost formation ESPCM fluid pump can be commanded by the electronic control unit to achieve flow rates which result in optimized cooling. Here the temperature gradient across the ESPCM to Air exchanger is minimized. For conventional VCC systems electric heat is often required to remove frost with considerable energy expended in the provision of the heat. These conventional defrost heaters can be provided in the present invention to expedite the defrost process if needed. However energy demand can be significantly reduced without those heaters allowing for a reduction in the size of the battery energy storage system or other defrost energy storage medium. In an advantageous embodiment the defrost system is under the control of the electronic control unit and under the power of the battery electric system .

Note that the terms inlet and outlet are relative to the normal discharge path through ESPCM to Air exchanger . During reverse flow defrost the ESPCM will enter through outlet and exit through inlet

The defrost system monitors the frost buildup on the ESPCM to Air exchanger and manages the status in the electronic control unit . The reversing valve along with the ESPCM fluid pump the bypass valve and the fan system are under the control of the electronic control unit . After the detection of frost build up electronic control unit signals the reversing valve resulting in a re routing or diverting of the ESPCM will through the reversing valve as illustrated in .

The reversing valve on the charging side performs a similar function to the reversing valve on the discharging side namely the prevention of frost build up but in this case the frost buildup to prevent is at the VCC to working fluid heat exchanger . Solid ice may form at the inlet end of the heat exchanger and is not desirable. By reversing the flow through the VCC to working fluid heat exchanger it is possible to limit any icing of the heat exchanger and therefore maximize the state of charge. As ice builds up on the VCC to working fluid heat exchanger the charging efficiency decreases due to the insulation of the ice buildup slowing and ultimately limiting the level of charging which is possible.

A conventional on board VCC system is located in proximity to the VCC to working fluid heat exchanger enabling the VCC system to remove heat from the working fluid as it passes through the heat exchanger . Here the VCC represents a traditional vapor compression cycle refrigeration system utilizing a compressor condenser throttling valve and evaporator. VCC refrigeration offers two advantageous features. First the large thermal energy required to change a liquid to a vapor across the throttling valve facilitates the removal of large amounts of heat from in this case the TESS working fluid. Second the isothermal nature of the vaporization allows extraction of heat without raising the temperature of the VCC refrigerant to the temperature of whatever is being cooled. This is a benefit because the closer the refrigerant temperature approaches that of its surroundings the lower the rate of heat transfer. The isothermal process allows the fastest rate of heat transfer. For the present invention the VCC to working fluid heat exchanger is the evaporator of the VCC System. The TES system of employs on board thermal charging by locating the TESS VCC loop within the TESS unit. A working fluid charging pump is in fluid communication with a VCC to working fluid heat exchanger . The pump drives the working fluid through the system and moves the working fluid directly from the pump back to the reversing valve . The working fluid is routed from the reversing valve back to the ESPCM slurry generator having completed the complete cycle thorough the charging loop and arriving at the slurry generator colder than when it left. Electrical power for the charging loop is provided by the shore power . In particular the shore power supplies the significant amounts of power consumed by the on board VCC system . Shore power also recharges the battery electric system while the TES system is in charging mode.

The working fluid can also be a PCM but the system does not require this set up. The WF selected is generally one that freezes at a temperature lower than the employed ESPCM. Ideally the WF will have a freezing point about 15 C. or more below the PCM. This results in a WF that can flow more easily through the system and at a higher rate in turn maximizing heat transfer to the PCM and minimizing the charging time and pump energy. The PCM needs to have a high cooling density KJ Kg KJ cc to be practical as a storage medium and will generally be mostly frozen high ice when fully charged. The WF does not have to have the same energy capacity cooling capacity volume . Instead it is more important to have heat transfer optimized which can be accomplished to a large degree through managing flow rates of the WF.

The discharging loop and the charging loop employ a state of charge detection system . The state of charge of the ESPCM can be measured by monitoring pressure changes in the system viscosity sensing or other means to insure that the slurry is fully charged for maximum cooling time while not overcharged and frozen solid. The pressure based state of charge takes advantage of the physical properties of the PCM material when it changes phase. The PCM phase change is accompanied by a defined increase in volume viscosity and other parameters. By detecting and measuring these parameters such as the change in volume or pressure the state of charge can be determined. Moreover the thermal storage medium can be charged with the TRU having an on board system as in TESS VCC loop over the road when its state of charge detection indicates it is needed.

The TES system can take advantage of the high COPR off board charging and slurry pumping while maintaining a closed onboard system advantages. For off board charging of the PCM on board closed system e.g. CaCl with freezing point of 25 F. can also incorporate a eutectic slurry working fluid e.g. another PCM with a lower freezing point than the onboard PCM 35 F. which is in slurry form . This facilitates high efficiency thermal storage off board and heat transfer to on board ESTESS while maintaining onboard closed system features.

For example the working fluid WF and PCM can be in slurry form. Off board slurry generators form open systems in which are not closed systems which are fixed and sealed like the present invention PCM loop. The closed PCM system provides the advantage of a contained and defined slurry mixture percentage and quantity which facilitates state of charge measurement and effective temperature control on discharge. To charge the PCM you would connect the off board charging system to the trailer s on board TESS reservoir and pump the WF through the WF PCM heat exchanger or slurry generation system and then disconnect the off board system components when the desired closed system PCM state of charge was achieved. The off board WF could be open system slurry or highly chilled liquid.

The mobile hybrid thermal energy systems has been designed to use the over the road high power system at reduced voltage to directly power TESS components at times in most operating situations while moving. However solar power is also available to power components at reduced voltage. For example the system design would allow the use of solar power to recharge the BES and power the TESS Fans and pumps directly. In more extreme embodiments it is possible that a less powerful VCC or other cooling system thermal electric could be added to directly provide cooling using power from the solar panels thus to providing solar powered cooling to thermally charge the TESS and or cool the refrigerated space.

A phase change material PCM is a substance with a high heat of fusion. Upon melting or solidifying at a fixed temperature the PCM isothermally stores or releases large amounts of energy. Heat is absorbed or released when the PCM changes from solid to liquid and vice versa. This allows PCMs to function as latent heat storage units. Examples of PCMs relevant to the present TES system include propylene glycol and salt brines such as CaCl paraffins alphatics and mineral oils diphenal and diphenyl oxide blends perphenyls silicones and the various Dynalenes particularly Dynalene MV Dynalene HT and Dynalene 600 . CaCl brines are a particularly advantageous PCM. A eutectic phase change material is a material that has the property whereby the isothermal phase change from a solid to a liquid medium can absorb and dissipate large amounts of thermal energy while remaining at a constant temperature . . . .

By slurry it is meant a semi liquid mixture of the phase change material. Slurry ice provides a phase changing refrigerant made up of millions of ice micro crystals formed and suspended within a solution of water and a freezing point depressant. Some compounds used in the field as freezing point depressants are salt ethylene glycol propylene glycol various alcohols and sugar.

The term charge as used herein refers not only to the more traditional notion of energizing a battery or other electrical storage device by passing a current through it in the direction opposite to discharge but also to charging the thermal energy storage device through the removal of heat from the PCM which then allows the PCM to remove heat from the surroundings in discharge mode by absorbing heat such as from the compartment of a trailer.

The term shorepower refers to the provision of external electrical power to a vehicle at rest while its main and auxiliary engines are not providing power to the vehicle. More specifically shorepower is grid based electrical power provided to the refrigeration system while the trailer or other refrigerated container is parked such as at a dock or staging area.

The term port as used herein refers to an opening for intake or exhaust of a fluid. The heat exchangers can have two or more ports functioning as inlets and outlets for the circulation of fluid though the conduits within the heat exchanger. Inlets and exhausts can be reversed on an exchanger by reversing the direction of flow of a liquid passing through the exchanger.
