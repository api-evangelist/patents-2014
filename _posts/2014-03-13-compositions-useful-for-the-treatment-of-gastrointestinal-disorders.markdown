The present invention relates to novel compositions related to guanylate cyclase C GC C agonists and their therapeutic use for preventing or treating inflammation cancer and other disorders particularly of the gastrointestinal tract and the lung. The compositions may be used either alone or in combination with other agents.

Uroguanylin guanylin and bacterial ST peptides are structurally related peptides that bind to a guanylate cyclase receptor and stimulate intracellular production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate cGMP 1 6 . This results in the activation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator CFTR an apical membrane channel for efflux of chloride from enterocytes lining the intestinal tract 1 6 . Activation of CFTR and the subsequent enhancement of transepithelial secretion of chloride lead to stimulation of sodium and water secretion into the intestinal lumen 3 . Therefore by serving as paracrine regulators of CFTR activity cGMP receptor agonists regulate fluid and electrolyte transport in the GI tract 1 6 U.S. Pat. No. 5 489 670 . Thus the cGMP mediated activation of CFTR and the downstream signaling plays an important role in normal functioning of gut physiology. Therefore any abnormality in this process could potentially lead to gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome inflammatory bowel disease excessive acidity and cancer 25 26 .

The process of epithelial renewal involves the proliferation migration differentiation senescence and eventual loss of GI cells in the lumen 7 8 . The GI mucosa can be divided into three distinct zones based on the proliferation index of epithelial cells. One of these zones the proliferative zone consists of undifferentiated stem cells responsible for providing a constant source of new cells. The stem cells migrate upward toward the lumen to which they are extruded. As they migrate the cells lose their capacity to divide and become differentiated for carrying out specialized functions of the GI mucosa 9 . Renewal of GI mucosa is very rapid with complete turnover occurring within a 24 48 hour period 9 . During this process mutated and unwanted cells are replenished with new cells. Hence homeostasis of the GI mucosa is regulated by continual maintenance of the balance between proliferation and apoptotic rates 8 .

The rates of cell proliferation and apoptosis in the gut epithelium can be increased or decreased in a wide variety of different circumstances e.g. in response to physiological stimuli such as aging inflammatory signals hormones peptides growth factors chemicals and dietary habits. In addition an enhanced proliferation rate is frequently associated with a reduction in turnover time and an expansion of the proliferative zone 10 . The proliferation index has been observed to be much higher in pathological cases of ulcerative colitis and other GI disorders 11 . Thus intestinal hyperplasia is the major promoter of gastrointestinal inflammation and carcinogenesis.

In addition to a role for uroguanylin and guanylin as modulators of intestinal fluid and ion secretion these peptides may also be involved in the continual renewal of GI mucosa by maintaining the balance between proliferation and apoptosis in cells lining GI mucosa. Therefore any disruption in this renewal process due to reduced production of uroguanylin and or guanylin can lead to GI inflammation and cancer 25 26 . This is consistent with previously published data in WO 01 25266 which suggest a peptide with the active domain of uroguanylin may function as an inhibitor of polyp development in the colon and may constitute a treatment of colon cancer. However recent data also suggest that uroguanylin also binds to a currently unknown receptor which is distinct from GC C receptor 3 4 . Knockout mice lacking this guanylate cyclase receptor show resistance to ST peptides in the intestine but effects of uroguanylin and ST peptides are not disturbed in the kidney in vivo 3 . These results were further supported by the fact that membrane depolarization induced by guanylin was blocked by genistein a tyrosine kinase inhibitor whereas hyperpolarization induced by uroguanylin was not effected 12 13 . Thus it is not clear if the anti colon cancer and anti inflammatory activities of uroguanylin and its analogs are mediated through binding to one or both of these receptors.

Irritable bowel syndrome IBS and chronic idiopathic constipation are pathological conditions that can cause a great deal of intestinal discomfort and distress but unlike the IBD diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn s disease IBS does not cause the serious inflammation or changes in bowel tissue and it is not thought to increase the risk of colorectal cancer. In the past inflammatory bowel disease IBD celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome IBS were regarded as completely separate disorders. Now with the description of inflammation albeit low grade in IBS and of symptom overlap between IBS and celiac disease this contention has come under question. Acute bacterial gastroenteritis is the strongest risk factor identified to date for the subsequent development of postinfective irritable bowel syndrome PI IBS . Clinical risk factors include prolonged acute illness and the absence of vomiting. A genetically determined susceptibility to inflammatory stimuli may also be a risk factor for irritable bowel syndrome. The underlying pathophysiology indicates increased intestinal permeability and low grade inflammation as well as altered motility and visceral sensitivity 27 . Thus IBS is now considered as a low grade IBD.

Given the prevalence of inflammatory conditions and the attendant risk of developing cancerous lesions from inflamed tissue particularly intestinal tissue a need exists to improve the treatment options for inflammatory conditions particularly of the gastrointestinal tract.

As used herein the term guanylate cyclase receptor GCR refers to the class of guanylate cyclase C receptor on any cell type to which the inventive agonist peptides or natural agonists described herein bind. As used herein intestinal guanylate cyclase receptor is found exclusively on epithelial cells lining the GI mucosa. Uroguanylin guanylin and ST peptides are expected to bind to these receptors and may induce apoptosis. The possibility that there may be different receptors for each agonist peptide is not excluded. Hence the term refers to the class of guanylate cyclase receptors on epithelial cells.

As used herein the term GCR agonist is meant to refer to peptides and or other compounds that bind to an intestinal guanylate cyclase receptor and stimulate fluid and electrolyte transport. This term also covers fragments and pro peptides that bind to GCR and stimulate fluid and water secretion.

As used herein the term substantially equivalent is meant to refer to a peptide that has an amino acid sequence equivalent to that of the binding domain where certain residues may be deleted or replaced with other amino acids without impairing the peptide s ability to bind to an intestinal guanylate cyclase receptor and stimulate fluid and electrolyte transport.

Addition of carriers e.g. phosphate buffered saline or PBS and other components to the composition of the present invention is well within the level of skill in this art. In addition to the compound such compositions may contain pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and other ingredients known to facilitate administration and or enhance uptake. Other formulations such as microspheres nanoparticles liposomes and immunologically based systems may also be used in accordance with the present invention. Other examples include formulations with polymers e.g. 20 w v polyethylene glycol or cellulose or enteric formulations.

Without being bound by any theory the present invention is based upon several concepts. The first is that there is a cGMP dependent mechanism which regulates the balance between cellular proliferation and apoptosis and that a reduction in cGMP levels due to a deficiency of uroguanylin guanylin and or due to the activation of cGMP dependent phosphodiesterases is an early and critical step in neoplastic transformation. A second concept is that the release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids which leads to the activation of cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 cPLA2 cyclooxygenase 2 COX 2 and possibly 5 lipoxygenase 5 LO during the process of inflammation is down regulated by a cGMP dependent mechanism leading to reduced levels of prostaglandins and leukotrienes and that increasing intracellular levels of cGMP may therefore produce an anti inflammatory response. In addition a cGMP dependent mechanism is thought to be involved in the control of proinflammatory processes. Therefore elevating intracellular levels of cGMP may be used as a means of treating and controlling lipid metabolism disorders biliary disorders gastrointestinal disorders inflammatory disorders lung disorders cancer cardiac disorders including cardiovascular disorders eye disorders oral disorders blood disorders liver disorders skin disorders prostate disorders endocrine disorders increasing gastrointestinal motility and obesity. Lipid metabolism disorders include but not limited to dyslipidemia hyperlipidemia hypercholesterolemia hypertriglyceridemia sitosterolemia familial hypercholesterolemia xanthoma combined hyperlipidemia lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency tangier disease abetalipoproteinemia erectile dysfunction fatty liver disease and hepatitis. Billary disorders include gallbladder disorders such as for example gallstones gall bladder cancer cholangitis or primary sclerosing cholangitis or bile duct disorders such as for example cholecystitis bile duct cancer or fascioliasis. Gastrointestinal disorders include for example inflammatory bowel disease IBD e.g. ulcerative colitis and Crohn s disease irritable bowel syndrome IBS non ulcer dyspepsia chronic intestinal pseudo obstruction functional dyspepsia colonic pseudo obstruction duodenogastric reflux gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD Celiac disease ileus inflammation e.g. post operative ileus gastroparesis heartburn high acidity in the GI tract constipation e.g. constipation associated with use of medications such as opioids osteoarthritis drugs osteoporosis drugs post surgical constipation constipation associated with neuropathic disorders constipation associated with IBS . Inflammatory disorders include tissue and organ inflammation such as kidney inflammation e.g. nephritis gastrointestinal system inflammation e.g. Crohn s disease and ulcerative colitis necrotizing enterocolitis NEC pancreatic inflammation e.g. pancreatis lung inflammation e.g. bronchitis or asthma or skin inflammation e.g. psoriasis eczema . Lung Disorders include for example chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD and fibrosis. Cancer includes tissue and organ carcinogenesis including metastases such as for example gastrointestinal cancer e.g. gastric cancer esophageal cancer pancreatic cancer colorectal cancer intestinal cancer anal cancer liver cancer gallbladder cancer or colon cancer lung cancer thyroid cancer skin cancer e.g. melanoma oral cancer urinary tract cancer e.g. bladder cancer or kidney cancer blood cancer e.g. myeloma or leukemia or prostate cancer. Cardiac disorders include for example congestive heart failure trachea cardia hypertension high cholesterol or high tryglycerides. Cardiovascular disorders include for example aneurysm angina atherosclerosis cerebrovascular accident stroke cerebrovasculardisease congestive heart failure coronary artery disease myocardial infarction heart attack or peripheral vascular disease. Liver disorders include for example cirrhosis and fibrosis. In addition GC C agonist may also be useful to facilitate liver regeneration in liver transplant patients. Eye disorders include for example increased intra ocular pressure glaucoma dry eyes retinal degeneration disorders of tear glands or eye inflammation. Skin disorders include for example xerosis. Oral disorders include for example dry mouth xerostomia Sj gren s syndrome gum diseases e.g. periodontal disease or salivary gland duct blockage or malfunction. Prostate disorders include for example benign prostatic hyperplasia BPH . Endocrine disorders include for example diabetes mellitus hyperthyroidism hypothyroidism and cystic fibrosis.

Without intending to be bound by any theory it is envisioned that ion transport across the plasma membrane may prove to be an important regulator of the balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis that will be affected by agents altering cGMP concentrations. Uroguanylin has been shown to stimulate K efflux Ca influx and water transport in the gastrointestinal tract 3 . Moreover atrial natriuretic peptide ANP a peptide that also binds to a specific guanylate cyclase receptor has also been shown to induce apoptosis in rat mesangial cells and to induce apoptosis in cardiac myocytes by a cGMP mechanism 21 24 .

Binding of the present agonists to a guanylate cyclase receptor stimulates production of cGMP. This ligand receptor interaction via activation of a cascade of cGMP dependent protein kinases and CFTR induces apoptosis in target cells. Therefore administration of the peptides defined by Formulae I XXI their corresponding aminoadipic acid Aad derivatives e.g. Formulae I Aad II Aad III Aad IV Aad V Aad VI Aad VII a Aad VII b Aad VIII Aad IX Aad XVIII Aad or XXI Aad as well as those amino acid sequence summarized below in Tables 1 8 are useful in eliminating or at least retarding the onset of lipid metabolism disorders biliary disorders gastrointestinal disorders inflammatory disorders lung disorders cancer cardiac disorders including cardiovascular disorders eye disorders oral disorders blood disorders liver disorders skin disorders prostate disorders endocrine disorders increasing gastrointestinal motility and obesity. Lipid metabolism disorders include but not limited to dyslipidemia hyperlipidemia hypercholesterolemia hypertriglyceridemia sitosterolemia familial hypercholesterolemia xanthoma combined hyperlipidemia lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency tangier disease abetalipoproteinemia erectile dysfunction fatty liver disease and hepatitis. Billary disorders include gallbladder disorders such as for example gallstones gall bladder cancer cholangitis or primary sclerosing cholangitis or bile duct disorders such as for example cholecystitis bile duct cancer or fascioliasis. Gastrointestinal disorders include for example inflammatory bowel disease IBD e.g. ulcerative colitis and Crohn s disease irritable bowel syndrome IBS non ulcer dyspepsia chronic intestinal pseudo obstruction functional dyspepsia colonic pseudo obstruction duodenogastric reflux gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD Celiac disease ileus inflammation e.g. post operative ileus gastroparesis heartburn high acidity in the GI tract constipation e.g. constipation associated with use of medications such as opioids osteoarthritis drugs osteoporosis drugs post surgical constipation constipation associated with neuropathic disorders constipation associated with IBS . Inflammatory disorders include tissue and organ inflammation such as kidney inflammation e.g. nephritis gastrointestinal system inflammation e.g. Crohn s disease and ulcerative colitis necrotizing enterocolitis NEC pancreatic inflammation e.g. pancreatis lung inflammation e.g. bronchitis or asthma or skin inflammation e.g. psoriasis eczema . Lung Disorders include for example chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD and fibrosis. Cancer includes tissue and organ carcinogenesis including metastases such as for example gastrointestinal cancer e.g. gastric cancer esophageal cancer pancreatic cancer colorectal cancer intestinal cancer anal cancer liver cancer gallbladder cancer or colon cancer lung cancer thyroid cancer skin cancer e.g. melanoma oral cancer urinary tract cancer e.g. bladder cancer or kidney cancer blood cancer e.g. myeloma or leukemia or prostate cancer. Cardiac disorders include for example congestive heart failure trachea cardia hypertension high cholesterol or high tryglycerides. Cardiovascular disorders include for example aneurysm angina atherosclerosis cerebrovascular accident stroke cerebrovasculardisease congestive heart failure coronary artery disease myocardial infarction heart attack or peripheral vascular disease. Liver disorders include for example cirrhosis and fibrosis. In addition GC C agonist may also be useful to facilitate liver regeneration in liver transplant patients. Eye disorders include for example increased intra ocular pressure glaucoma dry eyes retinal degeneration disorders of tear glands or eye inflammation. Skin disorders include for example xerosis. Oral disorders include for example dry mouth xerostomia Sj gren s syndrome gum diseases e.g. periodontal disease or salivary gland duct blockage or malfunction. Prostate disorders include for example benign prostatic hyperplasia BPH . Endocrine disorders include for example diabetes mellitus hyperthyroidism hypothyroidism and cystic fibrosis.

Uroguanylin is a circulating peptide hormone with natriuretic activity and has been found to stimulate fluid and electrolyte transport in a manner similar to another family of heat stable enterotoxins ST peptides secreted by pathogenic strains of and other enteric bacteria that activate guanylate cyclase receptor and cause secretory diarrhea. Unlike bacterial ST peptides the binding of uroguanylin to guanylate cyclase receptor is dependent on the physiological pH of the gut. Therefore uroguanylin is expected to regulate fluid and electrolyte transport in a pH dependent manner and without causing severe diarrhea.

The GCRA peptides of the present invention are analogues uroguanylin guanylin lymphoguanylin and ST peptides. No particular length is implied by the term peptide . In some embodiments the GCRA peptide is less than 25 amino acids in length e.g. less than or equal to 20 15 14 13 12 11 10 or 5 amino acid in length.

The GCRA peptides can be polymers of L amino acids D amino acids or a combination of both. For example in various embodiments the peptides are D retro inverso peptides. The term retro inverso isomer refers to an isomer of a linear peptide in which the direction of the sequence is reversed and the chirality of each amino acid residue is inverted. See e.g. Jameson et al. 368 744 746 1994 Brady et al. Nature 368 692 693 1994 . The net result of combining D enantiomers and reverse synthesis is that the positions of carbonyl and amino groups in each amide bond are exchanged while the position of the side chain groups at each alpha carbon is preserved. Unless specifically stated otherwise it is presumed that any given L amino acid sequence of the invention may be made into a D retro inverso peptide by synthesizing a reverse of the sequence for the corresponding native L amino acid sequence. For example a GCRA peptide includes the sequence defined by Formulae I XXI their corresponding aminoadipic acid Aad derivatives e.g. Formula I Aad II Aad III Aad IV Aad V Aad VI Aad VII a Aad VII b Aad VIII Aad IX Aad XVIII Aad or XXI Aad as well as those amino acid sequence summarized below in Tables 1 8.

By inducing cGMP production is meant that the GCRA peptide induces the production of intracellular cGMP. Intracellular cGMP is measured by methods known in the art. For example the GCRA peptide of the invention stimulate 5 10 20 30 40 50 75 90 or more intracellular cGMP compared to naturally occurring GC C agonists. In some embodiments the GCRA peptides described herein are more stable than naturally occurring GC C agonists. By more stable it is meant that the peptide degrade less and or more slowly in simulated gastric fluid and or simulated intestinal fluid compared to naturally occurring GC C agonists. For example the GCRA peptide of the invention degrade 2 3 5 10 15 20 30 40 50 75 90 or less compared to naturally occurring GC C agonists.

As used herein PEG3 3 PEG is meant to denote polyethylene glycol such as include aminoethyloxy ethyloxy acetic acid AeeA .

As used herein the term AMIDE is meant to denote that the terminal carboxylic acid is replaced with an amide group i.e. the terminal COOH is replaced with CONH.

Additionally any amino acid represented by Xaa may be an L amino acid a D amino acid a methylated amino acid a fluorinated amino acid or any combination of thereof. Preferably the amino acid at the N terminus C terminus or both is a D amino acid. Optionally any GCRA peptide represented by Formulae I XXI and their corresponding aminoadipic acid Aad derivatives represented by Formulae I Aad II Aad III Aad IV Aad V Aad VI Aad VII a Aad VII b Aad VIII Aad IX Aad XVIII Aad or XXI Aad may contain on or more polyethylene glycol residues at the N terminus C terminus or both. An exemplary polyethylene glycol includes aminoethyloxy ethyloxy acetic acid and polymers thereof. In some embodiments any GCRA peptide represented by Formulae I XXI and their corresponding aminoadipic acid Aad derivatives represented by Formulae I Aad II Aad III Aad IV Aad V Aad VI Aad VII a Aad VII b Aad VIII Aad IX Aad XVIII Aad or XXI Aad may contain AMIDE at the c terminus.

See for example Hunt The Non Protein Amino Acids In Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Amino Acids Barrett Chapman and Hall 1985 . For example an aromatic amino acid can be replaced by 3 4 dihydroxy L phenylalanine 3 iodo L tyrosine triiodothyronine L thyroxine phenylglycine Phg or nor tyrosine norTyr . Phg and norTyr and other amino acids including Phe and Tyr can be substituted by e.g. a halogen CH3 OH CH2NH3 C O H CH2CH3 CN CH2CH2CH3 SH or another group.

The polypeptides of the invention can include further modifications including those described in US20060019347 paragraph 589.

In some embodiments an amino acid can be replaced by a naturally occurring non essential amino acid e.g. taurine.

Alternatively the GCRA peptides are cyclic peptides. GCRA cyclic peptides are prepared by methods known in the art. For example macrocyclization is often accomplished by forming an amide bond between the peptide N and C termini between a side chain and the N or C terminus e.g. with KFe CN at pH 8.5 Samson et al. 137 5182 5185 1996 or between two amino acid side chains such as cysteine. See e.g. DeGrado 39 51 124 1988 . In various aspects the GCRA peptides are 4 12 7 15 bicycles.

In some GCRA peptides one or both members of one or both pairs of Cys residues which normally form a disulfide bond can be replaced by homocysteine penicillamine 3 mercaptoproline Kolodziej et al. 1996 Int J Pept Protein Res 48 274 dimethylcysteine Hunt et al. 1993 Int J Pept Protein Res 42 249 or diaminopropionic acid Smith et al. 1978 J Med Chem 2 1 117 to form alternative internal cross links at the positions of the normal disulfide bonds.

In addition one or more disulfide bonds can be replaced by alternative covalent cross links e.g. an amide linkage CH2CH O NHCH 2 or CH2NHCH O CH 2 an ester linkage a thioester linkage a lactam bridge a carbamoyl linkage a urea linkage a thiourea linkage a phosphonate ester linkage an alkyl linkage CH2CH2CH2CH2 an alkenyl linkage CH 2CH CHCH 2 an ether linkage CH2CH2OCH2 or CH2OCH2CH2 a thioether linkage CH2CH2SCH2 or CH2SCH2CH2 an amine linkage CH2CH2NHCH2 or CH2NHCH 2CH2 or a thioamide linkage CH2CH S HNHCH 2 or CH2NHCH S CH 2 . For example Ledu et al. Proc Nat l Acad. Sci. 100 11263 78 2003 describe methods for preparing lactam and amide cross links. Exemplary GCRA peptides which include a lactam bridge include for example SP 370.

The GCRA peptides can have one or more conventional polypeptide bonds replaced by an alternative bond. Such replacements can increase the stability of the polypeptide. For example replacement of the polypeptide bond between a residue amino terminal to an aromatic residue e.g. Tyr Phe Trp with an alternative bond can reduce cleavage by carboxy peptidases and may increase half life in the digestive tract. Bonds that can replace polypeptide bonds include a retro inverso bond C O NH instead of NH C O a reduced amide bond NH CH2 a thiomethylene bond S CH2 or CH2 S an oxomethylene bond O CH 2 or CH2 O an ethylene bond CH2 CH2 a thioamide bond C S NH a trans olefine bond CH CH a fluoro substituted trans olefine bond CF CH a ketomethylene bond C O CHR or CHR C O wherein R is H or CH3 and a fluoro ketomethylene bond C O CFR or CFR C O wherein R is H or F or CH3.

The GCRA peptides can be modified using standard modifications. Modifications may occur at the amino N carboxyl C terminus internally or a combination of any of the preceding. In one aspect described herein there may be more than one type of modification on the polypeptide. Modifications include but are not limited to acetylation amidation biotinylation cinnamoylation farnesylation formylation myristoylation palmitoylation phosphorylation Ser Tyr or Thr stearoylation succinylation sulfurylation and cyclisation via disulfide bridges or amide cyclisation and modification by Cys3 or Cys5. The GCRA peptides described herein may also be modified by 2 4 dinitrophenyl DNP DNP lysine modification by 7 Amino 4 methyl coumarin AMC flourescein NBD 7 Nitrobenz 2 Oxa 1 3 Diazole p nitro anilide rhodamine B EDANS 5 2 aminoethyl amino naphthalene 1 sulfonic acid dabcyl dabsyl dansyl texas red FMOC and Tamra Tetramethylrhodamine . The GCRA peptides described herein may also be conjugated to for example polyethylene glycol PEG alkyl groups e.g. C1 C20 straight or branched alkyl groups fatty acid radicals combinations of PEG alkyl groups and fatty acid radicals See U.S. Pat. No. 6 309 633 Soltero et al. 2001 Innovations in Pharmaceutical Technology 106 110 BSA and KLH Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin . The addition of PEG and other polymers which can be used to modify polypeptides of the invention is described in US2006019347 section IX.

Also included in the invention are peptides that biologically or functional equivalent to the peptides described herein. The term biologically equivalent or functional equivalent is intended to mean that the compositions of the present invention are capable of demonstrating some or all of the cGMP production modulatory effects.

GCRA peptides can also include derivatives of GCRA peptides which are intended to include hybrid and modified forms of GCRA peptides in which certain amino acids have been deleted or replaced and modifications such as where one or more amino acids have been changed to a modified amino acid or unusual amino acid and modifications such as glycosylation so long the modified form retains the biological activity of GCRA peptides. By retaining the biological activity it is meant that cGMP and or apoptosis is induced by the GCRA peptide although not necessarily at the same level of potency as that of a naturally occurring GCRA peptide identified.

Preferred variants are those that have conservative amino acid substitutions made at one or more predicted non essential amino acid residues. A conservative amino acid substitution is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains e.g. lysine arginine histidine acidic side chains e.g. aspartic acid glutamic acid uncharged polar side chains e.g. glycine asparagine glutamine serine threonine tyrosine cysteine nonpolar side chains e.g. alanine valine leucine isoleucine proline phenylalanine methionine tryptophan beta branched side chains e.g. threonine valine isoleucine and aromatic side chains e.g. tyrosine phenylalanine tryptophan histidine . Thus a predicted nonessential amino acid residue in a GCRA polypeptide is replaced with another amino acid residue from the same side chain family. Alternatively in another embodiment mutations can be introduced randomly along all or part of a GCRA coding sequence such as by saturation mutagenesis and the resultant mutants can be screened to identify mutants that retain activity.

Also included within the meaning of substantially homologous is any GCRA peptide which may be isolated by virtue of cross reactivity with antibodies to the GCRA peptide.

GCRA peptides are easily prepared using modern cloning techniques or may be synthesized by solid state methods or by site directed mutagenesis. A GCRA peptide may include dominant negative forms of a polypeptide.

Chemical synthesis may generally be performed using standard solution phase or solid phase peptide synthesis techniques in which a peptide linkage occurs through the direct condensation of the amino group of one amino acid with the carboxy group of the other amino acid with the elimination of a water molecule. Peptide bond synthesis by direct condensation as formulated above requires suppression of the reactive character of the amino group of the first and of the carboxyl group of the second amino acid. The masking substituents must permit their ready removal without inducing breakdown of the labile peptide molecule.

In solution phase synthesis a wide variety of coupling methods and protecting groups may be used See Gross and Meienhofer eds. The Peptides Analysis Synthesis Biology Vol. 1 4 Academic Press 1979 Bodansky and Bodansky The Practice of Peptide Synthesis 2d ed. Springer Verlag 1994 . In addition intermediate purification and linear scale up are possible. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that solution synthesis requires consideration of main chain and side chain protecting groups and activation method. In addition careful segment selection is necessary to minimize racemization during segment condensation. Solubility considerations are also a factor. Solid phase peptide synthesis uses an insoluble polymer for support during organic synthesis. The polymer supported peptide chain permits the use of simple washing and filtration steps instead of laborious purifications at intermediate steps. Solid phase peptide synthesis may generally be performed according to the method of Merrifield et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963 85 2149 which involves assembling a linear peptide chain on a resin support using protected amino acids. Solid phase peptide synthesis typically utilizes either the Boc or Fmoc strategy which is well known in the art.

Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that in solid phase synthesis deprotection and coupling reactions must go to completion and the side chain blocking groups must be stable throughout the synthesis. In addition solid phase synthesis is generally most suitable when peptides are to be made on a small scale.

Acetylation of the N terminal can be accomplished by reacting the final peptide with acetic anhydride before cleavage from the resin. C amidation is accomplished using an appropriate resin such as methylbenzhydrylamine resin using the Boc technology.

Alternatively the GCRA peptides are produced by modern cloning techniques. For example the GCRA peptides are produced either in bacteria including without limitation or in other existing systems for polypeptide or protein production e.g. baculovirus expression systems using Sf9 cells yeast or filamentous fungal expression systems mammalian cell expression systems or they can be chemically synthesized. If the GCRA peptide or variant peptide is to be produced in bacteria e.g. the nucleic acid molecule encoding the polypeptide may also encode a leader sequence that permits the secretion of the mature polypeptide from the cell. Thus the sequence encoding the polypeptide can include the pre sequence and the pro sequence of for example a naturally occurring bacterial ST polypeptide. The secreted mature polypeptide can be purified from the culture medium.

The sequence encoding a GCRA peptide described herein can be inserted into a vector capable of delivering and maintaining the nucleic acid molecule in a bacterial cell. The DNA molecule may be inserted into an autonomously replicating vector suitable vectors include for example pGEM3Z and pcDNA3 and derivatives thereof . The vector nucleic acid may be a bacterial or bacteriophage DNA such as bacteriophage lambda or M13 and derivatives thereof. Construction of a vector containing a nucleic acid described herein can be followed by transformation of a host cell such as a bacterium. Suitable bacterial hosts include but are not limited to . The genetic construct also includes in addition to the encoding nucleic acid molecule elements that allow expression such as a promoter and regulatory sequences. The expression vectors may contain transcriptional control sequences that control transcriptional initiation such as promoter enhancer operator and repressor sequences.

A variety of transcriptional control sequences are well known to those in the art. The expression vector can also include a translation regulatory sequence e.g. an untranslated 5 sequence an untranslated 3 sequence or an internal ribosome entry site . The vector can be capable of autonomous replication or it can integrate into host DNA to ensure stability during polypeptide production.

The protein coding sequence that includes a GCRA peptide described herein can also be fused to a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide affinity tag e.g. glutathione S transferase GST maltose E binding protein protein A FLAG tag hexa histidine myc tag or the influenza HA tag in order to facilitate purification. The affinity tag or reporter fusion joins the reading frame of the polypeptide of interest to the reading frame of the gene encoding the affinity tag such that a translational fusion is generated. Expression of the fusion gene results in translation of a single polypeptide that includes both the polypeptide of interest and the affinity tag. In some instances where affinity tags are utilized DNA sequence encoding a protease recognition site will be fused between the reading frames for the affinity tag and the polypeptide of interest.

Genetic constructs and methods suitable for production of immature and mature forms of the GCRA peptides and variants described herein in protein expression systems other than bacteria and well known to those skilled in the art can also be used to produce polypeptides in a biological system.

The peptides disclosed herein may be modified by attachment of a second molecule that confers a desired property upon the peptide such as increased half life in the body for example pegylation. Such modifications also fall within the scope of the term variant as used herein.

By inducing is meant an increase in cGMP production compared to a tissue or cell that has not been in contact with the composition. Tissues or cells are directly contacted with a composition of the invention. Alternatively the composition of the invention is administered systemically. Composition of the invention is administered in an amount sufficient to increase intracellular cGMP concentration. cGMP production is measured by a cell based assay known in the art 25 .

Disorders are treated prevented or alleviated by administering to a subject e.g. a mammal such as a human in need thereof a therapeutically effective dose of a composition of the present invention.

The present invention also provides a method of colonic cleansing by administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of any compositions of the present invention

This method can be used in cleansing or purging the bowels or colon prior to carrying out a diagnostic therapeutic or surgical procedure on the colon rectum or anus or elsewhere in the abdomen. The diagnostic or surgical procedure may for example be sigmoidoscopy colonoscopy radiographic examination preparation for patients undergoing bowel surgery and other medical or diagnostic procedures. It has been believed that profuse uncontrolled diarrhea was necessary to produce adequate cleansing of the colon. This present invention provides a safe and effective cleansing method for the bowels and colon without the ingestion of large volumes of lavage solutions without the unpleasant bitter and dangerous hypertonic salt solutions thus providing an improved patients compliance.

 Subject as used herein means an individual. In one aspect the subject is a mammal such as a primate and in another aspect the subject is a human. The term subject also includes domesticated animals e.g. cats dogs etc. and livestock e.g. cattle horses pigs sheep goats etc. . The subject may be at risk of or susceptible to developing a disorder that is mediated by guanylate cyclase receptor agonists or may have a disorder that is mediated by guanylate cyclase receptor agonists. The subject may be a human over 50 years old.

The GCRA peptides may be in a pharmaceutical composition in unit dose form together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. The term unit dose form refers to a single drug delivery entity e.g. a tablet capsule solution or inhalation formulation. The amount of peptide present should be sufficient to have a positive therapeutic effect when administered to a patient typically between 10 g and 3 g . What constitutes a positive therapeutic effect will depend upon the particular condition being treated and will include any significant improvement in a condition readily recognized by one of skill in the art.

The composition of the invention can be administered alone or in combination with other agents. For example the composition can be administered in combination with inhibitors of cGMP dependent phosphodiesterase such as for example sulindac sulfone zaprinast motapizone vardenafil or sildenafil one or more other chemotherapeutic agents or anti inflammatory drugs such as for example steroids or non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs NSAIDS such as aspirin.

Combination therapy can be achieved by administering two or more agents e.g. a composition described herein and another compound each of which is formulated and administered separately or by administering two or more agents in a single formulation. Other combinations are also encompassed by combination therapy. For example two agents can be formulated together and administered in conjunction with a separate formulation containing a third agent. While the two or more agents in the combination therapy can be administered simultaneously they need not be. For example administration of a first agent or combination of agents can precede administration of a second agent or combination of agents by minutes hours days or weeks. Thus the two or more agents can be administered within minutes of each other or within 1 2 3 6 9 12 15 18 or 24 hours of each other or within 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 14 days of each other or within 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 or 10 weeks of each other. In some cases even longer intervals are possible. While in many cases it is desirable that the two or more agents used in a combination therapy be present in within the patient s body at the same time this need not be so.

The composition described herein may be combined with cGMP dependent phosphodiesterase inhibitors e.g. sulindac sulfone Zaprinast sildenafil vardenafil or tadalafil to further enhance levels of cGMP in the target tissues or organs.

Combination therapy can also include two or more administrations of one or more of the agents used in the combination. For example if agent X and agent Y are used in a combination one could administer them sequentially in any combination one or more times e.g. in the order X Y X X X Y Y X Y Y Y X X X Y Y etc.

Combination therapy can also include the administration of one composition with azothioprine and or other immunomodulating agents. The immunomodulating agents may include small molecule drugs and biologics such as Remicade Humaira and Cimzia etc.

Combination therapy can also include the administration of two or more agents via different routes or locations. For example a one agent is administered orally and another agent is administered intravenously or b one agent is administered orally and another is administered locally. In each case the agents can either simultaneously or sequentially. Approximated dosages for some of the combination therapy agents described herein are found in the BNF Recommended Dose column of tables on pages 11 17 of WO01 76632 the data in the tables being attributed to the March 2000 British National Formulary and can also be found in other standard formularies and other drug prescribing directories. For some drugs the customary presecribed dose for an indication will vary somewhat from country to country.

The composition alone or in combination can be combined with any pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or medium. Thus they can be combined with materials that do not produce an adverse allergic or otherwise unwanted reaction when administered to a patient. The carriers or mediums used can include solvents dispersants coatings absorption promoting agents controlled release agents and one or more inert excipients which include starches polyols granulating agents microcrystalline cellulose e.g. celphere Celphere Beads diluents lubricants binders disintegrating agents and the like etc. If desired tablet dosages of the disclosed compositions may be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques.

A pharmaceutical composition of the invention is formulated to be compatible with its intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration include parenteral e.g. intravenous intradermal subcutaneous oral e.g. inhalation transdermal topical transmucosal and rectal administration. Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral intradermal or subcutaneous application can include the following components a sterile diluent such as water for injection saline solution fixed oils polyethylene glycols glycerine propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid buffers such as acetates citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. The pH can be adjusted with acids or bases such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic.

Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions where water soluble or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administration suitable carriers include physiological saline bacteriostatic water Cremophor EL BASF Parsippany N.J. or phosphate buffered saline PBS . In all cases the composition must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy syringeability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing for example water ethanol polyol for example glycerol propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol and the like and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained for example by the use of a coating such as lecithin by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents for example parabens chlorobutanol phenol ascorbic acid thimerosal and the like. In many cases it will be preferable to include isotonic agents for example sugars polyalcohols such as mannitol sorbitol sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption for example aluminum monostearate and gelatin.

Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound e.g. a composition described herein in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above as required followed by filtered sterilization. Generally dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle that contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze drying that yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile filtered solution thereof.

Oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier such as mannitol fructooligosaccharides polyethylene glycol and other excipients. They can be enclosed in gelatin capsules or compressed into tablets. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration the active compound can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets troches or capsules. Oral compositions can also be prepared using a fluid carrier for use as a mouthwash wherein the compound in the fluid carrier is applied orally and swished and expectorated or swallowed. Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents and or adjuvant materials can be included as part of the composition. The tablets pills capsules troches and the like can contain any of the following ingredients or compounds of a similar nature a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose gum tragacanth or gelatin an excipient such as starch or lactose a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid Primogel or corn starch a lubricant such as magnesium stearate or Sterotes a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin or a flavoring agent such as peppermint methyl salicylate or orange flavoring.

For administration by inhalation the compounds are delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from pressured container or dispenser which contains a suitable propellant e.g. a gas such as carbon dioxide or a nebulizer.

Systemic administration can also be by transmucosal or transdermal means. For transmucosal or transdermal administration penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art and include for example for transmucosal administration detergents bile salts and fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays or suppositories. For transdermal administration the active compounds are formulated into ointments salves gels or creams as generally known in the art.

The compounds can also be prepared in the form of suppositories e.g. with conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter and other glycerides or retention enemas for rectal delivery.

In one embodiment the active compounds are prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body such as a controlled release formulation including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable biocompatible polymers can be used such as ethylene vinyl acetate polyanhydrides polyglycolic acid collagen polyorthoesters and polylactic acid. Methods for preparation of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The materials can also be obtained commercially from Alza Corporation and Nova Pharmaceuticals Inc. Liposomal suspensions including liposomes targeted to infected cells with monoclonal antibodies to viral antigens can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 522 811 incorporated fully herein by reference.

It is especially advantageous to formulate oral or parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be treated each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on the unique characteristics of the active compound and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved.

Adjustments in dosage will be made using methods that are routine in the art and will be based upon the particular composition being used and clinical considerations.

The composition used in the methods described above may be administered orally systemically or locally. Dosage forms include preparations for inhalation or injection solutions suspensions emulsions tablets capsules topical salves and lotions transdermal compositions other known peptide formulations and pegylated peptide analogs. The composition described herein may be administered as either the sole active agent or in combination with other drugs e.g. an inhibitor of cGMP dependent phosphodiesterase and anti inflammatory agent. In all cases additional drugs should be administered at a dosage that is therapeutically effective using the existing art as a guide. Drugs may be administered in a single composition or sequentially.

Dosage levels of the composition for use in methods of this invention typically are from about 0.001 mg to about 10 000 mg daily preferably from about 0.005 mg to about 1 000 mg daily. For example an effective dosage of the GCRA peptide or its analogs for use in methods of this invention is 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 5.5 6.0 6.5 7.0 7.5 8.0 8.5 9.0 9.5 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 or 20 mg per day or optionally twice a day. For example an effective dosage of the 5 aminosalicyclic acid is 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 5.5 6.0 6.5 7.0 7.5 8.0 8.5 9.0 9.5 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 600 650 700 750 800 900 1000 1100 1200 1300 1400 1500 mg or more per day or optionally twice a day. Exemplary effective dosage of mercaptopurine is 2.5 5.0 mg kg of body weight per day.

Preferably the composition described herein is given after a meal i.e 30 minutes . In some embodiments a second agent is administered. Suitable second agents are described herein. In some aspects the second agent is administered at less than the standard does for treating the particular disorder because the composition described herein acts synergistically with the second agent. For example 2.5 5 7.5 or 10 mg of Liptor is given twice a day after a meal i.e 30 minutes . On the basis of mg kg daily dose either given in single or divided doses dosages typically range from about 0.001 75 mg kg to about 10 000 75 mg kg preferably from about 0.005 75 mg kg to about 1 000 75 mg kg.

The total daily dose of each inhibitor can be administered to the patient in a single dose or in multiple subdoses. Typically subdoses can be administered two to six times per day preferably two to four times per day and even more preferably two to three times per day. Doses can be in immediate release form or sustained release form sufficiently effective to obtain the desired control over the medical condition.

The dosage regimen to prevent treat give relief from or ameliorate a medical condition or disorder or to otherwise protect against or treat a medical condition with the combinations and compositions of the present invention is selected in accordance with a variety of factors. These factors include but are not limited to the type age weight sex diet and medical condition of the subject the severity of the disease the route of administration pharmacological considerations such as the activity efficacy pharmacokinetics and toxicology profiles of the particular inhibitors employed whether a drug delivery system is utilized and whether the inhibitors are administered with other active ingredients. Thus the dosage regimen actually employed may vary widely and therefore deviate from the preferred dosage regimen set forth above.
