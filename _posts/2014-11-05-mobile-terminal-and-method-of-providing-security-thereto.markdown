A mobile terminal according to the present invention is able to activate or deactivate various security functions by being linked to a mobile communication system in order to provide security. And the mobile terminal is able to query the mobile communication system about whether a process for this operation is performed. Moreover the mobile terminal is able to report a result of the process to the mobile communication system. A user is able to activate various functions for preventing an unauthorized use e.g. an unwanted call leakage of information saved in a mobile terminal etc. of a lost mobile terminal or acquiring a current location of a mobile terminal via webpages applications and the like. An access to a webpage or an activation of an application may be performed by an internet connectible computer another mobile terminal or the like. And a security function selected via the corresponding webpage or application may be delivered to the mobile terminal via a mobile communication network. A detailed configuration of a mobile communication system to secure the implementation of this operation is described with reference to as follows.

Referring to a mobile communication system for implementing embodiments of the present invention may include a mobile terminal a web terminal a web server a push server a connection management server hereinafter abbreviated CMS a database DB server and a relay server . In the following description the respective components are explained in detail.

First of all the foregoing descriptions with reference to and exactly apply to the mobile terminal . The web terminal is accessible to the web server by wire wireless via a web browser or application. If the web terminal is provided with a display means and a command input means it may include any kind of computer or terminal. The web server may provide a webpage API application programming interface for mobile terminal security to the web terminal query the connection management server about an address of the push server and read record information in the database server . In particular the webpage API for the mobile terminal security may include an interface prepared to control a mobile terminal security function of the present invention on a web browser or application activated by the web terminal . For this it may be able to provide an interface configured to enable a user to select various security functions that can be activated or deactivated in a lost mobile terminal .

The push server may play a role in delivering a security function related command requested by the web server to the mobile terminal . In this case the security function related command requested by the web server preferably includes a command corresponding to a function selected by a user via an API provided by the web terminal . Moreover a plurality of push servers may be provided in a manner of geographically distributed.

The connection management server acquires a server address of the push server and or a list of mobile terminals taken charge of by the corresponding push server from the push server and then manages the acquired server address and or the list. If the web server queries the server address of the push server in charge of the corresponding mobile terminal in order to deliver a command to a specific mobile terminal the connection management server may be able to inform the web server of the queried server address.

The database server may store a command for a security function requested to the web server by a user an execution result of the command and security related information e.g. SIM card information password synchronization information etc. on the mobile terminal.

If the mobile terminal makes a request for a command confirmation prior to executing the command delivered from the push server the relay server queries the database server about the corresponding command and then makes a reply to the mobile terminal . Alternatively the relay server receives information on the command execution result from the mobile terminal and then forwards it to the database server .

Meanwhile a communication between the web server and the web terminal may follow the HTTP specifications. And data exchanges may be performed via communications between other servers by TCP IP MQTT MQ Telemetry Transport . The respective servers to are classified with reference to executable functions by which the present invention may be non limited. For instance at least two functions may be performed by a single server or a single function may be performed by at least two servers which is apparent to those skilled in the art.

In the following description a sequence for performing a security related function of the mobile terminal through the above mentioned components is explained.

In the following sequence assume that program codes for the execution of a security function according to the present invention are loaded as an application and or operating system OS on the mobile terminal . And assume that the mobile terminal must include the wireless communication unit to communicate with the push server and the relay server . Moreover assume that information e.g. ID and password for an access to a web server i.e. web account information SIM card information information for mobile terminal security etc. for identifying a mobile terminal and a user is saved in the database server in advance.

First of all in case that a security function of a mobile terminal according to the present invention is necessary e.g. if a mobile terminal is lost a user accesses the web server via the web terminal . In doing so a login procedure may be requested for user confirmation authentication. And the web server for the login information confirmation is the database server .

If the user selects an activation of a specific security function via the API provided by the web server the web server queries the connection management server about an address of the push server in charge of the corresponding mobile terminal in order to deliver a execution command of the selected function. Having acquired the address of the push server the web server requests the push server to deliver the execution command to the mobile terminal and also requests the database server to store the execution command.

In response to the request made by the web server the push server delivers the execution command to the mobile terminal . The mobile terminal may directly perform an operation according to the corresponding execution command or may undergo a confirmation procedure. In case of undergoing the confirmation procedure the mobile terminal may query the relay server about validity of the execution command. In response to the query from the mobile terminal the relay server requests the database server to check whether the execution command queried by the mobile terminal is identical to the execution command requested to be stored by the web server i.e. the command selected by the user via the webpage . Having received the confirmation of the command identity the relay server notifies it to the mobile terminal . The mobile terminal then performs an operation in accordance with the corresponding execution command. Thereafter the mobile terminal transmits a result of the operation execution to the relay server immediately or on the basis of event triggering. The relay server forwards the execution result to the database server . The database server pushes the execution result to the web server by real time periods. Alternatively if there is a polling from the web server the database server may forward the execution result to the web server . The execution result forwarded to the web server may be displayed on the web terminal via API.

Except special cases the above mentioned command execution process may be universally applicable to the embodiments of the present invention.

In the following description detailed functions of providing security to a mobile terminal according to the present invention are explained with reference to .

Referring to a security function according to one embodiment of the present invention may be mainly divided into a loss step on a left side a function executing step on a middle side and an end step on a right side.

The loss step may mean a process for receiving API for controlling a security function in a manner that a user recognizes a loss and then accesses a web server via a web terminal.

The function executing step may mean a process executable prior to an end step of activating a kill function of canceling a security function finally activated in a mobile terminal or disabling a booting. And the respective functions configuring the function executing step may be individually executed or at least two of the functions may be performed together.

In the following description the respective functions configuring the function executing step are explained in detail. As mentioned in the foregoing description each of the functions explained in the following description may be executed when an execution command matched to the corresponding function is received from the push server. In particular if a user selects an execution command for a corresponding function from the web server via the web terminal the corresponding function can be executed in the mobile terminal.

First of all a remote alert may mean a function of forcing a sound via the audio output unit or a vibration via the haptic module to be outputted from the mobile terminal under a specific condition. This is to enable a user to perceive a location of the lost terminal in a manner of stimulating a tactile sense with vibration or the auditory sense with a sound generated from vibration or outputted via the audio output unit. In particular the vibration or sound may keep being generated for prescribed duration or by periods. An output pattern of the vibration or sound may be previously set in the mobile terminal or a user may directly select the output pattern from the API provided via the web server . In case that a user directly selects the output pattern an output pattern information may be delivered to the mobile terminal in a manner of being contained in an execution command transmitted from the push server . Moreover the specific condition may include a location information or a time information. According to the location information if a current location of the mobile terminal acquired from the position location module corresponds to a preset point the remote alert function may be executed. When the present function is executed on the basis of location if the remote alert function is set to operate at a location where a user of a lost mobile terminal resides a sound or vibration is generated when a finder passes the corresponding location. Hence it may be able to increase the possibility that the user may find the lost mobile terminal.

In the following description a web lock function is explained. Once a web lock function is set up at least one of functions of the mobile terminal may be restricted from being used. For instance a function of restricting a file in the mobile terminal from being viewed or a function of receiving an incoming call or rejecting an incoming call may be performed or a preset substitute screen may be displayed instead of a home screen of a mobile terminal. In this case a function executable in an active web lock function may be displayed on the substitute screen. In order to cancel an active web lock function a preset password may be inputted to a password input window displayed on the substitute screen or the like or a password may be inputted to an input means of the web terminal via the API provided by the web server . In doing so the password for canceling the web lock function may be encrypted and saved in the database server and may be preferably different from a password for canceling a lock screen of the mobile terminal. In case that the password for canceling the web lock function is inputted via the user input unit e.g. a virtual keypad displayed on the touchscreen of the mobile terminal the inputted password is transmitted to the relay server . The relay server then queries the database server about verification of identity with another password previously saved in the database server . If the database server confirms the identity between the two passwords the relay server notifies the confirmation of the identity to the mobile terminal whereby the web lock set in the mobile terminal can be cancelled.

If the password for canceling the web lock function is incorrectly inputted as many as a preset count an advanced web lock function may be executed. Once the advanced web lock function is activated it may be unable to further input the password for canceling the web lock in the mobile terminal. For instance as the web lock function is activated while a password input window is displayed on a substitute screen if the advanced web lock function is activated the password input window may disappear from the substitute screen. Hence if the advanced web lock function is executed once the executed advanced web lock function can be cancelled by an input via the web server only.

Meanwhile when a web lock function or an advanced web lock function is executed a sync off function and a USB port lock function may be additionally executed as well. In this case a sync function may mean that mutually stored data are synchronized between the mobile terminal and the database server . If the sync off function is executed synchronization can be prevented. Therefore new information is prevented from being transmitted to a lost mobile terminal from a database server or information saved in the database server is prevented from being updated with randomly modified information in the lost mobile terminal. The USB port lock function may mean a function of preventing a finder of a lost mobile terminal from arbitrarily accessing a file system of the lost mobile terminal via USB cable connection. In case of Android system an access via ADB Android data bridge or a UMS ultra mass storage connection can be blocked. Therefore a finder of a lost mobile terminal is prevented from gaining a root authority by hacking via ADB reinstalling OS or accessing an internal memory. Of course this is to deactivate a data input output function via USB port by software and may not block a power supply i.e. a built in battery charging via USB port.

The aforementioned sync off function and the aforementioned USB port lock function may be activated together when the web lock function is activated. The aforementioned sync off function and the aforementioned USB port lock function may be activated together when the advanced web lock function is activated. The aforementioned sync off function and the aforementioned USE port lock function may be activated in different steps respectively.

In the following description an encryption function is explained. The encryption function encrypts data saved in the memory of the mobile terminal to prevent internal data from leaking in case that a finder of the lost mobile terminal unlocks such a lock mechanism as a web lock and the like. Encryption may be performed by a preset encryption algorithm. In particular a while file may be encrypted. In case of a large sized file it may be able to encrypt a file header only. A range of a file to be encrypted may be set via web API or may be previously set in the mobile terminal .

In the following description a remote message function is explained. The remote message function means a function of displaying a message which is inputted by a user of a lost mobile terminal via web API on a display unit of the lost mobile terminal . Through this function the user of the lost mobile terminal may be able to deliver the message to a finder of the lost mobile terminal . In particular the present function may be displayed on a substitute screen provided by a web lock function when used together with the web lock function.

A memory wipe function means a function of deleting a message storage list in a specific range. The present function may be mainly classified into two steps. In the 1step a user file may be deleted while a system setting or application remains intact. In the 2step after a system has been reset like a factory reset rebooting may be performed in web lock mode. So to speak once the 1step wipe is executed a system file region e.g. internal memory for storing system files including OS and the like is maintained intact but a file saved in a file region e.g. SD memory card in which a user is able to record and delete files freely may be deleted only.

In the following description a location tracking function is explained. First of all according to the location tracking function a lost mobile terminal acquires its location information using the wireless communication module and then enables the acquired location information to be displayed on the web terminal via the web server by transmitting the acquired location information to the relay server . In doing so the mobile terminal activates the mobile communication module or the wireless Internet module acquires identification information e.g. Cell ID BSID MAC address of AP IP etc. of 3G or Wi Fi network via the activated mobile communication module or the activated wireless internet module and then transmits the acquired identification information to the relay server . Moreover the mobile terminal may be able to GPS coordinates acquired via the position location module to the relay server . Of course when an execution command for the location tracking function is received from the push server if the GPS or Wi Fi module is inactive the controller may be able to activate the corresponding module irrespective of settings i.e. setup override .

Moreover the mobile terminal activates the mobile communication module or the wireless internet module and the position location module in parallel and then transmits acquired informations to the relay server in order of acquisition. Alternatively the mobile terminal may be able to activate the corresponding modules in order indicated by an execution command received from the push server . Besides the present function may be configured to acquire and transmit location information by periods when an execution command for one of functions for providing security according to the present invention is received as well as a triggering via web.

In the following description an SIM data tracking function is explained. First of all an SIM or USIM card contains information for subscriber identification and may be generally connected to the mobile terminal via the interface unit . After an execution command for one of functions for providing security according to the present invention has been received if the controller detects that SIM card is replaced the controller may be able to transmit information e.g. phone number SIM card unique number IMSI international mobile subscriber identity etc. of the replaced card to the relay server .

In the following description an end call tracking function is explained. If an incoming call after execution of a web lock function is not ended due to a network situation e.g. call attempt time expiration etc. i.e. a call rejection menu selection a power off in the course of receiving a call a battery detachment in the course of receiving a call etc. the present function means a function of transmitting this fact to the relay server. Through the present function a user of a lost mobile terminal may be able to indirectly determine a return intention of a finder of the lost mobile terminal. In order to provide the present function more efficiently while a web lock is active an incoming call screen may be provided with a substitute screen for providing limited functions e.g. a call reception a call rejection etc. . On this substitute screen in order to protect personal information a caller is represented as a number only instead of a name saved in a phonebook despite the number is saved in the phonebook or the caller number may not be displayed at all. Of course the controller may be able to transmit an incoming call log and or received text messages after execution of a web lock function to the relay server as well as the fact of the reception rejection. And the controller may be able to delete transmission history.

Finally a kill function may mean a function of disabling a booting itself by deleting a booting related file or overwriting invalid data on the booting related file. If there is no hope for a user of a lost mobile terminal to recover the lost mobile terminal this function may be usable to lure a finder of the lost mobile terminal into a service center.

In the following description a process for executing the functions described with reference to and a configuration of executing the corresponding function on a display unit of a mobile terminal are explained in detail with reference to .

In assume that the mobile terminal receives a web lock function execution command and that a password inputtable substitute screen is displayed on the touchscreen according to the reception.

Referring to a finder inputs a password to unlock a web lock via the touchscreen of the mobile terminal S .

The controller transmits the inputted password to the relay server to make a request for a web lock cancellation S . In doing so the password information may be encrypted and transmitted for security.

The relay server transmits the received password information to the database server and then queries the database server about a validity check i.e. whether the transmitted password information is identical to a password saved in a database DB S .

Subsequently the database server transmits a password comparison result to the relay server S . The relay server then transmits the password comparison result to the mobile terminal S .

If the controller receives a response indicating that the password is valid from the relay server the controller cancels the web lock function S .

In assume that the mobile terminal receives a web lock function execution command and that a password inputtable substitute screen is displayed on the touchscreen according to the reception.

Referring to a visual effect indicating that a web lock function is executed a password input window for unlocking a web lock and a preset message e.g. user s contact information etc. are displayed on the substitute screen. If the web lock canceling process described with reference to is completed the web lock can be unlocked while a text indicating the web lock cancellation is displayed.

Meanwhile in case that a basic lock is previously set in the mobile terminal the aforementioned substitute screen may be directly displayed by ignoring the basic lock function or may be displayed after cancellation of the basic lock. In this case the basic lock may mean a security function of unlocking by inputting a password or a specific touch pattern set for the mobile terminal itself for the purpose of providing security or preventing touchscreen malfunction before a screen last used by a user or a background screen e.g. a standby screen a home screen etc. is entered.

As mentioned in the foregoing description with reference to in a manner of using a web lock dedicated web password different from a security system e.g. a password set for a terminal a touch pattern set for a terminal etc. of a mobile terminal the password is saved not in the terminal but in the server whereby security can be enhanced. Moreover the password set for the mobile terminal itself may be found through a password search function provided via web API despite that a user fails in memorizing the password. As the preset web password is too simple to be vulnerable to hacking it may be able to change a password via the web API after the loss of the mobile terminal. Besides since a web lock cancellation password is saved not in the mobile terminal but in the database server the terminal may be able to reflect a password changed on web by real time. Since the password comparison result is notified instead of downloading the password to the mobile terminal it may be able to cope with the hacking more effectively.

Referring to if a user selects USB port lock execution via web API a USB port lock execution command is delivered to the mobile terminal from the push server S .

In order to verify validity of the command the mobile terminal queries the relay server about the execution command check S . The relay server then inquires the database server about the execution command validity correspondingly S .

As a result of the check if the command is valid the relay server informs the mobile terminal of the validity S . Subsequently the mobile terminal executes a USB port lock function S and then transmits a corresponding result to the relay server again S .

Referring to assume a USB related menu in a configuration setting menu of general Android OS. Referring to a check box for selecting or canceling a USB debugging function via a prescribed menu depth is displayed on the touchscreen of the mobile terminal. Referring to a check box for selecting or canceling a UMS mass storage function via a prescribed menu depth is displayed on the touchscreen of the mobile terminal. A is able to prevent data exchange via USB port by disabling all functions irrespective of setup statuses of the corresponding functions in case of the loss of the mobile terminal .

In particular ADB is disabled as soon as a USB port lock is executed whereby a file extraction via root authority acquisition i.e. rooting can be prevented. Moreover since ADB command transmission is not available it may be able to basically prevent a finder of the lost mobile terminal from attempting to hack the lost mobile terminal. Moreover UMS is disabled as soon as the USB port lock is executed whereby data of a memory mass storage for user data storage can be protected.

As mentioned in the foregoing description since the present function is executed together with the web lock function it is impossible to enter the configuration setting menu shown in by a substitute screen displayed according to the execution of the web lock function. Therefore it is impossible to arbitrarily cancel the present function in the mobile terminal whereby security can be enhanced.

The present function may be cancelled when the web lock is cancelled. Alternatively the present function may be individually cancelled by a function cancel selection made by a user via web API.

Referring to when a USB port lock is not executed after a mobile terminal has been connected via ADB if an ADB command adb devices for displaying a recognized device is inputted to a computer an identification information of the mobile terminal is displayed . On the contrary when a USB port lock is executed even if a computer and a mobile terminal are physically connected with each other via USB cable since ADB function is disabled nothing is displayed on the computer to indicate that the mobile terminal is not recognized .

In case of UMS when a USB port lock is not executed if a mobile terminal is connected with a computer via USB cable the mobile terminal is recognized as a mobile disk by the computer and internal data are displayed. Yet when the USB port lock is executed an absence of a disk is displayed on the computer .

As mentioned in the foregoing description a sync off function basically prevents personal informations from entering a lost phone by turning off an auto sync function together with an execution of a web lock function. In case that a finder of the lost phone deletes or edits data saved in a mobile terminal by hacking the sync off function may prevent personal information on web from being modified.

Referring to if a user selects a sync off lock execution via web API a sync off execution command is delivered to the mobile terminal from the push server S .

The controller of the mobile terminal executes the sync off function in response to the sync off execution command S and then transmits a corresponding result to the relay server S .

Thereafter even if personal information on a user is updated in the mobile terminal or the database server auto sync is not executed S .

Of course the mobile terminal queries the relay server about the execution command check for the validity verification of the command before executing the sync off function. The relay server inquires the database server about the execution command validity and then feeds back a result of the inquiry to the mobile terminal not shown in the drawing .

Referring to a check box for selecting or canceling an auto sync function via a prescribed menu depth and an input box for inputting a web account information to be synchronized may be displayed. In this case the sync off function disables the auto sync function irrespective of a setup status of the auto sync function at that time of the loss thereby preventing synchronization from being automatically performed.

As mentioned in the foregoing description since the present function is executed together with the web lock function it is impossible to enter the configuration setting menu shown in by a substitute screen displayed according to the execution of the web lock function. Therefore it is impossible to arbitrarily cancel the present function in the mobile terminal whereby security can be enhanced. In doing so if the sync off function is executed a text may be displayed on the substitute screen to indicate this state .

As the aforementioned USB port lock function and the aforementioned sync off function are side functions that can be simultaneously executed although a separate execution command is not delivered if a web lock execution command is received the controller of the mobile terminal may be able to execute at lease one of them in accordance with a setting.

In the following description an SIM data tracking function is explained in detail with reference to .

Since an execution command delivery process and an execution process in are similar to the aforementioned steps S to S their details shall be omitted for clarity of the following description.

Referring to after the SIM data tracking function has been executed if the controller of the mobile terminal recognizes that an SIM card has been changed S the controller may deliver the changed card information to the relay server S .

If a finder of the mobile terminal changes the SIM card the controller transmits a changed SIM card information e.g. a new phone number to a server thereby enabling a new number use log of the lost terminal to keep being tracked. In particular a user of the lost terminal acquires the changed number and then make a phone call to the acquired number to recover the lost mobile terminal. If it is not possible to read the phone number from the changed SIM card the controller may enable a user to estimate the phone number later by reading and transmitting IMSI value.

In the following description an end call tracking function is explained in detail with reference to and . The end call tracking function may be executable together with or separately from a web lock. If the end call tracking function is executed separately since an execution command delivery process and an execution process are similar to the aforementioned steps S to S their details shall be omitted for clarity of the following description.

Referring to after a end call tracking function has been executed if the controller detects an end call i.e. a finder s intentional incoming call rejection independent from a network S the controller transmits call log containing a cause of the end call a sender information a call reception time information and the like to the relay server S . Having completed the transmission of the call log the controller may delete the corresponding call log from the memory to prevent information leakage in the future S . Through this in case that a finder of the mobile terminal intentionally rejects a call the controller informs a user of the mobile terminal of the finder s intentional call rejection to help the user take follow up measures.

Meanwhile as mentioned in the foregoing description if the web lock function is executed the substitute screen is provided and a substitute call screen Call UI may be displayed as well in the event of an incoming call. This is described with reference to as follows.

Referring to after an end call tracking function has been executed if there is an incoming call a substitute call screen Call UI may be displayed on the touchscreen of the mobile terminal . In doing so in order to force a finder of the mobile terminal to answer or reject the incoming call a touch menu is limitedly provided. Moreover even if a phone number of a sender is saved in a phonebook for the sender s information protection the number may be displayed only instead of a name on the phonebook. Of course the phone number of the sender may not be displayed at all .

Referring to when a web lock function is already executed if the controller detects that a password is incorrectly inputted to a password input window displayed on a substitute screen several times over a preset count e.g. 3 S the controller removes the password input window from the substitute screen and may then perform an encryption function S . Thereafter the controller may transmit information indicating that an advanced web lock is executed and information indicating encryption success failure to the relay server S .

Referring to as a web lock function is executed a substitute screen containing a password input window is displayed on the touchscreen of the mobile terminal . If a password in incorrectly inputted preset times an advanced web lock is executed and the password input window disappears from the substitute screen .

Meanwhile only if a slide bar is pushed by a touch drag input within a predetermined region of a substitute screen in opposite direction to prevent malfunction of the touchscreen a password input window may be displayed . In this case as an advanced web lock function is executed referring to if the slide bar is moved to an opposite side by a touch drag input the slide bar may return to its original position instead displaying the password input window.

Meanwhile as mentioned in the foregoing description the advanced web lock function may be disabled if a correct password is inputted to web API. If there is a file deleted by a finder or a file damaged in the course of an encryption canceling process the controller downloads data saved in the server via the auto sync function and may be then able to restore the deleted or damaged file automatically.

In the following description a location tracking function according to the present invention is explained. A location tracking technology proposed by the present invention may be mainly classified into three kinds of methods. According to the 1method a result value is represented in accordance with a type and order of a location tracking technique. According to the 2method a location tracking request made by a user via web is processed more efficiently. According to the 3method a current location is more accurately acquired by verifying validity in accordance with a time of a location tracking result value.

First of all a location tracking method according to the present embodiment may adopt a technique of using a wireless network or a mobile network or a coordinated acquisition technique of using a global positioning system GPS . Generally in case that a location tracking function is performed via the mobile network this may have accuracy lower than that of the GPS using technique. On the contrary although the GPS using technique may have high accuracy if a mobile terminal to be tracked is located in an indoor place and or a GPS shadow region the probability of the coordinated information acquisition failure is high. Hence a method of providing higher success probability and accuracy is required for a location positioning service quality.

To this end according to the present embodiment a terminal is requested to perform the location tracking using both of the two techniques and a corresponding result is displayed on web in accordance with a type and order of information received from the terminal. In particular if a location information using the mobile network is preferentially acquired from the terminal the acquired location information is outputted via web and a reception of a location information using the PGS is then awaited. Thereafter if the location information using the GPS is received the terminal location information outputted to the web is updated. On the contrary if the location information using the GPS is preferentially received the present location tracking procedure may be ended. This is because the location information using the mobile network having a relatively low accuracy is not necessary at the timing point of acquiring the location information using the GPS. In the following description the above described procedure is explained in aspect of mobile terminal servers with reference to .

In illustrates an operation of a mobile terminal and illustrates operations of severs i.e. a push server a web server and a relay server except the mobile terminal.

Referring to if a user inputs a tracking request command via the web server a terminal receives a location tracking command from the push server S . The controller activates the position location module for acquiring a location information via GPS and a related wireless communication module for acquiring a location information via a mobile network in accordance with the received command S . In this case the related wireless communication module for acquiring the location information via the mobile network may include at least one of the mobile communication module the wireless internet module and the short range communication module .

Once the location informations are acquired via the respective acquisition techniques the controller sequentially transmits the acquired location informations to the relay server in order of the acquisitions S to S . In doing so the controller may be able to transmit an identification information indicating the location information acquiring technique e.g. GPS mobile network etc. to the relay server together with the corresponding location information.

Referring to if a user inputs a tracking request command via the web server S the push server transmits a location tracking command to the mobile terminal S . Thereafter if a 1location information is received from the mobile terminal via the relay server S the relay server delivers it to the web server . The web server then enables the 1location information to be displayed on the web terminal of the user S .

In doing so if the 1location information is the location information acquired via GPS the location tracking procedure according to the present method may be ended irrespective of a reception result of a 2location information. If the 1location information is the location information acquired via the mobile network the servers may stand by for a reception of a 2location information from the mobile terminal S .

Thereafter if the 2location information is received from the mobile terminal via the relay server S the relay server delivers it to the web server . And the web server may update a current location of the mobile terminal which is displayed on the web terminal into the 2location information.

Therefore the location tracking using both of the GPS and the mobile network is simultaneously initiated by the above mentioned method. In accordance with the information acquiring technique and the order of the acquired informations a user can be provided with a fast and accurate location tracking result.

First of all a locating tracking method according to the present embodiment relates to a method of processing a location tracking request made by a user via web more efficiently. If a location tracking command transmitted to the mobile terminal via the push server in response to a user s request is lost due to a situation of the mobile terminal located in a shadow region or the like instead of being received by the mobile terminal the corresponding location tracking procedure is not successful. The user having failed in the location tracking frequently attempts the location finding service again. Of course in case of the failure due to a network state a packet loss and the like if a command is retransmitted within predetermined time the probability of success may rise.

Yet in case that the user gives the location tracking command for the reattempt consecutively and persistently it may put considerable load on the server. Therefore according to the present embodiment a repetitive command execution is prevented in a manner that whether to execute a command in the mobile terminal is preferentially checked for location tracking requests that can be regarded as a one time procedure. In particular even if a user consecutively requests N times location trackings via the web server a successful command delivery to the mobile terminal is substantially performed once only thereby reducing overly load put on the server. This is described with reference to as follows.

In in response to a one time request inputted by a user assume that a location tracking command is transmitted to a terminal five times in 10 second interval. Assume that a web server or a push server is set to ignore a user s request repeatedly inputted by a user before completion of 5 location tracking command transmissions 1 or a successful reception of location information from the terminal 2 . In the web server the push server or the relay server may be commonly named a server. And it is apparent to those skilled in the art that a function performed by a server in each step may be handled in a manner of being appropriately assigned in accordance with a function of each of the web server the push server and the relay server .

Referring to a location tracking request made by a user via the web terminal is received by a server S .

In response to the user s request the server transmits a 1location tracking command to the terminal S . In this case the location tracking command may contain an order identifier indicating that the corresponding location tracking command is transmitted for the nth time. If any response is not made by the mobile terminal for 10 seconds after the transmission the server considers that the 1command transmission is not successful and then transmits a 2location tracking command to the terminal S . If any response is not made by the mobile terminal for 10 seconds after the transmission the server considers that the 2command transmission is not successful as well and then transmits a 3location tracking command to the terminal S . If the 3location tracking command is successfully received by the mobile terminal the mobile terminal transmits a response to the server to indicate the successful command reception S . In this case the response may contain an order identifier of the command. When the location tracking command is received if the mobile terminal already acquires valid location information the location information of the mobile terminal may be contained in the response message. If the server receives the response from the mobile terminal the server may cancel the scheduled 4and 5command transmissions S S .

Compared to the method of transmitting the location tracking command as many as a count requested by a user the above described method enables a service load which is put on a server due to a user s request to be efficiently reduced.

First of all the 3method relates to a method of acquiring a more accurate current location by verifying validity in accordance with a time of a location tracking result value. Generally in accordance with features of an operating system if a location information is acquired based on an event e.g. activation of a map application activation of a navigation application etc. for which acquisition of location information is required the corresponding information is saved in the memory for prescribed duration from the location information acquisition. In this situation if a location tracking command is received by the mobile terminal the controller makes a response to the location tracking command with the previously saved location information instead of making a response by newly acquiring a current location information. In particular the information collected and provided by Android API in accordance with a location tracking command may include a location information collected at a previous timing point instead of a location information at a timing point of giving the location tracking command.

Thus since all location informations transmitted in response by the mobile terminal to the server are not always valid informations a location tracking service according to the present invention proposes that the location information is then provided after performing validity verification of location information using time information. In particular the controller compares a timing point of creation of location information retained by the mobile terminal to a current time. If a corresponding time difference is equal to or greater than a prescribed value the controller determines that the corresponding location information is not valid and then controls a new location information to be collected. This is described with reference to as follows.

Subsequently the controller checks whether there is a previously acquired location information S . If there is the previously acquired location information the controller checks a creation timing point of the corresponding location information and then compares a current timing point and the creation timing point with each other S . If a difference between the current timing point and the creation timing point is smaller than a preset value e.g. T minutes the controller transmits the previously saved location information to the server in response to the received location tracking command S .

On the contrary if the difference between the current timing point and the creation timing point is greater than the preset value the controller acquires a location information at a current timing point by activating at least one of the position location module for acquiring a location information via GPS and a related wireless communication module for acquiring a location information via a mobile network S . In this case the related wireless communication module for acquiring the location information via the mobile network may include at least one of the mobile communication module the wireless internet module and the short range communication module .

Once the current location information is secured the controller transmits it to the server in response to the location tracking command S .

By the above described method if the previously created location information is valid it may be able to make a prompt response to the location tracking command. If no it may be able to provide a user with an accurate information at a current timing point.

In the following description audio and video recording functions executable in addition to the aforementioned security providing functions are explained.

First of all the audio and video recording functions may be performed together with or separately from the aforementioned security providing functions. The audio and video recording functions acquire audio and or video around a lost mobile terminal and provide the acquired audio and or video to a user of the lost mobile terminal whereby a recovering rate of the lost mobile terminal can be raised.

Audio recording may be performed via the microphone and video acquisition may be performed via the camera . If such an audio video acquiring function is individually executed it can be performed in the mobile terminal by the aforementioned execution command delivering procedure. And the audio video acquiring function can be automatically executed when such a security function as a web lock and the like is executed. The audio video recording may be performed by periods. The audio video recording may be performed by real time if there is a user s instruction via web API. The audio video recording may be performed based on an event. The event based execution may mean that the audio video recording is performed when a lost mobile terminal is in a specific state. This is a sort of a method for acquiring audio or video efficiently. For instance after a web lock has been executed if a finder of a lost mobile terminal inputs a password onto a substitute screen the controller may have high possibility of photographing a face of the finder in a manner of acquiring an image or video via the camera provided to the front side of the body of the mobile terminal as shown in . For another instance when a remote alarm function is executed since it is highly probable that a finder may look at the mobile terminal in response to the sound generated from the mobile terminal the controller may control the camera to perform photographing as well. For further instance while there is an incoming call the controller may control the camera to perform photographing as well.

Besides when the position location module is active if the mobile terminal enters a predetermined location or a location of the mobile terminal moves over a predetermined range the audio video recording may be performed. Thus the data of the audio video recording may be transmitted to the relay sever so as to be checked by a user via the web terminal .

In the following description identification information for further raising security in the course of performing all the aforementioned security providing functions is explained.

First of all the present invention proposes IMEI international mobile equipment identity to be used as information for identifying a mobile terminal in the course of performing the aforementioned functions. The IMEI is an internationally identifiable unique number currently given to every mobile terminal belonging to CSM WCDMA network. And equipments of the corresponding specifications are requested to have the IMEI installed thereon. Therefore if such an abnormal situation as a theft a loss and the like takes place a corresponding device can be identified cut off using the IMEI. As the IMEI is the information for uniquely identifying a hardware it is not the information arbitrarily replaceable unlike SIM card. Of course although the IMEI is checkable modifiable copyable somehow statutory regulations apply to the check modification copy it may have considerable security as an identifier given to a terminal.

Therefore the IMEI may be able to play a role as an identifier for identifying a mobile terminal in exchanging the informations between the mobile terminal and the servers. Moreover instead of directly using IMEI it may be able to create a unique identifier in a manner of encryption by creating a protected key value using IMEI. In particular the created unique identifier may be applicable to a providing of a lock function in case of a loss a mobile terminal protection function in 3G Wi Fi environment a protection of a preloaded and cached identifier and account information and the like.

Besides in case that a service is performed with an identifier using a phone number by application of IMEI it may be free from influence due to detachment change of SIM. And the IMEI application may have security advantage stronger than MAC address relatively vulnerable to change modification. Moreover if a blacklist containing IMEIs of reported mobile terminals is shared between related organizations when distribution of terminals and IMEI informations increases legally illegally IMEI may work as a key to reveal theft and illegal use.

According to the above described embodiments the execution command transmitted from the web server to the mobile terminal via the push server may differ in format or content in accordance with a function to be executed in the mobile terminal via the execution command. And a plurality of functions may be executed by a single execution command. And program codes for performing the aforementioned functions may be installed on the mobile terminal by being downloaded via web. Moreover program codes for performing the aforementioned functions may be basically loaded in the memory of the mobile terminal. In this case the memory may include such a general storage medium which is used for OS or application data storage of a mobile terminal as a memory card or such a special memory for storing BIOS or firmware.

Although there is a difference in accordance with an operating system more or less the aforementioned security providing functions may frequently request a highest authority e.g. root authority in case of Android OS accessible to a system file and the highest authority may not be given to a general user. In this case since the highest authority is not given to an application installed by download when a program code is installed by download some functions may be restricted. Hence it may be preferable that the aforementioned security providing functions are basically loaded on a mobile terminal by a manufacturer of the mobile terminal.
