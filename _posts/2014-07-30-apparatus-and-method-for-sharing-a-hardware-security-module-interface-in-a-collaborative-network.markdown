title: Apparatus and method for sharing a hardware security module interface in a collaborative network
abstract: A first communication device having a secure access to a security module establishes a collaborative network by forming a collaborative security association with a second communication device associated with a user of the first communication device. The first communication device (a) sends an advertisement of services associated with the security module to the second communication device and receives an advertisement response from the second communication device or (b) receives a solicitation request for services associated with the security module from the second communication device. Responsive to receiving one of the advertisement response and the solicitation request, the first communication device determines whether the second communication device is authorized to access the security module. The first communication device processes and forwards security service messages between the second communication device and the security module, in response to determining that the second communication device is authorized to access the security module.

A collaborative network is a network with sufficient security mechanism such that each device connected to the collaborative network may be trusted by each of the other devices connected to the collaborative network. The level of security required to obtain such trust may vary from deployment to deployment. To participate in the collaborative network a communication device may maintain a security association of sufficient strength with at least one other communication device in the collaborative network. The strength of the security association can be considered sufficient when each of these devices conforms to a predefined security policy. For example the security policy may specify devices can only collaborate with each other if they are under the control of a single user. Another example a device may join a collaborative network if the network security implemented by the device uses FIPS specified cryptographic algorithms. Communication devices in the collaborative network may share resources with each other due to the trust provided by the security associations between the devices participating in the collaborative network and communication devices in the collaborative network may treat each other like separate processors on a multiprocessor system. Typically all the communication devices in a collaborative network are under the control of a single user. Accordingly the communication devices associated with a single user may be organized into a collaborative and secured local or personal area network PAN around the single user.

The collaborative network may be established by using a pairing protocol. Example of these protocols may include but are not limited to protocols over wireless communication links e.g. Near Field Communication NFC Bluetooth WiFi LTE etc. but also to wired communication link e.g. LAN WAN etc. During a pairing process when the separation between the communication devices being paired is within a predefined distance the communication devices may establish a security association for example by exchanging authentication keys or other credentials via a near field communication NFC interface. It is well known that a credential may include a digital certificate an identity assertion or a PIN password or other shared secret. The term authentication key as used herein is considered to include any data key or credential that is used to establish a security association between two or more nodes. It is well known that in addition to authentication keys other types of keys are used to protect data from modification or eavesdropping. These are some times known as encryption key. As used herein the term key when unqualified by the word authentication refers to both authentication keys as well as encryption keys. The authentication key exchanges may be through in band or out of band channels meaning that the key or credential exchange may occur on the same link that will be used for the collaborative network or on a different link. Subsequent to exchanging the authentication keys the communication devices may also become paired according to a pairing standard such as Bluetooth. In addition to being paired according to a pairing standard the communication devices may also perform certificate based authentication wherein the communications devices may exchange digital certificates. The certificates may include attributes indicating specific domain policy and or role associated with the devices.

Each communication device in the collaborative network may include a set of security features. Non limiting examples of these features may include the following list access to a Hardware Security Module HSM ability to perform cryptographic operations e.g. encryption decryption producing digital signature verifying digital signature using a specialized set of cryptographic algorithms e.g. Suite B algorithms access to a secured time source ability to provide secured and tamper proofed data protection and storage . When these communication devices are equipped with an HSM and capable of performing one or more of the additional listed security features these devices are referred to herein as high assurance devices. The specialized set of encryption cryptographic algorithms data protection and storage features included in high assurance devices are referred to herein as being at or above a predefined threshold. When a device performs certain network transactions such as authentication using the HSM or the specialized set of cryptographic functions described above the transaction is said to be occurring at a high assurance level. For example when a device uses the HSM or the specialized cryptographic functions to perform authentication the device is said to be performing high assurance authentication. On the other hand communication devices in the collaborative network that do not support the specialized set of encryption cryptographic algorithms data protection and storage features that are present in a high assurance device are referred to herein as low assurance devices. A non limiting example of a high assurance device may include a portable radio that interfaces with a hardware security module HSM . The HSM is a physical tamper resistant computing device that is configured to safeguard and manage digital keys for authentication and provide cryptographic processing such as encryption decryption digital signing and digital signature verification. A communications device may have an HSM that permanently built into the communications device such as is the case when an HSM chip that is soldered onto the communications device mother board or when the HSM is built into the communications device microprocessor. The HSM may also be external to the communications device for example when the communications devices is able to access the HSM via a secured network or when the HSM is a plug in card or an external device that attaches directly to a communication device. Another non limiting example of a high assurance device may be a communication device with a smart card that can execute Suite B cryptographic algorithms using 384 bit or 512 bit elliptic curve cryptography ECC algorithms and Advanced Encryption Standard AES AES 256 and that can perform robust authentication. Non limiting examples of low assurance devices may include personal devices such as a consumer grade cellphone smartphone personal digital assistance or digital glasses. It is unlikely and uneconomical for a low assurance device to include for example its own HSM. Nevertheless there may be a need to conduct high assurance transactions on applications being executed on the low assurance device.

One goal of a collaborative network is for the communication devices in the network to share resources in order to fulfill requests made by the user. For example the communication devices in the PAN may share wireless interfaces and storage. It may also be desirable to have the communication devices share security features. For example it may be desirable to have a low assurance device in a collaborative network access an HSM associated with a high assurance device in the collaborative network. In so doing the user may be enabled to access an application or services requiring high assurance authentication via the high assurance device associated with the HSM and the user may use credentials stored on the HSM when accessing the application or services from the low assurance device. In another example it may also be desirable to have a low assurance device in the collaborative network stores its login credentials on the HSM of a high assurance device.

Accordingly there is a need for an apparatus and method for sharing a security module in a collaborative network. The term security module may refer to a hardware security module HSM or to software security module preforming the same or similar functions.

Skilled artisans will appreciate that elements in the figures are illustrated for simplicity and clarity and have not necessarily been drawn to scale. For example the dimensions of some of the elements in the figures may be exaggerated relative to other elements to help to improve understanding of embodiments of the present invention.

The apparatus and method components have been represented where appropriate by conventional symbols in the drawings showing only those specific details that are pertinent to understanding the embodiments of the present invention so as not to obscure the disclosure with details that will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of the description herein.

Some embodiments are directed to methods and apparatus for sharing a security module between communication devices. A first communication device having a secure access to the security module establishes a collaborative network by forming a collaborative security association with a second communication device associated with a user of the first communication device. The first communication device a sends an advertisement of services associated with the security module to the second communication device and receives an advertisement response from the second communication device or b receives a solicitation request for services associated with the security module from the second communication device. Responsive to receiving one of the advertisement response and the solicitation request the first communication device determines whether the second communication device is authorized to access the security module. The first communication device processes and forwards security service messages between the second communication device and the security module in response to determining that the second communication device is authorized to access the security module.

Each communication device may include a set of security features wherein the security features included in for example communication device may or may not be included in for example communication devices . Consider for example that communication device has a collaborative security association with for example a hardware security module HSM device and that communication device also has collaborative security associations as shown by lines with each of communication devices . The association between communication device and HSM device may be via a collaborative security association as shown by line between the devices or communication device may have direct access to HSM device . For example HSM device may be included in communication device and HSM device and communication device may be connected via an internal communication bus. In another example HSM device and communication device may be connected via a separate internet protocol IP network that does not include communication devices . Therefore although communication devices form a collaborative network communication device may have exclusive connectivity to HSM device . It should be noted that although shows a connection between a communication device and an HSM device the discussion herein may be applicable to a connection between any security module and a communication device in a collaborative network.

In an embodiment the device in this case communication device with access to the HSM service offered by HSM device may advertise the HSM service to other communication devices i.e. communication devices in collaborative network . Only communication devices i.e. communication devices connected to collaborative network may receive the advertisements sent by communication device . In another embodiment one or more of communication devices seeking the HSM service referred to herein as a requestor communication device may solicit information about existing HSM services offered on network without necessarily waiting for an advertisement from the communication device with access to the HSM service.

The service advertisement sent by communication device may provide for example the information about the capabilities of HSM device access restrictions associated with accessing HSM device a list of the types of credential which may be used by requestor communication devices the list of access restrictions associated with each of those credentials. Non limiting examples of the advertised capabilities of HSM device may include cryptographic algorithms and domain parameters available on the HSM device message digest algorithms available on HSM device cryptographic operations carried out by HSM device types of cryptographic application programming interfaces APIs available for accessing the service on HSM device levels of the Federal Information Processing Standards FIPS used on HSM device hardware acceleration for specific algorithms and operations modes of connection between the HSM device and a requestor communication device and a list of credentials which can be shared and the list of applications which are authorized to use each of those credentials.

In one embodiment the services advertised in a service advertisement or requested in a solicitation requested may be indicated by specifying a trust anchor certificate authority. For example a solicitation request may include an identity of a trust anchor TA for which the requestor is attempting to validate a certificate subordinate to the specified TA or when the requestors is attempting to be validated by another entity that inherently trusts the specified TA. A trust anchor TA is a well known concept where the TA is a special CA which is inherently trusted by any node that has been preconfigured to use the special CA as a TA. Also certificates issued by other CAs subordinate to a TA may also be trusted by any node which uses the special CA as a TA. A node may support many TAs. The service advertisement may also include the identity of one or more TAs trusted by the advertiser. In one embodiment the inclusion of the identity of a TA in a service advertisement means that the advertiser is able to validate any certificates issued by the TA or CAs subordinate to the TA. In one embodiment the inclusion of a TA in a service advertisement means the advertiser has a certificate with itself identified as the certificate subject which was issued by the TA or a CA subordinate to the TA.

Non limiting examples of the cryptographic algorithms and domain parameters that may be used on HSM device may include an advance encryption standard AES AES 256 domain parameters of an Elliptic Curve Cryptography domain parameters an encryption and authentication algorithm such as RSA 2048 and an elliptic curve digital signature algorithm ECDSA . Non limiting examples of message digest algorithms that may be used on HSM device may include a set of cryptographic hash functions such as MD5 SHA 1 and SHA 2. Non limiting examples of cryptographic operations that may be carried out on HSM device may be encryption decryption signing signature verification message digest key generation key derivation function and random number generation. Non limiting examples of a type of cryptographic APIs that may be used on HSM device may include PKCS11 MS CAPI Microsoft Cryptographic API or vendor specific APIs. PKCS11 APIs are platform independent APIs that provide an abstraction layer for use with cryptographic tokens such as a hardware security module or a smart card. Examples of PKCS11 APIs include C GenerateKeyPair C SignInit C SignFinal C DecryptFinal C EncryptFinal among others. Examples of levels of FIPS 140 may include level 2 and level 3. Examples of the modes of connection that may exist between HSM and a requestor communication device may include a tunnel or a proxy mode of connection both connection modes are described in detail below.

The access restrictions advertised by device may specify requirements and constraints for acquiring the HSM service from HSM device . These restrictions may be constraints and requirements set forth by the HSM device device or both of the HSM Device and device . The requirements and constraints may be based on one or more criteria. For example the requirements and constraints may be based on one or more of a device type for example whether or not a portable radio or mobile device terminal is allowed to access the service device capabilities e.g. whether or not the requestor communication device is equipped with user interfaces non limiting examples of user interface may include physical virtual keyboard keypad display voice prompts level of assurance for example whether or not the requestor communication device with a low assurance device or a high assurance device is allowed access one or a combination of field parameters and or values in a certificate of the requestor communication device and or a certificate chain of a certificate authority CA certificate of the requestor communication device. In one example the requirements and constraints may be based on one or more of a subject issuer distinguished name DN an expiration date i.e. a date not before and or not after a set date a certificate policy CP object identifier OID extension and key usage extension. In an example where the requirements and constraints are based on the CP OID communication device may allow a requestor communication device with a CP OID indicating the requestor communication device is a field commander or that the requestor communication device and communication device are part of the same organization to access to HSM device . Service advertisements may also include the set of trust anchors present on communication device for instance. So communication devices using the HSM for example communication device may not need to perform a CPU intensive operation of validating a certificate chain of a relying party that has as its trust anchor one of the trust anchors in HSM device

One or more of communication devices may request access to HSM device when the communication device is capable of satisfying the requirements advertised by communication device . For example device may request access to HSM device when communication device is capable of satisfying the requirements advertised by communication device . Accordingly in response to the advertisement from communication device communication device may transmit an advertisement response to communication device . In an embodiment prior to receiving the advertisement communication device may transmit a service solicitation request to communication device . The service solicitation request and or the advertisement response both of which are referred to herein as a service solicitation may include for example one or more of a credentials that communication device intends to use for authenticating itself to HSM device to communication device or to both HSM device and device a preferred mode of connection for connecting communication device to HSM device and an application identifier for indicating which application in communication device will use the HSM service. Non limiting examples of credentials may include digital certificate public key username password SAML ID assertions hostname FQDN or any combination of those. Non limiting example of application identifiers may include application name application OID version fingerprint digital signature. The service solicitation may also include one or more of HSM capabilities required by communication device HSM capabilities that are optional for communication device the type of device requiring the HSM service i.e. the device type of communication device the level of assurance of communication device the authorization privileges of communication device and a list of credentials which are required by communication device and or a list of authorized applications associated with each of those credentials. The authorization level of device may indicate that device is authorized to access top secret secret confidential restricted or classified contents. The list of device credential may include device certificate issued by government private agencies or the device manufacturer. It may also include a device public key. The list of applications at device which require the HSM service may include voice encoder decoder IPSec client server TLS client server. A device type of communication device may include but not limited to Bluetooth headset mobile data terminal portable radio with no display smartphone. Depending on the policy of device HSM and or device the advertisement message from device may state that the source of activation data for HSM device should be from the communication device using HSM device . For example if device is requesting a high assurance key from HSM device the user may be prompted on communication device to enter the activation data for example a PIN . If communication device does not have user interface mechanism e.g. keyboard or display the user may be prompted to enter the activation data on communication device instead. This provides additional confirmation that communication device is part of the collaborative network associated with the particular user.

If communication device can fulfill the requirements specified by communication device in the service solicitation communication device may transmit a solicitation response responsive to the service solicitation. The solicitation response may include a list of credentials which can be used by communication device and more particularly an application on communication device authorized to access the HSM device

To share the HSM service among communication devices based on the service solicitation communication device may establish an HSM session with HSM device . For example if subsequent to receiving the service solicitation communication device does not have an existing HSM session with HSM device communication device may initiate a new HSM session with HSM device . Device uses information included in the service solicitation to determine if a request from device can be associated with an existing HSM session between device and the HSM device . For example communications device may be providing HSM based services to communications device when it receives a solicitation request from communications device . Based on preconfigured policy at device or the HSM communications device may determine that a new HSM session is required or that new activation data is required to allow device to have access to the HSM device . When communication device is establishing an HSM session with HSM device communication device may verify that the credentials used by communication device in establishing the collaborative security association are appropriate for accessing HSM device . Communication device may obtain the credentials for communication device from another device for example communication device . Communication device may also use a cache credentials for device

Alternatively or in addition to verifying the credentials for communication device HSM device may request that communication device provide information to authenticate that communication device has access to activation data for example a PIN associated with the required credentials in the HSM device . In responding to HSM device s activation data inquiry communication device may use its cached activation data. The cached activation data may be stored locally at device or at remote location. Alternatively if communication device cannot obtain valid activation data from its cache storage communication device may prompt the user for the activation data. When communication device obtains the activation data from the user communication device can store the activation data in its cache storage. Communication device may use HSM device activation data policy to cache or discard the activation data. The caching policy may also have constraints governing a caching validity period and or the period the HSM service may remain available before new activation data is required. In one embodiment device uses a table lookup to determine if a key has already been activated thus it is associated with an HSM session or the activation data associated with a key identifier is still valid. In one embodiment the table may include a list of key identifiers its corresponding HSM session identifiers and the caching validity period for each of the session and or key identifiers. Non limiting examples of key identifier may include a unique key name label hash of the key expiration date. Non limiting example of an HSM session identifier may include a unique session name label expiration period HSM hostname FQDN IP address MAC address PCI bus address serial number or combination of those.

In one embodiment communication device may verify whether or not a key requested by communication device has been activated. In this disclosure the term activating a key means that the key is available for use in crypto operations. The typical way to activate a key is for the user to provide a PIN a password or a pass phrase. If the key has been activated communication device knows there is an existing HSM session for that key. In this scenario communication device performs the crypto operation requested by device using the existing session.

If subsequent to receiving the service solicitation communication device has an existing HSM session with HSM device communication device may verify whether the existing HSM session attributes are suitable for fulfilling the request from communication device . The HSM session attributes may specify the mode of connection i.e. tunnel or proxy between communication device and HSM device and for the tunnel connection mode the user of the connection identified by the credential of communication device . If the existing HSM session attributes are unsuitable for proxy mode communication device may modify the existing HSM session attributes to fulfill the request from communication device . If the existing HSM session attributes are suitable to fulfill the request from communication device communication device use the existing HSM session attributes. Note that in tunnel mode a new HSM session is established as discussed in more detail below because the new HSM session is between HSM device and the communication device using the HSM for example communication device . When verifying the requested HSM session attributes against an existing HSM session attributes device may use an HSM session attribute matching policy. The policy may specify that a request can be fulfilled by an existing HSM session attributes if the value of the requested attributes matches with and or within the range of a value specified in the policy. Non limiting example of HSM session attributes include type of connection i.e. tunnel or proxy mode identifiers of user of the HSM session. Non limiting examples of identifiers of user of the session include device or application Distinguished Name name OID serial number device certificate device IP address MAC address device hostname FQDN.

In the proxy connection mode communication device may facilitate the connection between a requestor communication device such as communication device and HSM device . Thus in the proxy connection mode communication device may not have an end to end HSM session with the HSM device . Instead an independent HSM proxy session may exist between communication device and communication device and an independent HSM session or direct connection may exist between communication device and HSM device . The HSM proxy session between communication device and communication device may be secured via a collaborative security association and the HSM session between communication device and HSM device may be via a local interface or via a networked security association. Non limiting examples of protocols for forming a security association include TLS SSL IPSec other security protocols that provide any or a combination of data integrity authenticitication and message privacy .

In the proxy connection mode communication device forwards messages from communication device to the HSM device . In the proxy connection mode communication device enforces access control for keys to be used by the requestor communication device in this case communication device . In an embodiment communication device may use an access control table to control access to a key identifier requested by communication device or more specifically an application hosted in communication device . The table may include rules for allowing one or more communication devices to access specific keys specifying which applications can access which keys specifying which applications can perform which crypto operations specifying if keys can be shared with different devices for how many devices and which devices. In this connection mode communication device encapsulates the information from communication device and all cryptographic operations initiated by and for communication device are proxied by communication device i.e. the cryptographic operations are sent to and from HSM device via communication device . In this connection mode device may hide details of APIs used in the HSM session. Instead device may provide device with a simplified APIs for accessing the HSM service at HSM device . In this embodiment device may translate the API calls understood by device into the API calls understood by the HSM device . Device may also translate the API calls understood by device HSM device into the API calls understood by device

Messages of cryptographic operations between communication device and HSM device may be deciphered by communication device . Having communication device decipher cryptographic operation messages between communication device and HSM device may not be a concern because all of the collaborative communication devices in network are associated with the same user. Therefore in the proxy connection mode the keys provided to HSM device by communication device may appear to HSM device to belong to communication device . Activation data for the keys in HSM device may be known to communication device and may not be known to the requestor communication device that is communication device .

In the tunnel connection mode a requestor communication device such as communication device establishes an independent HSM session with HSM device . In other words the HSM session between communication device and HSM device is independent of the HSM session between communication device and HSM device . The HSM session between device and HSM device is known as HSM session and the HSM session between device and HSM device is known as HSM tunnel session. As noted previously in the service solicitation the requestor communication device that is communication device may indicate the mode of connection. If the tunnel mode is requested by the requestor communication device and communication device cannot support the requested tunnel mode the requestor communication device may choose to not use the HSM service provided via communication device . Consider for example that in addition to communication device a second communication device not shown also has access to HSM services provided either by HSM device or by a second HSM device not shown . If in response to the service solicitation from communication device communication device indicates that it does not support the requested tunnel mode and the second communication device indicates that it supports the requested tunnel connection mode communication device may choose to access the HSM service via the second communication device.

If communication device supports the tunnel connection mode communication device may introduce communication device to HSM device in order for a separate HSM tunnel session to be established between HSM device and communication device . In one embodiment device introduces device to HSM device by identifying device as the endpoint of the HSM tunnel session for a tunnel connection to an HSM device . In the request device may include device identity credentials the collaboration security association attributes of device and device and device capability. Non limiting examples of collaboration security association attributes include level of assurance validity or refresh period and security protocols for establishing the collaboration security association. Non limiting examples of device capabilities include an input unit e.g. keypad pointing device etc. an output transducer unit e.g. speaker an input transducer unit e.g. a microphone MIC and a display screen. Non limiting examples of device identity include Distinguished Name name network address FQDN hostname device serial number device s key identifier. In one embodiment device and HSM device may be able to establish a HSM tunnel session directly. In another embodiment device may assist device and HSM device to establish a HSM tunnel session. In assisting device and HSM device to establish a HSM tunnel session device may provide device and HSM device with a one time pre shared key or a short lived security token which can be used by device and HSM device to establish a HSM tunnel session. Non limiting example of security tokens may include a SAML OAuth or openID token Accordingly in the tunnel connection mode communication device may have an end to end HSM tunnel session with HSM device that does not include communication device as an intermediary that is while communication device may be in a path between communication devices and HSM device communication device does not serve as an endpoint of an HSM tunnel with either device. The HSM tunnel session between HSM device and communication device may be secured via for example transport layer security secure sockets layer TLS SSL Internet Protocol security IPSec or another application layer security association.

In the tunnel connection mode communication device may forward route cryptographic API calls from communication device to HSM device . The cryptographic API traffic between communication device and HSM device may be private after the tunnel is setup between HSM device and communication device . In this case communication device may be unable to decipher cryptographic API traffic between communication device and HSM device . HSM device may enforce access control for keys to be used by collaborative devices. From the point of view of HSM device keys in the HSM device may belong to either communication device or communication device . When communication device creates a new key communication device may specify the access control for that key. The activation data for the key may be generated by communication device or it may be inputted by the user into communication device . In both cases the activation data may be used to activate the key at HSM device and the activation data for that key may be known to only communication device . At the same time HSM device may provide device with a deactivation data. The deactivation data may be used to deactivate the key for communication device and close the session associated with that key. For example when the collaboration link between communication device and communication device is terminated communication device may use a deactivation data authorized by HSM device to deactivate the key associated with communication device . At a subsequent period when communication device and communication device reestablish the HSM tunnel session if previously created keys are still valid communication device may use the activation data to reactivate the key. Non limiting example of activation and deactivation data may include but not limited to PIN password pass phrase SAML OAuth or OpenID tokens.

In tunnel and proxy modes communication device may use HSM device for its own purposes. For instance communication device may store the private key of the certificate it uses to authenticate itself to a relying party in HSM device . Communication device may then use HSM device to sign messages to the relying party in order to authenticate itself. The signing operation can be done in HSM device . Another example may involve communication device using its private key stored in HSM device to decrypt a message it received from a relying party.

In one embodiment upon communication device successfully authenticating itself to HSM device communication device may include an indication of the presence of HSM device in its own service advertisement in the collaborative network. This would be useful in a collaborative network that has a multi hop topology.

In both the proxy and tunnel modes when device no longer needs the service provided by HSM device device may inform device or HSM device that device no longer needs the service of HSM device . When device no longer need the HSM proxy session device may indicate to the HSM device whether to delete or deactivate keys that are used by device . When device no longer need the HSM tunnel session device may indicate to HSM device whether to delete or keep keys that are used by device

The transceivers may be coupled to a combined modulator demodulator that is coupled to the encoder decoder .

Moreover an embodiment can be implemented as a computer readable storage medium having computer readable code stored thereon for programming a computer e.g. comprising a processor to perform a method as described and claimed herein. Examples of such computer readable storage mediums include but are not limited to a hard disk a CD ROM an optical storage device a magnetic storage device a ROM Read Only Memory a PROM Programmable Read Only Memory an EPROM Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory an EEPROM Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory and a Flash memory. Further it is expected that one of ordinary skill notwithstanding possibly significant effort and many design choices motivated by for example available time current technology and economic considerations when guided by the concepts and principles disclosed herein will be readily capable of generating such software instructions and programs and ICs with minimal experimentation.

The Abstract of the Disclosure is provided to allow the reader to quickly ascertain the nature of the technical disclosure. It is submitted with the understanding that it will not be used to interpret or limit the scope or meaning of the claims. In addition in the foregoing Detailed Description it can be seen that various features are grouped together in various embodiments for the purpose of streamlining the disclosure. This method of disclosure is not to be interpreted as reflecting an intention that the claimed embodiments require more features than are expressly recited in each claim. Rather as the following claims reflect inventive subject matter lies in less than all features of a single disclosed embodiment. Thus the following claims are hereby incorporated into the Detailed Description with each claim standing on its own as a separately claimed subject matter.
