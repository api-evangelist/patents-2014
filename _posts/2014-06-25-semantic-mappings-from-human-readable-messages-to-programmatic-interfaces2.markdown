The present application for patent claims priority to Provisional Application No. 61 839 822 entitled SEMANTIC MAPPINGS FROM HUMAN READABLE MESSAGES TO M2M INTERFACES filed Jun. 26 2013 by the same inventors as the subject application assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

The Internet is a global system of interconnected computers and computer networks that use a standard Internet protocol suite e.g. the Transmission Control Protocol TCP and Internet Protocol IP to communicate with each other. The Internet of Things IoT is based on the idea that everyday objects not just computers and computer networks can be readable recognizable locatable addressable and controllable via an IoT communications network e.g. an ad hoc system or the Internet .

A number of market trends are driving development of IoT devices. For example increasing energy costs are driving governments strategic investments in smart grids and support for future consumption such as for electric vehicles and public charging stations. Increasing health care costs and aging populations are driving development for remote connected health care and fitness services. A technological revolution in the home is driving development for new smart services including consolidation by service providers marketing N play e.g. data voice video security energy management etc. and expanding home networks. Buildings are getting smarter and more convenient as a means to reduce operational costs for enterprise facilities.

There are a number of key applications for the IoT. For example in the area of smart grids and energy management utility companies can optimize delivery of energy to homes and businesses while customers can better manage energy usage. In the area of home and building automation smart homes and buildings can have centralized control over virtually any device or system in the home or office from appliances to plug in electric vehicle PEV security systems. In the field of asset tracking enterprises hospitals factories and other large organizations can accurately track the locations of high value equipment patients vehicles and so on. In the area of health and wellness doctors can remotely monitor patients health while people can track the progress of fitness routines.

As such in the near future increasing development in IoT technologies will lead to numerous IoT devices surrounding a user at home in vehicles at work and many other locations. However despite the fact that IoT capable devices can provide substantial real time information about the environment surrounding a user e.g. likes choices habits device conditions and usage patterns etc. it can be relatively difficult to control different IoT devices from a single application because each IoT device has its own properties and actions that may be unique to the IoT device.

In general one implementation of the subject matter disclosed herein is directed to a method apparatus and computer readable storage medium having computer executable instructions recorded thereon that maps human readable information from an Internet of Things IoT device to a programmatic interface. The human readable information includes at least one of text video audio haptics and images.

One or more implementations of the technology described herein include a method of mapping data from an Internet of Things IoT device to a programmatic interface. The IoT device is configured to communicate using human readable information. The method comprises observing at a computing device a human readable indication of a presence of the IoT device wherein the IoT device includes associated information. In response to observing the human readable indication of the presence of the IoT device the method operates by assigning an agreed upon semantic tag to the associated information and enabling the agreed upon semantic tag to be used to control the IoT device.

In one or more implementations observing the human readable indication of a presence of the IoT device includes observing a presence broadcast by the IoT device wherein the broadcast is human readable. Observing the human readable indication of a presence of the IoT device includes observing the human readable indication of a presence of the IoT device at a user interface at an application layer interface and or at a presentation layer interface.

In one or more implementations assigning the agreed upon semantic tag to the associated information includes assigning the agreed upon semantic tag to a remotely exposed property of the IoT device. In one or more implementations assigning the agreed upon semantic tag to the associated information includes assigning the agreed upon semantic tag to a remotely exposed property of the IoT device.

In one or more implementations in response to observing the human readable indication of the presence of the IoT device mapping a user interface for the IoT device to a programmatic interface.

In one or more implementations of the technology described herein an apparatus for mapping data from an Internet of Things IoT device to a programmatic interface comprises logic that is configured to observe a human readable indication of a presence of the IoT device. The logic that is configured to observe a human readable indication of a presence of the IoT device includes associated information. The apparatus also includes logic that is configured to in response to observing the human readable indication of the presence of the IoT device assign an agreed upon semantic tag to the associated information. The apparatus also includes logic that is configured to enable the agreed upon semantic tag to be used to control the IoT device.

In one or more implementations of the technology described herein a computer readable storage medium includes data that when accessed by a machine cause the machine to perform operations comprising observing at a computing device a human readable indication of a presence of the IoT device wherein the IoT device includes associated information.

In one or more implementations a property associated with the IoT device is a user interface element. The user interface element associated with the IoT device is at least one of a switch and a radio button.

Above is a simplified Summary relating to one or more implementations described herein. As such the Summary should not be considered an extensive overview relating to all contemplated aspects and or implementations nor should the Summary be regarded to identify key or critical elements relating to all contemplated aspects and or implementations or to delineate the scope associated with any particular aspect and or implementation. Accordingly the Summary has the sole purpose of presenting certain concepts relating to one or more aspects and or implementations relating to the mechanisms disclosed herein in a simplified form to precede the detailed description presented below.

In one or more implementations user readable text broadcast by an Internet of Things device is mapped to semantic tags or other semantic data that has meaning in an Internet of Things environment. In one or more implementations a peer to peer P2P service module allows associated IoT devices to broadcast their presence in a manner that is not meant to be understood by a computer. Instead the broadcasts are meant to be displayed to the user understood by the user and meaningful to the user on the IoT device for example in the form of human readable communications such as text images video audio haptics and the like. That is the computer may not understand what is being broadcast by the IoT devices because the broadcasts do not have message codes or the kind of identification that messages typically utilize in machine to machine and or programmatic communication.

As used herein the term semantic tags is any type of information that can be easily parsed and understood by a computing device. In general a semantic tag is agreed upon between the communication parties. As an example the string CYCLE DONE might be a pre agreed upon semantic tag indicating that a washing machine has finished its cycle. As such home appliances may be pre programmed to respond to a message with the specific string of bytes CYCLE DONE. However the string Your washing machine has finished its cycle is an English text which since it has not been predefined and pre agreed upon is only comprehensible to a human. A computing device will generally not be programmed to respond to messages with the string Your washing machine has finished its cycle. Implementations of the technology described herein translate human readable strings into predefined or pre agreed upon semantic tags.

As used herein the term Internet of Things device or IoT device may refer to any object e.g. an appliance a sensor etc. that has an addressable interface e.g. an Internet protocol IP address a Bluetooth identifier ID a near field communication NFC ID etc. and can transmit information to one or more other devices over a wired or wireless connection. An IoT device may have a passive communication interface such as a quick response QR code a radio frequency identification RFID tag an NFC tag or the like or an active communication interface such as a modem a transceiver a transmitter receiver or the like.

An IoT device can have a particular set of attributes and or properties e.g. a device state or status such as whether the IoT device is on or off open or closed idle or active available for task execution or busy and so on a cooling or heating function an environmental monitoring or recording function a light emitting function a sound emitting function etc. that can be embedded in and or controlled monitored by a central processing unit CPU microprocessor ASIC or the like and configured for connection to an IoT network such as a local ad hoc network or the Internet. For example IoT devices may include but are not limited to refrigerators toasters ovens microwaves freezers dishwashers dishes hand tools clothes washers clothes dryers furnaces air conditioners thermostats televisions light fixtures vacuum cleaners sprinklers electricity meters gas meters etc. so long as the devices are equipped with an addressable communications interface for communicating with the IoT network.

IoT devices may also include cell phones desktop computers laptop computers tablet computers personal digital assistants PDAs etc. Accordingly the IoT network may be comprised of a combination of legacy Internet accessible devices e.g. laptop or desktop computers cell phones etc. in addition to devices that do not typically have Internet connectivity e.g. dishwashers etc. .

Referring to IoT devices are configured to communicate with an access network e.g. an access point over a physical communications interface or layer shown in as air interface and a direct wired connection . The air interface can comply with a wireless Internet protocol IP such as IEEE 802.11. Although illustrates IoT devices communicating over the air interface and IoT device communicating over the wired connection each IoT device may communicate over a wired or wireless connection or both.

The Internet includes a number of routing agents and processing agents not shown in for the sake of convenience . The Internet is a global system of interconnected computers and computer networks that uses a standard Internet protocol suite e.g. the Transmission Control Protocol TCP and IP to communicate among disparate devices networks. TCP IP provides end to end connectivity specifying how data should be formatted addressed transmitted routed and received at the destination.

In a computer such as a desktop or personal computer PC is shown as connecting to the Internet directly e.g. over an Ethernet connection or Wi Fi or 802.11 based network . The computer may have a wired connection to the Internet such as a direct connection to a modem or router which in an example can correspond to the access point itself e.g. for a Wi Fi router with both wired and wireless connectivity . Alternatively rather than being connected to the access point and the Internet over a wired connection the computer may be connected to the access point over air interface or another wireless interface and access the Internet over the air interface. Although illustrated as a desktop computer computer may be a laptop computer a tablet computer a PDA a smart phone or the like. The computer may be an IoT device and or contain functionality to manage an IoT network group such as the network group of IoT devices .

The access point may be connected to the Internet via for example an optical communication system such as FiOS a cable modem a digital subscriber line DSL modem or the like. The access point may communicate with IoT devices and the Internet using the standard Internet protocols e.g. TCP IP .

Referring to an IoT server is shown as connected to the Internet . The IoT server can be implemented as a plurality of structurally separate servers or alternatively may correspond to a single server. In an aspect the IoT server is optional as indicated by the dotted line and the group of IoT devices may be a peer to peer P2P network. In such a case the IoT devices can communicate with each other directly over the air interface and or the wired connection . Alternatively or additionally some or all of IoT devices may be configured with a communication interface independent of air interface and wired connection . For example if the air interface corresponds to a Wi Fi interface certain of the IoT devices may have Bluetooth or NFC interfaces for communicating directly with each other or other Bluetooth or NFC enabled devices.

In a peer to peer network service discovery schemes can multicast the presence of nodes their capabilities and group membership. The peer to peer devices can establish associations and subsequent interactions based on this information.

In accordance with an aspect of the disclosure illustrates a high level architecture of another wireless communications system B that contains a plurality of IoT devices. In general the wireless communications system B shown in may include various components that are the same and or substantially similar to the wireless communications system A shown in which was described in greater detail above e.g. various IoT devices including a television outdoor air conditioning unit thermostat refrigerator and washer and dryer that are configured to communicate with an access point over an air interface and or a direct wired connection a computer that directly connects to the Internet and or connects to the Internet through access point and an IoT server accessible via the Internet etc. . As such for brevity and ease of description various details relating to certain components in the wireless communications system B shown in may be omitted herein to the extent that the same or similar details have already been provided above in relation to the wireless communications system A illustrated in .

Referring to the wireless communications system B may include a supervisor device which may alternatively be referred to as an IoT manager or IoT manager device . As such where the following description uses the term supervisor device those skilled in the art will appreciate that any references to an IoT manager group owner or similar terminology may refer to the supervisor device or another physical or logical component that provides the same or substantially similar functionality.

In one implementation the supervisor device may generally observe monitor control or otherwise manage the various other components in the wireless communications system B. For example the supervisor device can communicate with an access network e.g. access point over air interface and or a direct wired connection to monitor or manage attributes activities or other states associated with the various IoT devices in the wireless communications system B. The supervisor device may have a wired or wireless connection to the Internet and optionally to the IoT server shown as a dotted line . The supervisor device may obtain information from the Internet and or the IoT server that can be used to further monitor or manage attributes activities or other states associated with the various IoT devices .

The supervisor device may be a standalone device or one of IoT devices such as computer . The supervisor device may be a physical device or a software application running on a physical device. The supervisor device may include a user interface that can output information relating to the monitored attributes activities or other states associated with the IoT devices and receive input information to control or otherwise manage the attributes activities or other states associated therewith. Accordingly the supervisor device may generally include various components and support various wired and wireless communication interfaces to observe monitor control or otherwise manage the various components in the wireless communications system B.

The wireless communications system B shown in may include one or more passive IoT devices in contrast to the active IoT devices that can be coupled to or otherwise made part of the wireless communications system B. In general the passive IoT devices may include barcoded devices Bluetooth devices radio frequency RF devices RFID tagged devices infrared IR devices NFC tagged devices or any other suitable device that can provide its identifier and attributes to another device when queried over a short range interface. Active IoT devices may detect store communicate act on and or the like changes in attributes of passive IoT devices.

For example passive IoT devices may include a coffee cup and a container of orange juice that each has an RFID tag or barcode. A cabinet IoT device and the refrigerator IoT device may each have an appropriate scanner or reader that can read the RFID tag or barcode to detect when the coffee cup and or the container of orange juice passive IoT devices have been added or removed. In response to the cabinet IoT device detecting the removal of the coffee cup passive IoT device and the refrigerator IoT device detecting the removal of the container of orange juice passive IoT device the supervisor device may receive one or more signals that relate to the activities detected at the cabinet IoT device and the refrigerator IoT device . The supervisor device may then infer that a user is drinking orange juice from the coffee cup and or likes to drink orange juice from a coffee cup.

Although the foregoing describes the passive IoT devices as having some form of RF or barcode communication interfaces the passive IoT devices may include one or more devices or other physical objects that do not have such communication capabilities. For example certain IoT devices may have appropriate scanner or reader mechanisms that can detect shapes sizes colors and or other observable features associated with the passive IoT devices to identify the passive IoT devices . In this manner any suitable physical object may communicate its identity and attributes and become part of the wireless communication system B and be observed monitored controlled or otherwise managed with the supervisor device . Further passive IoT devices may be coupled to or otherwise made part of the wireless communications system A in and observed monitored controlled or otherwise managed in a substantially similar manner.

In accordance with another aspect of the disclosure illustrates a high level architecture of another wireless communications system C that contains a plurality of IoT devices. In general the wireless communications system C shown in may include various components that are the same and or substantially similar to the wireless communications systems A and B shown in respectively which were described in greater detail above. As such for brevity and ease of description various details relating to certain components in the wireless communications system C shown in may be omitted herein to the extent that the same or similar details have already been provided above in relation to the wireless communications systems A and B illustrated in respectively.

The communications system C shown in illustrates example peer to peer communications between the IoT devices and the supervisor device . As shown in the supervisor device communicates with each of the IoT devices over an IoT supervisor interface. Further IoT devices and IoT devices and and IoT devices and communicate directly with each other.

The IoT devices make up an IoT group . An IoT device group is a group of locally connected IoT devices such as the IoT devices connected to a user s home network. Although not shown multiple IoT device groups may be connected to and or communicate with each other via an IoT SuperAgent connected to the Internet . At a high level the supervisor device manages intra group communications while the IoT SuperAgent can manage inter group communications. Although shown as separate devices the supervisor device and the IoT SuperAgent may be or reside on the same device e.g. a standalone device or an IoT device such as computer in . Alternatively the IoT SuperAgent may correspond to or include the functionality of the access point . As yet another alternative the IoT SuperAgent may correspond to or include the functionality of an IoT server such as IoT server . The IoT SuperAgent may encapsulate gateway functionality .

Each IoT device can treat the supervisor device as a peer and transmit attribute schema updates to the supervisor device . When an IoT device needs to communicate with another IoT device it can request the pointer to that IoT device from the supervisor device and then communicate with the target IoT device as a peer. The IoT devices communicate with each other over a peer to peer communication network using a common messaging protocol CMP . As long as two IoT devices are CMP enabled and connected over a common communication transport they can communicate with each other. In the protocol stack the CMP layer is below the application layer and above the transport layer and the physical layer .

In accordance with another aspect of the disclosure illustrates a high level architecture of another wireless communications system D that contains a plurality of IoT devices. In general the wireless communications system D shown in may include various components that are the same and or substantially similar to the wireless communications systems A C shown in C respectively which were described in greater detail above. As such for brevity and ease of description various details relating to certain components in the wireless communications system D shown in may be omitted herein to the extent that the same or similar details have already been provided above in relation to the wireless communications systems A C illustrated in respectively.

The Internet is a resource that can be regulated using the concept of the IoT. However the Internet is just one example of a resource that is regulated and any resource could be regulated using the concept of the IoT. Other resources that can be regulated include but are not limited to electricity gas storage security and the like. An IoT device may be connected to the resource and thereby regulate it or the resource could be regulated over the Internet . illustrates several resources such as natural gas gasoline hot water and electricity wherein the resources can be regulated in addition to and or over the Internet .

IoT devices can communicate with each other to regulate their use of a resource . For example IoT devices such as a toaster a computer and a hairdryer may communicate with each other over a Bluetooth communication interface to regulate their use of electricity the resource . As another example IoT devices such as a desktop computer a telephone and a tablet computer may communicate over a Wi Fi communication interface to regulate their access to the Internet the resource . As yet another example IoT devices such as a stove a clothes dryer and a water heater may communicate over a Wi Fi communication interface to regulate their use of gas. Alternatively or additionally each IoT device may be connected to an IoT server such as IoT server which has logic to regulate their use of the resource based on information received from the IoT devices.

In accordance with another aspect of the disclosure illustrates a high level architecture of another wireless communications system E that contains a plurality of IoT devices. In general the wireless communications system E shown in may include various components that are the same and or substantially similar to the wireless communications systems A D shown in D respectively which were described in greater detail above. As such for brevity and ease of description various details relating to certain components in the wireless communications system E shown in may be omitted herein to the extent that the same or similar details have already been provided above in relation to the wireless communications systems A D illustrated in respectively.

The communications system E includes two IoT device groups A and B. Multiple IoT device groups may be connected to and or communicate with each other via an IoT SuperAgent connected to the Internet . At a high level an IoT SuperAgent may manage inter group communications among IoT device groups. For example in the IoT device group A includes IoT devices A A and A and an IoT SuperAgent A while IoT device group B includes IoT devices B B and B and an IoT SuperAgent B. As such the IoT SuperAgents A and B may connect to the Internet and communicate with each other over the Internet and or communicate with each other directly to facilitate communication between the IoT device groups A and B. Furthermore although illustrates two IoT device groups A and B communicating with each other via IoT SuperAgents A and B those skilled in the art will appreciate that any number of IoT device groups may suitably communicate with each other using IoT SuperAgents.

As shown in in an example configuration for the IoT device A an external casing of IoT device A may be configured with a display a power button and two control buttons A and B among other components as is known in the art. The display may be a touchscreen display in which case the control buttons A and B may not be necessary. While not shown explicitly as part of IoT device A the IoT device A may include one or more external antennas and or one or more integrated antennas that are built into the external casing including but not limited to Wi Fi antennas cellular antennas satellite position system SPS antennas e.g. global positioning system GPS antennas and so on.

While internal components of IoT devices such as IoT device A can be embodied with different hardware configurations a basic high level configuration for internal hardware components is shown as platform in . The platform can receive and execute software applications data and or commands transmitted over a network interface such as air interface in and or a wired interface. The platform can also independently execute locally stored applications. The platform can include one or more transceivers configured for wired and or wireless communication e.g. a Wi Fi transceiver a Bluetooth transceiver a cellular transceiver a satellite transceiver a GPS or SPS receiver etc. operably coupled to one or more processors such as a microcontroller microprocessor application specific integrated circuit digital signal processor DSP programmable logic circuit or other data processing device which will be generally referred to as processor . The processor can execute application programming instructions within a memory of the IoT device. The memory can include one or more of read only memory ROM random access memory RAM electrically erasable programmable ROM EEPROM flash cards or any memory common to computer platforms. One or more input output I O interfaces can be configured to allow the processor to communicate with and control from various I O devices such as the display power button control buttons A and B as illustrated and any other devices such as sensors actuators relays valves switches and the like associated with the IoT device A.

Accordingly an aspect of the disclosure can include an IoT device e.g. IoT device A including the ability to perform the functions described herein. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art the various logic elements can be embodied in discrete elements software modules executed on a processor e.g. processor or any combination of software and hardware to achieve the functionality disclosed herein. For example transceiver processor memory and I O interface may all be used cooperatively to load store and execute the various functions disclosed herein and thus the logic to perform these functions may be distributed over various elements. Alternatively the functionality could be incorporated into one discrete component. Therefore the features of the IoT device A in are to be considered merely illustrative and the disclosure is not limited to the illustrated features or arrangement.

The passive IoT device B shown in may generally differ from the IoT device A shown in in that the passive IoT device B may not have a processor internal memory or certain other components. Instead in one implementation the passive IoT device A may only include an I O interface or other suitable mechanism that allows the passive IoT device B to be observed monitored controlled managed or otherwise known within a controlled IoT network. For example in one implementation the I O interface associated with the passive IoT device B may include a barcode Bluetooth interface radio frequency RF interface RFID tag IR interface NFC interface or any other suitable I O interface that can provide an identifier and attributes associated with the passive IoT device B to another device when queried over a short range interface e.g. an active IoT device such as IoT device A that can detect store communicate act on or otherwise process information relating to the attributes associated with the passive IoT device B .

Although the foregoing describes the passive IoT device B as having some form of RF barcode or other I O interface the passive IoT device B may comprise a device or other physical object that does not have such an I O interface . For example certain IoT devices may have appropriate scanner or reader mechanisms that can detect shapes sizes colors and or other observable features associated with the passive IoT device B to identify the passive IoT device B. In this manner any suitable physical object may communicate its identity and attributes and be observed monitored controlled or otherwise managed within a controlled IoT network.

Referring to the communication device includes logic configured to receive and or transmit information . In an example if the communication device corresponds to a wireless communications device e.g. IoT device A and or passive IoT device B the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can include a wireless communications interface e.g. Bluetooth Wi Fi Wi Fi Direct Long Term Evolution LTE Direct etc. such as a wireless transceiver and associated hardware e.g. an RF antenna a MODEM a modulator and or demodulator etc. .

In another example the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can correspond to a wired communications interface e.g. a serial connection a USB or Firewire connection an Ethernet connection through which the Internet can be accessed etc. . Thus if the communication device corresponds to some type of network based server e.g. the application the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can correspond to an Ethernet card in an example that connects the network based server to other communication entities via an Ethernet protocol.

In a further example the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can include sensory or measurement hardware by which the communication device can monitor its local environment e.g. an accelerometer a temperature sensor a light sensor an antenna for monitoring local RF signals etc. . The logic configured to receive and or transmit information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to receive and or transmit information to perform its reception and or transmission function s . However the logic configured to receive and or transmit information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to receive and or transmit information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to the communication device further includes logic configured to process information . In an example the logic configured to process information can include at least a processor. Example implementations of the type of processing that can be performed by the logic configured to process information includes but is not limited to performing determinations establishing connections making selections between different information options performing evaluations related to data interacting with sensors coupled to the communication device to perform measurement operations converting information from one format to another e.g. between different protocols such as .wmv to .avi etc. and so on.

A general purpose processor may be a microprocessor but in the alternative the processor may be any conventional processor controller microcontroller or state machine. A processor may also be implemented as a combination of computing devices e.g. a combination of a DSP and a microprocessor a plurality of microprocessors one or more microprocessors in conjunction with a DSP core or any other such configuration .

The logic configured to process information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to process information to perform its processing function s . However the logic configured to process information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to process information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to the communication device further includes logic configured to store information . In an example the logic configured to store information can include at least a non transitory memory and associated hardware e.g. a memory controller etc. . For example the non transitory memory included in the logic configured to store information can correspond to RAM flash memory ROM erasable programmable ROM EPROM EEPROM registers hard disk a removable disk a CD ROM or any other form of storage medium known in the art. The logic configured to store information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to store information to perform its storage function s . However the logic configured to store information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to store information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to the communication device further optionally includes logic configured to present information . In an example the logic configured to present information can include at least an output device and associated hardware. For example the output device can include a video output device e.g. a display screen a port that can carry video information such as USB HDMI etc. an audio output device e.g. speakers a port that can carry audio information such as a microphone jack USB HDMI etc. a vibration device and or any other device by which information can be formatted for output or actually outputted by a user or operator of the communication device . For example if the communication device corresponds to the IoT device A as shown in and or the passive IoT device B as shown in the logic configured to present information can include the display .

In a further example the logic configured to present information can be omitted for certain communication devices such as network communication devices that do not have a local user e.g. network switches or routers remote servers etc. . The logic configured to present information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to present information to perform its presentation function s . However the logic configured to present information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to present information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to the communication device further optionally includes logic configured to receive local user input . In an example the logic configured to receive local user input can include at least a user input device and associated hardware. For example the user input device can include buttons a touchscreen display a keyboard a camera an audio input device e.g. a microphone or a port that can carry audio information such as a microphone jack etc. and or any other device by which information can be received from a user or operator of the communication device . For example if the communication device corresponds to the IoT device A as shown in and or the passive IoT device B as shown in the logic configured to receive local user input can include the buttons A and B the display if a touchscreen etc.

In a further example the logic configured to receive local user input can be omitted for certain communication devices such as network communication devices that do not have a local user e.g. network switches or routers remote servers etc. . The logic configured to receive local user input can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to receive local user input to perform its input reception function s . However the logic configured to receive local user input does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to receive local user input relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to while the configured logics of through are shown as separate or distinct blocks in it will be appreciated that the hardware and or software by which the respective configured logic performs its functionality can overlap in part. For example any software used to facilitate the functionality of the configured logics of through can be stored in the non transitory memory associated with the logic configured to store information such that the configured logics of through each performs their functionality i.e. in this case software execution based in part upon the operation of software stored by the logic configured to store information .

Likewise hardware that is directly associated with one of the configured logics can be borrowed or used by other configured logics from time to time. For example the processor of the logic configured to process information can format data into an appropriate format before being transmitted by the logic configured to receive and or transmit information such that the logic configured to receive and or transmit information performs its functionality i.e. in this case transmission of data based in part upon the operation of hardware i.e. the processor associated with the logic configured to process information .

Generally unless stated otherwise explicitly the phrase logic configured to as used throughout this disclosure is intended to invoke an aspect that is at least partially implemented with hardware and is not intended to map to software only implementations that are independent of hardware. Also it will be appreciated that the configured logic or logic configured to in the various blocks are not limited to specific logic gates or elements but generally refer to the ability to perform the functionality described herein either via hardware or a combination of hardware and software . Thus the configured logics or logic configured to as illustrated in the various blocks are not necessarily implemented as logic gates or logic elements despite sharing the word logic. Other interactions or cooperation between the logic in the various blocks will become clear to one of ordinary skill in the art from a review of the aspects described below in more detail.

The various implementations may be implemented on any of a variety of commercially available server devices such as server illustrated in . In an example the server may correspond to one example configuration of the IoT server described above. In the server includes a processor coupled to volatile memory and a large capacity nonvolatile memory such as a disk drive . The server may also include a floppy disc drive compact disc CD or DVD disc drive coupled to the processor . The server may also include network access ports coupled to the processor for establishing data connections with a network such as a local area network coupled to other broadcast system computers and servers or to the Internet.

In context with it will be appreciated that the server of illustrates one example implementation of the communication device whereby the logic configured to transmit and or receive information corresponds to the network access points used by the server to communicate with the network the logic configured to process information corresponds to the processor and the logic configuration to store information corresponds to any combination of the volatile memory the disk drive and or the disc drive . The optional logic configured to present information and the optional logic configured to receive local user input are not shown explicitly in and may or may not be included therein. Thus helps to demonstrate that the communication device may be implemented as a server in addition to an IoT device implementation as in .

In an IoT network or environment enhanced functionality can obtained in certain use cases based on knowledge regarding whether two or more IoT devices are in close physical proximity to each other. As used herein close physical proximity can correspond to IoT devices being in the same room as each other or being a few feet away from each other in the same room or even being a few feet away from each other in different rooms with an intervening wall between the respective IoT devices.

Conventionally many devices expose either a graphical user interfaces GUI or a programmatic interface. Devices that only expose a GUI are very difficult to program. Each IoT device tends to have its own attributes and or properties. To illustrate assume that a user of the computer depicted in wishes to control the temperature of air conditioning unit using the computer . Depending on the type model manufacturer etc. of the air conditioning unit the temperature control property of the air conditioning unit varies. The computer may not know the different properties for each model of air conditioning unit .

In one or more implementations described herein properties and actions of possible models for the air conditioning unit are mapped from the air conditioning unit s exposed graphical user interfaces GUIs to a programmatic interface e.g. and application program interface API . In this way the air conditioning unit no matter the manufacturer model etc. can be controlled by the computer . In one or more implementations the mapping is performed at the server depicted in . In alternative implementations mapping is performed at the computer .

In one or more implementations the computer is similar to computer depicted in . As such the computer can be a personal computer PC a PDA a smart phone a tablet or the like.

In one or more implementations the P2P service module is a user interface service that allows associated IoT devices to broadcast their presence in a manner that is not meant to be understood by the computer . Instead the broadcasts are meant to be displayed to the user understood by the user and meaningful to the user on the IoT device for example in the form of human readable communications such as text images video audio haptics and the like. That is the computer does not understand what is being broadcast by the IoT device because the broadcasts do not have message codes or the kind of identification that messages typically utilize in machine to machine and or programmatic communication. In one or more implementations the P2P service module is a user interface that uses hypertext markup language HTML or other user interface technology.

Although shown as a P2P service module implementations are not so limited. For example other suitable technologies include a hub spoke module a client server module or any other module that is capable of communicating between two systems.

In one or more implementations the P2P service consults a user interface of the IoT device and is programmed to build properties and actions related to the IoT device . One property may be a knob on the IoT device e.g. a temperature knob and or a timer knob for an oven a cycle knob for a washing machine or a dishwasher and the like. One action may be a button e.g. a radio button or a switch which is used to select an action associated with a given property of the IoT device .

For example in implementations in which the IoT device is a washing machine there would be a property by which a user would select which washing cycle to use e.g. permanent press cotton etc. In this example implementation the user would be presented on the computer with a switch a radio button etc. with which the user could select the washing machine cycle. An action associated with the button or switch could then be start now. The P2P service includes information that informs the computer how to render the properties i.e. knobs and actions i.e. start now on the computer for the user to access. Information can include what type of widget to draw how to label the widget what color should the widget be etc. This information allows the semantic mapper to provide a normalized version of valid values for properties in IoT devices such as the IoT device . The normalized version may be the semantic tags.

In one or more implementations the IoT device can be any suitable IoT device such as those depicted in . These include but are not limited to the television the outdoor air conditioning units and or the thermostat the refrigerator and the washer and dryer .

In one or more implementations the semantic mapper maps a user interface for one or more IoT devices to a programmatic interface such as an application programming interface API . This is accomplished by having the semantic mapper assign semantic tags to remotely exposed generic properties of the IoT device . The remotely exposed generic properties may be a generic programmatic interface for setting and or getting properties of the IoT device . Additionally the semantic mapper provides to the computer a normalized version of valid values for a property for the IoT device .

Although illustrated as being separate from the computer the semantic mapper can be a mapping database that resides either locally on the computer or externally in the cloud on a server. In one or more implementations the semantic mapper can be the computer the server a software library not shown or other suitable entity that is capable of mapping properties of IoT devices to a programmatic interface e.g. an API so that the semantic mapper can be controlled to interact with the IoT device .

To illustrate one or more implementations assume that the IoT device is an air conditioning unit and an application writer has written an application on the computer that will automatically change the temperature of the IoT device . Also assume that the semantic mapper has published documentation that the pre agreed upon semantic tag for a property for controlling the temperature setting on an air conditioning unit is org.alljoyn.cpsSemanticTags.acTempControl. The application on the computer sends the air conditioning unit s name to the semantic mapper requesting a mapping for org.alljoyn.cpsSemanticTags.acTempControl. The response from the semantic mapper informs the application on the computer of a normalized version of the temperature property. For example the semantic mapper informs the application on the computer to use the property called thermometerstand. From here on the application on the computer interacts with the user interface on the IoT device in a standard manner but without needing to display a user interface to the user. The user can view the user interface on the computer .

Returning to the message flow in at a point the IoT device announces its presence in any known manner such as making its presence discoverable over a suitable discovery protocol. In one or more implementations the IoT device broadcasts its presence using human readable communications such as text images video audio haptics and the like. The broadcasts are not meant to be understood by the computer . Instead the broadcasts are meant to be displayed to the user understood by the user and meaningful to the user on the IoT device . That is the computer does not understand what is being broadcast by the IoT device because the broadcasts do not have message codes or the kind of identification that messages have in typical machine to machine and or programmatic communication.

In the illustrated example the IoT device broadcasts an About announcement Model Acme1234 text message when the model of the IoT device is an Acme1234 model.

At a point the computer obtains the announcement over the IoT network. In one or more implementations the computer obtains the broadcast of the announcement using an About announcement Model Acme1234 text message.

At a point the computer requests from the semantic mapper a semantic tag for the temperature property associated with the IoT device . In one or more implementations the computer requests the semantic tag for the temperature property associated with the IoT device by sending over the IoT network a findProperty semanticTag acTempContrormodel Acme1234 text message to the semantic mapper .

At a point the semantic mapper responds that the temperature property for the Acme1234 air conditioning unit is called thermometerstand. In one or more implementations in response to the request for the temperature property the semantic mapper returns a findProperty returns to use the property with the name thermometerstand text message to the application on the computer . The semantic mapper may look up the mapping in a database and respond over the IoT network.

At a point the application on the computer retrieves the programmatic interface for the IoT device using any suitable network protocol. In one or more implementations the computer retrieves the programmatic interface for the IoT device by sending a getTheControlPanel text message to the IoT device .

At a point the application on the computer locates the temperature property on the IoT device by parsing network protocol message for example. In one or more implementations the application on the computer locates the temperature property on the IoT device using a find the property called thermometerstand text message.

At a point the application on the computer sets the temperature on the IoT device using any suitable network protocol for example. In one or more implementations the application on the computer sets the temperature on the IoT device by sending a set the property text message to the IoT device .

In one or more implementations the computer may be any computing device such as a telephone a tablet computer a phablet phone tablet computer a smart phone a laptop computer and the like. The illustrated computer is capable of communicating with the peer to peer P2P service module the IoT device and the semantic mapper to implement the message flow .

In one or more implementations the peer to peer P2P service module may be an off the shelf P2P module. The illustrated peer to peer P2P service module is capable of communicating with the IoT device the semantic mapper and the computer .

The human readable indication of a presence of the IoT device may be observed by a user interface an application layer interface and or a presentation layer interface or infrastructure .

In response to observing the human readable indication of a presence of the IoT device the architecture may assign an agreed upon semantic tag to the associated information and enables pre agreed upon semantic tag to be used to control the IoT device.

In one or more implementations the pre agreed upon semantic tag may be presented on the display . For example if the string CYCLE DONE is a pre agreed upon semantic tag indicating that a washing machine has finished its cycle then one or more home appliances e.g. washing machine dishwasher dryer etc. may be pre programmed to display the message with the specific string of bytes CYCLE DONE.
