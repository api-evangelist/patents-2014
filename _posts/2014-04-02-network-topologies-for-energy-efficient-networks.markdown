This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 13 019 157 filed Feb. 1 2011 entitled Network Topologies for Energy Efficient Networks to be U.S. Pat. No. 8 699 382.

This disclosure generally relates to network topologies and more specifically relates to creating network topologies that reduce energy consumption throughout computer networks.

Energy Efficiency is a popular concept in the modern era especially among people who are conscious of environmental issues. Reducing energy consumption in computer networks brings about many benefits the least of which including reducing operation costs and saving energy and thus the environment.

To ensure performance quality computer networks especially large networks such as those associated with data centers or large institutions often include a great number of routers and contain a high amount of coupling and redundancy between these routers in order to provide fast data transfer and recovery rates. Consequently the largest energy consumption in a computer network is often in the individual routers such as the energy required to maintain process and operate each router. In comparison the energy required to actually transfer data over a computer network is relatively insignificant.

Network usage typically varies depending on the time of the day or the day of the week. For example at nights or on weekends network usage is often low because less people are working. And yet the routers are kept running at all hours and thus consume large amounts of energy even when their usage is low. Energy is needlessly wasted as a result.

Often the largest energy consumption in a computer network is in the individual routers. Therefore by eliminating unnecessary routers from a network large amounts of energy may be saved over time. One way to eliminate unnecessary routers from a computer network is through network topology reduction. Many forms of topology reduction such as Dijkstra s algorithm mid sum routes DFS numbering and min metric have been implemented and used over time. However the existing forms of topology reduction usually require full knowledge of the topology of a network or focus on eliminating only unnecessary connections between routers instead of eliminating unnecessary router nodes throughout the network.

Particular embodiments take into account the energy consumption of the individual nodes e.g. routers in a computer network in order to design minimal topologies for the computer network so that during periods of low network usage or downtime large amounts of energy may be saved. Particular embodiments utilize a protocol independent algorithm to dynamically determine minimal topologies for computer networks. In particular embodiments the algorithm is protocol independent because it is not necessary for each node in a network to have any knowledge of the full topology of the network. In particular embodiments the algorithm not only optimizes energy usage in a network but maintains a performance standard in order to guarantee that the network does not lose its ability to perform the necessary tasks.

In particular embodiments a node in network may be directly connected with one or more other nodes . For example in node A is directly connected with nodes B and C node D is directly connected with nodes E F and G and node G is directly connected with nodes D and K. In particular embodiments a node may be directly connected with one or more user devices such as personal computers tablets smart telephones or game devices. For example in node A is directly connected with user device A while node H is directly connected with user devices B and C. In particular embodiments two components e.g. two nodes or a node and a user device are directly connected when there is a direct link with no other component between them. Thus node A is directly connected to node B but is not directly connected to node E because there is no direct link between nodes A and E.

In particular embodiments if a node is directly connected with one or more user devices it is referred to as an edge node e.g. an edge router . In particular embodiments when determining a minimal topology for a network all edge nodes in the network are kept alive and online at all times.

Each node has a first hop neighborhood also referred to as a one hop neighborhood and a second hop neighborhood also referred to as a two hop neighborhood . For each node its first hop neighborhood includes all the other nodes that are directly connected with the node all the other nodes that are one hop from node . For example in the first hop neighborhood of node A includes nodes B and C while the first hop neighborhood of node E includes nodes B C D and H. For each node its second hop neighborhood includes all the other nodes that are directly connected with any node in the first hop neighborhood of the node all the other nodes that are two hops from node . In other words for each node its second hop neighborhood includes all the other nodes that are connected with the node via only one other node. For example in the second hop neighborhood of node A includes nodes E H and I while the second hop neighborhood of node G includes nodes E F and J. Node I connects with node A via only node C and node C is in the first hop neighborhood of node A. Similarly node E connects with node A via only node B along one path or via only node C along another path and both nodes B and C are in the first hop neighborhood of node A. Note that as these examples illustrate the first hop and second hop neighborhoods are determined with respect to each specific node and the first hop and second hop neighborhoods of one node may differ from the first hop and second hop neighborhoods of another node. In addition it is possible that a node may not have any second hop neighbors e.g. when there are only a few nodes in the network . Furthermore in particular embodiments if a first node is connected with a second node via multiple paths then the shortest path between the first node and the second node is used to determine how many hops there are between the two nodes. Thus for example if the first node is directly connected with the second node on the one hand one hop and connected with the second node via a third node on the other hand two hops the first node and second node are considered one hop neighbors to each other.

Between any two nodes there may be one or more paths. For example in from node A to node C a first path may go from node A directly to node C a second path may go from node A to node B to node E to node C and a third path may go from node A to node B to node H to node E to node C. Of course the first path is shorter and thus generally more preferable than the second path which is in turn shorter than the third path. In particular embodiments each path between two nodes may be associated with a cost which may be the cost involved in transferring data from one node to the other node along this path. Particular embodiments may determine the cost of each path based on various factors such as for example and without limitation the total number of nodes along the path the cost of operating the individual nodes the cost of maintaining the connections between the nodes the time it takes to transfer the data and the delay along the path.

In particular embodiments when determining a minimal topology for a computer network for the purpose of reducing power consumption the algorithm used to determine the minimal topology may take into consideration any number of constraints or requirements such as performance requirements for the network formed according to the resulting topology.

In particular embodiments one constraint may be a baseline bandwidth also referred to as minimum bandwidth which is the minimum bandwidth that needs to be maintained across the network formed according to the resulting topology. In particular embodiments the baseline bandwidth may be represented as various metrics such as for example and without limitation delays and transfer rates. In particular embodiments the baseline bandwidth may be specified by a human user or determined based on system performance requirements. When determining a minimal topology for a network particular embodiments determine an active set of nodes for each node in the network described in more detail below in connection with . The active set of nodes of a specific node includes a minimum set of one hop neighbors of that specific node that is necessary to support the baseline bandwidth requirement.

In particular embodiments another constraint may be a minimum number of active paths in the network formed according to the resulting topology. That is if the minimum number of active paths is n n 1 then there should be at least n active paths between pairs of nodes in the network. In particular embodiments the minimum number of active paths may be specified by a human user. For example a user may specify that the minimum number of active paths is 1 e.g. one path between each pair of nodes which results in a minimal topology. Alternatively the user may specify that the minimum number of active paths is 2 e.g. two paths between each pair of nodes so that there may be a primary path and an alternate path for fast recovery. Note that increasing the minimum number of paths necessarily decreases the percentage of nodes e.g. routers that can be removed from service and thus decreases the amount of energy that may be reduced.

In particular embodiments these constraints e.g. baseline bandwidth minimum number of active paths may be supplied to the algorithm used to determine a minimal topology for a network as inputs.

In particular embodiments each node in the network has an identifier and a power consumption value and each link between two nodes has a bandwidth. In particular embodiments the node identifiers may be numbers alphabets or a combination thereof. For purpose of clarification let ID denote the identifier of a node PC denote the power consumption value of a node and BW denote the bandwidth of a link. Furthermore let BWdenote the baseline bandwidth and Pdenote the minimum number of paths specified for example by a user that the resulting topology needs to satisfy.

Particular embodiments may discover all of the first hop neighbors also referred to as one hop neighbors and second hop neighbors also referred to as two hop neighbors of each node in a network as illustrated in STEP . As described above with respect to a current node a one hop neighbor of the current node is another node that is directly connected with the current node. A two hop neighbor of the current node is another node that is directly connected with a one hop neighbor of the current node. In other words a two hop neighbor of the current node is another node that is connected with the current node via only one other node. In with respect to node A the one hop neighbors of node A include nodes B and E and the two hop neighbors of node A include nodes C and D. With respect to node B the one hop neighbors of node R include nodes A C D and E and node B does not have any two hop neighbors because it is directly connected with each of the other nodes in network .

Each node may discover its one hop neighbors and two hop neighbors by any suitable means. For example a current node may be aware of all the other nodes with which it is directly connected and thus the current node may compile a list of its one hop neighbors to include these directly connected nodes. The current node may request from each of its one hop neighbors a list of all the nodes directly connected with each of the one hop neighbors and based on this information compile a list of its two hop neighbors.

Particular embodiments may construct an active set of one hop neighbors for each node in the network as illustrated in STEP . In particular embodiments the active set of one hop neighbors of a node is a minimal set of one hop neighbors of the node that is necessary to support the baseline bandwidth BW. This step is described in more detail in .

Once the active set of one hop neighbors of each node has been determined particular embodiments may further determine which specific nodes are necessary and which are not as illustrated in STEP . This step is described in more detail in .

Finally particular embodiments may optimize the paths between the edge nodes and power down those nodes that are not necessary in order to reduce power consumption in the network as illustrated in STEP . This step is described in more detail in .

Particular embodiments add all of the one hop neighbors of a current node that are also edge nodes to the active set of the current node as illustrated in STEP .

In suppose that node A is selected as the current node. Nodes B and E are the one hop neighbors of node A. Node B is not an edge node and therefore is not added to the active set of node A. On the other hand node E is an edge node and therefore is added to the active set of node A. At this point the active set of node A includes node E.

Suppose that node B is selected as the current node. Nodes A C D and E are all its one hop neighbors. In this case nodes C and E are added to the active set of node B because these two are edge nodes. Nodes A and D are not added to the active set of node B because they are not edge nodes.

Suppose that node E is selected as the current node. Its one hop neighbors include nodes A B and D none of which is an edge node. Thus none of the one hop neighbors of node E is added to its active set at this point.

Particular embodiments add all of the remaining one hop neighbors of the current node that are uniquely and directly connected with one or more two hop neighbors of the current node to the active set of the current node as illustrated in STEP . In other words if a one hop neighbor of the current node which has not been included in the active set of the current node during STEP is directly connected with at least one two hop neighbor of the current node and this two hop neighbor cannot be reach by the current node through any other one hop neighbor of the current node then the one hop neighbor is added to the active set of the current node.

In with respect to node A as the current node node B is the remaining one hop neighbor of node A that has not been added to the active set of node A. Node B directly connects with nodes C and D which are both two hop neighbors of node A. Node A can reach node D through either node B or node E. In this case node B is not the only one hop neighbor that connects node A to node D and based on node D node B would not be added to the active set of node A. However node A can reach node C only through node B. In this case node B is the only one hop neighbor that connects node A to node C. Based on node C node B should be added to the active set of node A. At this point the active set of node A includes both nodes B and E.

With respect to node B as the current node node B does not have any two hop neighbors. Therefore no remaining one hop neighbor of node B e.g. node A or node D is added to the active set of node B at this point.

With respect to node E as the current node nodes A B and D are the one hop neighbors of node E that have not been included in the active set of node E. Among these three one hop neighbors node B uniquely and directly connects node E with node C which is a two hop neighbor of node E. That is node E can reach node C only through node B. Therefore node B is added to the active set of node E at this point.

Particular embodiments determines whether the active set of the current node is complete as illustrated in STEP . The active set of the current node is complete if all of the two hop neighbors of the current node are connected to one or more one hop neighbors of the current node that are included in the active set of the current node 1 by a total bandwidth greater than or equal to the baseline bandwidth BW and 2 by a total number of paths greater than or equal to the minimum number of paths P. Recall that in particular embodiments BWand Pmay be specified by a user.

In with respect to node A as the current node after STEPS and the active set of node A includes nodes B and E. The two hop neighbors of node A are nodes C and D. Two hop neighbor node C is directly connected to one hop neighbor node B in the active set and two hop neighbor node E is directly connected to both one hop neighbor nodes B and E in the active set. Thus all of the two hop neighbor nodes of node A are connected to one or more one hop neighbor nodes of node A in the active set. Next there are three links through which nodes C and D are connected with nodes B and E. Specifically node C connects with node B via link C node D connects with node B via link B and node D connects with node E via link D. Each link has a bandwidth. The total bandwidth is the sum of the bandwidths of the three individual links B C and D BW BW BW BW . This total bandwidth BWneeds to be greater than or equal to the baseline bandwidth BWin order for the active set of node A to be complete. Finally there are a total three paths P 3 through links B C and D that the two hop neighbor nodes C and D are connected with the one hop neighbor nodes B and E in the active set. This total number of paths Pneeds to be greater than or equal to the minimum number of paths Pin order for the active set of node A to be complete. That is if the total bandwidth BWis greater than or equal to the baseline bandwidth BWand the total number of paths Pis greater than or equal to the minimum number of paths P then the active set of node A is complete. Otherwise the active set is not yet complete. Note that in this case since all of the one hop neighbors of node A are included in its active set the active set is complete.

With respect to node B as the current node after STEPS and the active set of node B includes nodes C and E. Node B does not have any two hop neighbors. Therefore the active set of node B is also complete.

With respect to node E as the current node after STEPS and the active set of node E includes node B. Node E has only one two hop neighbor node C which is connected to node B via link C. The total bandwidth is the bandwidth of link C BW BW and the total number of paths is 1 P 1 . Again if the total bandwidth BW is greater than or equal to the baseline bandwidth BW and the total number of paths Pis greater than or equal to the minimum number of paths P then the active set of node E is complete. Otherwise the active set is not yet complete.

For the current node if its active set is complete at this point STEP YES then the active set of one hop neighbors of the current node has been obtained. On the other hand if the active set is not yet complete at this point STEP NO then additional one hop neighbors of the current node may need to be included in the active set in order to complete the active set.

Suppose the active set of the current node is not yet complete particular embodiments determine all different combinations of the one hop neighbors of the current node that are not yet included in the active set of the current node as illustrated in STEP .

As an example suppose that the current node has four one hop neighbors n1 n2 n3 n4 and among these node n4 has already been included in the active set of the current node. The remaining three one hop neighbors not yet included in the active set of the current node are n1 n2 and n3. The combinations of the three remaining one hop neighbors are n1 n2 n3 n1 n2 n1 n3 n2 n3 and n1 n2 n3.

In with respect to node E as the current node suppose that the active set of node E is not yet complete after STEPS and . At this point the one hop neighbors of node E that are not included in its active set are nodes A and D. There are three different combinations of these two one hop neighbor nodes A D and A D.

For each combination of the remaining one hop neighbors particular embodiments determine a total energy metric a bandwidth metric for each two hop neighbor and a total bandwidth metric as illustrated in STEP . In particular embodiments the total energy metric of each combination of the remaining one hop neighbors is the sum of the assumed energy usage of each node in that combination. In particular embodiments the assumed energy usage of a node may be its power consumption value PC. For example with respect to node E in the total energy metric for combination A may be the power consumption value of node A PC and the total energy metric for combination A D may be the sum of the power consumption values of nodes A and D PC PC .

In particular embodiments for each combination of the remaining one hop neighbors there is a bandwidth metric for each two hop neighbor. That is there is a bandwidth metric associated with each path connecting the current node through the one hop neighbors in that combination with each two hop neighbor. Since this bandwidth is determined on a per path basis it may be referred to as an individual bandwidth as opposed to the total bandwidth . In particular embodiments this bandwidth metric may be used to determine equal cost paths e.g. paths having the same bandwidth to a specific two hop neighbor node however each path is still limited by the baseline or minimum bandwidth. In particular embodiments the individual bandwidth may be a sum of the equal cost paths to a specific two hop neighbor node.

In particular embodiments for each combination of the remaining one hop neighbors there is a total bandwidth metric which is the sum of all the bandwidth metrics for all the two hop neighbors. That is the total bandwidth metric for each combination is the sum of all the bandwidth metrics associated with the paths connecting the one hop neighbors in that combination with the two hop neighbors.

Particular embodiments iterate through these different combinations of the remaining one hop neighbors one combination at a time starting with the combination that has the lowest total energy measured by the total energy metric of the combination and ending with the combination that has the highest total energy again measured by the total energy metric of the combination and test whether each combination may complete the active set of the current node. In particular embodiments when selecting a specific combination for testing if multiple combinations have the same total energy level then the combination that has the highest total bandwidth measured by the total bandwidth metric of the combination is selected first. Furthermore in particular embodiments when selecting a specific combination for testing if multiple combinations have the same total energy level and the same total bandwidth then the combination that has a node with the lowest identifier is selected first or alternatively the combination that has the lowest sum of the identifiers of the nodes in the combination is selected first.

More specifically particular embodiments select a combination of the remaining one hop neighbors that has not been evaluated and that has the lowest total energy among the untested combinations as illustrated in STEP . Particular embodiments then determine whether adding the one hop neighbors in the selected combination to the active set of the current node would complete the active set of the current node as illustrated in STEP .

As described above in connection with STEP if after adding the one hop neighbors in the selected combination to the active set of the current node all of the two hop neighbors of the current node are connected to one or more one hop neighbors of the current node that are included in the active set of the current node 1 by a total bandwidth greater than or equal to the baseline bandwidth BW and 2 by a total number of paths greater than or equal to the minimum number of paths P then the active set of the current set is complete. Otherwise the active set is not yet complete.

If adding the one hop neighbors in the selected combination to the active set of the current node completes the active set STEP YES then particular embodiments add all of the one hop neighbors in the selected combination to the active set as illustrated in STEP . At this point the active set of one hop neighbors of the current node has been obtained. On the other hand if adding the one hop neighbors in the selected combination to the active set of the current node does not complete the active set STEP NO particular embodiments determine whether there is any more combination of the remaining one hop neighbors that has not been evaluated as illustrated STEP . If so STEP YES particular embodiments selects another un evaluated combination that currently has the lowest total energy for testing and repeat STEPS for another iteration. On the other hand if there is no more combination left to be tested particular embodiments add all of the remaining one hop neighbors of the current node to the active set of the current node to complete the active set as illustrated in STEP .

In particular embodiments each node sends a message e.g. a hello message of each of its one hop neighbors included in the active set of the node as illustrated in STEP . In particular embodiments each node then identifies whether it is necessary in the current topology as illustrated in STEPS . Note that STEPS may be similarly performed with respect to each node.

In particular embodiments if a node is an edge node e.g. directly connected with one or more user devices or if the node is necessary to two or more if its neighboring nodes then the node is necessary. Otherwise the node is not necessary. In other words if a node is not an edge node and is necessary for connectivity purposes to less than two of its neighbors then the node is not necessary in the current topology configuration as illustrated in STEP . For example a node is necessary to less than two of its neighbors if the node is directly connected with less than two of its neighbors.

In particular embodiments if the node is not necessary as illustrated in STEP the unnecessary node sends a message to each of its one hop neighbors informing them that the unnecessary node is about to be shut down because it is not necessary to the current configuration of the network topology as illustrated in STEP . This also enables each neighbor node of the unnecessary node to determine whether that neighbor node itself is still necessary to the current configuration of the topology. For example if a neighbor node s only path derives from the unnecessary node that neighbor node may also be unnecessary to the current configuration of the topology.

In particular embodiments the unnecessary node is powered down to reduce power consumption in the network as illustrated in STEP . On the other hand if the node is necessary as illustrated in STEP the necessary node remains alive e.g. power on .

In particular embodiments each edge node identifies one or lowest cost paths e.g. in terms of energy cost between itself and each other edge node as illustrated in STEP . In particular embodiments the total energy cost of a path may be the sum of the energy costs of the individual nodes along that path. In particular embodiments between two edge nodes the path that has the lowest total emery cost is considered the lowest cost path. For two edge nodes if there are multiple paths connecting the two edge nodes that have the same total energy cost the total minimum bandwidth of these equal cost paths must be greater than or equal to the baseline bandwidth BW. In particular embodiments each edge node may construct a routing table that contains these lowest cost paths to the other edge nodes. In particular embodiments each edge node maintains a routing table that contains the identified lowest cost paths to all of the other edge nodes.

In particular embodiments each edge node sends a message e.g. a test packet to each other edge node along the corresponding lowest cost path as illustrated in STEP

In particular embodiments any node e.g. not edge node that is not involved in the transferring of the messages between the edge nodes along the lowest cost paths are no longer necessary and may be shut down to reduce power consumption in the network.

At this point the remaining nodes that are still alive form a minimal topology for the computer network that reduces power consumption while satisfying the baseline bandwidth and minimum number of paths requirements.

Topologies may be dynamically determined for a network using the methods illustrated in . For example different topology profiles may be constructed for different times of the day e.g. morning afternoon evening or night or different days of the week e.g. weekdays and weekends . For each topology profile a user may specify the appropriate baseline bandwidth and minimum number of paths so that the network may be optimized based on different metrics under different circumstances.
