title: System and method for facilitating transactions as conversations between participants
abstract: A computer-implemented system keeps records of communications between participants as a conversation. All communications between participants in a transaction are stored as part of the conversation including documents, photographs, forms etc. needed to complete the transaction. A computer system interacts with a wallet service of one or more participants to keep a record of, or to affect the transfer of, consideration between participants in the transaction. Conversations can occur for any topic or conversations for a particular topic can be selected and a template provided for documents and/or conversation participants most often needed to complete an associated transaction.

The present application claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Patent Application No. 61 827 494 filed on May 24 2013 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The technology described herein relates to computers systems and in particular to computer systems to facilitate transactions between users.

For anything but the most simple of transactions a person often uses multiple electronic devices to communicate with several parties in order to complete a transaction. For example in the case of an automobile accident a party may need to involve the police witnesses car body repair shops insurance agencies attorneys and maybe others to settle a claim and repair a car. Letters drafted on computers are sent between parties phone calls are made e mails are sent. A user has to keep track of all these communications in order to make sure that the underlying issues are resolved.

Given the complexity of tracking storing and analyzing records of each of these communications there is a need for a system that can help reduce transaction costs by facilitating communications between parties about a transaction in order see a transaction through to its completion.

As will be discussed in further detail below the technology disclosed is a computer based system that groups communications between users as a conversation. A conversation can store records of communications between multiple parties and the documents that are transmitted between parties. A user can easily view previously started conversations and add to them in order to complete some desired task. The computer system records a result of the conversation and can rate participants in the conversation on how effective the participants were in achieving the completion of a task or assignment that was the subject of the conversation. In addition the computer system can facilitate the transfer of consideration between one or more participants in a conversation in order to complete a transaction. Furthermore the computer system can simplify analysis of transactions and suggest efficient communication templates.

As discussed above the purpose of the system described herein is to facilitate collaboration and transactions between participants in a commercial governmental non profit social etc. setting. These transactions can include but are not limited to negotiating a purchase contract and or commitment providing a service effecting a customer support session arriving at an agreement between people on a future course of action resolving an issue developing an idea prioritizing action items assembling a document and or document package to support a claim etc.

A computer system keeps records of transactions as a conversation between participants. Communications between participants include streams of information exchanges comprising fragments e.g. text messages pictures requests orders promises location information delivery options comments questions legal documents schedules money etc. A transaction can include the exchange of goods services information considerations promises etc.

Participants in a conversation can include teams and individuals e.g. team team team individual individual individual . Teams can be formal and informal entities formal Legal Corporations Universities Governments Families or informal Friends Acquaintances Extended Family Co workers Countrymen etc. . Individuals can be human animal and artificial e.g. automated services .

Depending on the nature of the transaction teams and individuals involved individuals and teams can be assigned different hats e.g. customer husband employee contractor advisor authorized agent boyfriend team member calendar etc. More than one hat can be assigned to an individual or a team at the same time.

To explore the feasibility and or conduct a transaction parties create at least one conversation and invite teams and individuals to discuss or join the conversation as appropriate.

Conversations occur between individuals but depending on the hats assigned to the individuals teams can own and participate in the conversations.

In one embodiment a computer system stores records of free form conversations where the users are invited to define the participants in the conversation the documents to be transmitted or communications to be sent between participants. In another embodiment the computer system provides templates for transactions and related conversations to handle pre defined scenarios e.g. an Auto Accident Insurance Claim Airport Arrival Service Sign up New Hire Apartment Rental Contract Negotiations Product Service Delivery Product Service Feedback Customer Support etc. Users of the system are enabled to use default templates or create their own. Furthermore the system can rate templates with regard to the efficiency of completed transactions.

In one embodiment individuals and teams are introduced to each other via a Say Hi mechanism. The mechanism makes one party individual or team aware of another party which becomes a potential transaction partner e.g. in a pre defined scenario.

Parties in a transaction engage in conversations that involve an offerable product service experience etc. its description price invitations to make an offer advertisement conditions of sale availability quality delivery options distribution of money between parties contract terms complaints etc.

A conversation can be split into multiple conversation streams and routed to different teams and individuals.

Records of conversations are stored and analyzed to evaluate transaction efficiency value creation satisfaction team individual performance dispute arbitration etc.

Parties in the transaction are enabled to allocate and distribute money or equivalent consideration between themselves and third parties. The money or its equivalent exchanged during the conversation may represent an official record of receipt. The money can be transferred through various mechanisms e.g. a digital wallet service which is tied to the user s bank account credit card account Amazon Flexible Payment System Amazon FPS PayPal BitCoin frequent flier affiliation card etc.

The system keeps records including time and location stamps of individuals teams conversations relationships transactions etc.

In one embodiment the computer system provides Application Programming Interfaces APIs to third parties programs that desire access to the conversation in real time and or related records through a database.

The system and third parties may exchange identifying information that allows them to match e.g. positively negatively partially individually in aggregate teams individuals transactions conversations etc.

The system and third parties may exchange the contents of conversations and related meta data such as date time response time number of parties involved number of conversation branches considerations transferred participants and observers subjective evaluation of the transaction efficiency emotional markers etc.

The following is a non exhaustive list of sample transactions for which a user may wish to maintain a record of a conversation service registration Say Hi auto accident claim airport arrival new hire onboarding new employee orientation signing up for health benefits buying a mobile phone with a carrier contract buying delivering installing repairing replacing a heater for the house employee team performance evaluation filing a medical insurance claim ordering a meal paying and giving a tip at a restaurant disputing a service bill requesting legal advice delegation of authority during vacation test performance discussion between student parent teacher tutor and school principal getting advice from a store employee and or another consumer with proven product service experience and contacting distant relatives in a foreign city.

Human interactions about private pubic and commercial matters typically involve multiple information exchanges that comprise objective and subjective data. The exchanges take place between people organizations and or automated systems that help facilitate transactions make them less expensive e.g. in terms of time money and efforts of the parties involved. The exchanges can be thought of as virtual assembly lines for services. When an individual service fails to be delivered in the right place at the right time in the right quality and quantity the entire assembly line stops resulting in increased transaction costs.

For example a purchase of a product on a website may include at least some of the following operations browsing product related web pages reading reviews comparing competing and or related product offerings receiving product description and pricing information filling out order information submitting an order paying tracking the order providing feedback on product and or service quality contacting customer service resolving disputes returning the product e.g. when it doesn t satisfy one s needs etc.

In another example fixing one s car after an auto accident may involve but not limited to interactions with relatives insurance companies police witnesses other parties in the accident and or their agents auto repair shops information services emergency assistance services courts etc. The process includes collecting various documents submitting them in accordance with pre defined rules or procedures obtaining or paying money etc. It gets even more complicated when the accident involves medical claims because yet more parties have to be included in resolving the issue.

In a yet another example encountering a new situation such as arriving at an airport in a foreign city or starting a new job may require discovering new information sources accessing new services acquiring new contacts fulfilling new roles in transaction processes entering new types of negotiations and much more.

As more people use mobile device and related communication services it becomes more difficult to address issues mentioned above using traditional web voice e mail SMS and other modes of interaction. One purpose of the disclosed technology is to facilitate collaboration and enable efficient interaction in a broad variety of human environments commercial governmental social non profit etc.

Another purpose of the disclosed technology is to facilitate commercial transactions between individuals and businesses that involve use of mobile connected devices.

Yet another purpose of the disclosed technology is to facilitate distribution of value among parties involved in commercial transactions and providing means for evaluating efficiency and value creation among employees and businesses involved in the transactions.

These and other advantages of the disclosed technology are accomplished by providing a system for conversation creation and management. A conversation is represented by a stream of messages generated by and distributed over a relationship graph. The system further enables insertion into the conversation representations of value e.g. money or tokens and means for distributing the value among the participants of the conversation.

At step the system starts the conversation e.g. by launching an mobile application and initializing user environment with previous conversations potential relevant contacts value holders connections to services and other elements necessary to engage in a transaction.

At step the system decides whether the user is going to continue an existing conversation or create a new one. If the user chooses New e.g. pressing a corresponding icon on his or her user interface the system goes to step . Alternatively step can be performed by the system automatically depending on the context of the application e.g. when the user opens up the application for the first time for registration.

If the New option is rejected in step the system tries to select an existing conversation for the user to continue. If the process of selection succeeds the system goes to step where the parties involved engage in an information exchange. Otherwise the system creates a new conversation at step . Each conversation has a unique identifier. The identifier can be generated explicitly e.g. by generating a unique number or implicitly by a combination of conversation attributes e.g. concatenation of names of parties involved in the conversation and a random hash code.

Step may proceed in real time or over an extended period of time where parties exchange messages asynchronously.

In some implementations the strength of the connection between conversation participants determines when and how messages are delivered. For example if a particular employee or team member contacted by a customer is not available the customer s request can be either forward or escalated to other employees team members or not.

The customer and team member are enabled to lock their relationships e.g. for a period of time. For example only a specific Financial Advisor is allowed to reply to investment portfolio allocation questions within two days provided the advisor is still available. The lock e.g. exclusivity of the relationship and its duration can be determined in different ways.

In one implementation the customer and or team member explicitly define the terms of the relationship through their preferences.

In another implementation the systems determines the terms by monitoring user interactions and calculating preferences e.g. based on the number of interactions their frequency customer satisfaction statistics and consideration exchanged.

In a yet another implementation the system determines lock characteristics on a per conversation or even per message bases e.g. asking the customer and or team member whether at least one of them wishes to maintain the lock or exclusive conversation with the customer.

In one more implementation the system escalates a conversation if the customer accesses it in an emergency mode.

When a lock is not present a team receptionist either human or automatic is enabled to steer the conversation to an available team member. For example when a new customer contacts Macy s sales service for the first time the conversation is not locked. In another example a sales rep at Macy s manages her own customer base. She does clienteling with top customers and keeps ownership of their customer base.

At step the system decides whether the subject of the conversation has been resolved. If yes the system marks the conversation as closed at step .

In some implementations conversation parties are enabled to explicitly propose a closure e.g. by pressing a handshake button. For example when a deal is reached the user presses the button thus confirming the conditions of a sale. The closure can be linked to a transfer of consideration via e.g. a digital wallet service implemented either as hardware software or a combination of both.

Various user interface elements e.g. icons voice commands gestures etc. can be used to declare the outcome of the conversation.

Similarly the user can be prompted by another party to close the deal with a standard or customized user interface element e.g. Do you agree button.

Otherwise at step the system tries to determine whether the conversation is going to be continued. For example parties may decide to continue their conversation at a later time. If that s the case the conversation is kept alive e.g. by assigning it an alive attribute and storing it in a database.

Otherwise from step the system proceeds to close the transaction at step . The process ends at step with the conversation either closed or kept alive.

The process begins with initializing the system with existing live conversations step e.g. by accessing a conversation database using the user ID and or local storage of recent conversations. The conversation database can be distributed and span multiple services including social networks personal professional business private public protected etc. .

At step the system generates a suggestion for continuing at least one conversation. The suggestion can be made based on the last live conversation default user location preferences device context other applications open communications security channels available transaction value priority and other factors.

At step the system decides whether the suggested conversations satisfy the user. If yes the system proceeds to step where the user selects a conversation.

Otherwise the system enables the user to search for a conversation at step . The user can search for a conversation using conversation topics parties involved location information transaction value priority and other factors.

In another implementation the user is enabled to browse a directory and pick a relevant conversation party.

In a yet another implementation the system provides a combination of search and directory access mechanisms. For example when a search for a specific French restaurant doesn t produce any matches the user is presented with a directory of highly rated French restaurants listed in the system. The ratings of the restaurant can be derived from various factors e.g. an average of star ratings from external review services such as Zagat from users who have no relationship to the searcher from the searcher s social network the system s internal ratings based on previous conversations between the restaurant team and other users or a combination of such ratings mechanisms.

If a conversation is found the user goes to step to select a conversation. Otherwise the system notes that no conversation has been selected and proceeds to step described on .

When user selects a conversation at step the system identifies the conversation and sets the mode to Selected True and then transitions to step described on .

The system starts at step by initializing potential conversation parties communication channels and scenarios.

At step the system suggests a number of typical pre defined scenarios e.g. Medical Emergency Security Alert Automobile Insurance Claim Airport Arrival New on the Job New to the Neighborhood Ordering Food Entertainment etc. A particular service provider e.g. listed in the directory can present their own scenarios related to the services typically offered to customers. Default scenarios may differ based on the user s location e.g. determined by GPS functionality. For example when the user is located in the store she may be presented with a May I help you scenario.

In one implementation to directly invoke a predefined scenario the user presses a dedicated hardware or software button or by making an utterance or by performing a pre defined gesture such as moving their hand or eyes in a certain pattern. E.g. in case of danger the user invokes a 911 scenario with a panic button where police would be at least one pre defined party.

In another implementation the system invokes a medical emergency scenario the user s vital signs are communicated to the device from other connected devices such as heart monitor blood pressure monitor etc.

In a yet another implementation the system invokes an Auto Insurance Claim scenario when the user s automobile sends a signal of an accident e.g. when the airbag is deployed or the automobile s security system is triggered or the glass is broken etc.

In a yet another implementation a third party invokes a conversation scenario. For example in a Health Check a medical nurse contacts the user remotely to acquire vital signs for a periodic checkup. Similarly a parent invokes an Everything s Ok scenario when the child is not home at a pre defined time. In all cases the third party can be a human individual an animal an artificial pre programmed agent or a combination of the above.

At step the system decides whether the proposed scenarios are suitable to the situation. In one implementation the user makes the decision. In another implementation the conversation takes place in the background between artificial agents e.g. medical devices that determine whether measured vital signs warrant human intervention. In a yet another implementation the police determine the level of danger based on data from surrounding people and or security cameras.

If the suggested scenario s is ok the system proceeds to step where it selects the scenario. Otherwise the system enables a search for a suitable scenario step .

If the scenario is found step the system proceeds to step Select Scenario . Otherwise the system goes to step and instantiates a blank conversation.

At step the system instantiates a conversation according to the scenario selected at step . A detailed description of step is provided below.

At step the system modifies conversation parties. In one implementation e.g. an auto accident scenario the user chooses to replace the name of his her insurance agent. In another implementation the user chooses to add his her spouse. In a yet another implementation the user chooses to add his her favorite car repair shop. In one more implementation the user chooses to replace a specific person with a business.

At step the system either generates default messages conversation starters to all conversation parties or enables the user to create the messages or a combination of both. A detailed description of step is provided below.

The purpose of the process is to allow the user to create a conversation either from a previous similar conversation of the same scenario or use a blank scenario prototype.

At step the system initiates a look up of a scenario based conversation that can be used as a sample for a new conversation. At step it decides whether it is a new scenario for the user or his her team or his her business. The scope of scenario novelty depends on at least one of the following user preferences conversation experience team and or business affiliation whether the user is human or artificial services involved location timing etc. The system may also apply a security confidentiality and or privacy filter to exclude unauthorized access to data from previous conversations.

In one implementation a business uses a standard scenario for all conversations of a certain scenario type. For example for a new employee orientation message exchange a standard scenario includes mandatory roles of a Human Resources Manager Department Manager IT specialist and Security specialist.

In another implementation potential previous conversations for a given scenario include only conversations of the user s team members. For example an insurance agent uses by default contacts from a previous conversation of his department staff that interacted with the same customer.

In a yet another implementation the user starts a conversation with his doctor s nurse. The conversation by default adds contacts of his spouse doctor and pharmacy.

In a yet another implementation customer support conversations available to the user as prototypes only include those that were marked as highly satisfactory.

If at least one previous conversation with the same scenario is found the system suggests at least one existing conversation at step . After that at step the system decides whether the suggestions are ok e.g. with user preferences or the composition of the parties and selects a prototype conversation at step .

At step the system decides whether to remove all previous message exchanges from the conversation or not. The decision depends e.g. on privacy security confidentiality relevancy and other conditions.

In one implementation the decision is made automatically because the conversation involves financial transactions and user identifying information that the system is not set up to share in an insecure connection environment.

In another implementation the decision is left to the user who can press e.g. a Clear button to remove all conversation elements except the parties involved in the conversation. For example in an auto insurance claim scenario all previous information specific to the accident is removed because it involved a different set of circumstances.

In a yet another implementation the system delegates the decision to a team supervisor or some other third party who is not going to be a part of the conversation unless it is escalated.

If the decision is to remove all exchanges the system instantiates a blank conversation at step registers it with the system and import participants from the prototype conversation. If not the system proceeds further e.g. to step from to allow the user to modify participants both their roles and specific individuals.

If at step the system decides that the scenario is new it instantiates a blank conversation at step registers it with the system and imports suggested party roles according to the scenario without instantiating the actual individuals. That is the user and or his her team are supposed to fill in specific individual contact info to start the conversation.

For example in an Auto Accident scenario the system creates a prototype conversation with roles of Insurance Agent Police My Lawyer Witness 1 Monitoring Service an artificial agent that records all communications in a conversation Repair Shop Medical Service The Other Party and The Other Insurance Agent. The user is supposed to fill in specific names on the next step see description .

If at step suggested conversation is not approved the user is enabled to perform a search within the scope of previous conversations step .

In a yet another implementation the system performs search over conversation within a given time interval in the past e.g. last year.

In one more implementation the system performs search over conversations with people within the same demographic range with the user.

In yet another implementation the system performs search over conversations rated above a certain user satisfaction threshold.

In one more implementation the system performs search over conversations with people who belong to the person s social or business network.

At step the system creates an instance of the conversation with potential parties and roles involved. For example when the user opens the application for the first time the system creates a conversation and populates it with businesses and or community organizations that are preferred by local residents.

In another example when a new employee joins the company the system populates his Say hi conversation with an HR rep and his team members.

In a yet another example after being acquainted with his team the new employee is prompted to Say hi to the customers that his predecessor on the job interacted with most productively.

In one more example an automatic Say hi message is customized depending on the former relationship between the parties including characteristics of the target group and or team.

At step the system proposes default greeting messages to be sent within the conversation. In one implementation the message includes at least one of name address email information phone number working hours etc.

In a yet another implementation the message includes a personal introduction from a friend who referred the user to the service.

In one more implementation the message includes a request for information e.g. What are your working hours What s my budget for the month etc.

At step the system monitors the interaction between parties over a period of time while the user is within a certain location or until a certain condition is met.

At step the system checks whether a reply has been received from at least one of the conversation parties. If yes the system increments the connection level between the parties involved step . Otherwise the system decrements the connection level step or leaves it unchanged.

The connection level can be used to determine the strength of the connection between the user and other parties. For example the next time the user searches for a business service of a certain time only businesses with a certain connection level are included in the search. The system may also take into account whether a human or automated reply has been received.

In one implementation the user is enabled to request only human conversation parties for a given scenario.

The Say Hi process can be used for any introduction to a new situation such as service registration scenario initiation arrival at a location airport online greetings first walk through on a new device to get acquainted with available device features receptionist services and etc.

In one implementation the process is executed in a newcomer mode where the user is completely unfamiliar with the potential conversation parties and needs to learn everything from scratch.

For example when one arrives at Paris CDG airport for the first time his Say hi application proposes conversations with the airport information service a highly rated airport sports bar a money exchange service and his airline s connection service.

In one scenario ratings are derived from reviews and evaluations from the members of the general public derived from 3rd parties e.g. Yelp Amazon etc. The system also enables to use ratings based on feedback from one s social network connections e.g. Facebook friends or friends of friends LinkedIn colleagues followed Twitter feeds etc. In another scenario ratings are derived from reviews and evaluations from the system s users only. Such ratings are preferred because they contain information about outcomes of the conversation such as a sale a thank you message a complaint etc.

In another implementation the process is executed in the local mode where the user assumes an identity of a local person highly experienced in the surroundings.

For example when one moves a new neighborhood in San Francisco the system proposes to him to Say hi to businesses frequented by people with similar preferences and or demographic characteristics. For that purpose the system may initiate a Q A session with the user prior to the arrival. Alternatively the may make inferences from the user s history of transactions and create a model profile to be used in the future.

In a yet another implementation the process is executed in the human mode where the user desires to talk to humans only. In that case the system contacts businesses and or team members who are available in real time.

The insurance claim process involves coordination between multiple parties to arrange for several major steps that include but are not limited to submission of evidence furnishing a police report filing a claim towing the car providing an estimate for repairs and repairing the car.

In case of emergency the conversation can be escalated to all participants or a specific team or a specific member within the team.

To facilitate the transaction Bob uses an implementation of the system of the disclosed technology and creates conversation stream .

In another implementation Bob uses a default Auto Insurance Claim Scenario provided by the system or his Insurance Agent and adds relevant parties.

In a yet another implementation Bob contacts his Insurance Agent via telephone not shown who creates the conversation as a standard means to process customer claims and adds Bob to the conversation.

In one more implementation Police Officer creates the conversation when Witness reports the burglary.

Participants of the conversation are organized as teams. All messages and digital communications conversation fragments e.g. pictures of the car repair estimate document and others become a part of the conversation stream accessible to all team parties. Conversation participants may or may not know each other personally. In the present example Bob knows personally Insurance Agent and Auto Repair Mechanic from previous interactions. Conversations fragments can be sent to individuals as well as teams.

In some implementations all fragments are available to all internal team members. In other implementations conversation fragments are distributed according to pre defined rules. In a yet another implementation conversation fragments are distributed according to predefined rules arranged according to team structure team graph . Team graph can be implemented as flat hierarchical distributed etc.

In one more implementation certain conversation fragments e.g. value tokens are distributed over secure channels only.

All fragments are given at least a time stamp and or a hash value and associated with the conversation ID.

Bob s team comprises himself his wife and his lawyer . The team may use the system separately as a private means to discuss the accident among themselves concurrently with conversation .

Police team comprises Police Officer Records Clerk Surveillance Service and Records Service . Surveillance and Records Services are computer implemented systems artificial individuals enabled to receive process and send conversation fragments.

For example Surveillance Service can be implemented as a digital media database with a conversation interface responsive to structured and or free form queries. In another example Surveillance Service is implemented as a digital photo video camera system with storage. It can be a fixed and or a portable camera or a combination of multiple cameras attached to a building person car helicopter drone etc.

In one more example Surveillance Service can be implemented as a text based system containing reports from private and public sources. In one implementation a system of the disclosed technology can be used as a Surveillance Service gathering inputs fragments from multiple observers human animal artificial .

Records Service provides police reports necessary for processing insurance claims. It can be implemented as a digital document repository with an interface responsive to conversation fragments. For example it can provide detailed police report data based e.g. on report ID accident location information car ID owner suspect police officer and a combination of such multiple identifiers.

Insurance team comprises Insurance Agent Claim Adjustor Claim Service and Wallet Service . Wallet Service is a computer implemented system enabled to process payments e.g. receive instructions send and receive value tokens using the conversation interface. Value tokens can represent currency coupons credits game currency bitcoins affiliation card points etc. The service can be implemented as a third party financial transaction system e.g. digital wallet credit card processing service or as a value transfer subsystem to the conversation system or a combination of both.

Similarly a third party application can use the interface to communicate to the services and consumers. The system is enabled to charge commissions e.g. as a percentage and or fixed and or variable fee for accessing the interface and or concluding transactions.

In an internal implementation case Wallet Service keeps track of considerations users provide in return or advance for products and services. Users are enabled to buy internal credits using official government currencies or other means of payment e.g. loyalty points BitCoins etc.

During the process of Conversation parties exchange multiple conversation fragments and pertaining to the transaction. Communications and user interface components of the system e.g. mobile apps place the fragments into Conversation Stream available to conversation parties on their respective conversation devices such as smartphones tablets digital watches digital glasses television screens computer monitors electronic readers brain computer interfaces equipment control panels etc.

In one example of the Auto Insurance Claim scenario car owner finds his car burglarized. The burglar flees the scene but Witness agrees to confirm the fact of the crime. Owner starts a conversation application on his mobile device and locates Auto Insurance Claim Scenario see description above . Using the Say Hi logic the app proposes to start a conversation with key parties Police Insurance Owner Witness and Auto Repair Shop. Owner asks Witness for some personal information and locates him within the system. The system invites Witness to join the conversation. Since Witness is a registered user Owner doesn t have to provide detailed personal information to the owner. He also doesn t need to provide his account of the accident unless requested later.

Witness leaves the scene. Owner uses a step by step Say Hi process to send customized messages to all parties required to create and process an auto insurance claim. Since the system has Police department registered within the service it locates ID for the Police Officer responsible for the dealing with the claims. Owner notifies Police Officer by typing his message a conversation fragment and inserting pictures conversation fragments of his burglarized car into Conversation . The system is configured to send the conversation fragments to the police officer as well as the entire Police team .

Police Records clerk becomes a party to the conversation as a member of the police team. He adds Records Service to the conversation and requests a police report number which is entered into the conversation.

Since car burglary is not a violent crime the police officer is not required to attend the scene in person. He adds Surveillance Service to the conversation and queries it for street snapshots within the time interval of the crime. After matching time and location of the accident Surveillance Service discovers several videos from street cameras that capture the moment of the crime and extract snapshots from them. The service adds the snapshots conversation fragments to Conversation .

In the meantime the system adds Insurance team to Conversation . Using an interactive process it asks the user for his policy number and other identifying information. Using the information the system locates registered Insurance Agent responsible for processing claims and adds him to the conversation. By the virtue of being added to the conversation the agent is notified of the accident. He also receives information provided by the user police and witness.

The system asks the agent to fill in the default roles of Claim Adjustor Claim Service and Wallet Service . Having located registered persons human and artificial within the system the agent adds them to the conversation.

Claim Service interacts with Owner to gather information about the accident and verify coverage information. Because it knows that Police team and Witness are parties to Conversation it requests and receives information from them within the same conversation. Information exchanges may occur in real time and or asynchronously depending on availability of persons involved.

Once the information necessary for submitting an insurance claim is ready Claim Service notifies Claim Adjustor so that she begins claim valuation process.

In the meantime Owner adds his Wife and his Lawyer to the conversation. He instructs the system that his wife is an active participant while his lawyer is a passive participant. As the result Wife receives all conversation fragments by default while Lawyer will receive them only when Owner instructs the system to share Conversation or any of its fragments explicitly.

Because the owner has an important meeting he asks his wife to contact a repair shop. Wife knows Mechanic . She finds him within the system and adds him to the conversation. Prompted by the system she designates the repair shop where he is employed as Auto Repair Shop team .

The system contacts the shop. Since Mechanic is not available for messages Receptionist interacts with the system to respond to the invitation to join the conversation. She also adds Shop Owner who instructs his staff to tow the car and gives them location information contained in the conversation.

Once the car is delivered to the shop Shop Owner creates a detailed estimate for repairs and adds it to the conversation directing it at Adjustor Owner .

When the adjustor doesn t reply within a day Wife uses the conversation to alert Insurance Agent to the delay. As the result Adjustor contacts Receptionist to schedule a visit to the shop to verify the estimate.

Once the visit is complete and estimate verified Adjustor validates the estimate using Conversation . The system notifies Insurance Agent and Claims Service . Insurance Agent completes the claim process by instructing Wallet Service to transfer money to Wallet Service that belongs to the auto repair shop. In one implementation he sends the instructions as a text fragment in the body of the conversation. In another implementation he drags and drops the amount due on the claim from an icon representing his Wallet Service to an icon representing the shop s Wallet Service. The icons are located on his portable device and displayed next to Conversation Stream .

Car Owner monitors the transactions using the conversation system. He asks Shop Owner to instruct Mechanic to fix the car. When the car is ready Mechanic takes its pictures adds them to the conversation and notifies the owner. Owner arranges with Receptionist to pick up the car.

As the result of the process all parties have access to copies of all documents and transactions. Instead of using various means of communications such as e mail phone web personal interactions they rely on the conversation system to provide an efficient medium for gathering information for the claim processing the claim transferring funds and making sure that the car is fixed.

To make the system even more efficient the system is enabled to use reminder calendar auditing and other automated services. The services are configured to generate reminders if conversation parties are not responsive to certain conversation fragments. That is internal exchanges within a conversation can be timed so that automatic reminders are sent.

For example when Owner sends a message to Insurance Agent he attaches a conditional reminder service timer that generates a repeat if Agent doesn t reply within 24 hrs.

In another example an automated auditing service asks Owner for feedback on the entire transaction and its parties. The owner rates various aspects of the transaction. The service is enabled to evaluate objective information such as claim processing or auto repair duration and combine it with subjective feedback supplied by the user. As a result the system is enabled to compare performance of different parties within the same set of scenarios. It can use the information to suggest a higher rated team car repair shop insurance adjustor etc. during the initial stages of a particular scenario. The system is also enabled to provide information to employers of each team to rate their performance for internal purposes e.g. promotions pay raises recommendations etc.

The scenario involves three teams Buyer Seller and Delivery . The teams interact using Conversation .

Conversation is configured to have multiple sub conversations and . Buyer team uses sub conversation to exchange confidential messages Seller team uses sub conversation for their own confidential messages all teams use sub conversation for joint messages conversation fragments .

In one example the seller team specializes in customized kitchen cabinets. Seller agents are physically located at different locations agent is at the store agent at the manufacturing site. Agent creates open Conversation that indicates to prospective buyers that the store is open for business. Agent registers the conversation with the system of the disclosed technology. After exchanging private messages and agent places an invitation to make an offer in the public domain of the system via sub conversation .

The buyer team discovers the offer by searching the system for kitchen cabinets. Initially Buyer agent uses her mobile phone to browse available deals. When she locates a suitable offer she makes agent a member of her team and after exchanging with him messages and she transfers the conversation to the large screen digital TV in their living room. Both teams exchange messages not shown that include pricing technical graphical video and other information to negotiate the offer. All messages are a part of the same Conversation but split into different sub conversations to avoid confusion among the parties and allow for private discussions of various aspects of the offer.

Finally agent makes an acceptable offer . He adds their Wallet Service to the conversation. Seller Team accepts the offer not shown and adds Delivery Team to Conversation allowing it to interact only through the public sub conversation .

Delivery Agent suggests a possible delivery schedule which agent accepts. After that Wallet Service is instructed to transfer money to Wallet Service .

Automated Deliver Schedule Service finalizes the schedule using sub conversation . Since all parties are enabled to monitor the sub conversations they participate in the process ensuring that the service has information what product packages when how at which price at what time at which location with what notification options are going to be delivered to the buyers. If necessary sellers and participate in the conversation to complete the transaction.

The system enables Seller team to create a separate private sub conversation with its subcontractors to negotiate various aspects of the transaction. In one example they use the sub conversation to discuss technical aspects. In another example they use the sub conversation to distribute money among the participants. In a yet another example they use the sub conversation to discuss customer complaints when scheduled delivery doesn t take place on time or has other discrepancies from the original agreement.

In some implementations the system enables Buyer team to divide money between the parties in the public sub conversation . For example they are enabled to allocate tips per team member or between different sub contractors depending on the level of service provided.

The system enables efficient transactions because it covers end to end conversations associated with the order. All teams are enabled to review the conversation at a later time.

For example the supervisor of the seller team may evaluate negotiation tactics used by the team. In another example the supervisor may request and receive aggregated parameters from multiple buyer teams to see how much conversation time and effort it takes to negotiate a transaction with a particular seller team. That is since all sub conversations belong to the same conversation the system enables statistical analysis of transactions across multiple buyers sellers and their sub contractors. The supervisor may use the information to create a high level control dashboard to monitor transactions using interactive graphical interfaces across different teams locations types of products etc. The supervisor is also enabled to add team members and or incentives if she concludes that the conversation is not proceeding well.

The conversation records can be used for customer support dispute resolution product returns re negotiations repeat purchases incentive offers training sessions etc.

User interfaces in the system are enabled to browse e.g. using scroll interface on a multi touch display with a swipe gesture each sub conversation synchronously or separately. For example when agent wants to review her private conversations with agent she can independently go back over sub conversation without affecting the representation of sub conversation either on her own device or on everybody else s device. In one implementation to enable a broader view of the conversation the interface displays multiple threads and scrolling options when the user turns it e.g. from portrait to landscape mode.

According to the scenario traveler flies for the first time from San Francisco airport SFO to Paris Charles De Gaulle airport CDG . Upon arrival the traveler starts his mobile application that serves as an interface to the conversation system. He activates the Say Hi scenario for the airport by hitting Say Hi soft button on the device. The system creates a new composite conversation comprising 5 independent sub conversations through .

By default the system creates a team for the traveler adding instances of Say hi and Wallet services. In one implementation the system detects popular businesses at the location. In another implementation the system is pre configured with certain business instances by the user before the flight. In a yet another implementation the system adds teams in an interactive mode asking the traveler whether he wants to connect.

First Airport Information Service replies with a welcome message containing an airport map border and customs notes and locations of restrooms restaurants and major duty free stores. If desired the user can initiate a conversation Say Hi with any of the restaurants or stores. In one implementation the message is customized with the traveler s language age gender other explicitly or implicitly expressed general preferences. In another implementation the system communicates to service the traveler s system ID which the service uses to obtain his travel preferences from a remote database. In a yet another implementation the traveler picks specific questions from a menu suggested by his Say Hi service . In one more implementation a third party not shown guides the user in selecting asking and replying to messages from Airport Info Service . This interactive mode is implemented using either sub conversation or a different sub conversation. Service is enabled to offer incentives such as coupons and discounts which can be transferred between different sub conversations e.g. by dragging and dropping them on the application user interface. The system is enabled to analyze effectiveness of incentives provide feedback to the service providers and adjust them to improve effectiveness.

Second an Air France customer service representative replies with message placed into sub conversation . In this scenario the traveler s initial message contained his frequent flyer information therefore message contains connecting gate and time data. The traveler is enabled to interact with the service and he replies with question . Other message exchanges may take place within the sub conversation not shown . In one implementation Say Hi service sends traveler s system ID which allows representative to locate the traveler s frequent flyer information and other personal data allowed to be shared in this scenario. The representative is enabled to customize her messages similar to the customization options described earlier.

The user is enabled to authorize or de authorize a specific person and or team to access personal information. The authorization can be applied at different levels team relationship conversation and or conversation fragment.

Third an automated message from Say Hi service arrives. It contains default information about Sports Bar team the information includes location menu and popular game schedule for the next two hours. Service is a 24 7 part of the Sports Bar team. It is configured to reply to standard Say Hi requests in languages preferred by the travelers. Most travelers contact the bar using their conversation app rather than the more traditional web interface.

Traveler replies with message asking to reserve a spot in front of the big TV in 30 minutes. Since the automated service can t understand the message it is routed to waiter who replies with message confirming the reservation.

Fourth a reply message from Bank team arrives to sub conversation . The message contains foreign exchange information. The traveler uses his Wallet Service to exchange money certificate . The Bank s Currency Exchange Service replies with message confirming the exchange. The message represents a receipt that can be moved to the traveler s expense report conversation not shown started when his manager authorized the trip. The user interface of the application supports drag and drop hold and search e.g. using a pop up menu and other types of interactions for conversation navigation.

As discussed in description the system is enabled to increment successful interaction counts so that the next time the traveler arrives to the airport his conversations are automatically connected to preferred teams individuals services.

In some implementations the system keeps track of user interactions and suggests teams individuals services with high connection levels across users of a certain demographic group or other type of group or personal preferences.

No reply comes from Family Graph team . The team represents a segment of the traveler s extended family that lives in Paris. The system forms the team based on the traveler s information submitted in his preferences imported through social networks email and other mechanisms. Unfortunately for the traveler nobody among his distant relatives is online. Since he doesn t know them personally or is not aware of their plans message is sent to the entire virtual team.

In other scenarios the traveler is enabled to browse Family Graph before the flight and identify individuals that he would like to contact upon arrival. Based on his preferences message can be sent to specific selected individuals or the entire graph. Similarly the traveler can send a Say Hi message to his social or business graph or a combination of any members of both.

As discussed above user interface allows the traveler to interact with each sub conversation independently. Also he has an option of joining or splitting sub conversations. For example he joins sub conversations and to discuss with the airline and bar waiter whether he has enough time to for a glass of wine before the connecting flight.

The traveler is also enabled to transfer money from his Wallet Service to the Sports Bar team via Bank .

Traveler has a mobile user device which is enabled to interact with the rest of the devices and services in the system using client interface which is responsible for attaching the device to the rest of the system. The interface supports system APIs necessary for transferring data from the user device to the rest of the system. An application hosted by the device uses the APIs to communicate e.g. user ID conversation ID conversation fragments network ID e.g. IP and or MAC addresses and other information relevant to the interaction. For example the application may initialize with user ID when the traveler logs onto the system. When the traveler starts a new conversation the application requests and receives a conversation ID e.g. using Instantiate Blank process which is associated with the traveler and his device. The application is enabled to store conversation IDs for a certain number of recent and or open conversations depending on the amount of memory available on the device. The application is also enabled to receive a conversation fragment using a conversation ID. In some implementations the application is enabled to receive a conversation ID as a result of a search of a subset of user conversations e.g. by text names of other users team composition pictures videos time interval etc. The application is also enabled to get team composition graph using a conversation ID.

Bar waiter also has a communication device with system interface . Device interacts with the rest of the system in a manner very similar to device . Because the device belongs to a business in some implementations it is allowed to interact with the system over a secure channel only. In other implementations it is required to do a two factor user authentication. In another implementation it is enabled to use network and software interfaces with different levels of security requirements. For example when user participates in one conversation as a consumer and in another conversation as a member of a business team the latter conversation is required to go over a secure channel.

Services and others interact with the system using instances of Service Interface . The interface enables conversion of internal representations of service information to conversation format. For example Airport Information Service has information in HTML format. When interacting with the system of the disclosed technology it uses interface to convert it to text format. In another example Wallet Service uses interface to encrypt currency values before transferring it between different user and business team accounts.

Other services can be easily added to the system for originating capturing processing augmenting adding and manipulating conversation fragments based on user team business security location and other meta information. In one embodiment each fragment is assigned at least one semantic type such as text time picture money etc. The interface uses the type to convert the fragment to its service s internal data type and back

In some scenarios team is formed on a per project basis. Nevertheless the conversation contains contact information of the team members so that any one or all of them can be contacted in the future e.g. with customer complaints project review and other messages.

In other scenarios team represents a formal organization e.g. a sales department customer support group university faculty etc.

On conversations are represented by two way arrows e.g. . Conversations may include but not limited to digital interactions transfer of goods and services value tokens currency tokens as well as other types of consideration. Interactions may include representations about products services user preferences and various states of affairs in the system. Interaction may also include directives i.e. instructions from conversation participants to perform certain actions such as value transfers product transfers orders etc. Interactions may include comissive statements such as promises offers and others. Interactions may also include expressive statements such as complaints thanks apologies etc. In addition Interactions may include declarations such as appointments announcements joint agreements etc.

In the food order example above Business team provides representations of plates and drinks on the menu. Consumer describes his preferences asks for advice and places orders. He also promises a payment and thanks for the prompt service. Business team members can also place orders e.g. to Sub contractor and or third party service . They can promise transfer of currency and or value tokens e.g. coupons loyalty points etc.

In another example Consumer interacts with Business e.g. insurance agency. He knows Employee personally and contacts him directly via connection . As the conversation progresses the consumer has to transfer money in return for a payment at a later date e.g. for medical services from a third party. Although the relationship between the consumer and the employee is personal the promise of payment is between the consumer and Business . Both interactions and can be a part of the same conversation. The conversation can involve other employees of Business .

By contrast Consumer has only business relationship with team . Nevertheless he can proceed to create a conversation. In the process of the conversation he can establish a personal working relationship and next time contact a specific team member directly. When a specific employee leaves his her team the relationship remains with the team. A replacement employee is enabled to access the relationship and evaluate its characteristics.

Similarly employees may or may not have direct individual relationships with other employees. Nevertheless they can do business with teams by locating them e.g. by search directory or reference from other conversation participants. For example relationship between business and sub contractor is impersonal.

In another example business Employee and Sub contractor employee have a personal working relationship. When Consumer interacts with business which requires services of Sub Contractor Employee gets involved to facilitate the conversation. The involvement is implemented e.g. by adding the employee to the conversation either privately within his team or so that the consumer can see the employee s involvement. Various mechanisms to involve multiple parties in a conversation are discussed above e.g. in relationship to .

Characteristics of a connection are stored in a memory e.g. database service not shown . Such characteristics may include absolute values e.g. number of conversations between parties number volume of product service items transacted amount of value tokens transferred amount of currency payments transferred. In other implementations characteristics include relative values e.g. ratio between currency value of transactions and number of conversations average of conversation fragments per conversation ratio of goods services per conversation etc. The system is enabled to provide information and evaluate employee and or team performance based on connection characteristics.

Similarly a consumer in the system can be characterized by his her connections e.g. by automatically assigning priority conversations with higher ratios of currency value to a business. For example when consumers and initiate conversation with business consumer is given a preference because he has a personal connection with employee . Alternatively the system may assign a higher priority to a new customer e.g. because the connection with the existing customer has a value ratio below threshold. The system may identify consumers with high level of experience and include them in conversations when business team members are not available to provide advice e.g. outside the office hours. Such consumers can be treated as virtual team members and provided with incentives to answer questions and transact with other consumers on behalf of the team.

In some implementations connections are evaluated statistically over a population in at least one of the categories of employees teams businesses organizations consumers etc. For example Consumer Cluster is created by aggregating consumers using a calculated value of expected ratio of money spent per conversation. The cluster can be created and or adjusted by evaluating connections between consumers in a third party social graph e.g. Facebook LinkedIn Twitter Google and other social networks.

In some implementations external relationships are mapped to internal relationship and user identities friends presented as internal and or transparent for creating and exchanging messages.

User device see discussion for more detail initiates conversation see discussion for more detail . Examples of user device include a smartphone personal area network accessory such Google Glass tablet PC laptop Point of Sale terminal TV Set Top Box STB game console GPS device HVAC control panel etc.

Fragments of the conversation go another user device tablet and data center associated with a Wallet Service. Devices and are members of the same team members of which can exchange conversations between themselves.

At the same time Conversation is copied to memory which is associated with conversation evaluation service that computes and or statistically predicts conversation ratios.

In some implementations tablet belongs to a team supervisor who also has access to service . The access is provided on a subscription or pay per use basis. The supervisor evaluates this and other conversations using a visual dashboard on tablet that shows performance of the team e.g. measured in value generated and or consumer satisfaction measurements received.

Conversation results in an agreement. According to the agreement business sends goods to the user while the user sends consideration e.g. money to the business. The consideration is directed to Service and credited to the team. In some implementations the user is enabled to divide the consideration between team members. For example when giving a tip after a meal at a restaurant the user allocates money between the cook waiter and kitchen staff.

To avoid bank fees such as currency conversion users are enabled to use internal credits in lieu of consideration and exchange the credits into preferred currency if necessary.

Service is used for discovery and routing conversations between users in the system. It contains real time as well as historical information about the network personal preferences and device configurations time of conversation. The service can be used for pre configured standard scenarios e.g. involved in secure conversations.

Users access a conversation using their personal computing device such a PC laptop gaming console in car computer system etc. or their personal smart phone . Communications about a conversation can be sent directly to the hosting server through the API . If another participant performs some task related to a conversation in which the user is involved worker software operated by the server detects the communication and provides a notification to the user s computing device .

A web application monitors communications from a user s or a conversation participant s computing device. If the communication is directed to a conversation the web application notifies a messaging broker application such as RabbitMQ from Pivotal that allows communications to be sent and received from different applications. Documents photographs consideration etc. for a transaction that is the subject of a conversation can be sent between participants and messages confirming the transmission and receipt of such items are stored in the database .

The software program also interfaces with the wallet exchange program not shown that is associated with conversation participants. In this manner the software program confirms the transfer of consideration between participants in order to detect if a transaction has been completed and to keep records of a transaction.

In some cases supervisors can access the database with their own computing device not shown to determine how a transaction is progressing. Such supervisors could be managers of a sales team physicians monitoring their patients and nurses insurance claim adjusters etc. A user can leave feedback regarding a conversation that is stored in the database and used by the supervisor to rate its sales team or improve future service.

If a user wishes to purchase a particular hardware item a new conversation can be started between the user and an employee at a hardware store. The store is copied on the message and a supervisor can forward the message to another employee if the original employee is no longer working at the store. Records of the interactions that make up the conversation are stored on the database . The user can complete a transaction from their computing device to initiate the transfer of consideration from their account to the hardware store using their wallet exchange. A record of the consideration transfer is kept on the database for return exchange purposes. A supervisor can inspect all the transactions from a particular store to determine the effectiveness of its sales team to spot trends in consumer purchases etc.

Once a user is registered with the system the application keeps a record of an identification number for the user s computing device and messages to the user for a new or existing conversation are sent to the address of the computing device.

The computing device is able to display the conversations by subject or other identifier so that the user is able to view all portions of a conversation as well as the underlying documents. In some cases the database keeps track of items that need to be completed in order to finalize a transaction. For example in home ownership a buyer may want to pre qualify for a mortgage. Several papers are required to be provided to the bank in order to pre qualify and the database can keep track of what papers have been provided and which are still outstanding. Other aspects of a home purchase such as an earnest money check inspection sign off etc. can be shown to the participants so that the participants can easily view what steps are left to complete.

The checklist of documents required can be pre determined based on the type of transaction that the user wants to complete. In addition participants in the conversation may be able to add or subtract from the list of documents required based on the particular circumstances of the matter at hand.

On the user s computing device communications to another conversation participant include an ID or other code that identifies the particular conversation. The ID or code is read by the web application to route the communication to the appropriate participants and to store a record of the communication in the database . The user s computing device produces a user interface that lists individual conversations that the user is involved in or has completed. Be selecting a particular conversation the computing device retrieves communications stored for that conversation. In addition documents for the transaction associated with the conversation can also be retrieved or viewed as well as any checklist of items to be completed. The user interface allows a user to invite additional people or services into a conversation and to set rules for how much of the conversation the new participant is able to see.

From the foregoing it will be appreciated that specific embodiments of the disclosed technology have been described herein for purposes of illustration but that various modifications may be made without deviating from the scope of the disclosed technology. Accordingly the disclosed technology is not limited except as by the appended claims.
