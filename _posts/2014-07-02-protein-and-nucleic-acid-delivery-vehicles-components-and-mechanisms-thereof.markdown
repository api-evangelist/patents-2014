title: Protein and nucleic acid delivery vehicles, components and mechanisms thereof
abstract: Complex viruses are assembled from simple protein subunits by sequential and irreversible assembly. During genome packaging in bacteriophages, a powerful molecular motor assembles at the special portal vertex of an empty prohead to initiate packaging. An aspect of the invention relates to the phage T4 packaging machine being highly promiscuous, translocating DNA into finished phage heads as well as into proheads. Single motors can force exogenous DNA into phage heads at the same rate as into proheads and phage heads undergo repeated initiations, packaging multiple DNA molecules into the same head. This shows that the phage DNA packaging machine has unusual conformational plasticity, powering DNA into an apparently passive capsid receptacle, including the highly stable virus shell, until it is full. These features allow for the design of a novel class of nanocapsid delivery vehicles.

No. 8 802 418 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 322 334 entitled a A Promiscuous DNA Packaging Machine from Bacteriophage T4 filed Apr. 9 2010.

The United States Government has rights in this invention pursuant to funding obtained from the National Institutes of Health NIH grant NIBIB 1R21 EB009869 01 and National Science Foundation grant MCB 0923873.

The present invention relates generally to protein and nucleic acid delivery components compositions mechanisms and methods of delivery thereof.

The packaging competency of a matured capsid shell has not been discovered. There is still much to be desired for improved vehicles of gene therapy especially for platforms that can deliver both nucleic acids and proteins. Outstanding issues relate to inefficiency of gene packaging low amounts of genetic material being delivered poor targeting and lack of tissue specificity. Other methods being employed for delivery of nucleic acids and proteins have a number of limitations for example the injection of naked DNA has very low expression electroporation has a high rate of cell death associated with it many viral vectors can only carry a small amount of nucleic acid for delivery and there may be dose related toxicity associated with cationic liposomal delivery. There is a need for a platform to be developed that addresses these issues.

According one broad aspect the present invention provides a method comprising the following steps a attaching a packaging motor to a carrier and b transferring an exogenous material into an inner compartment of the carrier to thereby form a packaging machine.

Where the meaning of terms departs from the commonly used meaning of the term applicant intends to utilize the terminology provided below unless specifically indicated.

For purposes of the present invention the term bacteriophage component refers to bacteriophages and bacteriophage derivatives including bacteriophages and bacteriophage derivatives having antigens fusion proteins and other types of molecules attached thereto. For example the term T4 bacteriophage component refers to T4 bacteriophages and T4 bacteriophage derivatives.

For purposes of the present invention the term bacteriophage derivative refers to any structure including at least part of the protein coat of a bacteriophage. An example of a bacteriophage derivative is where foreign DNA is packaged into a customized bacteriophage s genome is described for example in Jiang et al. Display of a PorA Peptide form on the Bacteriophage T4 Capsid surface 65 4770 77 1997 Clark J R and March J B Bacteriophage mediated nucleic acid immunization 40 21 26 2004 and March et al.

Another example of a bacteriophage derivative is a bacteriophage capsid. Another example of a bacteriophage derivative is a bacteriophage tail. In one embodiment of the present invention foreign DNA may be loaded into empty T4 capsids using the methods described in Kondabagil et al. The DNA translocating ATPase Of bacteriophage T4 packaging motor 363 786 99 2006 the entire contents and disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.

For purposes of the present invention the term bind the term binding and the term bound refers to any type of chemical or physical binding which includes but is not limited to covalent binding hydrogen binding electrostatic binding biological tethers transmembrane attachment cell surface attachment and expression.

For purposes of the present invention the term biological sample and the term biological specimen refers to either a part or the whole of a human animal microbe or plant in vitro or in vivo. The term includes but is not limited to material of human animal microbe or plant origin such as human animal microbial or plant tissue sections cell or tissue cultures suspension of human animal microbial or plant cells or isolated parts thereof human or animal biopsies blood samples cell containing fluids and secretion.

For purposes of the present invention the term capsid coat protein refers to the proteins that come together in many copies to form a capsid shell of a virus. For example the T4 bacteriophage capsid is constituted by 930 copies of a single major capsid protein gp23 46 kDa . The capsid also consists of 55 copies of another minor capsid protein located at eleven of the 12 vertices one pentamer at each vertex of the minor capsid protein gp24 42 kDa . Structural studies have established that two additional proteins namely Hoc Highly antigenic outer capsid protein 40 kDa and Soc Small outer capsid protein 9 kDa are added onto the capsid after completion of capsid assembly Hoc is present up to 155 copies per capsid particle whereas Soc is present up to 810 copies per capsid particle. These proteins may be considered nonessential. Mutations in either of the genes or in both the genes do not affect phage production phage viability phage infectivity or phage stability under normal experimental conditions. However Hoc and Soc provide additional stability to the capsid under extreme environmental conditions. Capsid coat proteins of the T4 bacteriophage and other phages are described for example in U.S. Patent Application. No. 2005 0226892 to Rao entitled Methods and compositions comprising bacteriophage nanoparticles published Oct. 13 2005 the entire contents and disclosure of which in incorporated herein by reference.

For purposes of the present invention the term capsid and the term capsid shell refers to the protein shell of a virus comprising several structural subunits of proteins. The capsid encloses the nucleic acid core of the virus. The terms prehead prohead or procapsid partial head or partially filled head full head and phage head in singular or plural form refer to different stages of maturity of the viral capsid shell. Prehead refers to a capsid shell of precise dimensions or an isometric capsid that is initially assembled often with a single type of protein subunit polymerizing around a protein scaffold. When the protein scaffolding is removed creating an empty space inside the capsid shell the structure is referred to as a prohead or a procapsid. Partial head full head and phage head all refer to capsids that reach a stage of maturation that makes them larger stabler particles associated with DNA. The term partial head refers to a mature capsid shell that either has only a portion of DNA packaged into it or it may refer to a mature capsid shell that was once packed full with DNA and then the DNA releases from the shell to leave only a small portion of DNA behind. The term full head refers to a mature capsid shell that is fully packed with DNA. Full heads can pack up to 105 of the bacteriophage genome. This is about 165 170 kb for T4 bacteriophages. Similarly capsids of other viruses can also be packaged to accommodate more than their genomic volume. The capsid may or may not be enveloped. The maturation process of capsids in bacteriophages like HK97 is described for example in Lata et al. Maturation Dynamics of a Viral Capsid Visualization of Transitional Intermediate States 100 2 253 263 2000 as well as in Gertsman et al. An unexpected twist in viral capsid maturation 458 646 50 2009 and in bacteriophages like T4 in Rao et al. Structure and assembly of bacteriophage T4 head 7 356 2010 by reference.

For purposes of the present invention the term epitope refers to the smallest part of an antigen moiety recognizable by the combining site of an immunoglobulin.

For purposes of the present invention the term exogenous material refers to material that originates outside the organism of concern or material that may be isolated from a organism manipulated to any extent externally and then reintroduced into its natural environment or the environment from which it was isolated. Exogenous material includes but is not limited to nucleic acids proteins polymeric compounds particulate matter and artificially synthesized material. For example exogenous nucleic acid refers to any nucleic acid DNA or RNA or fragments thereof either single or double stranded that originates outside of the organism of concern or was isolated from the organism modified and reintroduced into the organism. Exogenous DNA present in a host cell may be derived from a source organism cloned into a vector and then introduced into a host cell.

For purposes of the present invention the term immune response refers to a specific response of the immune system of an animal to antigen or immunogen. Immune response may include the production of antibodies and cellular immunity.

For purposes of the present invention the term immunity refers to a state of resistance of a subject animal including a human to an infecting organism or substance. It will be understood that an infecting organism or substance is defined broadly and includes parasites toxic substances cancer cells and other cells as well as bacteria and viruses. A Therapeutically Effective Immunization Course see below for definition will produce the immune response.

For purposes of the present invention the term immunization conditions refers to factors that affect an immune response including the amount and kind of immunogen or adjuvant delivered to a subject animal including a human method of delivery number of inoculations interval of inoculations the type of subject animal and its condition. Vaccine refers to pharmaceutical formulations able to induce immunity.

For purposes of the present invention the term immunization dose refers to the amount of antigen or immunogen needed to precipitate an immune response. This amount will vary with the presence and effectiveness of various adjuvants. This amount will vary with the animal and the antigen immunogen and or adjuvant but will generally be between about 0.1 g ml or less and about 100 g per inoculation. The immunization dose is easily determined by methods well known to those skilled in the art such as by conducting statistically valid host animal immunization and challenge studies as described for example Manual of Clinical Immunology H. R. Rose and H. Friedman American Society for Microbiology Washington D.C. 1980 tithe entire contents and disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. In some instances several immunization doses including booster doses may administered to provide immunity and For purposes of the present invention such a course of treatment is collectively referred to as Therapeutically Effective Immunization Course .

For purposes of the present invention the term immunogen and the term immunogenic refers to a substance or material including antigens that is able to induce an immune response alone or in conjunction with an adjuvant. Both natural and synthetic substances may be immunogens. An immunogen is generally a protein peptide polysaccharide nucleoprotein lipoprotein synthetic polypeptide or hapten linked to a protein peptide polysaccharide nucleoprotein lipoprotein or synthetic polypeptide or other bacterial viral or protozoal fractions. It will be understood that immunogen or a composition that is immunogenic includes substances e.g. small peptides that do not generate an immune response or generate only a therapeutically ineffective immune response unless associated with an adjuvant. For purposes of the present invention such immunogens are referred to as adjuvant obligatory immunogens.

Liposomes may also contain glycolipids. Aspects of liposomes are further described in U.S. Patent Application No. 2008 0274533 to Alving et al entitled T4 Bacteriophage Bound to a Substrate published Nov. 6 2008 the entire contents and disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.

For purposes of the present invention the term neck protein and the term tail protein refers to proteins that are involved in the assembly of any part of the necks or tails of a virus particle in particular bacteriophages. Tailed bacteriophages belong to the order Caudovirales and include three families The Siphoviridae have long flexible tails and constitute the majority of the tailed viruses. Myoviridae have long rigid tails and are fully characterized by the tail sheath that contracts upon phage attachment to bacterial host. The smallest family of tailed viruses are podoviruses phage with short leg like tails . For example in T4 bacteriophage gp10 associates with gp11 to forms the tail pins of the baseplate. Tail pin assembly is the first step of tail assembly. The tail of bacteriophage T4 consists of a contractile sheath surrounding a rigid tube and terminating in a multiprotein baseplate to which the long and short tail fibers of the phage are attached. Once the heads are packaged with DNA the proteins gp13 gp14 and gp15 assemble into a neck that seals of the packaged heads with gp13 protein directly interacting with the portal protein gp20 following DNA packaging and gp14 and gp15 then assembling on the gp13 platform. Neck and tail proteins in T4 bacteriophage may include but are not limited to proteins gp6 gp25 gp53 gp8 gp10 gp11 gp7 gp29 gp27 gp5 gp28 gp12 gp9 gp48 gp54 gp3 gp18 gp19 gp13 gp14 gp15 and gp63. Aspects of the neck and tail assembly proteins in T4 bacteriophage and other viruses are described further for example in Rossmann et al.

For purposes of the present invention the term non naturally occurring or isolated refers to the component of interest being at least substantially free from at least one other component with which it is naturally associated in nature and as found in nature.

For purposes of the present invention the term packaging machine refers to the complete packaging unit including the compartment the motor and the component or any other attachment mechanism that connects the motor to the compartment. For example the T4 packaging machine comprises the shell the procapsid made primarily of gp23 the vertex portal protein dodecameric gp20 and the gp17 packaging motor. The T4 DNA packaging machine is further described for example in Zhang et al. A promiscuous DNA packaging machine from bacteriophage t49 2 310000592 2011 and in Rao et al. DNA Packaging in Bacteriophage T4 Landes Bioscience 2000 the entire contents and disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.

For purposes of the present invention the term packaging motor refers to a molecular motor or a molecular machine that is capable of using chemical energy to drive the mechanical translocation of a nucleic acid and package the nucleic acid into a compartment. For example the packaging motor in T4 bacteriophage uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to translocate and package DNA into the capsid shell. The packaging motor may be a protein complex comprising one or more protein subunits and have enzymatic activities that help package nucleic acids which include but are not limited to ATPase nuclease and translocase. For example T4 bacteriophage packaging motor refers to a large terminase protein the pentameric gene product gp 17. The term packaging motor may also be considered to encompass additional proteins that regulate or enhance the activity of the actual motor. For example the T4 packaging motor may also include a small terminase protein gp 16. The T4 DNA packaging motor is further described in for example Sun et al. The structure of the phage T4 DNA packaging motor suggests a mechanism dependent on electrostatic forces Cell 135 7 1251 62 2008 by reference.

For purposes of the present invention the term peptide like refers to short chain peptides as well as proteins lipoproteins and glycoproteins but will also for convenience include non proteinaceous molecules for example amino acid containing molecules. In certain embodiments the peptide like therapeutic agent may additionally comprise vitamins steroids azidothymidine and free primaquine in addition to other agents. One useful class of peptides is immunomodulators such as interleukins colony stimulating factors and interferons. Another useful class of proteins is antigens and immunogens such as are used in vaccines.

For purposes of the present invention the term purified refers to the component in a relatively pure state e.g. at least about 90 pure or at least about 95 pure or at least about 98 pure.

For purposes of the present invention the term virus particle refers to viruses and virus like organisms.

The present invention may be understood more readily by reference to the following detailed description of specific embodiments included herein. Although the present invention has been described with reference to specific details of certain embodiments thereof it is not intended that such details should be regarded as limitations upon the scope of the invention. The entire text of the references mentioned herein and references cited within them are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties including U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 322 334 entitled a A Promiscuous DNA Packaging Machine from Bacteriophage T4 filed Apr. 9 2010.

Phage T4 is a prototype for tailed bacteriophages the most abundant organisms on the planet as well as for large eukaryotic viruses such as herpes viruses. These viruses encode powerful machines to package their genomes tightly inside an icosahedral shaped capsid head . Packaging into the capsid occurs via a dodecameric portal localized in one of the vertexes of the capsid. Packaging requires precise orchestration of a series of steps assembly of an empty prohead concatemer cutting and attachment of the motor DNA complex to the portal vertex ATP fueled DNA translocation until the head is full DNA cutting to terminate packaging detachment of the motor and sealing of the packaged head by neck assembly. Sequential conformational changes particularly in the portal are thought to drive these transitions such that assembly proceeds directionally and irreversibly.

In one embodiment the present invention takes advantage of the new discovered fact that the phage T4 packaging machine on various capsids is highly promiscuous translocating DNA into proheads but also unexpectedly into previously filled virus heads. Other studies have shown that in filled viral capsids the structure of the portal is fundamentally altered and it was thought that the packaging mechanism on full heads would be irreversible. An aspect of the invention relates to the showing that full heads or heads that are emptied of most of their packaged DNA can reassemble the packaging machine and use it to re fill the capsid with any DNA molecules.

These results challenge the classic sequential virus assembly models suggest an explanation for the evolution of viral genomes that fit capsid volume and point the way to a novel nanocapsid delivery system in which the viral packaging machine portal and motor could be used to translocate DNA and other therapeutic molecules into synthetic capsids.

In one embodiment the present invention provides a T4 bacteriophage component being used as a carrier to deliver nucleic acids and or proteins of interest.

In one embodiment the present invention provides a packaging motor that is a T4 bacteriophage packaging motor.

In one embodiment the present invention provides a T4 packaging motor that can associate with a liposomal vesicle to package nucleic acids into the liposomal vesicle.

In one embodiment the present invention provides a packaging motor that can associate with any compartment to which it is capable of attaching and package nucleic acids to the full volume capacity of the compartment.

In one embodiment the present invention provides a multiuse type of delivery vehicle that can be packaged with nucleic acids and attached to proteins of interest.

Tailed bacteriophages are ubiquitously distributed in nature and are the most abundant organisms on the planet as referred to in Hendrix Evolution the long evolutionary reach of viruses 9 R914 R917 1999 . These in particular bacteriophage T4 are excellent models to elucidate the mechanisms of DNA condensation and decondensation in living organisms. The virion consists of a head into which the genome is packaged and a tail that delivers the genome into the bacterial cell. The head is pressurized to 6 MPa equivalent to more than ten times the pressure inside a bottle of champagne because of the packing of highly negatively charged relatively rigid double stranded DNA dsDNA to near crystalline density 500 g ml further described in Smith et al.

The phage T4 packaging motor is the fastest and most powerful reported to date. It generates 60 pN of force and packages at a rate of up to 2 000 bp s. The motor is composed of a large terminase protein gp17 70 kDa and a small terminase protein gp16 18 kDa as described in Rao et al. Cloning overexpression and purification of the terminase proteins gp16 and gp17 of bacteriophage T4. Construction of a defined in vitro DNA packaging system using purified terminase proteins 200 475 88 1988 . gp17 contains all the enzymatic activities necessary for DNA packaging ATPase nuclease and translocase as described in Leffers et al. Biochemical characterization of an ATPase activity associated with the large packaging subunit gp17 from bacteriophage T4 J. 275 37127 136 2000 Rentas et al.

Isolation and characterization of T4 bacteriophage gp17 terminase a large subunit multimer with enhanced ATPase activity 278 4618 27 2003 . Five molecules of gp17 assemble on the portal forming a pentameric motor with a central translocation channel that is continuous with the portal channel as described in Sun et al. The structure of the phage T4 DNA packaging motor suggests a mechanism dependent on electrostatic forces 135 1251 1262 2008 . Gp16 a putative 11 mer regulates gp17 s activities but its location on the packaging machine is unknown as described in van Duijn Current limitations in native mass spectrometry based structural biology 21 971 78 2010 and Al Zahrani et al. The small terminase gp16 of bacteriophage T4 is a regulator of the DNA packaging motor 284 24490 500 2009 . Structural and biochemical studies suggest that packaging is driven by the electrostatic force generated by the motor alternating between relaxed and tensed conformational states.

A fundamental feature of virus assembly is sequential assembly in which simple components assemble in a strict sequence to generate a complex nanomachine with unique biological properties. Each assembly step generates a new site or conformational state to which the next component binds with exquisite specificity essentially irreversibly as described in Wood Bacteriophage T4 morphogenesis as a model for assembly of subcellular structure 55 353 67 1980 . A series of such steps as documented by studies in phage T4 referred to in King Assembly of the tail of bacteriophage T432 231 62 1968 and numerous other viruses leads to rapid and high fidelity assembly of a complex infectious virion as described in Casjens et al. Control mechanisms in dsDNA bacteriophage assembly Volume 1 Calendar editor New York Plenum Press 15 91 1988 . In phage T4 this process assembles virions approaching a theoretical infection efficiency of 1.

The sequence of steps in the head morphogenesis of phage T4 in vivo as well as in other phages and dsDNA viruses e.g. herpes viruses is as follows i assembly of the packaging motor on a nascent unexpanded empty prohead step A of ii expansion of the capsid after about 10 25 of the genome is packaged step B of iii packaging until the head is full iv cutting of DNA and dissociation of the motor step C of and v assembly of neck proteins to seal the packaged heads step D of . Conformational changes in the portal are reported to drive these sequential irreversible transitions the portal goes through different conformational states in each stage 

An advantageous aspect of the invention relates to the assembly of the phage T4 genome packaging machine not strictly adhering to the paradigm of sequential and irreversible steps motor refers to pentameric gp17 whereas machine refers to the complete packaging unit including shell gp23 portal and motor . Results show that the assembly of the phage T4 packaging machine is highly promiscuous and does not discriminate as to the type of head it assembles on. In one embodiment of the invention the motor can translocate into the phage head either the DNA full head step G of or the once full but DNA ejected head step F of . In fact the latter shows 5 to 10 fold greater packaging efficiency than the prohead. This is the first report demonstrating that a finished virus shell can reassemble the packaging machine and repackage any DNA. Single molecule optical tweezers experiments are used to show another embodiment of the invention that the packaging rate of phage head assembled packaging machines is similar to that of machines assembled on packaging na ve proheads. Single molecule fluorescence measurements show a further embodiment of the invention that the mature phage heads catalyze repeated packaging initiations encapsidating multiple DNA molecules within the same head. An advantageous embodiment of the invention is that the phage T4 DNA packaging machine has unusual conformational plasticity powering genome translocation into a passive capsid receptacle regardless of its maturation stage. These features may have driven the evolution of headful measured genomes in dsDNA viruses and may offer avenues to further embodiments of the invention like the design novel nanodevices that can transport DNA therapeutics and vaccines into cells.

One of the central themes in virus assembly is sequential and irreversible assembly. Assembly of one component generates a new site or conformational state that is specific for the assembly of the next component and so on as further described in Casjens et al. Control mechanisms in dsDNA bacteriophage assembly Volume 1 Calendar editor New York Plenum Press 15 91 1988 and King Assembly of the tail of bacteriophage T432 231 62 1968 . If a component is missing assembly proceeds up to that point and stalls accumulating a partially assembled structure and unassembled downstream components as further described in Edgar et al. Morphogenesis of bacteriophage T4 in extracts of mutant infected cells 55 498 505 1966 and Kikuchi et al. Genetic control of bacteriophage T4 baseplate morphogenesis. I. Sequential assembly of the major precursor in vivo and in vitro 99 645 72 1975 . Although the precise mechanisms are still poorly understood the assembled structure does not spontaneously disassemble nor is it in equilibrium with the unassembled subunits presumably because it is locked in a different energetically stable conformational state. This process not only ensures directional assembly in a predetermined order but also leads to rapid and high fidelity construction of a complex infectious virion from the seemingly chaotic distribution of subunits in the infected cell.

Sequential conformational changes in the portal and the major capsid protein may drive maturation transitions from the nascent prohead to the DNA full head as suggested in Casjens et al. Control mechanisms in dsDNA bacteriophage assembly Volume 1 Calendar editor. New York Plenum Press. 15 91 1988 Black et al. Morphogenesis of the T4 head 4 In Karam editor Washington D.C. American Society for Microbiology 218 58 1994 and Rao A virus DNA gate zipping and unzipping the packed viral genome 106 8403 404 2009 . These include assembly of the packaging motor packaging initiation prohead expansion headful packaging packaging termination and assembly of neck proteins steps A to D .

The major capsid protein gp23 undergoes a major conformational change during prohead expansion leading to a 15 increase in outer dimensions and a 50 increase in inner volume gp23 is the cleaved form of the major capsid protein gp23 cleavage occurs during maturation of prehead to prohead as indicated in step A . A conformational change in the T4 portal gp20 was reported to trigger this expansion following assembly of packaging motor on the unexpanded prohead as referred to in Ray et al. Portal control of viral prohead expansion and DNA packaging 391 44 50 1999 . About 870 binding sites for Soc small outer capsid protein and 155 binding sites for Hoc highly antigenic outer capsid protein are exposed following the expansion transition as described in Carrascosa Head maturation pathway of bacteriophages T4 and T2. IV. In vitro transformation of T4 head related particles produced by mutants in gene 17 to capsid like structures 26 420 28 1978 .

In phages SPP1 and P22 portal conformational variants were shown to either underpackage 95 of genome per head or overpackage 105 of genome per head the head as referred to in Orlova et al. Structure of the 13 fold symmetric portal protein of bacteriophage SPP16 842 846 1999 and Casjens et al. Bacteriophage P22 portal protein is part of the gauge that regulates packing density of intravirion DNA 224 1055 74 1992 . In phage P22 a piece of packaged DNA spools around the portal forcing a conformational change that apparently signals the motor to make the headful termination cut and disengage from the DNA full head. Another portal conformational change primes DNA delivery following the binding of neck proteins. Thus as was appreciate in the art at the time of the invention the DNA full heads having just ejected the packaging motor following head filling would not be competent to reinitiate packaging instead these would be primed to bind the neck proteins. Applicants show that for the first time the packaging machine assembly is neither sequential nor irreversible. It can occur on the finished head as efficiently as on the packaging na ve empty unexpanded or expanded prohead as was demonstrated by bulk as well as single molecule experiments. Such promiscuous assembly appears to be a special property of the packaging machine because all other head assembly transitions for example head expansion are irreversible and follow the classic sequential assembly paradigm. The fact that the motor can translocate DNA into the capsid regardless of its maturation state unexpanded expanded DNA full or DNA ejected suggests that the shell as such is a passive receptacle. The main goal of the packaging process appears to be to power genome into a capsid receptacle until it is full.

What is the structural basis for the conformational plasticity of the packaging machine X ray and cryo electron microscopy structures show that despite lacking sequence similarity the three dimensional structure of the portals is strictly conserved as described in Mettenleiter et al. Herpesvirus assembly an update 143 222 34 2009 and Simpson et al. Structure of the bacteriophage phi29 DNA packaging motor 408 745 750 2000 . The cone shaped portal consists of three parts a wide domain that is inside the icosahedral vertex a long central stem that forms the channel and a stalk that protrudes out of the capsid. The channel is lined by helices radiating from the center at a 45 angle whereas the protruding end has an domain connected by loops. In one model the portal may oscillate between different energetically equivalent conformational states but gets frozen in one state upon binding to a partner molecule gp17 gp13 etc. In another model different binding sites may be accessible at different stages of the maturation pathway. In the nascent procapsid only the protruding stalk would be accessed allowing the assembly of gp17 but after head filling the internal pressure of packaged DNA might push the portal down exposing part of the stem that contains binding sites for neck proteins. Neck protein assembly displaces the packaging motor but in the absence of neck proteins the packaging motor can reassemble to the portal.

A promiscuous packaging machine may have led to the evolution of headful genomes a fundamentally common feature among dsDNA phages and viruses including the herpes viruses as referred to in Rao et al. The bacteriophage DNA packaging motor 42 647 81 2008 . Closed shells assembled from an ancient capsid protein probably predates genome evolution. A flexible packaging machine that can indiscriminately translocate DNA molecules into a capsid receptacle would continue packaging until the capsid is full. The filled shells by virtue of the energy internal pressure present in the tightly packed DNA can more efficiently deliver the genome into a host cell. Eventually this selective advantage leads to the evolution of infectious capsids virions whose interior is tightly packed with DNA their length dictated by the internal volume of the closed shell. An advantageous embodiment of the invention is to tightly package DNA to efficiently deliver exogenous material into a host cell under either in vitro or in vivo conditions.

The conformational flexibility of the packaging machine may also lead to more efficient production of infectious virions in a normal infection. The low abundant packaging terminase proteins must compete for the DNA substrate with a variety of other DNA metabolizing enzymes involved in transcription replication recombination and repair. Should the packaging motor prematurely fall off or be displaced from the head it could reassemble and resume packaging.

In another embodiment of the invention highly stable virus shells are used as packaging containers. This is a significant breakthrough from a technical standpoint and has broad implications. First the proheads currently used in all the in vitro DNA packaging systems are very fragile and in T4 the prohead is a heterogeneous mixture of unexpanded expanded damaged and partially Soc Hoc bound particles. In an embodiment of the invention the heads that have undergone all the maturation transitions are homogenous and structurally very stable and reinforced with 870 copies of Soc offering a very efficient system to package DNA as well as generate high resolution reconstructions of packaging intermediates. Another embodiment of the invention is that partial heads have 5 to 10 fold greater packaging efficiency than the proheads. In an advantageous embodiment of the invention it is possible to overcome some of the technical barriers to developing in vitro DNA packaging systems for eukaryotic viruses such as herpes viruses and adenoviruses by ejecting the packaged DNA from the virions as described in Newcomb et al. Polarized DNA ejection from the herpesvirus capsid 392 885 94 2009 and repackaging different DNA into the emptied heads. In another embodiment of the invention the powerful packaging motor can be used to encapsidate large chunks of foreign DNA and target these particles to specific cells or tissues by displaying specific ligands on the capsid surface as referred to in Li et al. Bacteriophage T4 capsid a unique platform for efficient surface assembly of macromolecular complexes 363 577 88 2006 . Such particles can deliver multiple genes for gene therapy as well as multivalent DNA vaccines against pathogenic agents. In a further embodiment of the invention the phage T4 head which has very high capacity 170 kb and demonstrates ability to package multiple DNA molecules in the same head would be a particularly attractive nanoparticle. In another embodiment of the invention nanomotors are designed for various biomedical applications. Since the shell appears to be a passive receptacle the packaging machine portal and motor could be stripped off of the capsid and inserted into an artificial and much larger shell such as a liposome or mammalian cell and the machine could be made to translocate DNA and other therapeutic molecules into these compartments.

The surface of bacteriophage T4 nanoparticles can be modified either through genetic engineering or direct chemical conjugation to display functional moieties such as antibodies or other proteins to recognize a specific target and can be used as sensors as further described in Archer et al. 9 6298 311 2009 .

Liposomes can be prepared in many different sizes ranging from small unilamellar vesicles SW s whose smallest dia. are about 20 nm to giant unilamellar vesicles GUV s up to tens of pm in dia. In between are the multilamellar vesicles MLV s i.e. the first generation of liposomes l of several hundreds of nm in dia. and the more recent large unilamellar vesicles LUV s characterized by high capture volumes whose dia. can be adjusted e.g. 100 or 200 nm and size distribution narrowed down by extrusion through specific membranes 2 . In essence liposomes are highly versatile structures whose properties can be modulated by changing number of parameters such as size lamellarity composition of the bilayers surface charges and surface properties for the chemist the phospho lipids which are the constituents of liposomes are also challenging molecules for designing analogs endowed with new properties and derivatives that are useful e.g. for coupling ligands to the surface of the vesicles. Because of the polyanionic nature of DNA cationic and neutral lipids are typically used for gene delivery while the use of anionic liposomes has been fairly restricted to the delivery of other therapeutic macromolecules as referred to in Mayhew et al. Therapeutic applications of liposomes Ostro editor Marcel Dekker New York 289 341 1983 .

In another embodiment of the invention a carrier that encompasses bacteriophage T4 viruses or the T4 virus capsid can have mutations in any of the constituent protein subunits that may result in advantageous properties in methods of gene therapy. The mutations may be introduced into the nucleic acid sequences of the constituent carrier proteins. The carrier may also be used to deliver target genes or proteins that have also be modified. For example modifications can address issues like the short lived nature of gene therapy by generating nucleic acids that are long lived and stable. Another modification can result in no or reduced immune responses from the organism when exogenous material is introduced into it. In addition modifications can be made to address toxicity immune and inflammatory responses and potential disease causing ability of the carrier itself. Modification can also be made to address multigene disorders and to reduce the chance of tumor formation with insertional mutagenesis. The terms protein peptide polypeptide and amino acid sequence are used interchangeably herein to refer to polymers of amino acid residues of any length. The polymer may be linear or branched it may comprise modified amino acids or amino acid analogs and it may be interrupted by chemical moieties other than amino acids. The terms also encompass an amino acid polymer that has been modified naturally or by intervention for example disulfide bond formation glycosylation lipidation acetylation phosphorylation or any other manipulation or modification such as conjugation with a labeling or bioactive component.

The present invention also encompasses carriers into which polypeptides with novel functions are introduced. For example the novel function may proceed via directed or random mutagenesis coupled with a functional selection or screen. Methods of mutagenesis are well known to one of skill in the art.

The nucleic acid can be single stranded or partially or completely double stranded duplex . Duplex nucleic acids can be homoduplex or heteroduplex.

As used herein the term transgene may be used to refer to recombinant nucleotide sequences that may be associated with the present invention. The term recombinant means a nucleotide sequence that has been manipulated by man and that does not occur in nature or is linked to another nucleotide sequence or found in a different arrangement in nature. It is understood that manipulated by man means manipulated by some artificial means including by use of machines codon optimization restriction enzymes etc.

For example in one embodiment the nucleotide sequences may be mutated such that the activity of the encoded proteins in vivo is abrogated. In another embodiment the nucleotide sequences may be codon optimized for example the codons may be optimized for human use. In preferred embodiments the nucleotide sequences of the invention are both mutated to abrogate the normal in vivo function of the encoded proteins and codon optimized for human use.

As regards codon optimization the nucleic acid molecules associated with the invention have a nucleotide sequence that encodes the antigens of the invention and can be designed to employ codons that are used in the genes of the subject in which the antigen is to be produced. In a preferred embodiment the codons used are humanized codons i.e. the codons are those that appear frequently in highly expressed human genes as described in Andre et al. Increased immune response elicited by DNA vaccination with a synthetic gp120 sequence with optimized codon usage 72 1497 1503 1998 . Any suitable method of codon optimization may be used. Such methods and the selection of such methods are well known to those of skill in the art. In addition there are several companies that will optimize codons of sequences such as Geneart and its website of the same name. Thus the nucleotide sequences utilized in the invention can readily be codon optimized.

Another embodiment of the invention also encompasses nucleotide sequences that encode functional and or equivalent variants and derivatives of the proteins that constitute the carrier or proteins that are attached to the carrier or are being delivered by the carrier of the invention and functionally equivalent fragments thereof. For instance changes in a DNA sequence that do not change the encoded amino acid sequence as well as those that result in conservative substitutions of amino acid residues one or a few amino acid deletions or additions and substitution of amino acid residues by amino acid analogs are those that will not significantly affect properties of the encoded polypeptide. Conservative amino acid substitutions are glycine alanine valine isoleucine leucine asparagine glutamine aspartic acid glutamic acid serine threonine methionine lysine arginine and phenylalanine tyrosine tryptophan. In one embodiment the variants have at least 50 at least 55 at least 60 at least 65 at least 70 at least 75 at least 80 at least 85 at least 86 at least 87 at least 88 at least 89 at least 90 at least 91 at least 92 at least 93 at least 94 at least 95 at least 96 at least 97 at least 98 or at least 99 homology or identity to the antigen epitope immunogen peptide or polypeptide of interest.

For purposes of the present invention sequence identity or homology is determined by comparing the sequences when aligned so as to maximize overlap and identity while minimizing sequence gaps. In particular sequence identity may be determined using any of a number of mathematical algorithms. A nonlimiting example of a mathematical algorithm used for comparison of two sequences is the algorithm of Karlin et al.

When utilizing the ALIGN program for comparing amino acid sequences a PAM120 weight residue table a gap length penalty of 12 and a gap penalty of 4 can be used. Yet another useful algorithm for identifying regions of local sequence similarity and alignment is the FASTA algorithm as described in Pearson et al.

Phage heads reassemble a functional DNA packaging machine and package DNA. Phage T4 gp10 in association with gp11 forms the tail pins of the baseplate as described in Leiman et al. Structure and morphogenesis of bacteriophage T460 2356 70 2003 . Since the tail pin assembly is the first step of tail assembly tail structures do not assemble in the absence of gp10. The proteins gp13 gp14 and gp15 assemble into a neck that seals off packaged heads with the gp13 protein directly interacting with the portal protein gp20 following DNA packaging and gp14 and gp15 then assembling on the gp13 platform. 10am13am mutants and analogous mutants in phage and other phages complete all the packaging steps including the cutting of concatemeric DNA and dissociation of the packaging motor. DNA full phage heads accumulate in the 10am13am mutant infected cells which can be converted to infectious virions by in vitro complementation with neck and tail proteins. Thus according to the well accepted sequential assembly models the heads following completion of DNA packaging are expected to have the least affinity for the packaging motor but high affinity for the neck proteins. A novel aspect of the invention relates to it being the first time that the packaging machine does not discriminate between prohead step A and finished or matured phage head steps F and G of .

The 10am13am heads are separated into two major species by CsCl density gradient centrifugation DNA sequencing shows that the 10am13am phage has TAG amber mutations at residues Trp 430 in gene 10 and Gln 39 in gene 13 . Two very closely spaced low density bands are present at about the middle of the gradient and a high density band is located near the bottom of the gradient . The two close bands making about 93 of the total heads contain the same head species but migrate slightly differently probably because the heads in the upper band ate loosely associated with cell debris in some purifications only a broad single band is seen . Upon further purification by diethylaminoethyl cellulose DEAE ion exchange chromatography the cell debris contaminants are removed and the heads elute as a single symmetrical peak . Both the head species are resistant to SDS at room temperature which means that they are as expected in the fully expanded state. Agarose gel electrophoresis shows that the low density heads contain a 8 kb DNA band lanes 5 and 6 whereas the high density heads contain near genome length DNA lanes 9 and 10 . The former is referred to as partial heads and the latter as full heads.

Since 13am mutants accumulate DNA full heads the partial heads likely arose by spontaneous ejection of the packaged DNA from full heads during the purification procedures. The full heads are known to be unstable and to spontaneously eject the DNA unless sealed off by neck proteins. The ejected DNA may be digested by the DNAse I present in the buffer leaving only a small piece of DNA inside the shell. As seen in the DNA that associates with the partial heads was inside the head because it comigrates with the head band lane 3 and is resistant to DNAse I treatment lane 4 but upon digestion with proteinase K the DNA is released and migrates to the 8 kb position lane 5 . It is interesting that the 8 kb band is consistently observed in several independent preparations and is quite compact suggesting that ejection stops within a narrow window after about 95 of the genome is released. This DNA may belong to a specific sequence of the T4 genome because it binds to the capsid protein and is not ejected. To test this hypothesis the DNA is extracted from partial heads by phenol and chloroform and digested with the restriction enzymes EcoRV six base cutter or TaqI four base cutter which can cut the hydroxymethylated and glycosylated T4 DNA. If the 8 kb DNA belongs to a unique sequence of T4 genome a series of discrete bands should result. Alternatively if each 8 kb piece belongs to a different part of the genome the restriction fragments should not form discrete bands. Results indicate that the products migrate as a smear demonstrating that the retained DNA does not have a unique sequence. This is also consistent with the fact that the ends of the T4 genome are nearly random and thus it is not expected that the stretch of the genome that is in proximity to the capsid protein will be of the same DNA in different particles.

The full heads which make up to about 7 of the total heads have the packaged genome relatively stably retained inside the head presumably because either the portal channel is constrained as suggested in Lander et al. The structure of an infectious P22 virion shows the signal for headful DNA packaging 312 1791 95 2006 or the DNA ends are not in close proximity to the entrance of the portal channel. These heads slowly release DNA upon storage at 4 C.

The packaging activity of partial and full heads is determined by in vitro DNA packaging assay using the 17am18amrII empty proheads as a positive control. In phage T4 the empty proheads produced by packaging defective 17am mutant infections are mostly of the expanded type see lanes 1 and 2 of since expansion occurs spontaneously when packaging is blocked in vivo. The resultant packaging na ve empty expanded proheads which package DNA as well or better than the unexpanded proheads have been used as a positive control in the packaging assays as referred to in Rao et al. DNA packaging of bacteriophage T4 proheads in vitro. Evidence that prohead expansion is not coupled to DNA packaging 185 565 578 1985 Black et al. Mechanistic coupling of bacteriophage T4 DNA packaging to components of the replication dependent late transcription machinery 281 25635 25643 2006 and Kondabagil et al. The DNA translocating ATPase of bacteriophage T4 packaging motor 363 786 99 2006 . In bulk packaging assays both partial and full heads efficiently pack short DNA fragments 50 766 bp . Packaging efficiency of partial heads is about six times higher than that of the proheads the true precursors of DNA packaging in vivo packaging efficiency is defined as the number of DNA molecules packaged per number of head particles . This may be because the proheads unlike the mature heads are fragile and might have been damaged during purification because of irregular expansion in vitro and or lack of the stabilizing capsid decoration proteins Soc and Hoc as referred to in Fokine et al. Molecular architecture of the prolate head of bacteriophage T4101 6003 08 2004 . The efficiency of partial head packaging is about five to ten times higher than that of the full heads lanes 3 and 6 which maybe because most of the full heads may not have any empty space left to accommodate additional DNA. Accordingly the partial heads but not the full heads packaged the 48.5 kb phage DNA lanes 7 and 15 or the T4 genomic DNA. To confirm that the partial and full heads reassemble the exogenously added packaging motor the head gp17 complexes are purified and analyzed by Western blotting using polyclonal gp17 antibodies. It is seen that both types of heads reassemble the externally added gp17 . The above findings are reproduced by constructing additional 10am13am phage mutants in which either hoc or soc or both genes are also deleted.

Single mature phage head assembled packaging machines refill the capsid. Although Example 1 shows that full heads package DNA it may be argued that a fraction of the full heads ejected DNA during CsCl gradient centrifugation converting them into partial heads. To address this question 10am13am heads are prepared without the CsCl gradient centrifugation. The infected cells are lysed in the presence of DNAse I and phage heads are isolated by differential centrifugation. These heads which contain a mixture of partial heads and full heads are packaged with DNA 50 to 766 bp ladder fragments and are then separated by CsCl density gradient centrifugation. This not only minimized any DNA ejection from full heads but more importantly ensures that only the full heads that package DNA sediment to the high density position lower band in the CsCl gradient.

The partial and full head bands are extracted from the CsCl gradient treated with proteinase K to release packaged DNA and electrophoresed on a 4 20 polyacrylamide gel. The samples are also electrophoresed prior to proteinase K treatment on an SDS polyacrylamide gel to determine the number of head particles . As shown in the full heads package the ladder DNA fragments at similar efficiency as the gradient purified full heads shown in did. Control samples in which the heads are treated the same way except that gp17 and ATP are omitted in the packaging reactions showed no detectable DNA compare packaged lanes 1 and 2 to control lanes 3 and 4 . The partial heads as expected also package DNA at a similar efficiency as the gradient purified partial heads . Indeed the packaged partial head band shows a downward shift towards higher density after packaging see the packaged left gradient tube in showing broadening of partial head band towards higher density when compared to the control gradient tube on the right . These experiments indicate that there are no fundamental barriers to packaging short pieces of DNA into full heads an observation further confirmed by single molecule optical tweezers experiments.

Single mature phage head assembled packaging machines refill the capsid. Single molecule experiments are conducted using dual trap optical tweezers in a force clamp mode. Head gp17 packaging complexes are formed in the presence of the non hydrolyzable analog ATP S and immobilized on T4 antibody coated microspheres. The substrate DNA molecules 10 kb biotinylated at one end are attached to streptavidin coated microspheres. The microspheres are captured in separate traps and brought into near contact and quickly separated . This fishing procedure is repeated until a tether was formed as evident by a rise in force when the motor captures the DNA. A constant force of 5 pN is then applied by a feedback loop and packaging is measured as decrease in tether length as a function of time.

The data shows that the packaging rates of the partial head assembled packaging machines are similar to those of the empty proheads 800 1 100 bp s . As described previously in Zheng et al. A conformational switch in bacteriophage p22 portal protein primes genome injection Mol Cell 29 376 83 2008 these rates are about seven times faster than those of the phi29 packaging machine. The full heads also packaged DNA but show distinctive features . Some of the heads package the entire 10 kb DNA and the packaging rates are similar to those of the partial head or prohead assembled machines . These heads presumably empty a significant portion of the packaged DNA during storage creating room to accommodate a 10 kb piece. A second class of heads package only a short piece of DNA about 1 3 kb and then stall suggesting that these heads may be nearly full and can only accommodate a small piece . Interestingly the packaging rates of these machines are still very high considering that these machines presumably packaged into a nearly full head. However some of these machines did not stall completely but instead package slowly e.g. the top and bottom traces in . A third class of heads simply form tethers with no translocation evident suggesting that these heads may have had no room left to accommodate additional DNA . It is interesting that these machines form tethers an indication that they successfully initiated packaging as evident by a rise in force but remain in the stalled state for a long period of time otherwise the DNA would rapidly slip out under 5 pN of force . These data demonstrate that the packaging machines can efficiently assemble on mature phage heads and refill the capsid and that the length of refilled DNA appears to be dependent upon the amount of space available inside the capsid.

Mature phage head assembled packaging machines undergo multiple packaging initiations. Short 39 bp Cy5 end labeled and 83 bp Cy3 end labeled DNAs are packaged into proheads partial heads and full heads using the bulk assay. The packaged heads are immobilized on polyethylene glycol PEG passivated quartz surface using anti phage T4 polyclonal antibodies and total internal reflection microscopy and single molecule detection are used to image the fluorescent particles. The glowing heads are quantified by determining the average number of bright spots per area from at least 30 images per sample see for fluorescent images . Consistent with the bulk assays the average number of bright spots corresponding to partial heads that package the labeled DNA is about 5 fold greater than for the empty proheads and about 10 fold greater than for the full heads . Control experiments which omitted gp17 had 0 2 bright spots suggesting that nonspecific fluorescence of any surface bound material is negligible the packaged samples were treated with excess DNAse I 10 g ml at room temperature for about 20 h to digest any unpackaged or nonspecifically bound DNA. Moreover an analysis of the fluorescence intensity histograms of individual heads that package fluorescent DNA show that the weighted average intensity for individual partial head samples is around 5 500 units arbitrary units while the same for proheads was 4 000 units suggesting that the partial head package more DNA molecules than the prohead . This is further quantified by the number of photobleaching steps needed to bleach the fluorescent signal of each spot . These data show that the partial heads contain on average five to six DNA molecules per head whereas the proheads and full heads contain four DNA molecules per head. Thus the mature phage heads like the procapsids can undergo multiple packaging initiations. The single molecule data also suggest that the large difference in packaging efficiency between the partial head the full head and the prohead arises from the inability to initiate packaging in a large fraction of full heads and proheads. For heads that are capable of initiating DNA packaging the number of molecules packaged is only slightly different between the three species.

Purification of 10am13am heads. The phage heads both partial heads and full heads are isolated from the P301 infected with 10am13am mutant. Proheads are isolated from the infected with 17am18amrII mutant. Proheads and phage heads are purified according to the procedures described above. Briefly the infected cells 500 ml culture are lysed in 40 ml of Pi Mg buffer 26 mM Na2HPO4 68 mM NaCl 22 mM KH2PO4 1 mM MgSO4 pH 7.5 containing 10 g ml DNAse I and chloroform 1 ml and incubated at 37 C. for 30 min to digest DNA. The lysate is centrifuged at 4 300 g for 10 min. and the supernatant is centrifuged at 34 500 g for 45 min. The supernatant is resuspended in 2.5 ml of 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5 and 5 mM MgCl2 and again subjected to low and high speed centrifugations. The head pellet is then resuspended in 200 l of Tris Mg buffer and purified by CsCl density gradient centrifugation. The head bands are extracted and dialyzed overnight against 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5 50 mM NaCl and 5 mM MgCl2. The two closely spaced bands at the top are pooled and further purified by DEAE Sepharose chromatography . The peak fractions are concentrated and stored at 4 C.

Bulk in vitro DNA packaging. In vitro DNA packaging assays are performed by the procedure described above. The reaction mixture contains purified proheads partial heads or full heads 0.5 1 1010 particles purified full length gp17 1.5 M and DNA 300 ng of 50 to 766 bp ladder DNA New England Biolabs 100 ng of Cy3 83 bp DNA 50 ng of Cy5 39 bp DNA or 600 ng of 48.5 kb phage DNA . The DNA is packaged using a buffer containing 30 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5 100 mM NaCl 3 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM ATP. The Cy3 and Cy5 DNAs are packaged using the 5 PEG buffer as described above. The packaging reactions are terminated by the addition of DNAse I and the encapsidated DNAse I resistant DNA is released by treatment with proteinase K and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Each experiment included one to several negative controls that lacked one of the essential packaging components head gp17 ATP or DNA. Packaging efficiency is defined as the number of DNA molecules packaged per the number of head particles used in the packaging reaction.

Single molecule optical tweezers packaging. The packaging complexes are prepared by mixing purified heads 4 109 particles with purified 1 M full length gp17 and 0.44 M 125 bp dsDNA priming DNA Z. Z. and V. B. R. unpublished data in the presence of 1 mM ATP S in a 10 0 reaction volume consisting of packaging buffer 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.6 100 mM NaCl and 5 mM MgCl2 . The mixture is incubated at 37 C. for 30 min. The T4 phage antibody coated polystyrene beads 1.5 l 0.79 m in diameter Spherotech are added to the above reaction mixture and incubated at 37 C. for 30 min.

The DNA beads are prepared by adding PCR amplified 10 kb DNA biotinylated at one end to the streptavidin coated polystyrene beads 0.86 m in diameter Spherotech and incubated at 37 C. for 30 min. The dual trap optical tweezers are set up and calibrated as described in Bustamante et al. High resolution dual trap optical tweezers with differential detection Selvin et al. editors Woodbury N.Y. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. 297 324 2007 and Chemla et al. Mechanism of force generation of a viral DNA packaging motor Cell 122 683 692 2005 . Single molecule measurements are taken at 100 Hz in a force feedback mode where packaging is allowed to occur against a constant force of 5 pN. Tether formation and packaging is initiated by infusing packaging buffer containing 1 mM ATP into the flow cell. To prevent the formation of reactive singlet oxygen species an oxygen scavenging system is used 100 g ml glucose oxidase 20 g ml catalase and 4 mg ml glucose . The contour length of DNA is calculated from the measured force and extension between the beads using the worm like chain model assuming a persistence length of 53 nm a stretch modulus of 1 200 pN and a distance per basepair of 0.34 nm. The velocity of DNA packaging is determined from a linear fit of the contour length of DNA over a sliding window of 0.1 s ten data points .

Single Molecule Fluorescence of Packaged Heads. Single molecule fluorescence experiments to quantify packaging efficiency of different heads are performed on a wide field prism type total internal reflection microscope with a 532 laser Coherent for Cy3 excitation or a 630 laser Melles Griot for Cy5 excitation. Immobilized capsids are imaged by a charged coupled device camera iXon DV 887 BI Andor Technology at 100 ms time resolution. A homemade C program is used to record and analyze the images as described in Roy et al. A practical guide to single molecule FRET 5 507 16 2008 .

To minimize nonspecific surface binding clean quartz slides and glass cover slips are surface passivated with PEG and 3 biotinylated PEG Laysan Bio 43 . After assembling the channel NeutrAvidin Thermo Scientific is added 0.2 mg ml followed by incubation with biotinylated protein G Rockland Immunochemicals 25 nM for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently T4 phage antibody 15 nM is added and incubated for 1 h. The packaged heads with 83 bp Cy3 and 39 bp Cy5 DNAs are applied to separate channels and incubated for 20 min. The packaging reaction mixtures are treated with DNAse I 10 g ml at room temperature for about 20 h to digest any unpackaged or nonspecifically bound Cy3 and Cy5 DNAs.
