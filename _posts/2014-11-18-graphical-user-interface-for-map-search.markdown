This application is a continuation under 35 U.S.C. 120 of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 113 889 filed 23 May 2011.

The present disclosure generally relates to location based services and more specifically relates to graphical user interfaces for map search with respect to location based services.

A social network in general is a social structure made up of entities such as individuals or organizations that are connected by one or more types of interdependency or relationships such as friendship kinship common interest financial exchange dislike or relationships of beliefs knowledge or prestige. In more recent years social networks have taken advantage of the Internet. There are social networking systems existing on the Internet in the form of social networking websites. A social networking system such as a social networking website enables its users to interact with it and with each other through the system.

The social networking system may create and store a record often referred to as a user profile in connection with the user. The user profile may include a user s demographic information communication channel information and personal interest. The social networking system may also create and store a record of a user s relationship with other users in the social networking system e.g. social graph as well as provide services e.g. wall posts photo sharing or instant messaging to facilitate social interaction between users in the social networking system. A geo social networking system is a social networking system in which geographic services and capabilities are used to enable additional social interactions. User submitted location data or geo location techniques e.g. mobile phone position tracking can allow a geo social network to connect and coordinate users with local people or events that match their interests. For example users can check in to a place using a mobile client application by providing a name of a place or selecting a place from a pre established list of places . The geo social networking system among other things can record information about the user s presence at the place and possibly provide this information to other users of the geo social networking system. The maps graphical user interface can allow the user to obtain location data using a map search with respect to the geo social networking system.

The present disclosure generally relates to a location based services network system and more specifically relates to graphical user interfaces for map search with respect to the location based services network system.

In particular embodiments a computing device accesses location data representing a first location of a first user wherein the first location corresponds to geographic coordinates retrieves image data defining a graphical map from a remote server based on the first location accesses a search query inputted by the first user retrieves one or more second locations in response to the search query where the one or more second locations correspond to geographic coordinates and displays a first view comprising a list of the one or more second locations overlaying at least a portion of the graphical map wherein the graphical map includes indicators for the first location and at least one of the one or more second locations in accordance with their respective geographic coordinates.

These and other features aspects and advantages of the disclosure are described in more detail below in the detailed description and in conjunction with the following figures.

The present disclosure is now described in detail with reference to a few embodiments thereof as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following description numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present disclosure. However the present disclosure may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances well known process steps and or structures have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present disclosure. In addition while the disclosure is described in conjunction with the particular embodiments it should be understood that this description is not intended to limit the disclosure to the described embodiments. To the contrary the description is intended to cover alternatives modifications and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the disclosure as defined by the appended claims.

A social networking system such as a social networking website enables its users to interact with it and with each other through the system. Typically to become a registered user of a social networking system an entity either human or non human registers for an account with the social networking system. Thereafter the registered user may log into the social networking system via an account by providing for example a correct login ID or username and password. As used herein a user may be an individual human user an entity e.g. an enterprise business or third party application or a group e.g. of individuals or entities that interacts or communicates with or over such a social network environment.

When a user registers for an account with a social networking system the social networking system may create and store a record often referred to as a user profile in connection with the user. The user profile may include information provided by the user and information gathered by various systems including the social networking system relating to activities or actions of the user. For example the user may provide his name profile picture contact information birth date gender marital status family status employment education background preferences interests and other demographical information to be included in his user profile. The user may identify other users of the social networking system that the user considers to be his friends. A list of the user s friends or first degree contacts may be included in the user s profile. Connections in social networking systems may be in both directions or may be in just one direction. For example if Bob and Joe are both users and connect with each another Bob and Joe are each connections of the other. If on the other hand Bob wishes to connect to Sam to view Sam s posted content items but Sam does not choose to connect to Bob a one way connection may be formed where Sam is Bob s connection but Bob is not Sam s connection. Some embodiments of a social networking system allow the connection to be indirect via one or more levels of connections e.g. friends of friends . Connections may be added explicitly by a user for example the user selecting a particular other user to be a friend or automatically created by the social networking system based on common characteristics of the users e.g. users who are alumni of the same educational institution . The user may identify or bookmark websites or web pages he visits frequently and these websites or web pages may be included in the user s profile.

The user may provide information relating to various aspects of the user such as contact information and interests at the time the user registers for an account or at a later time. The user may also update his or her profile information at any time. For example when the user moves or changes a phone number he may update his contact information. Additionally the user s interests may change as time passes and the user may update his interests in his profile from time to time. A user s activities on the social networking system such as frequency of accessing particular information on the system may also provide information that may be included in the user s profile. Again such information may be updated from time to time to reflect the user s most recent activities. Still further other users or so called friends or contacts of the user may also perform activities that affect or cause updates to a user s profile. For example a contact may add the user as a friend or remove the user as a friend . A contact may also write messages to the user s profile pages typically known as wall posts. A user may also input status messages that get posted to the user s profile page.

A social network system may maintain social graph information which can generally model the relationships among groups of individuals and may include relationships ranging from casual acquaintances to close familial bonds. A social network may be represented using a graph structure. Each node of the graph corresponds to a member of the social network. Edges connecting two nodes represent a relationship between two users. In addition the degree of separation between any two nodes is defined as the minimum number of hops required to traverse the graph from one node to the other. A degree of separation between two users can be considered a measure of relatedness between the two users represented by the nodes in the graph.

A social networking system may support a variety of applications such as photo sharing on line calendars search events and location based services. For example the social networking system may allow users to post photographs and other multimedia files to a user s profile such as in a wall post or in a photo album both of which may be accessible to other users of the social networking system. Social networking system may also allow users to configure events. For example a first user may configure an event with attributes including time and date of the event location of the event and other users invited to the event. The invited users may receive invitations to the event and respond such as by accepting the invitation or declining it . Furthermore social networking system may allow users to maintain a personal calendar. Similarly to events the calendar entries may include times dates locations and identities of other users.

The social networking system may also support a privacy model. A user may or may not wish to share his information with other users or third party applications or a user may wish to share his information only with specific users or third party applications. A user may control whether his information is shared with other users or third party applications through privacy settings associated with his user profile. For example a user may select a privacy setting for each user datum associated with the user and or select settings that apply globally or to categories or types of user profile information. A privacy setting defines or identifies the set of entities e.g. other users connections of the user friends of friends or third party application that may have access to the user datum. The privacy setting may be specified on various levels of granularity such as by specifying particular entities in the social network e.g. other users predefined groups of the user s connections a particular type of connections all of the user s connections all first degree connections of the user s connections the entire social network or even the entire Internet e.g. to make the posted content item index able and searchable on the Internet . A user may choose a default privacy setting for all user data that is to be posted. Additionally a user may specifically exclude certain entities from viewing a user datum or a particular type of user data.

Social networking system may maintain a database of information relating to geographic locations or places. Places may correspond to various physical locations such as restaurants bars train stations airports and the like. Some places may correspond to larger regions that themselves contain places such as a restaurant or a gate location in an airport. In one implementation each place can be maintained as a hub node in a social graph or other data structure maintained by the social networking system as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 763 171 which is incorporated by reference herein for all purposes. Social networking system may allow users to access information regarding each place using a client application e.g. a browser hosted by a wired or wireless station such as a laptop desktop or mobile device. For example social networking system may serve web pages or other structured documents to users that request information about a place. In addition to user profile and place information the social networking system may track or maintain other information about the user. For example the social networking system may support geo social networking system functionality including one or more location based services that record the user s location. For example users may access the geo social networking system using a special purpose client application hosted by a mobile device of the user or a web or network based application using a browser client . The client application may automatically access Global Positioning System GPS or other geo location functions supported by the mobile device and report the user s current location to the geo social networking system. In addition the client application may support geo social networking functionality that allows users to check in at various locations and communicate this location to other users. A check in to a given place may occur when a user is physically located at a place and using a mobile device access the geo social networking system to register the user s presence at the place. A user may select a place from a list of existing places near to the user s current location or create a new place. The user may also provide comments in a text string when checking in to a given place. The user may also identify one or more other users in connection with a check in such as friends of a user and associate them with the check in as well. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 574 614 which is incorporated by reference herein for all purposes describes a system that allows a first user to check in other users at a given place. An entry including a comment and a time stamp corresponding to the time the user checked in may be displayed to other users. For example a record of the user s check in activity may be stored in a database. Social networking system may select one or more records associated with check in activities of users at a given place and include such check in activity in web pages or other structured documents that correspond to a given place. For example social networking system may select the check in activity associated with the friends or other social contacts of a user that requests a page corresponding to a place. U.S. application Ser. No. 12 858 718 incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes describes an example geo social networking system that can be used in connection with various embodiments of the present invention. The check in activity may also be displayed on a user profile page and in news feeds provided to users of the social networking system.

Still further a special purpose client application hosted on a mobile device of a user may be configured to periodically capture location data of the mobile device and send the location data to social networking system. In this manner the social networking system may track the user s location and provide various recommendations to the user related to places that are proximal to the user s path or that are frequented by the user. In one implementation a user may opt in to this recommendation service which causes the client application to periodically post location data of the user to the social networking system.

In particular embodiments user profile database may store communication channel information and an address book of a user. The address book in one implementation may be a superset or a subset of the users of the social networking system that a user has established a friend or contact relationship. A user of client device may access this address book information using a special purpose or general purpose client application to view contact information. In particular embodiments the address book may contain one or more contacts e.g. a person or an business entity and a name e.g. first name and or last name and communication channel information for each contact e.g. a phone number a user ID for an IM service an email address a user ID for a social networking system home address etc. . For at least a portion of the address book information the contact entries may be dynamic in that the contact entry is associated with a user of the social networking system that maintains his or her own account and corresponding user profile with contact information. Accordingly when a first user changes any aspect of contact information the revised contact information may be provided to requesting users. In particular embodiments a user may access the address book look up and connect to a contact through a communication channel. In some implementations the client device may maintain a local copy of the address book that may be refreshed or synchronized at various times.

In particular embodiments event database may store event data for any number of particular events and the data associated with each event including the name of the event the date and time of the event the event location particular users who are invited to participate or who are participating in the event and other user or participant s comments about the event. For example a user may schedule an event through the social networking system which has an associated link so that any invited user may participate or any user if the event is open to any user. The event may have a specific geographical location associated with the event and other participants who have indicated through the social networking system that they will participate in the event. The event may also have event photos that have been uploaded by the user who created the event or any other participants.

In particular embodiments privacy policy database may store a user s privacy data for a user s settings for each user datum associated with the user and the user s settings for third party applications. For example a user may have selected default privacy settings or a user may have specifically excluded certain entities from viewing a user datum or particular type of user data and all of that privacy data for all users and friends of users may be stored in the privacy policy database .

In particular embodiments location database may store geo location data identifying a real world geographic location of a user associated with a check in. For example a geographic location of an Internet connected computer can be identified by the computer s IP address. For example a geographic location of a cell phone equipped with Wi Fi and GPS capabilities can be identified by cell tower triangulation Wi Fi positioning and or GPS positioning. In particular embodiments location database may store an information base of places where each place includes a name a geographic location and meta information. For example a place can be a local business a point of interest e.g. Union Square in San Francisco Calif. a college a city or a national park. For example a geographic location of a place e.g. a local coffee shop can be an address a set of geographic coordinates latitude and longitude or a reference to another place e.g. the coffee shop next to the train station . For example a geographic location of a place with a large area e.g. Yosemite National Park can be a shape e.g. a circle or a polygon approximating the boundary of the place and or a centroid i.e. geometric center of the shape. For example meta information of a place can include information identifying be the user that initially created the place reviews ratings comments check in activity data and the like. Places may be created by administrators of the system and or created by users of the system. For example a user may register a new place by accessing a client application to define a place name and provide a geographic location and cause the newly created place to be registered in location database . The creating user or other users may access a web page directed to the page and add additional information such as reviews comments and ratings for the place. In particular embodiments location database may store a user s location data. For example location database may store a user s check in activities. For example a user can create a place e.g. a new restaurant or coffee shop causing the social networking system to stores the user created place in location database . For example a user can create a comment a review or a rating of a place causing the social networking system to store the user s comment review and rating of the place in location database .

The social networking system may also include media sharing capabilities. In particular embodiments a user of the social networking system may upload one or more media files to media database . For example a user can upload a photo or a set of photos often called a photo album or a video clip to media database from a client device e.g. a computer or a camera phone . In particular embodiments the one or more media files may contain metadata often called tags associated with each media file. For example a photo shot by a digital camera may contain metadata relating to file size resolution time stamp name of the camera maker and or location e.g. GPS coordinates. A user can add additional metadata values to a photo or tag a photo during an upload process. Some examples of tags of a media file are author title comments event names time location names of people appearing in the media file or user comment. In particular embodiments a user may tag a media file by using a client application e.g. a photo or video editor or entering one or more tags in a graphical user interface of a media uploading tool that uploads a user s one or more media files from a client device to the social networking system. A user may also tag a media file after an upload at a later time in the social networking system s web site. In particular embodiments the social networking system may also extract metadata from a media file and store the metadata in media database .

In particular embodiments news feed engine may access user profile database event database location database and media database for data about a user or set of users of the social networking system and assemble a list of one or more activities as news items for a particular user. In particular embodiments news feed engine may access privacy policy database and determine a subset of news items based on one or more privacy settings. In particular embodiments news feed engine may compile a dynamic list of a limited number of news items in a ranked or sorted order. In particular embodiments news feed engine may provide links related to one or more activities in the news items and links providing opportunities to participate in the activities. For example a news feed can comprise wall posts status updates comments and recent check ins to a place with a link to a web page of the place . In other embodiments news feed engine may access user profile database event database location database and media database and compile a dynamic list of a limited number of news items about a group of related actions received from users of the social networking system i.e. a news feed . For example a news feed can comprise an event that a user may schedule and organize through the social networking system with a link to participate the event check ins at a specific geographical location of the event by the user and other participants of the event messages about the event posted by the user and other participants of the event and photos of the event uploaded by the user and other participants of the event.

The social networking system may also support other location based services such as location based search and map services. For example using client device a user may access the social networking system and retrieve graphical maps that correspond to the user s current location and or a desired location. In particular embodiments a user may manually input a location either in a free form text field and or in connection with a check in to a place in a geo social networking system. Still further the client device may include GPS or other location functionality that may be appended or otherwise included in one or more messages transmitted to the social networking system. The social networking system itself may host search and map services as internal functionality or may rely on one or more external systems hosted by third party service providers. Using such functionality a user may transmit a query that identifies a location and optionally one or more search terms that correspond to a desired activity or other intention such as restaurants shopping gas stations and the like . A response may include a graphical map indicating the identified location graphically as an icon together with additional icons corresponding to locations that meet the search query.

Particular embodiments may access location data representing a first location of a first user wherein the first location corresponds to geographic coordinates as illustrated in step . The first location may be a current location or previous location of the user or any arbitrary location specified by the user. The first location may be a location identified as the result of a query. Particular embodiments may automatically access GPS data or other geo location functions to determine a location of the user. Particular embodiments may determine the user s location based on location data from social networking system being continuously received by a special purpose client application that is configured to continuously capture location data of a mobile device of the first user. Particular embodiments may record data including but not limited to the latitude and longitude of the user the altitude of the user the horizontal and vertical accuracy levels of the location information the current speed and direction of the user s travel the timestamp of when a particular location was recorded and the source of the location data on the mobile device for example from a GPS chip WiFi Bluetooth hardware Cellular ID or a software solution incorporating one or more of the above signals. Particular embodiments may determine the first user s location based on the user s most recent or history of location information based on the entries above in the geo social networking system. Particular embodiments may determine the first user s location based on automatic check in or geo tracking mechanisms or even the user s latest check in entry based on the time stamp of the entry maintained by a geo social networking system. Furthermore location information may also be included in a search query inputted by the user in a text entry field. For example a user may input a query coffee Dolores Park. A search service may parse the query to identify the geographic terms to locate map image data to be displayed to a user.

In particular embodiments the search query may require disambiguation based on a variety of signals including but not limited to the most recent or history of location information for the user stored in the geo social networking system recent or historical location information for friends of the user as determined by the geo social networking system the currently displayed viewport of the graphical map interface or location information resident on the mobile device but not yet resident on the geo social networking system. In particular embodiments for example Dolores Park could refer to a park in San Francisco or New York or two completely different zones. In particular embodiments which set of results is retrieved could be altered by whether the user is closer to one of the two zones whether they are normally closer to one of the two zones whether the user s friends are normally closer to one of the two zones and whether the phone has received a GPS update saying that the phone is closer to one of the two zones even if the geo social networking system has not yet been updated.

Particular embodiments may retrieve image data defining a graphical map from a remote server based on the first location as illustrated in step . In particular embodiments image data defining a graphical map may be retrieved from local cache of the client. Image data defining a graphical map may be stored in databases servers other types of computing devices or in the local cache of the client. illustrates an example user interface where image data defining a graphical map has been retrieved from a remote server based on the first location and is being displayed as a graphical map . Within graphical map location data representing a first location of a first user may be displayed as graphical location indicator . For example graphical location indicator representing the current location of the first user may be a blue dot or any other such graphical indicator that distinctly points out the location of the user.

Particular embodiments may access a search query inputted by the first user as illustrated in step . Particular embodiments of graphical map may have an input field contained in the interface where the user can enter a search query. A search query is a query that a user enters into input field to satisfy his or her informational needs. For example a user may enter a search query for coffee into input field .

Particular embodiments may retrieve one or more second locations in response to the search query where the one or more second locations correspond to geographic coordinates as illustrated in step . Sophisticated search engines implement many other functionalities in addition to merely identifying the second locations as a part of the search process. For example a search engine may rank the second locations identified for a search query according to their relative degrees of relevance. Relevance may include one or more of a proximity component and one or more social components. For example relevance of a particular second location may be based in part on the distance between the first location and the second location. In order to determine relevance to the user at the first location particular embodiments may access the user s social network data. For example particular embodiments may access data associated the user s prior check in activity. Particular embodiments may access data associated with the other users who have checked in which may include the user s friends or other social contacts of the user who is at the first location. Particular embodiments may access data associated with places that the first user likes or additional like data from any other users including but not limited to the user s friends or other social contacts of the user. In particular embodiments the first user or any other user may have liked any of one or more second location one or more times. Further particular embodiments may access external data such as third party ratings and reviews.

In particular embodiments a search engine may rank the second locations identified for a search query by relevance and relative to the user s location so that second locations in closer proximity to the user are ranked higher than those second locations that are a greater distance from the user. In order to determine the relevance and proximity particular embodiments may access the social network data discussed above as well as location data of the user that was accessed in step .

Particular embodiments may display a first view comprising a list of the one or more second locations overlaying at least a portion of the graphical map wherein the graphical map includes indicators for the first location and at least one of the one or more second locations in accordance with their respective geographic coordinates as illustrated in step . In particular embodiments the list of one or more second locations overlaying at least a portion of the graphical map is translucent enabling the graphical map to be at least slightly visible through the list. illustrates an example search result that identifies four second locations . Search result is generated in response to an example search query coffee . Note that only four second locations are illustrated in order to simplify the discussion. In practice a search result may identify tens hundreds or even thousands of locations near or around the first user. Still further the overlay list view may be scrollable to allow additional locations to be displayed. Second locations each may include a title for the location a short summary including relevant social data retrieved from social networking system and a rating for the particular second location.

In particular embodiments second locations may be presented according to their relative degrees of relevance to search query coffee . That is second location may be considered somewhat more relevant to search query coffee than second location which in turn may be considered somewhat more relevant than second location and so on. Consequently second location may be presented first i.e. at the top of search result followed by second location second location and so on. In particular embodiments second locations may be presented in a list view on top of the map that obscures at least a portion of the map. In some embodiments the graphical map icon or location indicator corresponding to the first ranked location may be centered in the portion of the display map that remains unobscured by the list view. Furthermore the client application may move the displayed portion of the map such that another icon corresponding to a location in the list view is substantially centered in the unobscured portion in response to selection inputs by the user. For example positional indicator may correspond to second location . In other particular embodiments in response to selection inputs by the user the client application may collapse the list view such that the map is completely unobscured by the list and re enable the list view which may again obscure at least a portion of the map.

In particular embodiments may be presented according to their relative degrees of relevance to search query coffee in or around the user s location. That is second location may be considered somewhat more relevant to search query coffee and closer in proximity to the user s current location than second location . Second location in turn is considered somewhat more relevant and close in proximity to the user s location than second location and so on. Consequently second location may be presented first i.e. at the top of search result followed by second location second location and so on.

In particular embodiments the ranking of the second locations with respect to the search queries may be determined by a ranking algorithm implemented by the search engine. Given a search query and a set of second locations identified in response to the search query the ranking algorithm ranks the second locations in the set according to their relative degrees of relevance with respect to the search query or by proximity to the first user. More specifically in particular embodiments the second locations that are relatively more relevant to the search query are ranked higher than the second locations that are relatively less relevant to the search query as illustrated for example in .

As discussed above second locations may also be represented as corresponding positional indicators in the graphical map portion of the user interface. Each positional indicator appearing on the graphical map portion of the user interface may represent a corresponding second location and appear at the geographical coordinates for the location associated with second locations . As discussed below a list view may be displayed as an overlay on the graphical map that can be toggled on and off by the user. Furthermore a user using appropriate inputs such as touch screen inputs may cause the client application with the overlay list toggled on or off to pan the graphical map as desired by the user.

In particular embodiments each second location and is selectable both in the overlaying list view and the graphical map. Particular embodiments may in response to input by the first user display a second view comprising the list of the one or more second locations overlaying the graphical map wherein one of the one or more second locations is highlighted and the portion of the displayed may that is unobscured by the overlaying list view is centered on the geographic coordinates of the highlighted second location. For example in particular embodiments if the user selects a second location from the list view the second location may become highlighted and the graphical map may center on the positional icon representing the geographic coordinates for the selected second location. Further in response to input by the first user from the graphical map view particular embodiments may display a third view comprising the list of the one or more second locations overlaying the graphical map wherein one of the one or more second locations is highlighted and the unobscured in one implementation lower portion of the map is centered and zoomed in on the geographic coordinates of the highlighted second location. In other implementations in particular embodiments if the user selects a second location either the from the list or the graphical map the second location may become highlighted and the graphical map may center relative to the overall graphical map including the obscured portion and zoom in on the positional icon representing the geographic coordinates for the selected second location.

In particular embodiments in response to input by the first user associated with a particular second location a client application may display further information about the selected second location as illustrated in . illustrates a user interface where in response to input by the user meta information is displayed for a second location in user interface . For example the user has selected second location or Blue Bottle Coffee . User interface is partitioned into several areas or components. In particular embodiments one or more components in user interface e.g. component may be used to display relevant location data about the selected second location . For example component may display the geographical coordinates address phone number or business hours for the selected second location . In particular embodiments additional components such as component may be used to display social network data retrieved from social networking system that relates to selected second location . For example component may display social network data such as friends or other associates of the user who have checked in at Blue Bottle Coffee commented on Blue Bottle Coffee indicated that they like Blue Bottle Coffee or any other social network data available in the database. In particular embodiments additional components such as component may be used to display selectable components where the component displays additional information or performs additional functions in response to user input. For example the user may select component to call Blue Bottle Coffee or get directions to Blue Bottle Coffee.

In particular embodiments in response to input by a user second locations may be presented only as positional indicators on the graphical map as illustrated in . Particular embodiments of graphical map may pan or zoom in and out in response to input by a user. Graphical map may display positional indicators for the second locations where each positional indicator corresponds to a second location discussed above. Positional indicators are positioned on the graphical map at the geographical coordinates for the location associated the respective second location. Further in response to input by a user each positional indicator is selectable and may display further information about each of the second locations in the same manner as described above in connection with . For example from the user interface illustrated in a user may select a given positional indicator e.g. positional indicator causing the client application to display an interface similar to where the positional indicator is centered in the unobscured portion of the map display and the overlay includes meta information associated with the selected second location.
