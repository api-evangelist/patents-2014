Based on the comparison the content of the electronic message is converted to a format of the collaboration communications system . Further a collaboration message is prepared that is employed within the collaboration communications system for electronic transmission. The collaboration message includes the converted content of the electronic message.

In some implementations an electronic message is received from a message communications system. Specifically in some examples the collaboration plugin receives an electronic message e.g. an electronic mail or email message or other electronic message from the mail server computing system . The electronic message includes content and is associated with one or more characteristics. For example the content can include text of the electronic communication e.g. the body of the electronic communication text of the subject line of the electronic message or other content based information. Additionally for example the one or more characteristics can include metadata that is associated with the electronic message or other identifying properties of the electronic message.

In some examples the electronic message includes two or more related electronic messages. In some examples the electronic message can include two or more conversations. For example the electronic message can include an email chain or an email thread e.g. a threaded email message . In some examples the electronic message can include multiple mail messages that have been exchanged between multiple users over multiple days.

In some implementations at least one of the one or more characteristics of the electronic message e.g. email message is compared to one or more triggering rules. Specifically in some examples the collaboration plugin compares at least one or of the one or more characteristics of the electronic message with one or more triggering rules. For example for a particular characteristic of the electronic message the collaboration plugin identifies a triggering rule associated with the particular characteristic. In some examples the particular characteristic of the electronic message is associated with two or more triggering rules. In some examples a particular triggering rule is associated with two or more characteristics of the electronic message.

In some examples comparing at least one of the one or more characteristics of the electronic message with one or more triggering rules includes identifying a number of days associated with the electronic message. For example the electronic message e.g. email message was initially generated 10 days ago from a current date or the last update to the electronic message e.g. a reply to the electronic message or a forward of the electronic message was 10 days ago from a current date . The number of days is compared with an associated triggering rule of the one or more triggering rules. For example a triggering rule associated with the number of days can include a threshold number of days e.g. an age threshold of 8 days. Based on the comparing it is determined that that number of days satisfies the associated triggering rule. For example the number of days associated with the electronic message e.g. 10 days satisfies the associated triggering rule e.g. greater than the threshold number of 8 days . In response a suggestion is provided to an author associated with the electronic message e.g. a user providing content to the electronic message to convert the electronic message to a format of the collaboration communications system . For example the suggestion can be provided through the GUI and particularly displayed within a displayable module of the email client that is displayed through the GUI . The suggestion can include a hyperlink to an external website e.g. external to the message communications system to facilitate converting the electronic message to the format of the collaboration communications system described further below. However the suggestion can include other means including an email to the user a pop up window a notification e.g. push or other notification means.

In some examples comparing at least one of the one or more characteristics of the electronic message with one or more triggering rules includes identifying a number of total communications associated with the electronic message. For example the electronic message e.g. email message is associated with 21 conversations e.g. communications between participants of the electronic message. That is the electronic message has been communicated between the participants e.g. replies 21 times. For example each conversation e.g. reply includes the content of the previous reply and additional content added with the current communication e.g. response to a previous communication . The total number of communications is compared with an associated triggering rule of the one or more triggering rules. For example a triggering rule associated with the number of communications can include a threshold number of communications e.g. a threshold of 15 communications. Based on the comparison it is determined that that number of communications satisfies the associated triggering rule. For example the number of communications associated with the electronic message e.g. 21 communications satisfies the associated triggering rule e.g. greater than the threshold number of 15 communications . In response a suggestion is provided to an author associated with the electronic message e.g. a user providing content to the electronic message to convert the electronic message to a format of the collaboration communications system .

In some examples comparing at least one of the one or more characteristics of the electronic message with one or more triggering rules includes identifying a number of total participants associated with the electronic message. For example the electronic message e.g. email message is associated with 7 participants e.g. authors or users of the electronic message. That is the electronic message has been communicated between the 7 participants e.g. replies forwards or other email based activity . The total number of participants is compared with an associated triggering rule of the one or more triggering rules. For example a triggering rule associated with the number of participants can include a threshold number of participants e.g. a threshold of 5 participants. Based on the comparing it is determined that that number of participants satisfies the associated triggering rule. For example the number of participants associated with the electronic message e.g. 7 participants satisfies the associated triggering rule e.g. greater than the threshold number of 5 participants . In response a suggestion is provided to an author associated with the electronic message e.g. a user providing content to the electronic message to convert the electronic message to a format of the collaboration communications system .

In some examples the collaboration plugin compares two or more characteristics of the electronic message with two or more respective associated triggering rules. For example based on the comparison it is determined that one of the characteristics of the two or more characteristics of the electronic message e.g. email message satisfies the respective associated triggering rule. In some examples in response to at least one characteristic satisfying the respective triggering rule the suggestion is provided to an author associated with the electronic message e.g. a user providing content to the electronic message to convert the electronic message to a format of the collaboration communications system . In some examples in response to at least one characteristic not satisfying the respective triggering rule the suggestion is not provided to an author associated with the electronic message e.g. a user providing content to the electronic message to convert the electronic message to a format of the collaboration communications system .

Additionally in some examples based on the comparison it is determined that both of the characteristics of the two or more characteristics of the electronic message satisfy the respective associated triggering rules. In some examples in response to at both characteristics satisfying the respective triggering rules the suggestion is provided to an author associated with the electronic message e.g. a user providing content to the electronic message to convert the electronic message e.g. email message to a format of the collaboration communications system .

In some implementations based on the comparing the content of the electronic message is converted to a format of the collaboration communications system. Specifically in some examples the collaboration plugin converts the content of the electronic message e.g. email message to a format of the collaboration communications system . Specifically the message communications system may be associated with a first format e.g. an email based format and the collaboration communications system may be associated with a second different format e.g. a collaboration based format . In some examples the collaboration communications system may be unable to process or having limited processing capability associated with the electronic message and or the first format of the electronic message. For example the collaboration communications system may be unable to appropriately display the electronic message including appropriate collaboration information within a GUI of the collaboration communications system .

In some examples converting the content of the electronic message to a format of the collaboration communications system includes associating one or more collaboration properties with the electronic message. For example the properties can include embedded replies e.g. comment boxes associated with each communication within the electronic message e.g. a multi threaded electronic message . For example the properties can include thread based properties message board properties topic based properties and or discussion group based properties. In some examples the format of the collaboration communications system can include a tree based structure e.g. a root node and children nodes . For example each communication within the electronic message e.g. email message can act as a root node and responses to the communication e.g. embedded replies act as children nodes. In some examples the format of the collaboration communication system can include sorting the communications with the electronic message based on the content of each communication e.g. grouped together or filtered . In some examples converting the content of the electronic message to a format of the collaboration communications system is based on a particular type e.g. system platform of the collaboration communications system

In some implementations a collaboration message is prepared that is employed within the collaboration communications system for electronic transmission that includes the converted content of the electronic message. Specifically in some examples the collaboration plugin prepares the collaboration message employed within the collaboration communications system for electronic transmission. For example preparing the collaboration message includes providing the converted content of the electronic message e.g. email message to the collaboration server over a network e.g. network . In some examples the converted content of the electronic message includes is provided through a Web service and or an Open Data Protocol OData .

In some examples the collaboration plugin the collaboration server computing system or both prepare the collaboration message. In some examples the collaboration message includes a message that is accessible by the collaboration communications system and is able to be appropriately processed by the collaboration communications system . For example a user of the collaboration communications system is able to interact with the collaboration message.

For example a user of the mail client is able to interact with the collaboration message.

In some examples the collaboration message is displayable within a GUI of the collaboration communications system . In some examples the collaboration message is displayable within a GUI of the mail client and specifically within a graphical representation of the electronic message described further below. In some examples the collaboration message includes a group based message a discussion based message or a document sharing based message.

In some examples the collaboration client can provide the collaboration message to a user of the collaboration communications system . The collaboration client is in communication with the collaboration server e.g. over the network and receives the collaboration message from the collaboration server . Additionally the collaboration server is in communication with the collaboration data store e.g. over the network . The collaboration data store stores the collaboration message. For example the collaboration data stores further stores metadata associated with collaboration messages or other collaboration based data.

In some further implementations an update is received to the content of the electronic message. In some examples a user of the message communications system the collaboration communications system or both provides the update to the content of the electronic message e.g. email message . The update to the content of the electronic message can include an update to the body of the electronic message a reply or forward of the electronic message a comment or reply of one or more particular communications of the electronic messages or other interaction. In some examples the user directly updates the collaboration message.

In response to the receiving the update the collaboration message is updated to include the updated content. In some examples the updated content of the electronic message is identified and provided to the collaboration sever to update the collaboration message. That is the format of the updated content of the electronic message is converted to the format of the collaboration communication systems as discussed above.

In some examples updating the content of the collaboration message to include the updated content can include identifying a message identifier ID associated with the electronic message and identifying a collaboration identifier ID associated with the collaboration message. To that end a mapping is provided between the message ID and the collaboration ID. Specifically the mail data store includes a mail to collaboration ID map . The map stores mappings between message IDs associated with electronic messages and collaboration IDs associated with collaboration message e.g. in a database or a table . In some examples a particular message ID can map to multiple collaboration IDs. In some examples a particular collaboration ID can map to multiple message IDs. Based on the particular mapping associated with the message ID the respective associated collaboration ID is identified. The collaboration message associated with the collaboration ID is further identified and updated to include the updated content.

In some further implementations a first group of users is identified that are associated with the message communications system and a second differing group of users associated with the collaboration communications system . In some examples the first group of users are not associated with the collaboration communications system . In some examples the second group of users are not associated with the message communications system .

In some further implementations based on the suggestion provided to the author e.g. user an indication is received from the author e.g. of the electronic message to convert the content. For example the author can select the aforementioned hyperlink. Based on receiving the indication the content of the electronic message e.g. email message is converted to the format of the collaboration communications system . In some examples the author can further select a portion of the electronic message to convert such that the portion of the content of the electronic message is converted to the format of the collaboration communications system . For example the portion can include a particular communication of the electronic message or a particular thread of the electronic message.

In some further implementations the collaboration message is displayed within the message communications system . Specifically the collaboration message is displayed within a GUI associated with the mail client . In some examples a user associated with the message communications system e.g. a user interacting with the mail client can interact with the collaboration message such as adding replies to particular communications or threads of the collaboration message. In some examples the message communications systems emulates the collaboration communications system such that the user can interact with the collaboration message through the message communication systems in substantially the same way as through the collaboration communications system .

In some further implementations at least one of the one or more characteristics of the electronic message is compared to one or more collaboration rules. For example the collaboration rules define parameters for collaboration messages. That is a collaboration message is associated with parameters that define a collaboration message. In other words the electronic message e.g. email message is deemed fit or not for a collaboration platform. For example the collaboration rules can include rules pertaining to metadata of the electronic message. To that end by comparing the characteristics of the electronic message to the collaboration rules it is determined whether the electronic message satisfies the collaboration rules. When it is determined that the electronic message satisfies the collaboration rules the collaboration message is provided in response. However when it is determined that the electronic message does not satisfy the collaboration rules the collaboration message is not provided and or a warning message can provided to the user or author associated with the electronic message in response.

Implementations of the subject matter and the functional operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry in tangibly embodied computer software or firmware in computer hardware including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents or in combinations of one or more of them. Implementations of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented as one or more computer programs e.g. one or more modules of computer program instructions encoded on a tangible non transitory program carrier for execution by or to control the operation of data processing apparatus. Alternatively or in addition the program instructions can be encoded on an artificially generated propagated signal e.g. a machine generated electrical optical or electromagnetic signal that is generated to encode information for transmission to suitable receiver apparatus for execution by a data processing apparatus. The computer storage medium can be a machine readable storage device a machine readable storage substrate a random or serial access memory device or a combination of one or more of them.

The term data processing apparatus refers to data processing hardware and encompasses all kinds of apparatus devices and machines for processing data including by way of example a programmable processor a computer or multiple processors or computers. The apparatus can also be or further include special purpose logic circuitry e.g. a central processing unit CPU a FPGA field programmable gate array or an ASIC application specific integrated circuit . In some implementations the data processing apparatus and or special purpose logic circuitry may be hardware based and or software based. The apparatus can optionally include code that creates an execution environment for computer programs e.g. code that constitutes processor firmware a protocol stack a database management system an operating system or a combination of one or more of them. The present disclosure contemplates the use of data processing apparatuses with or without conventional operating systems for example Linux UNIX Windows Mac OS Android iOS or any other suitable conventional operating system.

A computer program which may also be referred to or described as a program software a software application a module a software module a script or code can be written in any form of programming language including compiled or interpreted languages or declarative or procedural languages and it can be deployed in any form including as a stand alone program or as a module component subroutine or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program may but need not correspond to a file in a file system. A program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data e.g. one or more scripts stored in a markup language document in a single file dedicated to the program in question or in multiple coordinated files e.g. files that store one or more modules sub programs or portions of code. A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network. While portions of the programs illustrated in the various figures are shown as individual modules that implement the various features and functionality through various objects methods or other processes the programs may instead include a number of sub modules third party services components libraries and such as appropriate. Conversely the features and functionality of various components can be combined into single components as appropriate.

The processes and logic flows described in this specification can be performed by one or more programmable computers executing one or more computer programs to perform functions by operating on input data and generating output. The processes and logic flows can also be performed by and apparatus can also be implemented as special purpose logic circuitry e.g. a central processing unit CPU a FPGA field programmable gate array or an ASIC application specific integrated circuit .

Computers suitable for the execution of a computer program include by way of example can be based on general or special purpose microprocessors or both or any other kind of central processing unit. Generally a central processing unit will receive instructions and data from a read only memory or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a central processing unit for performing or executing instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data. Generally a computer will also include or be operatively coupled to receive data from or transfer data to or both one or more mass storage devices for storing data e.g. magnetic magneto optical disks or optical disks. However a computer need not have such devices. Moreover a computer can be embedded in another device e.g. a mobile telephone a personal digital assistant PDA a mobile audio or video player a game console a Global Positioning System GPS receiver or a portable storage device e.g. a universal serial bus USB flash drive to name just a few.

Computer readable media transitory or non transitory as appropriate suitable for storing computer program instructions and data include all forms of non volatile memory media and memory devices including by way of example semiconductor memory devices e.g. EPROM EEPROM and flash memory devices magnetic disks e.g. internal hard disks or removable disks magneto optical disks and CD ROM and DVD ROM disks. The memory may store various objects or data including caches classes frameworks applications backup data jobs web pages web page templates database tables repositories storing business and or dynamic information and any other appropriate information including any parameters variables algorithms instructions rules constraints or references thereto. Additionally the memory may include any other appropriate data such as logs policies security or access data reporting files as well as others. The processor and the memory can be supplemented by or incorporated in special purpose logic circuitry.

To provide for interaction with a user implementations of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented on a computer having a display device e.g. a CRT cathode ray tube LCD liquid crystal display or plasma monitor for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device e.g. a mouse or a trackball by which the user can provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well for example feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback e.g. visual feedback auditory feedback or tactile feedback and input from the user can be received in any form including acoustic speech or tactile input. In addition a computer can interact with a user by sending documents to and receiving documents from a device that is used by the user for example by sending web pages to a web browser on a user s client device in response to requests received from the web browser.

The term graphical user interface or GUI may be used in the singular or the plural to describe one or more graphical user interfaces and each of the displays of a particular graphical user interface. Therefore a GUI may represent any graphical user interface including but not limited to a web browser a touch screen or a command line interface CLI that processes information and efficiently presents the information results to the user. In general a GUI may include a plurality of user interface UI elements some or all associated with a web browser such as interactive fields pull down lists and buttons operable by the business suite user. These and other UI elements may be related to or represent the functions of the web browser.

Implementations of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back end component e.g. as a data server or that includes a middleware component e.g. an application server or that includes a front end component e.g. a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of the subject matter described in this specification or any combination of one or more such back end middleware or front end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication e.g. a communication network. Examples of communication networks include a local area network LAN a wide area network WAN e.g. the Internet and a wireless local area network WLAN .

The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client server relationship to each other.

While this specification contains many specific implementation details these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of any invention or on the scope of what may be claimed but rather as descriptions of features that may be specific to particular implementations of particular inventions. Certain features that are described in this specification in the context of separate implementations can also be implemented in combination in a single implementation. Conversely various features that are described in the context of a single implementation can also be implemented in multiple implementations separately or in any suitable sub combination. Moreover although features may be described above as acting in certain combinations and even initially claimed as such one or more features from a claimed combination can in some cases be excised from the combination and the claimed combination may be directed to a sub combination or variation of a sub combination.

Similarly while operations are depicted in the drawings in a particular order e.g. this should not be understood as requiring that such operations be performed in the particular order shown or in sequential order or that all illustrated operations be performed to achieve desirable results. In certain circumstances multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous. Moreover the separation of various system modules and components in the implementations described above should not be understood as requiring such separation in all implementations and it should be understood that the described program components and systems can generally be integrated together in a single software product or packaged into multiple software products.

Particular implementations of the subject matter have been described. Other implementations alterations and permutations of the described implementations are within the scope of the following claims as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. For example the actions recited in the claims can be performed in a different order and still achieve desirable results. Accordingly the above description of example implementations does not define or constrain this disclosure. Other changes substitutions and alterations are also possible without departing from the spirit and scope of this disclosure.
