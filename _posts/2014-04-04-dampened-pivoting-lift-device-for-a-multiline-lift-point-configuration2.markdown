The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.

The present invention relates generally to lifting devices and more specifically in one possible embodiment to a dampened one axis pivoting lifting device for a multi line lift configuration.

In the maritime field a lifting device is often used to grab or capture water vehicle such as unmanned underwater vehicles. The lifting device is typically a rigid frame that is clamped to the vehicle. The rigid frame provides lifting points to which multiple lift cables can be attached. Once the frame is secured to the underwater vehicle a ship borne crane lifts the water vehicle from the water.

However the lifting process often takes place in a dynamic fluid environment that may comprise wind and waves that may cause the ship borne crane and or water vehicle to move relative to each other. In this environment the water vehicle which may be relatively heavy is likely to experience rolling movement along the axis of the vehicle.

As the vehicle being lifted rolls in the water environment some lines slacken while at some point during the roll one or more other lines suddenly become taut. When these lift lines suddenly become taut they must resist the entire weight and momentum of the vehicle that suddenly comes to bear. These dynamics can snap the lift lines during the recovery operation and or cause damage to the vehicle as the frame engages the vehicle at stress points. Accordingly this type of suddenly applied stress may be referred to herein as a snap load .

If a lift line breaks or if there is damage to the frame or vehicle due to a snap load the lifting operation can be significantly prolonged. Equipment damage may occur to both the vehicle and lifting device. Moreover breaking lines and or equipment can potentially lead to unsafe environment for workers assisting in the capture of the underwater vehicle.

Consequently those of skill in the art will appreciate the present invention which addresses the above and or other problems.

Accordingly it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved lifting device for a multi line lift configuration.

Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved lifting device for a multi line lift configuration that significantly eliminates roll induced snap loads created by a water vehicle during recovery in a dynamic fluid environment.

Another possible object of the invention is to provide a lifting device for a multi line lift configuration that contains portions that rotate with respect to each other for spring dampening of vehicle movement during recovery in a water environment.

In accordance with the disclosure the present invention provides a lifting device for a multi point lift line configuration to capture a water vehicle. The lifting device comprises a vehicle capture portion and a lifting arms portion. The lifting arms portion may comprise two lifting arms correctable with at least two lift lines of the multi point lift line configuration. At least one spring is connected to the two lifting arms. The lifting arms portion farther comprises at least two vehicle pads positioned for engagement with the vehicle whereby the spring is positioned between the vehicle capture portion and the lifting arms portion. The vehicle capture portion interfaces rigidly with the vehicle. So as the vehicle rolls this portion rolls as well. When it rolls the springs are compressed because the lifting arms portion is held level by the lift lines. In one preferred embodiment the spring is positioned between the vehicle capture portion and the lifting arms portion. The vehicle capture portion interfaces rigidly with the vehicle. So as the vehicle rolls this portion rolls as well. When it rolls the springs are compressed because the lifting arms portion is held level by the lift lines.

In one embodiment a capture connector further comprises a probe mounted to the vehicle capture portion that extends outwardly from the vehicle capture portion at a position for engaging the vehicle.

The vehicle capture portion may further comprise at least one lift line connection point positioned at a distal end from the lifting arms portion. The lift line connection point is operable for connection with at least one lift line of the multi point lift line configuration.

The two lifting arms are positioned on the lifting arms portion to extend outwardly from the vehicle on opposite sides when in position with the capture connector secured to the vehicle. In one embodiment the pivot connection permits relative rotation between the vehicle capture portion and the lifting arms portion only along one axis. The vehicle capture portion is preferably elongate in a direction of the one axis.

In another embodiment a method is provided for making a lifting device for a multi point lift line configuration to capture a vehicle. The method may comprise steps such as providing a vehicle capture portion with a capture connector operable to secure the vehicle capture portion to the vehicle and or providing a lifting arms portion comprising two lifting arms that are connectable with at least two lift lines of the multi point lift line configuration.

Other steps may comprise connecting a spring to each of the two lifting arms and pivotally connecting the vehicle capture portion to the lifting arms portion.

The method may further comprise positioning at least two vehicle pads for engagement with the vehicle in response to compressing the spring.

The method may further comprise providing that the pivot connection permits relative rotation between the vehicle capture portion and the lifting arms portion only along one axis.

Detailed descriptions of the preferred embodiment are provided herein. It is to be understood however that the present invention may be embodied in various forms. Therefore specific details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting but rather as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to employ the present invention in virtually any appropriately detailed system structure or manner.

The need for this invention arises when lifting a mass out of a dynamic fluid environment with a lift line configuration which allows the lifting device complete freedom to roll up to a certain point wherein from that point a high stress is applied that comprises a snap load that is suddenly applied to the lift line configuration.

Turning to multi line capture system comprises lifting device which is lowered onto vehicle . The weight of vehicle capture portion of lifting device presses a probe into vehicle which then locks into vehicle as discussed hereinafter in reference to . Vehicle capture portion preferably has a length sufficient to extend along a substantial portion of the vehicle as shown in .

Multiple lift lines are utilized with lifting device which may comprise lift lines such as lines forward lift lines and or other lift lines and or groups of lift lines. Lift line attaches to arm and lift line attaches to arm . Accordingly lift lines may be utilized to prevent or resist rolling of vehicle .

The lifting process requires that lift lines be slackened during capture which allows lifting device and vehicle to begin to roll unrestrained. As the angle of the roil increases and or as lift lines are tightened the forces increase to resist rolling motion. However in accord with the present invention capture system is designed to so that forces applied to the lift lines due to rolling of vehicle increases more gradually. System more gradually increases force to resist roll as one of lines and is more gradually tightened. In this way the likelihood of sudden application of snap loads is greatly reduced or prevented. Vehicle rolling motion is thereby better controlled without damage to lifting system and or the vehicle .

A more in depth view of multi line capture system is depicted in . However as shown the vehicle is rotated to create tension in lift line . When line is tensioned the vehicle should be rotated clockwise with respect to the lift arms . Lift line arm connects with lift line via clevis hitch . Lift line arm connects with lift line via clevis hitch . In this scenario as vehicle rolls in a clockwise direction vehicle pad contacts vehicle and force is gradually applied to lift line through a spring loaded connection between lift line arm and vehicle capture portion . Lifting device also comprises pivot connection which allows lift line arms to pivot with respect to vehicle capture portion .

Turning to there is shown vehicle capture portion and lifting arms portion of lifting device . Lifting arms portion comprises lift line interfacing arms . Lifting arms portion is interconnected with vehicle capture portion via pivot connection that allows pivotal or rotational motion therebetween along a single axis in two directions as indicated by arrow . In one embodiment lifting arms portion interfaces only with the corresponding lift lines connected at opposite ends thereof see and pivot connection of vehicle capture portion . The vehicle capture portion interfaces with the lifting arm pivoting portion and the vehicle. Vehicle capture portion further comprises a capture connector see discussed hereinafter with respect to which secures vehicle capture portion to vehicle to thereby capture vehicle . Various types of appropriate capture connectors known in the art may be utilized for connecting lifting device to existing water vehicles.

In vehicle capture portion and lifting arms portion are depicted in a pivoted position with respect to each other which occurs when vehicle rolls. Pivot connection of lifting device separates vehicle capture portion and lifting arms portion into two portions that can rotate independently of each other. Preferably pivot connection permits only rotation along a single axis that is parallel or generally parallel to axis of vehicle shown in .

Referring now to springs and control the rotation of lifting device by gradually slowing or dampening the rolling motion of vehicle and thereby preventing snap loads suddenly being applied to lift lines . As shown in spring is compressed while spring is not compressed. It will be noted that springs interface only between vehicle capture portion and lifting arms portion there are no springs between the pads see e.g. and the lifting arms . In the example of spring is compressed while spring is not.

In lifting arms portion of lifting device is depicted partially in cut away. Relative movement of lifting device and vehicle is controlled using springs to counteract rotation. Springs may comprise spring canisters or shock absorbers as examples. Vehicle capture portion See connects with lifting arms portion at pivot connection . As vehicle capture portion rotates relative to lift line arms one of springs is compressed via one of spring rods depending on the direction of the roll. The compression of springs stores a large amount of energy. This energy buildup slows the roil of the vehicle being recovered and eliminates snap line loading of the lift lines. In one non limiting embodiment the springs are connected via rods between the lifting arms portion and the vehicle capture portion .

The springs may be configured differently may comprise more or fewer than two springs and may or may not comprise rods as long as the springs are connected between lifting arms portion and vehicle capture portion so as to dampen the relative rotational movement therebetween.

Vehicle is affixed to lifting device by single point vehicle connection which is discussed in more detail below and illustrated in . The relative position of single point vehicle connection point on vehicle capture portion is also shown in .

In vehicle is not rolling i.e. it is in a zero degree roll upright and stationary. In this position lift lines are both relatively slack or have even loads applied. Lift line arms are both at relative equal positions with respect to vehicle . Vehicle pads are evenly spaced and may have little or no contact with vehicle .

In vehicle experiences the first two degrees of an initial roll e.g. in a clockwise direction as indicated by the arrow . Lift line remains relatively slack but lift line may become more taught in reaction to the roll. Vehicle makes contact with vehicle pad and vehicle pad may become or remain spaced away from vehicle .

In lifting arms portion pivots sufficiently with respect to vehicle capture portion to provide initial spring compression of spring as vehicle experiences roll which in one embodiment may be in the general range of five to ten degrees. Vehicle pad further applies pressure to vehicle through spring as lift line becomes further tensioned. This tension causes spring to compress and store energy to counteract rotation of vehicle as discussed hereinbefore in reference to .

It will be noted that if the roll was initiated in the opposite direction than that depicted by the arrow in the descriptions above would hold true except lift line would be the line experiencing tension and pad would initiate contact with vehicle .

In a side view is shown of lifting device mounted to vehicle . Vehicle capture portion comprises single point vehicle connection which preferably is positioned near the center of gravity of vehicle when the vehicle is captured.

Accordingly as discussed hereinbefore the present invention prevents and or significantly reduces the possibility of snap line loading that was present with previous lifting devices. Pivotal lifting device with spring loading eliminates snap line loading between vehicle vehicle lift device and lift lines .

It will be understood that many additional changes in the details materials steps and arrangement of parts which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.
