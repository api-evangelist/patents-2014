title: Comprehensive user/event matching or recommendations based on awareness of entities, activities, interests, desires, location
abstract: A method for comprehensive user/event matching or recommendations is described. The method includes a network environment which receives one or more pieces of user data, event data, or social data from users or third party data sources, determining the relevance of the data for users, and displaying the identified data to user in the form of recommendations.

The present application incorporates by reference U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 794 283 filed on Mar. 15 2013 for Comprehensive User Event Matching or Recommendations Based on Awareness of Entities Activities Interests Desires Location. 

The invention relates generally to social networking and in particular to systems and methods for serving meaningful real world recommendations.

Social networking services include social utilities that track and enable connections between users including people businesses and other entities which have become prevalent in recent years. In particular social networking services allow users to communicate more efficiently information that is relevant to their friends or other connections in the social networking service. Social networking services typically incorporate a system for connecting users to content that is likely to be relevant to each user. For example users may be grouped according to one or more common attributes in their profiles such as geographic location employer job type age music preferences page likes followers or other attributes. Users of the social networking service and or external parties can then use these groups to customize or target information delivery so that information that might be of particular interest to a group can be communicated to that group.

Furthermore advertisers wishing to use members affinities or common attributes as targeting criteria for advertisements have difficulty placing their ads in contextually relevant areas a problem called ad blindness. As a result members are inundated with advertisements for products unrelated to the context of what the members are currently viewing. Thus these ads are largely ignored by members of a social network.

Despite prior art designed to increase the relevance of this information the systems and methods of the prior art do not achieve the desired outcome and continue to overwhelm the user with large amounts of non relevant information. Additionally methods for indicating user interests including page likes and followers on social networks today are largely comprised of non useful and non meaningful data for real world offline interactions thus the power for directing content recommendations and advertising that promotes real world interactions is greatly limited.

The foregoing description of the embodiments of the invention has been presented for the purpose of illustration it is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. Persons skilled in the relevant art can appreciate that many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above disclosure.

Some portions of this description describe the embodiments of the invention in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on information. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are commonly used by those skilled in the data processing arts to convey the substance of their work effectively to others skilled in the art. These operations while described functionally computationally or logically are understood to be implemented by computer programs or equivalent electrical circuits microcode or the like. Furthermore it has also proven convenient at times to refer to these arrangements of operations as modules without loss of generality. The described operations and their associated modules may be embodied in software firmware hardware or any combinations thereof.

Any of the steps operations or processes described herein may be performed or implemented with one or more hardware or software modules alone or in combination with other devices. In one embodiment a software module is implemented with a computer program product comprising a computer readable medium containing computer program code which can be executed by a computer processor for performing any or all of the steps operations or processes described.

Embodiments of the invention may also relate to an apparatus for performing the operations herein. This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes and or it may comprise a general purpose computing device selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer. Such a computer program may be stored in a tangible computer readable storage medium or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions and coupled to a computer system bus. Furthermore any computing systems referred to in the specification may include a single processor or may be architectures employing multiple processor designs for increased computing capability.

Embodiments of the invention may also relate to a computer data signal embodied in a carrier wave where the computer data signal includes any embodiment of a computer program product or other data combination described herein. The computer data signal is a product that is presented in a tangible medium or carrier wave and modulated or otherwise encoded in the carrier wave which is tangible and transmitted according to any suitable transmission method.

Finally the language used in the specification has been principally selected for readability and instructional purposes and it may not have been selected to delineate or circumscribe the inventive subject matter. It is therefore intended that the scope of the invention be limited not by this detailed description but rather by any claims that issue on an application based hereon. Accordingly the disclosure of the embodiments of the invention is intended to be illustrative but not limiting of the scope of the invention which is set forth in the following claims.
