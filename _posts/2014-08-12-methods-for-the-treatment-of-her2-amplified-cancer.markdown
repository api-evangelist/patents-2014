Described herein are methods of treating HER2 amplified breast cancer in an individual in need thereof comprising administering to the individual a composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of an ACK inhibitor compound e.g. a BTK inhibitor such as for example ibrutinib . As shown herein ibrutinib is an ACK inhibitor compound that is effective in inhibiting the activity of ErbB kinases such as EGFR ErbB1 HER2 ErbB2 and HER4 ErbB4 . Further described herein are methods of treating HER2 amplified cancer in an individual in need thereof comprising administering to the individual a composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of an ACK inhibitor compound e.g. a BTK inhibitor such as for example ibrutinib .

HER2 Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 also known as Neu ErbB2 CD340 cluster of differentiation 340 and p185 is an epidermal growth factor receptor found on cells. The HER2 gene is found on human chromosome 17. HER2 protein is composed of four plasma membrane bound receptor tyrosine kinases. Signaling pathways activated by HER2 protein include mitogen activated protein kinase MAPK phosphoinositide 3 kinase PI3K Akt phospholipase C protein kinase C PKC and signal transducer and activator of transcription STAT .

As used herein HER2 amplified cancer means a cancer e.g. breast cancer characterized by amplification or over expression of the HER2 gene. Amplification of HER2 gene expression leads to increased membrane expression of the HER2 protein. Increased expression is associated with increased dimerization of HER2 proteins with HER3 and HER4. Increased dimerization leads to increased activation of the HER2 tyrosine kinase resulting in excessive mitosis and cell replication.

HER2 amplification has been identified in breast colon endometrial cervical urothelial lung including non small cell lung cancer ovarian gastric gastroesophageal junction GEJ head and neck biliary tract prostate and pancreatic adenocarcinomas. HER2 amplification is present in about 18 25 of breast cancers. HER2 amplification is also present in about 30 of GEJ cancers and about 20 of gastric cancers. In some embodiments the HER2 amplified cancer is selected from breast colon endometrial cervical urothelial lung ovarian salivary duct gastric and gastroesophageal junction GEJ cancer. In some embodiments the HER2 amplified cancer is HER2 amplified breast cancer. In some embodiments the HER2 amplified cancer is HER2 amplified gastric cancer. In some embodiments the HER2 amplified cancer is HER2 amplified gastroesophageal junction GEJ cancer.

HER2 amplified tumors are characterized by an aggressive phenotype e.g. increased cell proliferation increased cell survival increased cell motility and increased cell adhesion increased metastasis increased relapse shorter disease free survival and poorer overall survival. In some embodiments the HER2 amplified cancer is metastatic HER2 amplified cancer. Individuals with HER2 amplified breast cancer are at a high risk of developing brain metastases. In some embodiments the HER2 amplified breast cancer is metastatic HER2 amplified breast cancer. In some embodiments the HER2 amplified breast cancer has metastasized to the brain.

The degree of HER2 amplification is variable amongst tumors. Some tumors have high levels of amplification HER2 CEP17 ratio 4.0 whereas others have lower levels amplification HER2 CEP17 ratio of 2.0 4.0 or HER2 CEP17 ratio of 2.2 4.0 . Several tests are used to diagnose and classify HER2 amplification immunohistochemistry IHC Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization FISH Subtraction Probe Technology Chromogenic In Situ Hybridization SPoT Light HER2 CISH and Inform HER2 Dual In Situ Hybridization ISH . Using IHC a cancer is classified as HER2 amplified if it is rated 3 . Using FISH a cancer is generally classified as HER2 amplified if it has a HER2 CEP17 ratio of 2.2 4.0. A HER2 CEP17 ratio of 1.8 to 2.2 is considered equivocal.

In some instances HER2 amplified tumors is associated with the presence and in some cases elevated expression of heregulin. Heregulin HRG also known as neuregulin is a member of the EGF like growth and differentiation factors. There are four isoforms of HRG HRG1 HRG4 . HRG binds with high affinity to the receptors of ErbB3 and ErbB4 members of the human epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR family of receptors. Upon activation ErbB3 undergoes heterodimerization with other members of the ErbB family leading to cell differentiation migration proliferation and survival.

In some cases the presence and or elevated level of HRG in breast cancer is correlated with poor histological grades. In some cases the presence and or elevated level of HRG in HER2 amplified breast cancer is correlated with poor histological grades. In some cases the presence and or elevated level of HRG in HER2 amplified tumors is correlated with poor histological grades.

In some cases breast cancer contains an elevated level of HRG. In some cases HER2 amplified breast cancer contains an elevated level of HRG. In some cases HER2 amplified tumors contains an elevated level of HRG.

In some cases HRG induces resistance in breast cancer. In some cases HRG induces resistance in HER2 amplified breast cancer. In some cases HRG induces resistance in HER2 amplified tumors.

In some cases the presence or absence or the expression level of HRG is used to select a patient for therapy. In some cases the presence or absence or the expression level of HRG is used to monitor a patient s treatment progress. In some cases the presence or absence or the expression level of HRG is used to optimize a therapeutic regimen.

The ACK inhibitor compounds described herein are selective for kinases having an accessible cysteine that is able to form a covalent bond with a Michael acceptor moiety on the inhibitor compound. In some embodiments the cysteine residue is accessible or becomes accessible when the binding site moiety of the irreversible inhibitor binds to the kinase. That is the binding site moiety of the irreversible inhibitor binds to an active site of the ACK and the Michael acceptor moiety of irreversible inhibitor gains access in one embodiment the step of binding leads to a conformational change in the ACK thus exposing the cysteine or is otherwise exposed to the cysteine residue of the ACK as a result a covalent bond is formed between the S of the cysteine residue and the Michael acceptor of the irreversible inhibitor. Consequently the binding site moiety of the irreversible inhibitor remains bound or otherwise blocks the active site of the ACK.

In one embodiment the ACK is Btk a homolog of Btk or a tyrosine kinase having a cysteine residue in an amino acid sequence position that is homologous to the amino acid sequence position of cysteine 481 in Btk. In some embodiments the ACK is HER4. Inhibitor compounds described herein include a Michael acceptor moiety a binding site moiety and a linker that links the binding site moiety and the Michael acceptor moiety and in some embodiments the structure of the linker provides a conformation or otherwise directs the Michael acceptor moiety so as to improve the selectivity of the irreversible inhibitor for a particular ACK .

When an additional agent is co administered with an ACK inhibitor the additional agent and the ACK inhibitor do not have to be administered in the same pharmaceutical composition and are optionally because of different physical and chemical characteristics administered by different routes. The initial administration is made for example according to established protocols and then based upon the observed effects the dosage modes of administration and times of administration are modified.

By way of example only if a side effect experienced by an individual upon receiving an ACK inhibitor is nausea then it is appropriate to administer an anti emetic agent in combination with the ACK inhibitor.

Or by way of example only the therapeutic effectiveness of an ACK inhibitor described herein is enhanced by administration of an adjuvant i.e. by itself the adjuvant has minimal therapeutic benefit but in combination with another therapeutic agent the overall therapeutic benefit to the patient is enhanced . Or by way of example only the benefit experienced by an individual is increased by administering an ACK inhibitor described herein with another therapeutic agent which also includes a therapeutic regimen that also has therapeutic benefit. In any case regardless of the disease disorder being treated the overall benefit experienced by the patient is in some embodiments simply additive of the two therapeutic agents or in other embodiments the patient experiences a synergistic benefit.

The particular choice of compounds used will depend upon the diagnosis of the attending physicians and their judgment of the condition of the patient and the appropriate treatment protocol. The compounds are optionally administered concurrently e.g. simultaneously essentially simultaneously or within the same treatment protocol or sequentially depending upon the nature of the disorder the condition of the patient and the actual choice of compounds used. The determination of the order of administration and the number of repetitions of administration of each therapeutic agent during a treatment protocol is based on an evaluation of the disease being treated and the condition of the patient.

In some embodiments therapeutically effective dosages vary when the drugs are used in treatment combinations. Methods for experimentally determining therapeutically effective dosages of drugs and other agents for use in combination treatment regimens are described in the literature. For example the use of metronomic dosing i.e. providing more frequent lower doses in order to minimize toxic side effects has been described extensively in the literature Combination treatment further includes periodic treatments that start and stop at various times to assist with the clinical management of the patient.

For combination therapies described herein dosages of the co administered compounds will of course vary depending on the type of co drug employed on the specific drug employed on the disorder being treated and so forth. In addition when co administered with an additional therapeutic agent an ACK inhibitor described herein is administered either simultaneously with the additional therapeutic agent or sequentially. If administered sequentially the attending physician will decide on the appropriate sequence of administering protein in combination with the biologically active agent s .

If the additional therapeutic agent and the ACK inhibitor are administered simultaneously the multiple therapeutic agents are optionally provided in a single unified form or in multiple forms by way of example only either as a single pill or as two separate pills . In some embodiments one of the therapeutic agents is given in multiple doses or both are given as multiple doses. If not simultaneous the timing between the multiple doses is from about more than zero weeks to less than about four weeks. In addition the combination methods compositions and formulations are not to be limited to the use of only two agents the use of multiple therapeutic combinations is also envisioned.

It is understood that the dosage regimen to treat prevent or ameliorate the condition s for which relief is sought can be modified in accordance with a variety of factors. These factors include the disorder from which the subject suffers as well as the age weight sex diet and medical condition of the subject. Thus the dosage regimen actually employed can vary widely and therefore can deviate from the dosage regimens set forth herein.

In some embodiments the pharmaceutical agents which make up the combination therapy disclosed herein are administered in a combined dosage form or in separate dosage forms intended for substantially simultaneous administration. In some embodiments the pharmaceutical agents that make up the combination therapy are administered sequentially with either therapeutic compound being administered by a regimen calling for two step administration. In some embodiments the two step administration regimen calls for sequential administration of the active agents or spaced apart administration of the separate active agents. The time period between the multiple administration steps ranges from a few minutes to several hours depending upon the properties of each pharmaceutical agent such as potency solubility bioavailability plasma half life and kinetic profile of the pharmaceutical agent. In some embodiments circadian variation of the target molecule concentration determines the optimal dose interval.

In some embodiments the ACK inhibitor compound and the additional therapeutic agent are administered in a unified dosage form. In some embodiments the ACK inhibitor compound and the additional therapeutic agent are administered in separate dosage forms. In some embodiments the ACK inhibitor compound and the additional therapeutic agent are administered simultaneously or sequentially.

In still other embodiments effervescent powders are also prepared in accordance with the present disclosure. Effervescent salts have been used to disperse medicines in water for oral administration. Effervescent salts are granules or coarse powders containing a medicinal agent in a dry mixture usually composed of sodium bicarbonate citric acid and or tartaric acid. When salts of the compositions described herein are added to water the acids and the base react to liberate carbon dioxide gas thereby causing effervescence. Examples of effervescent salts include e.g. the following ingredients sodium bicarbonate or a mixture of sodium bicarbonate and sodium carbonate citric acid and or tartaric acid. Any acid base combination that results in the liberation of carbon dioxide can be used in place of the combination of sodium bicarbonate and citric and tartaric acids as long as the ingredients were suitable for pharmaceutical use and result in a pH of about 6.0 or higher.

In some embodiments the solid dosage forms described herein can be formulated as enteric coated delayed release oral dosage forms i.e. as an oral dosage form of a pharmaceutical composition as described herein which utilizes an enteric coating to affect release in the small intestine of the gastrointestinal tract. The enteric coated dosage form may be a compressed or molded or extruded tablet mold coated or uncoated containing granules powder pellets beads or particles of the active ingredient and or other composition components which are themselves coated or uncoated. The enteric coated oral dosage form may also be a capsule coated or uncoated containing pellets beads or granules of the solid carrier or the composition which are themselves coated or uncoated.

The term delayed release as used herein refers to the delivery so that the release can be accomplished at some generally predictable location in the intestinal tract more distal to that which would have been accomplished if there had been no delayed release alterations. In some embodiments the method for delay of release is coating. Any coatings should be applied to a sufficient thickness such that the entire coating does not dissolve in the gastrointestinal fluids at pH below about 5 but does dissolve at pH about 5 and above. It is expected that any anionic polymer exhibiting a pH dependent solubility profile can be used as an enteric coating in the methods and compositions described herein to achieve delivery to the lower gastrointestinal tract. In some embodiments the polymers described herein are anionic carboxylic polymers. In other embodiments the polymers and compatible mixtures thereof and some of their properties include but are not limited to 

Shellac also called purified lac a refined product obtained from the resinous secretion of an insect. This coating dissolves in media of pH 7 

Acrylic polymers. The performance of acrylic polymers primarily their solubility in biological fluids can vary based on the degree and type of substitution. Examples of suitable acrylic polymers include methacrylic acid copolymers and ammonium methacrylate copolymers. The Eudragit series E L S RL RS and NE Rohm Pharma are available as solubilized in organic solvent aqueous dispersion or dry powders. The Eudragit series RL NE and RS are insoluble in the gastrointestinal tract but are permeable and are used primarily for colonic targeting. The Eudragit series E dissolve in the stomach. The Eudragit series L L 30D and S are insoluble in stomach and dissolve in the intestine 

Cellulose Derivatives. Examples of suitable cellulose derivatives are ethyl cellulose reaction mixtures of partial acetate esters of cellulose with phthalic anhydride. The performance can vary based on the degree and type of substitution. Cellulose acetate phthalate CAP dissolves in pH 6. Aquateric FMC is an aqueous based system and is a spray dried CAP psuedolatex with particles 5 and it is much less permeable to water vapor and gastric fluids.

In some embodiments the coating can and usually does contain a plasticizer and possibly other coating excipients such as colorants talc and or magnesium stearate which are well known in the art. Suitable plasticizers include triethyl citrate Citroflex 2 triacetin glyceryl triacetate acetyl triethyl citrate Citroflec A2 Carbowax 400 polyethylene glycol 400 diethyl phthalate tributyl citrate acetylated monoglycerides glycerol fatty acid esters propylene glycol and dibutyl phthalate. In particular anionic carboxylic acrylic polymers usually will contain 10 25 by weight of a plasticizer especially dibutyl phthalate polyethylene glycol triethyl citrate and triacetin. Conventional coating techniques such as spray or pan coating are employed to apply coatings. The coating thickness must be sufficient to ensure that the oral dosage form remains intact until the desired site of topical delivery in the intestinal tract is reached.

Colorants detackifiers surfactants antifoaming agents lubricants e.g. carnuba wax or PEG may be added to the coatings besides plasticizers to solubilize or disperse the coating material and to improve coating performance and the coated product.

In other embodiments the formulations described herein which include ibrutinib and or an additional therapeutic agent are delivered using a pulsatile dosage form. A pulsatile dosage form is capable of providing one or more immediate release pulses at predetermined time points after a controlled lag time or at specific sites. Many other types of controlled release systems known to those of ordinary skill in the art and are suitable for use with the formulations described herein. Examples of such delivery systems include e.g. polymer based systems such as polylactic and polyglycolic acid plyanhydrides and polycaprolactone porous matrices nonpolymer based systems that are lipids including sterols such as cholesterol cholesterol esters and fatty acids or neutral fats such as mono di and triglycerides hydrogel release systems silastic systems peptide based systems wax coatings bioerodible dosage forms compressed tablets using conventional binders and the like.

In some embodiments the pharmaceutical formulations described herein can be self emulsifying drug delivery systems SEDDS . Emulsions are dispersions of one immiscible phase in another usually in the form of droplets. Generally emulsions are created by vigorous mechanical dispersion. SEDDS as opposed to emulsions or microemulsions spontaneously form emulsions when added to an excess of water without any external mechanical dispersion or agitation. An advantage of SEDDS is that only gentle mixing is required to distribute the droplets throughout the solution. Additionally water or the aqueous phase can be added just prior to administration which ensures stability of an unstable or hydrophobic active ingredient. Thus the SEDDS provides an effective delivery system for oral and parenteral delivery of hydrophobic active ingredients. SEDDS may provide improvements in the bioavailability of hydrophobic active ingredients. Methods of producing self emulsifying dosage forms are known in the art and include but are not limited to for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 858 401 6 667 048 and 6 960 563 each of which is specifically incorporated by reference.

It is to be appreciated that there is overlap between the above listed additives used in the aqueous dispersions or suspensions described herein since a given additive is often classified differently by different practitioners in the field or is commonly used for any of several different functions. Thus the above listed additives should be taken as merely exemplary and not limiting of the types of additives that can be included in formulations described herein. The amounts of such additives can be readily determined by one skilled in the art according to the particular properties desired.

Intranasal formulations are known in the art and are described in for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 476 116 5 116 817 and 6 391 452 each of which is specifically incorporated by reference. Formulations that include ibrutinib and or an additional therapeutic agent which are prepared according to these and other techniques well known in the art are prepared as solutions in saline employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives fluorocarbons and or other solubilizing or dispersing agents known in the art. See for example Ansel H. C. et al. Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems Sixth Ed. 1995 . Preferably these compositions and formulations are prepared with suitable nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients. These ingredients are known to those skilled in the preparation of nasal dosage forms and some of these can be found in REMINGTON THE SCIENCE AND PRACTICE OF PHARMACY 21st edition 2005 a standard reference in the field. The choice of suitable carriers is highly dependent upon the exact nature of the nasal dosage form desired e.g. solutions suspensions ointments or gels. Nasal dosage forms generally contain large amounts of water in addition to the active ingredient. Minor amounts of other ingredients such as pH adjusters emulsifiers or dispersing agents preservatives surfactants gelling agents or buffering and other stabilizing and solubilizing agents may also be present. The nasal dosage form should be isotonic with nasal secretions.

In addition the buccal dosage forms described herein can further include a bioerodible hydrolysable polymeric carrier that also serves to adhere the dosage form to the buccal mucosa. The buccal dosage form is fabricated so as to erode gradually over a predetermined time period wherein the delivery is provided essentially throughout. Buccal drug delivery as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art avoids the disadvantages encountered with oral drug administration e.g. slow absorption degradation of the active agent by fluids present in the gastrointestinal tract and or first pass inactivation in the liver. With regard to the bioerodible hydrolysable polymeric carrier it will be appreciated that virtually any such carrier can be used so long as the desired drug release profile is not compromised and the carrier is compatible with ibrutinib and or an additional therapeutic agent and any other components that may be present in the buccal dosage unit.

Examples of suitable aqueous and non aqueous carriers diluents solvents or vehicles including water ethanol polyols propyleneglycol polyethylene glycol glycerol cremophor and the like suitable mixtures thereof vegetable oils such as olive oil and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained for example by the use of a coating such as lecithin by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions and by the use of surfactants. Formulations suitable for subcutaneous injection may also contain additives such as preserving wetting emulsifying and dispensing agents. Prevention of the growth of microorganisms can be ensured by various antibacterial and antifungal agents such as parabens chlorobutanol phenol sorbic acid and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents such as sugars sodium chloride and the like.

Methods for determining the expression level or the presence of biomarkers such as heregulin are well known in the art for example by ELISA radioimmunoassay RIA electrochemiluminescence ECL Western blot multiplexing technologies or other similar methods. Cell surface expression of biomarkers are measured for example by flow cytometry immunohistochemistry Western Blot immunoprecipitation magnetic bead selection and quantification of cells expressing either of these cell surface markers. Biomarker RNA expression levels could be measured by RT PCR Qt PCR microarray Northern blot or other similar technologies.

As disclosed herein determining the expression or presence of the biomarker of interest at the protein or nucleotide level is accomplished using any detection method known to those of skill in the art. By detecting expression or detecting the level of is intended determining the expression level or presence of a biomarker protein or gene in the biological sample. Thus detecting expression encompasses instances where a biomarker is determined not to be expressed not to be detectably expressed expressed at a low level expressed at a normal level or overexpressed.

In certain aspects of the method provided herein the tumor samples are isolated detected or measured. In certain embodiments the tumor samples are isolated detected or measured using immunophenotyping techniques. In other embodiments the tumor samples are isolated detected or measured using fluorescence activated cell sorting FACS techniques.

In certain aspects the expression or presence of these various biomarkers and any clinically useful prognostic markers in a biological sample are detected at the protein or nucleic acid level using for example immunohistochemistry techniques or nucleic acid based techniques such as in situ hybridization and RT PCR. In one embodiments the expression or presence of one or more biomarkers is carried out by a means for nucleic acid amplification a means for nucleic acid sequencing a means utilizing a nucleic acid microarray DNA and RNA or a means for in situ hybridization using specifically labeled probes.

In other embodiments determining the expression or presence of one or more biomarkers is carried out through gel electrophoresis. In one embodiment the determination is carried out through transfer to a membrane and hybridization with a specific probe.

In other embodiments the determining the expression or presence of one or more biomarkers carried out by a diagnostic imaging technique.

In still other embodiments the determining the expression or presence of one or more biomarkers carried out by a detectable solid substrate. In one embodiment the detectable solid substrate is paramagnetic nanoparticles functionalized with antibodies.

In some embodiments expression level of a biomarker protein of interest in a biological sample is detected by means of a binding protein capable of interacting specifically with that biomarker protein or a biologically active variant thereof. In some embodiments labeled antibodies binding portions thereof or other binding partners are used. The word label when used herein refers to a detectable compound or composition that is conjugated directly or indirectly to the antibody so as to generate a labeled antibody. In some embodiments the label is detectable by itself e.g. radioisotope labels or fluorescent labels or in the case of an enzymatic label catalyzes chemical alteration of a substrate compound or composition that is detectable.

The antibodies for detection of a biomarker protein are either monoclonal or polyclonal in origin or are synthetically or recombinantly produced. The amount of complexed protein for example the amount of biomarker protein associated with the binding protein for example an antibody that specifically binds to the biomarker protein is determined using standard protein detection methodologies known to those of skill in the art. A detailed review of immunological assay design theory and protocols are found in numerous texts in the art see for example Ausubel et al. eds. 1995 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Greene Publishing and Wiley Interscience NY Coligan et al. eds. 1994 Current Protocols in Immunology John Wiley Sons Inc. New York N.Y. .

The choice of marker used to label the antibodies will vary depending upon the application. However the choice of the marker is readily determinable to one skilled in the art. These labeled antibodies are used in immunoassays as well as in histological applications to detect the presence of any biomarker or protein of interest. The labeled antibodies are either polyclonal or monoclonal. Further the antibodies for use in detecting a protein of interest are labeled with a radioactive atom an enzyme a chromophoric or fluorescent moiety or a colorimetric tag as described elsewhere herein. The choice of tagging label also will depend on the detection limitations desired. Enzyme assays ELISAs typically allow detection of a colored product formed by interaction of the enzyme tagged complex with an enzyme substrate. Radionuclides that serve as detectable labels include for example I 131 I 123 I 125 Y 90 Re 188 Re 186 At 211 Cu 67 Bi 212 and Pd 109. Examples of enzymes that serve as detectable labels include but are not limited to horseradish peroxidase alkaline phosphatase beta galactosidase and glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase. Chromophoric moieties include but are not limited to fluorescein and rhodamine. The antibodies are conjugated to these labels by methods known in the art. For example enzymes and chromophoric molecules are conjugated to the antibodies by means of coupling agents such as dialdehydes carbodiimides dimaleimides and the like. Alternatively conjugation occurs through a ligand receptor pair. Examples of suitable ligand receptor pairs are biotin avidin or biotin streptavidin and antibody antigen.

In certain embodiments expression or presence of the biomarkers disclosed herein is determined by radioimmunoassays or enzyme linked immunoassays ELISAs competitive binding enzyme linked immunoassays dot blot see for example Promega Protocols and Applications Guide Promega Corporation 1991 Western blot see for example Sambrook et al. 1989 Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual Vol. 3 Chapter 18 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Plainview N.Y. chromatography such as high performance liquid chromatography HPLC or other assays known in the art. Thus the detection assays involve steps such as but not limited to immunoblotting immunodiffusion immunoelectrophoresis or immunoprecipitation.

In some embodiments the expression or presence of the biomarkers described herein are also determined at the nucleic acid level. Nucleic acid based techniques for assessing expression are well known in the art and include for example determining the level of biomarker mRNA in a biological sample. Many expression detection methods use isolated RNA. Any RNA isolation technique that does not select against the isolation of mRNA is utilized for the purification of RNA see e.g. Ausubel et al. ed. 1987 1999 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology John Wiley Sons New York . Additionally large numbers of tissue samples are readily processed using techniques well known to those of skill in the art such as for example the single step RNA isolation process disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4 843 155.

Thus in some embodiments the detection of a biomarker or other protein of interest is assayed at the nucleic acid level using nucleic acid probes. The term nucleic acid probe refers to any molecule that is capable of selectively binding to a specifically intended target nucleic acid molecule for example a nucleotide transcript. Probes are synthesized by one of skill in the art or derived from appropriate biological preparations. Probes are specifically designed to be labeled for example with a radioactive label a fluorescent label an enzyme a chemiluminescent tag a colorimetric tag or other labels or tags that are discussed above or that are known in the art. Examples of molecules that are utilized as probes include but are not limited to RNA and DNA.

For example isolated mRNA are used in hybridization or amplification assays that include but are not limited to Southern or Northern analyses polymerase chain reaction analyses and probe arrays. One method for the detection of mRNA levels involves contacting the isolated mRNA with a nucleic acid molecule probe that hybridize to the mRNA encoded by the gene being detected. The nucleic acid probe comprises of for example a full length cDNA or a portion thereof such as an oligonucleotide of at least 7 15 30 50 100 250 or 500 nucleotides in length and sufficient to specifically hybridize under stringent conditions to an mRNA or genomic DNA encoding a biomarker biomarker described herein above. Hybridization of an mRNA with the probe indicates that the biomarker or other target protein of interest is being expressed.

In one embodiment the mRNA is immobilized on a solid surface and contacted with a probe for example by running the isolated mRNA on an agarose gel and transferring the mRNA from the gel to a membrane such as nitrocellulose. In an alternative embodiment the probe s are immobilized on a solid surface and the mRNA is contacted with the probe s for example in a gene chip array. A skilled artisan readily adapts known mRNA detection methods for use in detecting the level of mRNA encoding the biomarkers or other proteins of interest.

An alternative method for determining the level of an mRNA of interest in a sample involves the process of nucleic acid amplification e.g. by RT PCR see for example U.S. Pat. No. 4 683 202 ligase chain reaction Barany 1991 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88 189 193 self sustained sequence replication Guatelli et al. 1990 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87 1874 1878 transcriptional amplification system Kwoh et al. 1989 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 1173 1177 Q Beta Replicase Lizardi et al. 1988 Bio Technology 6 1197 rolling circle replication U.S. Pat. No. 5 854 033 or any other nucleic acid amplification method followed by the detection of the amplified molecules using techniques well known to those of skill in the art. These detection schemes are especially useful for the detection of nucleic acid molecules if such molecules are present in very low numbers. In particular aspects of the invention biomarker expression is assessed by quantitative fluorogenic RT PCR i.e. the TaqMan System .

Expression levels of an RNA of interest are monitored using a membrane blot such as used in hybridization analysis such as Northern dot and the like or microwells sample tubes gels beads or fibers or any solid support comprising bound nucleic acids . See U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 770 722 5 874 219 5 744 305 5 677 195 and 5 445 934. The detection of expression also comprises using nucleic acid probes in solution.

In one embodiment of the invention microarrays are used to determine expression or presence of one or more biomarkers. Microarrays are particularly well suited for this purpose because of the reproducibility between different experiments. DNA microarrays provide one method for the simultaneous measurement of the expression levels of large numbers of genes. Each array consists of a reproducible pattern of capture probes attached to a solid support. Labeled RNA or DNA is hybridized to complementary probes on the array and then detected by laser scanning Hybridization intensities for each probe on the array are determined and converted to a quantitative value representing relative gene expression levels. See U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 040 138 5 800 992 and 6 020 135 6 033 860 and 6 344 316. High density oligonucleotide arrays are particularly useful for determining the gene expression profile for a large number of RNA s in a sample.

The following specific and non limiting examples are to be construed as merely illustrative and do not limit the present disclosure in any way whatsoever.

Breast cancer lines BT 474 SK BR3 MDA MB 453 and UACC 893 were obtained from ATCC and cultured as indicated from the source. Antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling and Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. Western blotting reagents were obtained from Life Technology Invitrogen . Antibody to Btk was obtained from BD Biosciences.

BT 474 and SK BR 3 cells ATCC were cultured in DMEM and McCoy 5A media respectively supplemented with 10 fetal calf serum. Antibodies to EGFR pEGFR Y1086 HER2 pHER2 Y1248 HER3 pHER3 Y1289 Akt pAkt MEK pMEK and pBtk Y223 were from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibodies to HER4 pHER4 Y1056 ERK pERK and tubulin were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Antibody to BTK was from BD Biosciences.

The LabChip platform was used for enzyme activity assay performed by Nanosyn Inc. The recombinant enzymes were used at 5 nM with substrate at 1 M.

Cells were plated at 10 000 cells well in 100 L. After 3 days incubation at 37 C. in a 5 COincubator alamar blue Invitrogen 1 10 was added into each well and incubated for another 2.5 3 hours. The plate was read at Excitation Emission wavelengths of 545 590 nm.

Cells were plated at 350 000 cells plate for BT 474 and 300 000 cells plate for SK BR 3 cells in 10 cm plate. Cells were treated with ibrutinib for 1 h. After wash out and fresh media added the culture continued for another 6 days. Cell number in each plate was counted by cell counter after trypsinization.

Cells were plated at 350 000 cells plate for BT 474 and 300 000 cells plate for SK BR 3 cells in 10 cm plate. Cells were treated with ibrutinib for 1 h. After washing twice with media the culture was continued for 24 h. Cells were fixed in 70 ethanol and stained with PI RNase. The data were acquired with BD FACSCalibur and the cell cycle analysis was performed using FlowJo software.

Cells were washed once with cold PBS and lysed in 1 sample buffer Invitrogen . The whole cell lysate was boiled sonicated and then loaded onto a 4 15 gradient SDS PAGE gel. The proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane. After probing with antibodies the detection was conducted using an Odyssey spectrometer Li Cor . Paired mouse and rabbit antibodies were used to probe the total and corresponding phosphorylated proteins.

BT 474 cells were treated with ibrutinib for 1 h at 120 000 cells in lmL media in triplicate. The culture was conducted in a 6 well ultra low adherent plate using MammoCult media as suggested by manufacturer Stem Cell Technologies . For treatment cells were trypsinized and the single cell suspension were treated with ibrutinib for 1 h in triplicate. After washing twice the cells were resuspended in 6 mL complete MammoCult media and cultured for 7 days. For tumorsphere counting concentrate the spheres into 1.5 mL media and transfer into a 96 well plate. The number of tumorspheres was counted using a Nikon phase contrast microscope for the spheres larger than 5 mm using a ruler installed in the eyepiece. The size of tumorspheres was measured from photos taken in the microscope with 4 objective. 5 pictures were taken for each well and the size of tumorspheres in computer monitor was measured.

BT 474 cells were treated with ibrutinib for 1 h washed twice and the culture continued for 3 days or were cultured continuously in the presence of 0.1 M ibrutinib for 3 days. The assay was conducted according to directions provided by the manufacturer Stem CellTechnologies . Cells were incubated with the Aldefluor reagent for 35 minutes prior to flow cytometry.

Whole cell lysates in 1 sample buffer Invitrogen were electrophoresed on a 4 12 Bis Tris gel. After transferring the proteins onto a PVDF membrane the blot was probed by antibodies and signal was detected using an Odyssey imager LI COR Biosciences . Paired mouse and rabbit antibodies were used to probe the total and corresponding phosphorylated proteins.

Cells were stained with annexin V PI or PI RNase and apoptotic cells were quantitated using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer Becton Dickinson . The numbers of annexin V positive cells or subGO cells were calculated.

ErbB family of kinases share high degrees of homology in their kinase domain with Btk around a conserved cysteine residue which can bond irreversibly to ibrutinib . The ability of ibrutinib to inhibit the various kinases illustrated in was assayed. As shown in the figure ibrutinib was able to inhibit EGFR ErbB1 ErB2 and Erb4 in addition to BTK and other members of the TEC kinase family e.g. BMX TEC TXK ITK JAK3 and BLK . In a separate experiment it was further observed that kinase inhibition was dialysis resistant data not shown which supports covalent inhibition.

Breast cancer lines BT 474 SK BR3 MDA MB 453 and UACC 893 which are HER2 amplified were cultured in the presence of ibrutinib AVL 292 and PCI 45468. After 3 days continuous exposure to ibrutinib it was observed that the HER 2 positive breast cancer cells are sensitive to the growth inhibitory effect of ibrutinib as assay by alamar blue assay see e.g. . After 1 hour exposure to ibrutinib followed by wash out and culturing for 6 days it was observed that the growth inhibitory effect was sustained and was dose dependent see e.g. . Further one hour treatment with ibrutinib has a lasting inhibitory effect even after day 6 on HER signaling pathway see e.g. . Cell cycle analysis showed that cells with 1 h exposure to ibrutinib had G1 arrest as measured at 24 h see e.g. . For BT 474 cells the difference was statistically significant p

Ibrutinib induced apoptosis in BT 474 cells see e.g. and . One hour of drug treatment caused a low level of apoptosis 6 days after the exposure while continuous treatment 3 day resulted in dramatic apoptosis which was caspase dependent Q VD OPH and . Apoptosis was measured as percentage of cells in sub G0 or with annexin V positivity. Ibrutinib also inhibited tumorsphere growth of BT 474 cells in culture without affecting tumorsphere number see e.g. and inhibited solid tumor growth in a mouse MDA MB 453 xenograft see e.g. .

The expression of total and phosphorylated forms of EGFR HER2 HER4 MEK ERK and AKT was examined in various cancer cells lines in the absence or presence of ibrutinib 0.1 M after 1 hour of treatment. Breast cancer lines that were sensitive to ibrutinib are also HER2 4 amplified see e.g. . In a washout experiment where cells were treated with ibrutinib for various times and then cultured for an additional 2 hours inhibition of ErbB kinases and down stream signaling pathways persisted after ibrutinib washout and was time and concentration dependent see e.g. .

The effect of ibrutinib on progenitor cell marker expression in BT 474 breast cancer cells was analyzed by Aldefluor assay which identifies progenitor cells based on expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH . Diethylaminobenzaldehyde DEAB inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase activity and was used as a control in the assay. It was observed that one hour or continuous treatment with ibrutinib decreased putative stem like subpopulation of breast cancer cells see e.g. and . For example decreased aldehyde dehydrogenase activity detected by the Aldefluor assay was noted after short exposures to high concentrations or continuous exposure to low concentration of ibrutinib. Thus short exposure to ibrutinib causes a reduction of growth potential for putative stem like cancer cells.

Using a fluorescence based assay the inhibition of the breast cancer cell line MDA MB 453 by ibrutinib or gefitinib Iressa was determined. Gefitinib is a reversible inhibitor that has higher EGFR inhibitory activity but lower HER2 4 inhibitory activity compared to ibrutinib. It was observed that ibrutinib was more potent than gefitinib in inhibiting MDA MB 453 cell growth see e.g. . Ibrutinib also exhibited similar growth inhibitory activity in SK BR3 cells and MDA MB 453 breast cancer cells and as compared to lapatinib neratinib and dacomitinib see e.g. . Separate experiments confirmed ibrutinib inhibitory activity in BT 474 SK BR3 and MDA MB 453 breast cancer cells as compared to kinase inhibitors gefitinib lapatinib neratinib and dacomitinib see e.g. . Ibrutinib was also a more potent inhibitor of cell growth compared to AVL 292 in BT 474 SK BR3 and MDA MB 453 breast cancer cells see e.g. . In addition as compared to AVL 292 only ibrutinib inhibited HER2 and HER4 activation as assessed by phosphorylation of downstream targets such as AKT see e.g. .
