The present application generally relates to data communication networks. In particular the present application relates to systems and methods for sampling management across multiple cores for HTML injection.

Conventionally HTML injection is a form of content rewriting that allows arbitrary injection of data into HTTP response forwarded from a server to a client by an intermediate device. However conventional techniques for establishing frequencies typically result in inaccuracies on multi core intermediate devices because in typical environments the frequency at which to inject data into responses is specified for the intermediate device as a whole rather than for particular cores on the intermediate device. Further components executing within one core typically work independently at runtime from corresponding components executing within other cores on the intermediate device and do not synchronize with the corresponding components on statistics and runtime counters potentially resulting in additional inaccuracy on multi core intermediate devices.

In one aspect the present invention is related to a method establishing a frequency of injection sampling across a plurality of cores of a multi core intermediary device. The method includes identifying for an intermediary device comprising a plurality of packet processing engines executing on a corresponding core of a plurality cores a frequency at which the intermediary device injects data into a response transmitted from a server to a client. The method includes scaling by the intermediary device the frequency by a number of packet processing engines in the plurality of packet processing engines. For each packet processing engine of the plurality of packet processing engine an offset is established based on the frequency multiplied by a corresponding number assigned to each packet processing engine. A first packet processing engine of the plurality of packet processing engines injects data into a first response of the server at a first time specified by a first offset of the first packet processing engine and the scaled frequency. A second packet processing engine of the plurality of packet processing engines injects data into a second response of the server at a second time specified by a second offset of the second packet processing engine and the scaled frequency. The second offset for the second packet processing engine may be established a time period of one frequency from the first offset for the first packet processing engine. The first packet processing engine may inject data into responses once during the scaled frequency at the first offset while the second packet processing engine injects data into response once during the scaled frequency at the second offset.

In one aspect a method for controlling by a multi core intermediary injection of content into a response from a server to a request of a client includes establishing for a multi core intermediary comprising a plurality of packet evaluation components executing on a corresponding plurality of cores a frequency at which the multi core intermediary intercepts a response transmitted from a server to a client and injects data into the intercepted response. The method includes establishing for each of the plurality of packet evaluation components an offset and a frequency based on a number of packet evaluation components in the plurality of packet evaluation components a combination of the established frequencies substantially similar to the frequency established for the multi core intermediary. The method includes intercepting by one of the plurality of cores a response from the server to the client at a time specified by the frequency and the offset. The method includes injecting by the packet evaluation component executing on the one of the plurality of cores data into the intercepted response. The method includes transmitting by the one of the plurality of cores the intercepted response comprising the injected data to the client.

In another aspect a system for controlling by a multi core intermediary injection of content into a response from a server to a request of a client includes a multi core intermediary comprising a plurality of packet evaluation components executing on a corresponding plurality of cores and receiving an identification of a frequency at which the multi core intermediary intercepts a response transmitted from a server to a client and injects data into the intercepted response. The system includes a frequency calculation component establishing for each of the plurality of packet evaluation components an offset and a frequency based on a number of packet evaluation components in the plurality of packet evaluation components a combination of the established frequencies substantially similar to the frequency established for the multi core intermediary. The system includes an interception component executed by one of the plurality of cores and intercepting a response from the server to the client at a time specified by the frequency and the offset for the packet evaluation component executing on the one of the plurality of cores. The system includes an injection component executed by the packet evaluation component executing on the one of the plurality of cores receiving the intercepted response from the interception component and injecting data into the received intercepted response. The system includes a transmitter executed by the one of the plurality of cores receiving the intercepted response comprising the injected data from the injection component and transmitting the received intercepted response to the client.

For example illustrates a first core Core A processing applications and processes associated with network I O functionality A. Network traffic associated with network I O in some embodiments can be associated with a particular port number. Thus outgoing and incoming packets having a port destination associated with NW I O A will be directed towards Core A which is dedicated to handling all network traffic associated with the NW I O port. Similarly Core B is dedicated to handling functionality associated with SSL processing and Core D may be dedicated handling all TCP level processing and functionality.

While illustrates functions such as network I O SSL and TCP other functions can be assigned to cores. These other functions can include any one or more of the functions or operations described herein. For example any of the functions described in conjunction with may be distributed across the cores on a functionality basis. In some cases a first VIP A may run on a first core while a second VIP B with a different configuration may run on a second core. In some embodiments each core can handle a particular functionality such that each core can handle the processing associated with that particular function. For example Core B may handle SSL offloading while Core D may handle application layer processing and traffic management.

In other embodiments work load or network traffic may be distributed among cores according to any type and form of data parallelism . In some embodiments data parallelism may be achieved in a multi core system by each core performing the same task or functionally on different pieces of distributed data. In some embodiments a single execution thread or code controls operations on all pieces of data. In other embodiments different threads or instructions control the operation but may execute the same code. In some embodiments data parallelism is achieved from the perspective of a packet engine vServers VIPs A C network interface cards NIC D E and or any other networking hardware or software included on or associated with an appliance . For example each core may run the same packet engine or VIP code or configuration but operate on different sets of distributed data. Each networking hardware or software construct can receive different varying or substantially the same amount of data and as a result may have varying different or relatively the same amount of load .

In the case of a data parallelism approach the work may be divided up and distributed based on VIPs NICs and or data flows of the VIPs or NICs. In one of these approaches the work of the multi core system may be divided or distributed among the VIPs by having each VIP work on a distributed set of data. For example each core may be configured to run one or more VIPs. Network traffic may be distributed to the core for each VIP handling that traffic. In another of these approaches the work of the appliance may be divided or distributed among the cores based on which NIC receives the network traffic. For example network traffic of a first NIC may be distributed to a first core while network traffic of a second NIC may be distributed to a second core. In some cases a core may process data from multiple NICs.

While illustrates a single vServer associated with a single core as is the case for VIP A VIP B and VIP C. In some embodiments a single vServer can be associated with one or more cores . In contrast one or more vServers can be associated with a single core . Associating a vServer with a core may include that core to process all functions associated with that particular vServer. In some embodiments each core executes a VIP having the same code and configuration. In other embodiments each core executes a VIP having the same code but different configuration. In some embodiments each core executes a VIP having different code and the same or different configuration.

Like vServers NICs can also be associated with particular cores . In many embodiments NICs can be connected to one or more cores such that when a NIC receives or transmits data packets a particular core handles the processing involved with receiving and transmitting the data packets. In one embodiment a single NIC can be associated with a single core as is the case with NIC D and NIC E. In other embodiments one or more NICs can be associated with a single core . In other embodiments a single NIC can be associated with one or more cores . In these embodiments load could be distributed amongst the one or more cores such that each core processes a substantially similar amount of load. A core associated with a NIC may process all functions and or data associated with that particular NIC.

While distributing work across cores based on data of VIPs or NICs may have a level of independency in some embodiments this may lead to unbalanced use of cores as illustrated by the varying loads of .

In some embodiments load work or network traffic can be distributed among cores based on any type and form of data flow. In another of these approaches the work may be divided or distributed among cores based on data flows. For example network traffic between a client and a server traversing the appliance may be distributed to and processed by one core of the plurality of cores. In some cases the core initially establishing the session or connection may be the core for which network traffic for that session or connection is distributed. In some embodiments the data flow is based on any unit or portion of network traffic such as a transaction a request response communication or traffic originating from an application on a client. In this manner and in some embodiments data flows between clients and servers traversing the appliance may be distributed in a more balanced manner than the other approaches.

In flow based data parallelism distribution of data is related to any type of flow of data such as request response pairings transactions sessions connections or application communications. For example network traffic between a client and a server traversing the appliance may be distributed to and processed by one core of the plurality of cores. In some cases the core initially establishing the session or connection may be the core for which network traffic for that session or connection is distributed. The distribution of data flow may be such that each core carries a substantially equal or relatively evenly distributed amount of load data or network traffic.

In some embodiments the data flow is based on any unit or portion of network traffic such as a transaction a request response communication or traffic originating from an application on a client. In this manner and in some embodiments data flows between clients and servers traversing the appliance may be distributed in a more balanced manner than the other approached. In one embodiment data flow can be distributed based on a transaction or a series of transactions. This transaction in some embodiments can be between a client and a server and can be characterized by an IP address or other packet identifier. For example Core A can be dedicated to transactions between a particular client and a particular server therefore the load A on Core A may be comprised of the network traffic associated with the transactions between the particular client and server. Allocating the network traffic to Core A can be accomplished by routing all data packets originating from either the particular client or server to Core A.

While work or load can be distributed to the cores based in part on transactions in other embodiments load or work can be allocated on a per packet basis. In these embodiments the appliance can intercept data packets and allocate them to a core having the least amount of load. For example the appliance could allocate a first incoming data packet to Core A because the load A on Core is less than the load B N on the rest of the cores B N. Once the first data packet is allocated to Core A the amount of load A on Core A is increased proportional to the amount of processing resources needed to process the first data packet. When the appliance intercepts a second data packet the appliance will allocate the load to Core D because Core D has the second least amount of load. Allocating data packets to the core with the least amount of load can in some embodiments ensure that the load A N distributed to each core remains substantially equal.

In other embodiments load can be allocated on a per unit basis where a section of network traffic is allocated to a particular core . The above mentioned example illustrates load balancing on a per packet basis. In other embodiments load can be allocated based on a number of packets such that every 10 100 or 1000 packets are allocated to the core having the least amount of load. The number of packets allocated to a core can be a number determined by an application user or administrator and can be any number greater than zero. In still other embodiments load can be allocated based on a time metric such that packets are distributed to a particular core for a predetermined amount of time. In these embodiments packets can be distributed to a particular core for five milliseconds or for any period of time determined by a user program system administrator or otherwise. After the predetermined time period elapses data packets are transmitted to a different core for the predetermined period of time.

Flow based data parallelism methods for distributing work load or network traffic among the one or more cores can comprise any combination of the above mentioned embodiments. These methods can be carried out by any part of the appliance by an application or set of executable instructions executing on one of the cores such as the packet engine or by any application program or agent executing on a computing device in communication with the appliance .

The functional and data parallelism computing schemes illustrated in can be combined in any manner to generate a hybrid parallelism or distributed processing scheme that encompasses function parallelism data parallelism flow based data parallelism or any portions thereof. In some cases the multi core system may use any type and form of load balancing schemes to distribute load among the one or more cores . The load balancing scheme may be used in any combination with any of the functional and data parallelism schemes or combinations thereof.

The packet engine s A N can in some embodiments be associated with a particular server user client or network. When a packet engine becomes associated with a particular entity that packet engine can process data packets associated with that entity. For example should a packet engine be associated with a first user that packet engine will process and operate on packets generated by the first user or packets having a destination address associated with the first user. Similarly the packet engine may choose not to be associated with a particular entity such that the packet engine can process and otherwise operate on any data packets not generated by that entity or destined for that entity.

In embodiments where the system comprises one or more flow distributors each flow distributor can be associated with a processor or a packet engine . The flow distributors can comprise an interface mechanism that allows each flow distributor to communicate with the other flow distributors executing within the system . In one instance the one or more flow distributors can determine how to balance load by communicating with each other. This process can operate substantially similarly to the process described above for submitting votes to an arbiter which then determines which flow distributor should receive the load. In other embodiments a first flow distributor can identify the load on an associated core and determine whether to forward a first data packet to the associated core based on any of the following criteria the load on the associated core is above a predetermined threshold the load on the associated core is below a predetermined threshold the load on the associated core is less than the load on the other cores or any other metric that can be used to determine where to forward data packets based in part on the amount of load on a processor.

In some embodiments the RSS module uses the MICROSOFT receive side scaling RSS scheme. In one embodiment RSS is a Microsoft Scalable Networking initiative technology that enables receive processing to be balanced across multiple processors in the system while maintaining in order delivery of the data. The RSS may use any type and form of hashing scheme to determine a core or processor for processing a network packet.

The hash function may be designed and constructed based on any one or more criteria or design goals. In some embodiments a hash function may be used that provides an even distribution of hash result for different hash inputs and different hash types including TCP IPv4 TCP IPv6 IPv4 and IPv6 headers. In some embodiments a hash function may be used that provides a hash result that is evenly distributed when a small number of buckets are present for example two or four . In some embodiments hash function may be used that provides a hash result that is randomly distributed when a large number of buckets were present for example 64 buckets . In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on a level of computational or resource usage. In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on ease or difficulty of implementing the hash in hardware. In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on the ease or difficulty of a malicious remote host to send packets that would all hash to the same bucket.

The RSS may generate hashes from any type and form of input such as a sequence of values. This sequence of values can include any portion of the network packet such as any header field or payload of network packet or portions thereof. In some embodiments the input to the hash may be referred to as a hash type and include any tuples of information associated with a network packet or data flow such as any of the following a four tuple comprising at least two IP addresses and two ports a four tuple comprising any four sets of values a six tuple a two tuple and or any other sequence of numbers or values.

The network stack may set the actual number of bits to be used during initialization. The number will be between 1 and 7 inclusive.

The hash result may be used to identify the core or entity via any type and form of table such as a bucket table or indirection table. In some embodiments the number of hash result bits are used to index into the table. The range of the hash mask may effectively define the size of the indirection table. ny portion of the hash result or the hast result itself may be used to index the indirection table. The values in the table may identify any of the cores or processor such as by a core or processor identifier. In some embodiments all of the cores of the multi core system are identified in the table. In other embodiments a port of the cores of the multi core system are identified in the table.

The flow distributor in some embodiments executes within any module or program on the appliance on any one of the cores and on any one of the devices or components included within the multi core system . In some embodiments the flow distributor can execute on the first core A while in other embodiments the flow distributor can execute on the NIC . In still other embodiments an instance of the flow distributor can execute on each core included in the multi core system . In this embodiment each instance of the flow distributor can communicate with other instances of the flow distributor to forward packets back and forth across the cores . There exist situations where a response to a request packet may not be processed by the same core i.e. the first core processes the request while the second core processes the response. In these situations the instances of the flow distributor can intercept the packet and forward it to the desired or correct core i.e. a flow distributor instance can forward the response to the first core. Multiple instances of the flow distributor can execute on any number of cores and any combination of cores .

The flow distributor may operate responsive to any one or more rules or policies. The rules may identify a core or packet processing engine to receive a network packet data or data flow. The rules may identify any type and form of tuple information related to a network packet such as a 4 tuple of source and destination IP address and source and destination ports. Based on a received packet matching the tuple specified by the rule the flow distributor may forward the packet to a core or packet engine. In some embodiments the packet is forwarded to a core via shared memory and or core to core messaging.

Illustrated in is an embodiment of a multi core system comprising one or more processing cores A N. In brief overview one of the cores can be designated as a control core A and can be used as a control plane for the other cores . The other cores may be secondary cores which operate in a data plane while the control core provides the control plane. The cores A N may share a global cache . While the control core provides a control plane the other cores in the multi core system form or provide a data plane. These cores perform data processing functionality on network traffic while the control provides initialization configuration and control of the multi core system.

Further referring to and in more detail the cores A N as well as the control core A can be any processor described herein. Furthermore the cores A N and the control core A can be any processor able to function within the system described in . Still further the cores A N and the control core A can be any core or group of cores described herein. The control core may be a different type of core or processor than the other cores. In some embodiments the control may operate a different packet engine or have a packet engine configured differently than the packet engines of the other cores.

Any portion of the memory of each of the cores may be allocated to or used for a global cache that is shared by the cores. In brief overview a predetermined percentage or predetermined amount of each of the memory of each core may be used for the global cache. For example 50 of each memory of each code may be dedicated or allocated to the shared global cache. That is in the illustrated embodiment 2 GB of each core excluding the control plane core or core may be used to form a 28 GB shared global cache. The configuration of the control plane such as via the configuration services may determine the amount of memory used for the shared global cache. In some embodiments each core may provide a different amount of memory for use by the global cache. In other embodiments any one core may not provide any memory or use the global cache. In some embodiments any of the cores may also have a local cache in memory not allocated to the global shared memory. Each of the cores may store any portion of network traffic to the global shared cache. Each of the cores may check the cache for any content to use in a request or response. Any of the cores may obtain content from the global shared cache to use in a data flow request or response.

The global cache can be any type and form of memory or storage element such as any memory or storage element described herein. In some embodiments the cores may have access to a predetermined amount of memory i.e. 32 GB or any other memory amount commensurate with the system . The global cache can be allocated from that predetermined amount of memory while the rest of the available memory can be allocated among the cores . In other embodiments each core can have a predetermined amount of memory. The global cache can comprise an amount of the memory allocated to each core . This memory amount can be measured in bytes or can be measured as a percentage of the memory allocated to each core . Thus the global cache can comprise 1 GB of memory from the memory associated with each core or can comprise 20 percent or one half of the memory associated with each core . In some embodiments only a portion of the cores provide memory to the global cache while in other embodiments the global cache can comprise memory not allocated to the cores .

Each core can use the global cache to store network traffic or cache data. In some embodiments the packet engines of the core use the global cache to cache and use data stored by the plurality of packet engines. For example the cache manager of and cache functionality of may use the global cache to share data for acceleration. For example each of the packet engines may store responses such as HTML data to the global cache. Any of the cache managers operating on a core may access the global cache to server caches responses to client requests.

In some embodiments the cores can use the global cache to store a port allocation table which can be used to determine data flow based in part on ports. In other embodiments the cores can use the global cache to store an address lookup table or any other table or list that can be used by the flow distributor to determine where to direct incoming and outgoing data packets. The cores can in some embodiments read from and write to cache while in other embodiments the cores can only read from or write to cache . The cores may use the global cache to perform core to core communications.

In some embodiments the system can comprise a control core A. While illustrates core A as the control core the control core can be any core within the appliance or multi core system. Further while only a single control core is depicted the system can comprise one or more control cores each having a level of control over the system. In some embodiments one or more control cores can each control a particular aspect of the system . For example one core can control deciding which distribution scheme to use while another core can determine the size of the global cache .

The control plane of the multi core system may be the designation and configuration of a core as the dedicated management core or as a master core. This control plane core may provide control management and coordination of operation and functionality the plurality of cores in the multi core system. This control plane core may provide control management and coordination of allocation and use of memory of the system among the plurality of cores in the multi core system including initialization and configuration of the same. In some embodiments the control plane includes the flow distributor for controlling the assignment of data flows to cores and the distribution of network packets to cores based on data flows. In some embodiments the control plane core runs a packet engine and in other embodiments the control plane core is dedicated to management and control of the other cores of the system.

The control core A can exercise a level of control over the other cores such as determining how much memory should be allocated to each core or determining which core should be assigned to handle a particular function or hardware software entity. The control core A in some embodiments can exercise control over those cores within the control plan . Thus there can exist processors outside of the control plane which are not controlled by the control core A. Determining the boundaries of the control plane can include maintaining by the control core A or agent executing within the system a list of those cores controlled by the control core A. The control core A can control any of the following initialization of a core determining when a core is unavailable re distributing load to other cores when one core fails determining which distribution scheme to implement determining which core should receive network traffic determining how much cache should be allocated to each core determining whether to assign a particular function or element to a particular core determining whether to permit cores to communicate with one another determining the size of the global cache and any other determination of a function configuration or operation of the cores within the system .

In brief overview the system includes a client a server and an appliance . The appliance may have an integrated packet engine to modify a response from the server and provide a modified response to a browser of the client . The engine may inject content into a prebody or a postbody of the response to form the modified response . The engine may inject content into a response responsive to injection policies of a policy engine . For example the injection policies may include policies based on the request and or policies based on the response. The engine may inject into the response one or more variables from a variable store . In some cases a server A may include a performance monitoring agent that uses the modified response to determine performance of the system with and without the appliance such as by providing a report .

In brief overview the system includes a server a client and a multi core intermediary . The multi core intermediary includes a plurality of packet evaluation components executing on a corresponding plurality of cores . The multi core intermediary receives an identification of a frequency at which the multi core intermediary intercepts a response transmitted from the server to the client and injects data into the intercepted response. A frequency calculation component establishes for each of the plurality of packet evaluation components an offset and a frequency based on a number of packet evaluation components in the plurality of packet evaluation components a combination of the established frequencies substantially similar to the frequency established for the multi core intermediary . An interception component executed by one of the plurality of cores intercepts a response from the server to the client at a time specified by the frequency and the offset for the packet evaluation component N executing on the one of the plurality of cores N.

A transmitter executed by the one of the plurality of cores N receives the intercepted response comprising the injected data from the injection component and transmits the received intercepted response to the client .

In some embodiments by scaling the over all frequency up by the number of cores in the multi core intermediary the over all frequency at which data is injected into packets is maintained. In one of these embodiments by way of example if an established frequency for a multi core intermediary specifies that the multi core intermediary should inject data into an intercepted response once every 10 milliseconds and if each of for example cores applies that frequency to inject data into an intercepted response once every 10 milliseconds data will effectively be injected into intercepted responses once a millisecond.

The method includes establishing for a multi core intermediary comprising a plurality of packet evaluation components executing on a corresponding plurality of cores a frequency at which the multi core intermediary intercepts a response transmitted from a server to a client and injects data into the intercepted response . The method includes establishing for each of the plurality of packet evaluation components an offset and a frequency based on a number of packet evaluation components in the plurality of packet evaluation components a combination of the established frequencies substantially similar to the frequency established for the multi core intermediary . The method includes intercepting by one of the plurality of cores a response from the server to the client at a time specified by the frequency and the offset . The method includes injecting by the packet evaluation component executing on the one of the plurality of cores data into the intercepted response .

Referring now to and in greater detail a frequency is established for a multi core intermediary comprising a plurality of packet evaluation components executing on a corresponding plurality of cores. The frequency indicating when the multi core intermediary is to intercept a response transmitted from a server to a client and inject data into the intercepted response . In one embodiment a frequency specifies how often the multi core intermediary should inject data into a intercepted response e.g. the response transmitted from the server to the client e.g. once every 10 milliseconds . In another of these embodiments a rate is established such as specifying how many injection responses to generate per core when a client receives a rate from a user administrator for example for each X number of intercepted responses for which a policy indicates that an injection should occur complete the injection once 1 out of X .

For each of the plurality of packet evaluation components an offset and a frequency based on a number of packet evaluation components in the plurality of packet evaluation components is established a combination of the established frequencies substantially similar to the frequency established for the multi core intermediary . In one embodiment the frequency calculation component establishes the offset and the frequency for each of the plurality of packet evaluation components N. In another embodiment each packet evaluation component N in the plurality of packet evaluation components executes a frequency calculation component that establishes the offset and the frequency for the packet evaluation component N.

In some embodiments the frequency calculation component identifies a total number of packet evaluation components in the plurality of packet evaluation components. In one of these embodiments the frequency calculation component multiplies the frequency established for the multi core intermediary as a whole by the identified total number of packet evaluation components in the plurality of packet evaluation components. By way of example in embodiment with N cores in the multi core intermediary and an established frequency for the multi core intermediary of once every 10 milliseconds the frequency calculation component multiplies N by 10 to establish a new frequency of 10N for each packet evaluation component N in the plurality of packet evaluation components. In such an embodiment each packet evaluation component N would inject data into an intercepted packet once every 10N milliseconds and N injections of data would occur every 10N milliseconds thus the effective frequency is maintained at the 1 in 10 milliseconds established for the frequency of the multi core intermediary as a whole. In some embodiments by scaling the over all frequency up by the number of cores in the multi core intermediary the over all frequency at which data is injected into packets is maintained.

In one embodiment the frequency calculation component generates an offset for use by a packet evaluation component N in conjunction with a frequency in determining when to inject data into an intercepted response. In another embodiment the frequency calculation component generates a random number pseudo random number or substantially random number for use in generating the offset. In still another embodiment the frequency calculation component generates an offset based upon an identifier of the core in which a particular packet evaluation component N executes. In yet another embodiment the frequency calculation component generates an offset based upon an identifier of the packet evaluation component N. In some embodiments the packet evaluation component N multiplies the frequency established for the packet evaluation component N by the offset established for the packet evaluation component N. In one of these embodiments by way of example the frequency calculation component establishes a frequency of one every 10N milliseconds at which the packet evaluation component N should inject data into an intercepted response and establishes an offset based upon an identifier of the packet evaluation component N e.g. any numeric identifier distinguishing the packet evaluation component N from other packet evaluation components executing on other cores by way of example if the packet evaluation component N has an identifier of 7 as in the 7packet evaluation component in the multi core intermediary and a frequency of 100 milliseconds the packet evaluation component N will inject data into an intercepted response once every 700 milliseconds while a packet evaluation component N having an identifier of 5 and a frequency of 100 milliseconds would inject data into an intercepted response once every 500 milliseconds. In some embodiments the use of the offset avoids a burst of transmissions to the client from each of the cores at the frequency established for each packet evaluation component e.g. distributing the transmissions at 500 milliseconds 700 milliseconds etc. rather than having 10 transmissions every 100 milliseconds .

One of the plurality of cores intercepts a response from the server to the client at a time specified by the frequency and the offset . In one embodiment an interception component intercepts the response. In another embodiment the packet evaluation component N intercepts the response. In still another embodiment the core N intercepts the response and forwards the response to the packet evaluation component N e.g. via the memory bus . In yet another embodiment the interception occurs as described above in connection with .

The packet evaluation component executing on the one of the plurality of cores injects data into the intercepted response . In some embodiments the packet evaluation component N provides the functionality for injecting data into the intercepted response as described above in connection with . In one embodiment the packet evaluation component N determines whether to inject data into the intercepted response by applying a rate for example an administrator may have specified a rate at which to inject data such that for every X packets that a policy specifies data should be injected into the rate specifies that the packet evaluation component N should only actually inject data into 1 out of the X packets.

The one of the plurality of cores transmits the intercepted response comprising the injected data to the client . In some embodiments the core N transmits the intercepted response to the client as described above in connection with step .

Although described above in as injection of data into server responses based upon policies it should be understood that the methods and systems described herein may be applied in any sampling scenario. For example in some embodiments intercepted server communications responses or otherwise are forwarded to a second server for application of a quality control process or other analysis of the server communications. In other embodiments and as another example intercepted server communications may be injected with data other than that described above in connection with .

By way of example the following design and pseudo code describes an embodiment for using the techniques described herein. If the frequency is set to X then an injection response is generated at a maximum frequency of 1 in X milliseconds. Following the design approach the frequency parameter is divided across all packet processing engines referred to as PEs. In some embodiments the frequency is multiplied by N for each PE in which N represents a number assigned to the core or PE N 1 for first PE core N 2 for second PE core etc . An offset time at which each PE matches the frequency is multiplied by X where X is the configured frequency value. The following is an example of how this works 

In some embodiments and with the above mechanism there will be silence for X N milliseconds and then there a burst of N responses. To resolve this the technique uses the offset X. Each PEs next response time is offset by n X where n is the number assigned to the PE. In some embodiments the overall rate is maintained with a slight randomness in the times at which each PE generates a response.
