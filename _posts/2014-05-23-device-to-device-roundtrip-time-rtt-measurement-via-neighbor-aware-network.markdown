Unless otherwise indicated herein the materials described in this section are not prior art to the claims in this application and are not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.

In telecommunications the round trip time refers to the duration of time elapsed between sending a signal to a destination and receiving an acknowledgment of the signal from the destination. In the context of computer networks round trip time is often referred to as the ping time and may involve sending and receiving data packets. Various techniques for measuring round trip time between Wi Fi IEEE 802.11 enabled devices known as stations or STAs have been proposed. However obtaining accurate round trip time between stations is non trivial and may necessitate a combination of a highly accurate clock on each station and significant signal processing. Further some techniques necessitate each station to be awake and listening on the same channel which is not always the case. At the same time accurate round trip times may have a variety of applications such as enabling indoor location determinations.

Neighbor Aware Networking is a Wi Fi standard that enables NAN devices a station configured to operate in a particular manner to connect directly. Many conventional Wi Fi networks operate using a controller device known as a wireless access point that provides for among other functions communication between stations. Unlike these conventional networks NAN devices form a NAN network without the use of a wireless access point. NAN provides a mechanism on which NAN devices may converge to facilitate the discovery of services and devices within the NAN network.

In one example a method is provided that includes publishing over a wireless network interface by a first device within a neighbor aware network NAN cluster a schedule that invites devices within the NAN cluster to request within a time window to perform a round trip time determination with the first device. The schedule indicates that the time window begins at a time offset from a NAN discovery window and ends after a predetermined period of time has elapsed. The method further includes receiving a request within the time window from a second device within the NAN cluster to perform the RTT determination with the first device. The method further includes performing the RTT determination with the second device.

In another example a computer readable storage memory having stored therein instructions that when executed by a processor cause the processor to perform functions is provided. The functions comprise publishing over a wireless network interface by a first device a schedule that invites devices receiving the schedule to request within a time window to perform a round trip time determination with the first device. The schedule indicates that the time window begins at a particular time and ends after a predetermined period of time has elapsed. The functions also comprise receiving a request from a second device to perform the RTT determination with the first device. The functions further comprise performing within the time window the RTT determination with the second device.

In still another example a device is provided that comprises a wireless local area network WLAN interface one or more processors and data storage configured to store instructions that when executed by the one or more processors cause the system to perform functions. The functions comprise sending over the WLAN interface to one or more devices within a neighbor aware network NAN cluster a schedule that invites devices within the NAN cluster to request within a time window to perform a round trip time RTT determination with the first device. The schedule indicates that the time window begins at a time offset from a NAN discovery window and ends after a predetermined period of time has elapsed. The functions also comprise receiving from at least one of the one or more devices a request to perform a respective RTT determination with the first device. The functions further comprise performing RTT determinations with the at least one of the one or more devices.

In yet another example a system is provided that includes a means for publishing over a wireless network interface by a first device within a neighbor aware network NAN cluster a schedule that invites devices within the NAN cluster to request within a time window to perform a round trip time RTT determination with the first device where the schedule indicates that the time window begins at a time offset from a NAN discovery window and ends after a predetermined period of time has elapsed. The system further includes a means for receiving a request within the time window from a second device within the NAN cluster to perform the RTT determination with the first device. The system further includes a means for performing the RTT determination with the second device.

These as well as other aspects advantages and alternatives will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art by reading the following detailed description with reference where appropriate to the accompanying figures.

The following detailed description describes various features and functions of the disclosed systems and methods with reference to the accompanying figures. In the figures similar symbols identify similar components unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative system and method embodiments described herein are not meant to be limiting. It may be readily understood that certain aspects of the disclosed systems and methods can be arranged and combined in a wide variety of different configurations all of which are contemplated herein.

Within examples a first device in a neighbor aware network NAN cluster may be configured to perform a round trip time RTT determination with one or more other devices that are also in the NAN cluster. Features of Neighbor Aware Networking also NAN may assist in synchronizing devices with the NAN cluster which may in some circumstances improve accuracy and or reliability of RTT determinations. For instance the NAN cluster may synchronize NAN devices within the cluster to a common clock or timer. The NAN cluster may also define a time period e.g. a NAN Discovery Window in which devices may converge on the same channel and communicate with one another.

In some examples the first device may publish over a wireless network interface a schedule that invites devices within the NAN cluster to perform a RTT determination with the first device. The schedule may indicate a certain time window in which the devices may perform the RTT determination with the first device. The schedule may further indicate that the time window begins at a time offset from a NAN discovery window and ends after a period of time has expired. The first device may then receive a request from a second device within the NAN cluster to perform the RTT determination with the first device. After receiving the request the first device may perform the RTT determination with the second device.

Performing the RTT determination may then involve time stamping messages exchanged between the first device and the second device. For instance the first device may generate based on the common clock of the NAN cluster a first time stamp that indicates the time at which an echo request message was sent to the second device. Then when the first device receives an echo message from the second device it may generate a second time stamp based on the common clock. The first device may then determine the RTT between the first device and the second device based on the difference between the second time stamp and the first time stamp.

In other examples other formats or systems may operate the device as well.

The device may include an interface a wireless communication component a cellular radio communication component a global position system GPS sensor s data storage a processor and a clock . Components illustrated in may be linked together by a communication link . The device may also include hardware to enable communication within the device and between the device and another computing device not shown such as a second device or a wireless access point entity.

The device is illustrated to include a clock . The clock may be synchronized to the clocks of other devices such as those in communication with device via interface wireless communication and or cellular radio communication component . Clock may also be referred to as a timer.

Within the protocol defined by Neighbor Aware Networking a NAN network may include NAN devices that are configured to share a common set of NAN parameters. These parameters may include 1 the time period between consecutive Discovery Windows 2 the time duration of the Discovery Windows 3 the Synchronization Beacon interval and 4 the NAN Channel s . A NAN cluster may then include NAN devices that share these parameters and are synchronized to the same Discovery Window schedule. NAN Discovery Windows may repeat periodically such as after every 512 Time Units TU s and last for a particular length of time such as 16 TUs. Time Units may correspond to clock cycles of a common clock to which NAN devices participating in a NAN cluster are synchronized. During Discovery Windows one or more NAN devices may transmit Synchronization Beacon frames to assist NAN devices in the NAN cluster synchronize their respective clocks such that each clock is common to other clocks of other devices in the NAN cluster. The one or more NAN devices may transmit Synchronization Beacon frames periodically i.e. after the elapse of a particular Synchronization Beacon interval . Between Discovery Windows one more NAN devices may transmit Discovery Beacon frames to facilitate discovery of the NAN cluster.

Since NAN devices of a NAN cluster are configured to use the NAN Channel s they may receive the transmitted frames and discover the NAN cluster. NAN networks typically operate on a single channel in each frequency band e.g. channel 6 in the 2.4 GigaHertz Ghz band and channel 44 or 149 in the 5 Ghz band depending on the applicable regulatory domain . The NAN cluster may operate on a particular frequency band based on the frequencies supported by the NAN devices. For instance some devices may support the 2.4 Ghz frequency band while others may support the 2.4 and 5 Ghz bands.

NAN devices may include Wi Fi enabled devices that are configured to support Neighbor Aware Networking Some implementation of NAN may assume NAN devices are configured according to an 802.11 certification such as 802.11n or 801.11 ac. Computing devices and in device in and or device in may be NAN devices.

NAN devices may operate in a role of either Master or Non Master. A NAN Device in a Master role may transmit both Synchronization Beacon and Discovery Beacon frames. A NAN Device in a Non Master role may operate in a sync or non sync state depending on whether the NAN Device is in a NAN cluster and is therefore synchronized to a Discovery Window schedule . Non Master NAN devices in a sync state may transmit Synchronization Beacon frames. A NAN Device in a Master role is typically in a sync state because it creates the NAN cluster. NAN Devices may change roles and states.

As noted above a particular NAN device may alert other NAN devices to services supported by the particular NAN device. The NAN Service Discovery Protocol defines two Service Discovery Protocol messages Publish and Subscribe. A NAN device may use a Publish message to make a service discoverable to other NAN devices operating in the same NAN cluster. A NAN device may use a Subscribe message to ask for other NAN Devices operating in the same NAN Cluster to transmit a Publish message when certain response criteria are met. The NAN Discovery Engine a component of the NAN device architecture may provide Service Discovery Protocol functionality through method primitives. One method primitive provided by the NAN Discovery Engine is the Publish function which produces Publish messages. Another method primitive provided by the NAN Discovery Engine is the Subscribe function by which a NAN device may send a Subscribe message.

A NAN device may operate concurrently in a NAN network and in another type of Wi Fi network such as a WLAN infrastructure network a WLAN ad hoc network as known as an Independent Basic Service Set IBSS network or a Wi Fi Direct network. For instance a NAN device may operate in a Wi Fi infrastructure mode during the time interval between Discovery Windows.

In addition for the method and other processes and methods disclosed herein the flowchart shows functionality and operation of one possible implementation of present embodiments. In this regard each block may represent a module a segment or a portion of program code which includes one or more instructions executable by a processor for implementing specific logical functions or steps in the process. The program code may be stored on any type of computer readable medium for example such as a storage device including a disk or hard drive. The computer readable medium may include a non transitory computer readable medium for example such as computer readable media that stores data for short periods of time like register memory processor cache and Random Access Memory RAM . The computer readable medium may also include non transitory media such as secondary or persistent long term storage like read only memory ROM optical or magnetic disks compact disc read only memory CD ROM for example. The computer readable media may also be any other volatile or non volatile storage systems. The computer readable medium may be considered a computer readable storage medium a tangible storage device or other article of manufacture for example.

In addition for the method and other processes and methods disclosed herein each block in may represent circuitry that is wired to perform the specific logical functions in the process.

Functions of the method may be fully performed by a processor of a computing device or may be distributed across multiple components of a computing device. In some examples the computing device may receive information from a network interface of the computing device.

At block the method includes publishing over a wireless network interface by a first device within a neighbor aware network NAN cluster a schedule that invites devices within the NAN cluster to request within a time window to perform a round trip time RTT determination with the first device. The schedule may indicate that the time window begins at a time offset from a NAN discovery window and ends after a predetermined period of time has elapsed. For instance referring to device may publish a schedule that invites one or more of devices and to request to perform a round trip time RTT determination with the first device. Device may publish the schedule over a network interface such as a network interface of wireless communication component in . The network interface may be a wireless local area network WLAN interface which may conform to an IEEE 802.11 standard.

Within examples publishing the schedule may involve sending a NAN publish message to devices within a NAN cluster. As noted above the NAN Service Discovery Protocol may define a Publish message. A NAN device may then use a Publish message to make a service discoverable to other NAN devices operating in the same NAN cluster. NAN Service Discovery Protocol messages such as Publish messages may be carried in NAN Service Discovery frames. Each Service Discovery frame may include zero or more Publish messages and zero or more Subscribe messages. A NAN device may broadcast Service Discovery frames to NAN devices in a NAN cluster. Also as noted above the NAN Discovery Engine may provide Publish and Subscribe functions. By executing the Publish function the first NAN device may cause a WLAN network interface to broadcast Service Discovery frames containing a Publish message that indicates the schedule.

The first device may publish the schedule during a Discovery Window. As noted above NAN devices properly operating in the NAN cluster may configure themselves to communicate on the NAN channel during the NAN Discovery Window. Therefore these NAN devices may receive the schedule when published by the first device. In other embodiments the first device may coordinate with the other NAN devices to converge on a different time window other than the Discovery Window. The first device may then publish the schedule during the coordinated time window.

Also during the Discovery Window the first device may synchronize its clock to the clocks of other devices within the NAN cluster. In some examples the first device may send and or receive a synchronization beacon to facilitate clock synchronization. As noted above during Discovery Windows one or more NAN devices may transmit Synchronization Beacon frames to assist NAN devices in the NAN cluster synchronize their respective clocks such that each clock is common to other clocks of other devices in the NAN cluster. For example Synchronization Beacon frames may indicate a timer value and NAN devices within the cluster may adopt the timer value on their respective clock to synchronize their clocks with the clocks of other NAN devices in the cluster.

NAN devices may have NAN Interface Addresses that conform to the 802.11 standard. For instance the NAN Interface Address may be a 48 bit media access control MAC address that is assigned to the network interface of the device. In some cases broadcasted Service Discovery frames may use the address FF FF FF FF FF FF to address each computer in the NAN cluster. However broadcasted Service Discovery frames may use any suitable broadcast or multi cast address to address each computer in the NAN cluster such as the all ones IPv4 address.

In other examples publishing the schedule may involve sending a Bluetooth publication to the devices within the NAN cluster. A network interface of the first device may include a Bluetooth compliant interface. For instance device may have a Bluetooth compliant interface and send via that interface a Bluetooth message that indicates the schedule to one or more of devices or in NAN cluster . The Bluetooth message or publication may indicate a NAN interface address of the first device. Then devices receiving the message may respond to the Bluetooth message over a Wi Fi interface.

In further examples publishing the schedule may involve sending a message that indicates the schedule to one or more Wi Fi enabled devices. For instance a first device may address each of the one or more Wi Fi enabled devices individually and send a respective message to each of the one or more Wi Fi enabled devices. The first device may address the one or more Wi Fi enabled devices using any suitable address of the Wi Fi enabled devices such as an IPv4 IPv6 or MAC address among other examples.

In some cases first device may publish the schedule based on an expectation that the devices in the NAN cluster may desire to perform an RTT determination with the first device. In one example the first device may receive a message requesting publication of the schedule. Such a message may be a NAN Subscribe message that requests publication of the schedule. As noted above the NAN Service Discovery Protocol may define a Subscribe message. NAN devices may send Subscribe messages to ask for other NAN Devices operating in the same NAN Cluster to transmit a Publish message when certain response criteria are met. In devices or of NAN cluster may send a Subscribe message to device that requests device to publish a schedule. After receiving the response the device may then take an action such as publishing the schedule or determining one or more parameters of the time window among other examples. Alternatively the first device may receive a message that requests publication of the schedule via Bluetooth.

As noted above the schedule may indicate that the time window begins at a time offset from a NAN discovery window. The time offset may last for a time duration measured from a particular point in time during the NAN Discovery Window such as the beginning or the end of the Window to the beginning of the time window. As noted above the duration of Discovery Windows may be measured in Time Units which may correspond to clock cycles of a common clock to which NAN devices participating in a NAN cluster are synchronized. The time duration of the time offset may vary. Further the first device may determine the time duration of the time offset based on one or more parameters. For instance device may determine the time duration of the time offset based on the number of NAN devices in the cluster the expected propagation time of the published schedule the expected time to receive a response from one or more of devices and and or the NAN channel or the expected time to calculate an instance an RTT algorithm among other example parameters. Each of the example parameters in turn may vary based on one or more external or internal factors. For instance the expected time to receive a response may vary according to the amount of electromagnetic noise in the environment in which devices and or are operating. As noted above the NAN channel may vary based on which frequency range the NAN network and the NAN cluster is operating which may in turn depend upon the supported frequencies of the devices e.g. 2.4 Ghz and or 5 Ghz .

As also noted above the schedule may indicate that the time window ends after a predetermined period of time has elapsed. Therefore the time window may last for a time duration measured from the start of the time window to when the predetermined period of time has elapsed. The time duration of the time window may vary. Further the first device may determine the time duration of the time window based on one or more parameters. For instance device may determine the time duration of the time window based on the number of NAN devices in the cluster the number of received Subscribe messages and or the expected time to perform a RTT determination among other example parameters.

In some cases before the time window starts the method may involve re configuring the first device. As noted above devices may operate concurrently within a NAN cluster and in another Wi Fi network. For example device may operate within NAN cluster during the NAN Discovery Window and during the time window indicated in the schedule. Then outside of those windows device may operate in another Wi Fi network such as network . Alternatively outside of the afore mentioned windows such as during the time offset device may enable a sleep mode on its wireless network interface. The sleep mode may involve disabling the network interface or certain components of the network interface.

At block the method includes receiving a request within the time window from a second device within the NAN cluster to perform the RTT determination with the first device. For instance referring to device may receive a request from devices and or devices and to perform the RTT determination with device . Device may receive the request over a network interface such as the network interface of wireless communication component in .

A device within NAN cluster e.g. device may respond in various ways to receiving the published schedule. For example device may respond by sending a request to the first device e.g. device to perform the RTT determination. Alternatively device may respond by determining whether a RTT determination is requested by an application executing on device . If so device may respond by sending the request to the device to perform the RTT determination. If not device may respond in a different manner such as by not sending the request to the device to perform the RTT determination.

At block the method includes performing the RTT determination with the second device. Device may perform RTT determinations with each device from which it received a request to perform the RTT determination. For instance device may perform an RTT determination with device and or with device and device . Further device may perform the RTT determinations fully within the time window or alternatively device may initiate the RTT determinations within the time window.

Within examples performing the RTT determination may involve a variety of functions. For instance the first device may send a first message to the second device and then receive a second message from the second device. The first device may then measure the length of the time that elapsed from sending the first message until receiving the second message. The first device may then base the RTT on the measured length of time. In some examples performing the RTT determination involves invoking the RTT protocol defined by the 802.11 standard currently referred to as RTT3 .

Within examples the first and second messages may be an echo request message and an echo message respectively. An echo request message may cause the receiving device to send an echo to the sender of the echo request message. The echo request message may indicate the sending device such as by indicating the NAN interface address of the sender. The Internet Control Message Protocol ICMP defines specific types of echo and echo request messages. Within examples the first device may send the IMCP echo request message and receive an IMCP echo request message in response.

To facilitate performing the RTT determination the first device may generate timestamps in conjunction with sending and receiving the first and second messages. For instance device may send an echo request message to device . Device may also generate a first time stamp that indicates the time at which the echo request message was sent. The first time stamp may be based upon a clock such as clock in which is synchronized to the clocks of other devices within NAN cluster . Device may then determine the RTT based on the first time stamp and the second time stamp. For instance device may determine the difference in time between the first time stamp and the second time stamp as the RTT.

In some examples the first device may determine a geographic distance from the first device to the second device based on the performed RTT determination. For instance device may determine a geographic distance to device . The first device may further base the determination of the geographic distance in part on the propagation speed of sending and receiving the first and second messages i.e. the speed of light . Then for example the geographic distance may be proportional to the RTT.
