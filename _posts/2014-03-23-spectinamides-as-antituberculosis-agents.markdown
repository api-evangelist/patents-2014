General Methods The presently disclosed 3 deoxy 3 acylamino and 3 deoxy 3 R alkylamino spectinomycins were synthesized according to procedures analogous to those previously described. See Woitun et al. 34 1 22 27 1981 and Maier et al. 34 1 16 21 1981 . 1 3 Dibenzyloxycarbonyl 3 R amino spectinomycin was synthesized from spectinomycin dihydrochloride pentahydrate in two steps as shown in . First the secondary methyl amines on the A ring were protected as benzyl carbamates with carboxybenzyl CBz groups using benzyl chloroformate and NaHCOin water. Then the 3 deoxy 3 amino derivative was obtained by the reductive amination of the protected intermediate with ammonium nitrate and sodium cyanoborohydride in methanol.

The amine was then used for the synthesis of the targeted 3 acylamino spectinomycin derivatives by coupling it to a variety of acids using HBTU in dichloromethane. See . The CBz groups were removed by catalytic hydrogenation using palladium on carbon Pd C for 2 hrs to afford the target amides. For aryl side chains sensitive to the hydrogenolysis conditions used to remove the CBz groups exposure to aqueous HBr 48 for 2 hrs was used as an alternative method to afford the deprotected final product.

The 3 deoxy 3 alkylamino spectinomycin derivatives were obtained by two routes either by reduction of corresponding di CBz protected amides using NaBHin the presence of TFA and dioxane for simple alkyl substitutents see or by direct reductive alkylation of 1 3 dibenzyloxycarbonyl 3 R amino spectinomycin with aryl aldehydes with PtOcatalyzed hydrogenation to afford arylalkyl substituted amines. See . Both approaches were then followed by CBz deprotection using catalytic hydrogenation using Pd C for 2 hrs to afford the target 3 deoxy 3 R alkylamino spectinomycins.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of 3 Deoxy 3 Acylamino Spectinomycins To a stirred solution of selected acid 3 mmol in CHCl 10 mL and DIPEA 6 mmol was added HBTU 3 mmol and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. Then 6 8 dibenzyloxycarbonyl 4 R amino spectinomycin 1 mmol was added and stirred at room temperature for overnight. The reaction solution was diluted with excess CHCland washed with water dried NaSO and concentrated. The residue was purified by column chromatography to afford corresponding protected amide using petroleum ethylacetate gradient eluent system. Deprotection of the amino protecting groups was achieved by dissolution of the protected amide in 1.25 M HCl in MeOH and EtOH 1 1 with 10 Pd C 50 by mass . The mixture was hydrogenated under 30 Psi Hat room temperature for 2 hrs filtered and concentrated. The resulting solid was titurated with cold diethyl ether filtered and the resulting solid washed with excess ether and dried in vacuo to give the target 3 deoxy 3 acylamino spectinomycins.

To a stirred solution of selected acid 3 mmol in CHCl 10 mL and DIPEA 6 mmol was added HBTU 3 mmol and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. Then 6 8 dibenzyloxycarbonyl 4 R amino spectinomycin 1 mmol was added and stirred at room temperature for overnight. The reaction solution was diluted with excess CHCland washed with water dried NaSO and concentrated. The residue was purified by column chromatograph to afford corresponding protected amide using a petroleum ethylacetate gradient eluent system. Deprotection of the amino protecting groups was achieved by dissolving the protected amide in 48 HBr in water . The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 hs and then the solution was dried in vacuo. The residue was dissolved by methanol to this solution ether was added then filtered the solid and washed with ether to give the target 3 deoxy 3 acylamino spectinomycins.

MIC Determination MICs were determined using the microbroth dilution method according to Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute CLSI National C. F. C. L. S. 7 7 CLSI Wayne Pa. United States of America 2008 and were read by visual inspection. Two fold serial dilutions of antibiotic in 100 L of the appropriate broth media were first prepared in 96 well round bottom microtiter plates Nalge Nunc International Rochester N.Y. United States of America . An equivalent volume 100 L of bacterial broth inocula containing approximately 10bacterial cfu mL was added to each well to give final concentrations of drug starting at 200 g mL and the plates were incubated aerobically at 37 C. and BCG microtiter plates were incubated for 7 days and all other strains were incubated overnight. MICs against were also evaluated by a method based on the agar proportion approach by CLSI. Briefly 24 well plates were prepared with 2 fold serial dilutions of antibiotic in 2 mL of 7H11 agar and were inoculated with ca. 10cfu and incubated for 3 weeks. After incubations in all cases the MIC was recorded as the lowest concentration of drug that prevented bacterial growth.

Chequerboard Synergy Assay The activity of 1329 in combination with rifampicin isoniazid and ethambutol were evaluated in triplicate against H37Rv by the chequerboard titration method in 96 well round bottom plates. Similar combinations with streptomycin were evaluated for comparison. Plates contained bacterial inocula 10cfu mL and 2 fold serial dilutions of each antibiotic in total volumes of 200 L of broth. The maximum and minimum concentrations of each diluted drug were at least 4 fold their MIC. Following 7 days of incubation at 37 C. MICs of drug combinations were read by visual inspection and fractional inhibitory concentration FIC indices against H37Rv were calculated as described by Eliopoulos et al. See Eliopoulos et al. Antimicrobial Combinations in Williams and Wilkins Co. Baltimore Md. United States of America 2000 pp 432 449. FIC indices were interpreted as follows 0.5 synergy 0.5 to 4 additive and 4 antagonism. See Odds F. C. 52 1 2003 .

Spontaneous mutation frequencies were determined against H37Rv by plating 100 L of a saturated culture onto 7H11 agar plates containing drug at 4 8 and 16 the agar MIC. Plates were incubated for 3 weeks at 37 C. and the mutation frequency was recorded as the number of resistant colonies divided by the total viable cells. Isolated colonies were then picked at random from the selection plates and inoculated into 7H9 broth containing the concentration of antibiotic on which they were selected. Colonies able to re grow were then grown to mid log phase in the absence of drug and antibiotic MICs determined by broth microdilution.

In Vitro Microsomal Metabolic Stability In vitro microsomal metabolic stability of the compounds was assessed using pooled rat liver microsomal preparations Cellzdirect Austin Tex. United States of America . Reactions were started by adding 25 L of microsomal protein solution 10 mg mL to 25 L of test compound 20 M and 200 L of NADPH regenerating solution 1.3 mM NADP 3.3 mM glucose 6 phosphate 3.3 mM MgCland 1 unit mL glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase in pH 7.4 phosphate buffer solution . The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 C. and samples were taken at 0 5 10 15 30 45 60 and 90 minutes respectively. A reaction mixture containing above mentioned composition but instead using deactivated microsomes was used for control. All the samples were analyzed using LC MS MS assay. Disappearance of the parent compound was monitored during the incubation period.

Biologically relevant concentrations of test compound were prepared low and high in rat plasma. 200 L of the plasma sample was placed in the central chamber and 350 L of blank isotonic phosphate buffer pH 7.4 was added to the peripheral chamber of a dialysis device MW cutoff 6000 8000 D RED device Pierce Biotechnology Inc Rockford Ill. United States of America . The chambers were covered with a seal and incubated at 37 C. for four hours on a shaker set at 100 rpm. At the end of incubation the volumes of plasma and recipient buffer were measured to identify and account for volume shift if any. Aliquots of plasma and buffer were used to determine the drug concentration using an LC MS MS assay.

Groups of rats n 4 received either an intravenous IV or oral dose of a test compound at a dose level of 10 mg kg or 100 mg kg respectively. For oral administration the animals were fasted overnight and until 4 hr after administration of test compound. Serial blood samples approx. 250 L were collected pre dose and at predetermined time points post dose until 48 hours.

Urine specimens were collected for a period of 48 hours following drug administration. The study protocol was approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center Memphis Tenn. United States of America .

Sample Preparation and LC MS MS Assay A calibration curve ranging from 7.81 1000 g L was constructed for each test compound by spiking the test compound into 50 L of blank plasma. A structurally similar analogue to the test compounds compound 1369 was used as internal standard IS to all calibration standards and all plasma specimens. Plasma proteins were precipitated by the addition of four volumes of ice cold methanol containing IS. These samples were vortexed and kept on ice for 20 minutes. Following this the samples were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4 C. and the supernatants were diluted if necessary and injected onto LC MS MS for analysis. Chromatographic separations were carried out using a Shimadzu liquid chromatograph Shimadzu Corporation Kyoto Japan consisting of two pumps online degasser system controller and a CTC Leap auto sampler Leap Technologies Carrboro N.C. United States of America . A gradient of methanol and 10 mM ammonium acetate at pH 3.5 was used at a flow rate of 0.4 mL min. A Phenomenex Luna 3 HILIC 100 4.6 mm column Phenomenex Torrance Calif. United States of America protected with a guard column was used for the separation. 10 L of sample was injected onto the column and the eluate was led directly into an API 3000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer Applied Biosystems ABI MDS Sciex Foster City Calif. United States of America equipped with an electrospray ion source. The instrument was operated in the positive ion mode with nebulizer gas NEB at 7 psi curtain gas CUR at 8 psi collision gas CAD at 10 psi ion spray voltage IS at 4000 V and temperature TEM at 500 C. The resulting multiple reaction monitoring chromatograms were used for quantification using Analyst software version 1.4.1 Applied Biosystems ABI MDS Sciex Foster City Calif. United States of America .

Pharmacokinetic Data Analysis Plasma concentration time data for oral dose were analyzed by non compartmental analysis. A two compartment open model with bolus input and first order output was used to analyze the IV plasma concentration time data. The area under the plasma concentration time curve from time 0 to infinity AUCinf was calculated by the trapezoidal rule with extrapolation to time infinity. Mean residence time MRT the average amount of time a particle remains in a compartment of system was calculated for IV dose using MRT AUMCinf AUCinf where AUMCinf is the area under the moment curve when the concentration time curve is extrapolated to infinity. The systemic clearance CL was calculated using the equation CL Doseiv AUCinf iv where Doseiv and AUCinf iv are the IV dose and corresponding area under the plasma concentration time curve from time 0 to infinity respectively. An estimate of volume of distribution at steady state Vss was obtained from IV data using Vss MRT CL. Oral bioavailability F was calculated using F AUCinf oral Doseiv AUCinf iv Doseoral where Doseoral Doseiv AUCinf iv and AUCinf oral are the oral and IV doses and the corresponding areas under the plasma concentration time curves from time 0 to infinity respectively. Physiologic parameters for rats obtained from Davies et al. 10 7 1093 1095 1993 were used to calculate the excretion ratio and hepatic extraction ratio.

The anti tuberculosis activity of the spectinomycin analogs was determined against H37Rv in Middlebrook 7H9 supplemented with 10 ADC media by microbroth dilution of drug in 96 well plates. The plates were incubated at 37 C. for 7 days and then read visually for growth inhibition according to previously described methods. See e.g. Hurdle et al. 62 5 1037 1045 2008 . Results are shown in Tables 1 and 2.

Several compounds showed good anti tubercular MIC values with many having superior anti tuberculosis activity compared to spectinomycin. The structure activity relationship of this series with respect to structural changes and MIC values was very tight. Without being bound to any one theory this is believed to be indicative of specific binding to a receptor site on the ribosome and strict rules for uptake of the inhibitors into the tuberculosis bacilli.

The MICs of synthesized analogs of spectinomycin were determined against several other clinically important gram positive and negative pathogens including and S. These results are shown in Tables 3 and 4.

As shown in Table 3 some organisms were more susceptible to particular derivatives than others. For example the compounds 1443 1444 and 1368 displayed MICs of 1.6 6.25 and 6.25 g mL respectively against which represents a 4 16 fold improvement over spectinomycin. Similarly the compounds 1422 1535 and 1543 showed 4 16 fold improvement over spectinomycin against . Several compounds showed significant activity against . For example 1329 1446 1447 1491 1515 1516 1517 1519 1520 1535 1537 1538 1539 1540 1541 1542 1543 and 1544 showed 8 62.5 fold improvement in activity against over spectinomycin.

As shown in Table 4 the K12 tolC knockout strain that possesses a defective multi drug efflux pump was more susceptible than parental K12 to the spectinomycin analogs whereas the MIC of spectinomycin was not substantially affected. Without being bound to any one theory this appears suggestive that drug efflux systems and or cell permeability might account for the relative inactivity of spectinomycin against most bacterial organisms and that the presently disclosed spectinamides differ from spectinomycin in their uptake and efflux into bacterial cells. Further it was recently reported that spectinomycin is effluxed by see Ramon Garcia et al. 59 3 544 547 2007 which can in part explain its general lack of activity against TB cells. Therefore it is believed that the enhanced anti tubercular activities of compounds 1329 1443 1444 and 1445 and their related analogs against other organisms reflect the increased ability of these molecules to penetrate into specific organisms. Additionally it is also likely that these inhibitors are less susceptible to extrusion by drug efflux mechanisms.

To determine whether the mode of action of spectinamides against is consistent with the known information for spectinomycin spontaneous drug resistant mutants of compound 1329 were selected on agar containing drug at 4 8 and 16 times their MICs. Mutants exhibiting resistance to 1329 emerged at a frequency of 1.9 3.7 10 which is comparable to the mutation frequency for isoniazid resistance as was previously determined using the same method. See Hurdle et al. 62 5 1037 1045 2008 . However this was higher than the mutation frequency for streptomycin resistant mutants that emerged at 0.7 1.6 10. In the spirochete spectinomycin resistance also arises at a frequency of 10in contrast to streptomycin that emerges at 10and results from mutations at different loci to those conferring spectinomycin resistance. See Criswell et al. 50 2 445 452 2006 . Without being bound to any one theory since spectinomycin and streptomycin both target the 16S rRNA it is plausible that the elevated mutation frequencies observed for 1329 reflect the occurrence of mutations at sites other than within the target such as in genes controlling the uptake of 1329. However two stable mutants exhibiting high level drug resistance to 1329 and spectinomycin MICs 200 g mL were examined for cross resistance to streptomycin kanamycin and other anti tubercular antibiotics. See Table 5. None of the mutants were cross resistant to the aminoglycosides streptomycin and kanamycin capreomycin and the 23S ribosomal inhibitor linezolid. Similarly spontaneous mutants of streptomycin were highly susceptible to 1329 including the reference strain ATCC 35820 that is resistant to streptomycin due to mutations in ribosomal protein S12. See Nair et al. 10 3 521 527 1993 . Importantly there was no cross resistance between 1329 and the first line TB drugs for isoniazid rifampicin and ethambutol. See Table 5. Together these results demonstrate that 1329 and spectinomycins appear to exhibit a novel mode of action against that is unlikely to be affected by mechanisms that confer resistance to other established TB antibiotics including streptomycin and related aminoglycosides.

To explore the genetic basis of resistance to 1329 and reasons for the lack of cross resistance with aminoglycosides molecular genetic analysis was performed on the two high level mutants of 1329. In non tuberculosis organisms mutations in helix 34 the binding domain for spectinomycin is commonly associated with specific resistance to this antibiotic. See Galimand et al. 44 5 1365 1366 2000 and O Connor and Dahlberg 45 6 429 433 2002 . Similarly mutations within the ribosomal protein S5 encoded by rpsE that interacts with the spectinomycin binding domain also confers spectinomycin resistance as a result of conformational changes that alter the binding domain for spectinomycin in the 16S rRNA. To determine if 1329 also binds to helix 34 and whether mutations within the ribosomal protein S5 or the 16S rRNA engender spectinomycin resistance in these genes were sequenced in their entirety in both 1329 resistant mutants i.e. HL 14 and 15. No nucleotide changes were detected in the rpsE genes of the two mutants when these were compared to the rpsE derived from their wild type progenitor H37Rv and the reference sequence for rpsE that is denoted by Rv0721 in the H37Rv genome. In contrast the mutants HL 14 and 15 contained single point transversions in the genes for the 16S rRNA. Whereas a point mutation involving a C1057A nucleotide change conferred resistance in HL 14 the mutant HL 15 contained a mutation of C1184A in its 16S rRNA. The location of these mutations in relation to the spectinomycin binding domain was ascertained using a BLAST sequence analysis and homology modeling of the TB 16S rRNA constructed from the crystal structure of the ribosome with bound spectinomycin . The tuberculosis and 16S rRNAs were found to be highly homologous being 80 identical in sequence. Moreover these sequences were found to be 100 identical within the 10 core area surrounding the spectinomycin binding site further supporting the use of to map the location of our mutations in relation to spectinamide binding for 16S rRNA.

Mutations at position C1192 or its cross helix partner G1064 within the helix 34 are common sites for spectinomycin resistance in and other organisms. From the primary sequence alignment and structural analysis it was observed that position C1184 in the ribosome is homologous to position C1192 in . See Galimand et al. 44 5 1365 1366 2000 and O Connor and Dahlberg 45 6 429 433 2002 .

These positions both make equivalent direct H bonding contact with spectinomycin. Thus the mutation in resulting in an adenine residue at position 1184 removes the H bonding contact that is vital for stabilizing spectinomycin within the ribosome. Similarly position C1057 is homologous to the residue C1066 that also stabilizes spectinomycin through H bonding interaction. A mutation involving C1066U is reported to confer spectinomycin resistance in Serovar Typhimurium and which supports our finding that the equivalent locus C1057 in confers high level resistance to 1329 and spectinomycin. See O Connor and Dahlberg 45 6 429 433 2002 . Without being bound to any one theory that mutational resistance to 1329 maps directly in helix 34 of the 16S rRNA of is believed to be consistent with the reported mode of action for spectinomycin and explains why there is a lack of target mediated cross resistance with streptomycin and other ribosomal inhibitors against . Indeed mutations within helix 44 i.e. the binding site for aminoglycosides are required for resistance to streptomycin. Mutations in the ribosomal protein S12 and or within helix 44 do not affect spectinomycin binding to helix 34.

To further probe the macromolecular basis of mycobacterial inhibition by spectinamides radiolabelling assays for macromolecular protein synthesis were performed on mid log cells of BCG using H Leucine GE Healthcare Life Sciences Piscataway N.J. United States of America . Within 4 hours after the addition of 1329 or 1445 at 10 times their MICs protein synthesis was inhibited by 50 or more. See . The control antibiotic streptomycin also inhibited protein synthesis. This appears to indicate that the spectinamides act on their ribosomal target in the bacterial cell to inhibit protein synthesis.

In addition to having enhanced cellular uptake or resistance to efflux mechanisms it is also plausible that 1329 is more potent than spectinomycin at the ribosomal level. The commercially available cell free S30 coupled transcription translation system Promega Madison Wis. United States of America that measures the production of luciferase enzyme on ribosomes and has been previously used in quantifying the antibacterial target level activity for ribosomal inhibitor antibiotics was used to assay the protein synthesis inhibition by spectinomycins. See Murray et al. 42 4 947 950 1998 . The concentrations of 1329 and spectinomycin that caused a 50 reduction in the synthesis of luciferase were found to be 0.66 M and 0.90 M respectively. See . These results indicate that 1329 is as potent as spectinomycin at the ribosomal level but that 1329 is better able to penetrate mycobacteria to reach its ribosomal target.

Using the ICof 1329 as a standard the relative inhibitory activity of several other compounds was investigated at 0.66 and 6.6 M i.e. 1 and 10 times the ICof 1329 . See . The results indicate that the compounds inhibit luciferase protein production on the ribosomes though at different levels of activity relative to 1329.

Most compounds in the assay were less active than 1329 at 0.66 M. Compound 1351 was the next most active. However 1351 has a MIC value of 25 g mL which suggests that this compound has relatively poor permeability and that selective transport into the tuberculosis bacilli plays a major role in the activity of this series. Likewise the 3 aminoalkyl series compounds 1420 1422 1423 1424 and 1425 all inhibited well in the cell free assay but have relatively poor anti tubercular MIC activity compared to 1329 suggesting that they also suffer from poor permeability. Benzamides 1364 1365 1370 alkyl substituted compounds 1421 1369 and the pyrimidine substituted compound 1439 were less active than 1329 in the protein synthesis assay suggesting that their lower anti tubercular activity is due to poorer target affinity.

To further compare the target level activities of spectinamides concentrations that caused 50 reduction IC in luciferase synthesis in the transcription translation assay were determined for several compounds. As shown in Table 6 the ICs of the compounds varied from 0.12 2.63 g mL. The compounds 1329 1443 1444 and 1445 all exhibited low ICs comparable to spectinomycin and streptomycin indicating that the uptake of these molecules into bacterial cells is accompanied by potent inhibition of microbial protein synthesis. Compounds 1351 and 1447 also displayed comparably low ICs but their higher MICs against TB bacilli probably reflect reduced uptake into these cells as mentioned above. Altogether these results indicate that the presently disclosed spectinamides are highly potent inhibitors of bacterial protein synthesis.

From these results it appears that the structural activity relationship of spectinomycins against and possibly other organisms is mediated by i the extent of their cellular uptake to reach their ribosomal drug target and ii the ability for molecules to interact with key residues within the spectinomycin binding domain. The high activity of 1329 1443 and 1445 appear to come from both high target affinity and good cellular uptake.

In some embodiments it can be efficacious to use anti tuberculosis drugs in combination. Standard chequerboard assays were performed to evaluate whether 1329 1443 or 1445 combined with front line anti tubercular drugs could exhibit enhanced activity against . Fractional inhibitory concentration FIC indices between 0.5 and 4 suggest additive effects. See Odds F. C. 52 1 2003 . Thus the results shown in Table 7 indicate that combinations of isoniazid ethambutol or rifampin with 1329 exhibited additive effects. Therefore the presently disclosed spectinomycins would most likely be suitable for combination therapy with other anti tuberculosis drugs.

For all antimicrobial drug candidates it is important to assess the toxicity of lead compounds to ensure they have selective killing of the target pathogen over host cells. Thus the cytotoxicity of 1329 was assessed against VERO epithelial cells using a well validated colorimetric MTT based cell proliferation. See Hurdle et al. 62 5 1037 1045 2008 . The mean cytotoxic ICfor spectinomycin 1329 streptomycin and ethambutol were 1030 2182.4 1536.1 and 731.6 respectively. The therapeutic indices obtained as the ICdivided by the MIC were 41.5 5456 7680.5 and 913.8 respectively which indicates that 1329 like streptomycin and ethambutol is highly selective for the killing of . The poor index of unmodified spectinomycin reflects its poor activity against TB bacilli. To determine whether lack of cytotoxicity resulted from poor binding to the mammalian ribosomes compounds were assayed for ability to inhibit mammalian protein synthesis in Rabbit Reticulocytes Promega Madison Wis. United States of America . The ICof compounds 1329 1443 and 1445 were greater than the highest concentration tested i.e. 512 g mL . This indicates the compounds are highly selective for bacterial ribosomes as shown in Table 6.

A preliminary pharmacokinetic profile was determined for 1329 i.e. Lee 1329 using previously described methods. See Budha et al. 10 1 157 165 2008 and Budha et al. 15 8 809 825 2008 .

Following intravenous administration of 10 mg kg in rats 1329 follows a bi exponential concentration time profile with distinct distribution and elimination phases. See . Plasma protein binding of the compound is approximately 30 . 1329 is widely distributed with a steady state volume of distribution of 4.3 L kg. It has a mean residence time in the body of approximately 5.3 hours. In vitro experiments using hepatic microsomes suggest that 1329 is metabolically stable with 95 of parent drug remaining intact after 90 min of incubation.

Following intravenous administration in rats 1329 has a mean systemic clearance of 0.8 L hr kg. The fraction of dose excreted unchanged by the kidneys is 0.46 with approx. 40 of the dose being eliminated unchanged in the first 6 hours. The excretion ratio ratio of renal clearance to glomerular filtration rate of 1329 is 1.7 indicating filtration and active secretion as the net urinary elimination processes. The hepatic extraction ratio of the molecule is 0.13 indicating that 1329 can be classified as a low hepatic extraction drug.

It will be understood that various details of the presently disclosed subject matter may be changed without departing from the scope of the presently disclosed subject matter. Furthermore the foregoing description is for the purpose of illustration only and not for the purpose of limitation.
