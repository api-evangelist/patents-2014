title: Layered video transmission over communication channels
abstract: Embodiments of a method are disclosed for transmitting one or more videos provided by one or more video cameras disposed at a mobile object traveling along a pre-defined route. The method includes receiving the videos, bandwidth map data for multiple communication channels, travel time data for the mobile object, and service level agreement (SLA) parameters. The received video is transformed into multiple video layers. For each video layer, a transmission cost over the multiple communication channels is computed based on the bandwidth map data, the travel time data and the SLA parameters. Out of the multiple communication channels, a particular communication channel is selected for each video layer, which has the minimum transmission cost over the selected communication channel. The video layers are scheduled for transmission over the respective selected communication channels. The scheduled video layers are transmitted with respect to at least one of the SLA parameters.

Some of the disclosed embodiments relate to transmission of a video over communication channels and more particularly to systems and methods for transmitting a layered video over wireless communication channels.

On board surveillance can be important to ensure security and safety of passengers in a vehicle. Such surveillance is particularly important for public transport vehicles such as buses trains aircraft ships etc. since the co passengers may not know each other. Typically the surveillance video feeds from the vehicles are transmitted to a central monitoring station CMS where the video feeds are monitored and archived.

The related art includes wireless transmission of surveillance video for different kinds of vehicles. For example wireless transmission of video surveillance has been proposed for aircrafts in U.S. Pat. No. 8 325 232 for cars and trucks in US Patent Publication No. 2004 0123328 A1 and passenger surveillance for cars in US Patent Publication No. 2009 0290021 and US Patent Publication No. 2012 0007981 .

The related art methods and apparatus are subject to various disadvantages. For example to be effective in deterring crime or serving other purposes surveillance videos need to be delivered to a monitoring station either in real time or in near real time. Such video transmission generally requires high bandwidth and the bandwidth requirement increases with the increase in video resolution. For surveillance high resolution videos may be needed if the videos are used to identify participants in a security incident. The video transmission may additionally have time varying uplink bandwidth. Moreover in case of a moving vehicle the video transmission from the vehicle to the central monitoring station typically involves transmission over wireless networks where the bandwidth is typically scarce. Especially for the uplink wireless channels from the vehicle to the wireless base stations or to the wireless access points and for the moving vehicular users the available bandwidth is typically low and time varying in nature. Further data transmission such as video data over a cellular wireless network is generally expensive but is relatively cheap over WI FI networks. The total cost of such wireless transmission may be especially high for a large vehicle fleet such as in the case of transit agencies that requires continuous on board monitoring. However none of the available or existing video surveillance systems reduce or minimize the cost of transmitting the surveillance video over wireless networks such as to the central monitoring station. It may therefore be beneficial to provide methods and apparatuses capable of reducing or minimizing transmission costs of videos over wireless networks.

In accordance with some embodiments systems and methods provide layered video encoding including a base layer that provides a low resolution feed of the video and one or more enhancement layers that enhance the resolution of the base layer. In accordance with some of these embodiments the transmission of the surveillance video layers over multiple wireless connections is scheduled in a manner such that each layer is delivered within some given latency e.g. the base layer is delivered with a small latency and an enhanced layer is delivered after a moderate latency and the cost of the wireless transmission is bounded. This latency aspect provides flexibility while scheduling transmission and thereby reduces transmission costs.

In accordance with some of these embodiments the methods and apparatuses take into account the following factors 1 different latencies associated with the different video layers and the penalty associated with late transmission 2 maximum allowed budget for transmission 3 different per unit cost of transmission over each wireless connection and 4 time varying available bandwidths of different wireless connections. Some of the disclosed methods and apparatus assign video layers two different wireless connections for transmission where the assignment may vary over time while taking the above inputs and constraints into account. In other words some of the disclosed embodiments are directed to video surveillance systems and methods for layered video encoding and opportunistic communication over multiple wireless networks to handle timing and cost requirements.

Some of the disclosed methods and apparatus combine both the cost of video transmission charged by wireless connection operators and a penalty user provided for late delivery of video layers. The two costs are considered simultaneously and a combination of them is minimized. This allows the operator to make a trade off between transmission costs and latency requirements.

The method furthermore includes assigning each of the plurality of video layers to a communication channel selected among the one or more communication channels. The selected communication channel provides a minimum transmission cost for an assigned video layer among the assigned plurality of video layers. The method also includes scheduling each of the assigned plurality of video layers for transmission over a respective selected communication channel among the one or more communication channels. The method further includes transmitting the scheduled plurality of video layers with respect to at least one of the SLA parameters.

Examples of the network include but are not limited to local area network LAN wide area network WAN cable telephone network satellite network and so on. The communication channels may be any wireless connection that is available over the predefined travel route of the mobile object. Examples of the communication channels include but are not limited to 2G telecommunication networks 3G telecommunication networks 4G telecommunication networks Wi Fi networks satellite networks etc.

The usage costs of the communication channels refer to costs that may be incurred if data for e.g. in bits is transmitted over the communication channels. The usage cost associated with each of the communication channels may be same or different. For example for Wi Fi connection the usage cost per transmitted bit is very low and the available bandwidth is high but the connection may be available only at stoppage points of the mobile object. On the other hand for 3G cellular connections the usage cost per transmitted bit is high and the available bandwidth is moderate to low but the 3G connection may be always available over the predefined route of the mobile object.

The input module further receives service level agreement SLA parameters for transmission of the received video to the CMS .

The penalty represents the cost paid per unit data per time interval if a video layer is not delivered within a predefined delay or maximum transmission latency. The penalty may be paid for the data of only for those video layers that are transmitted and delivered late at the CMS .

The input module may provide the received video the travel time data and the bandwidth map data to the layering module . The layering module may be configured to perform layered video encoding that involves transformation of the received video into a predetermined number of video layers each having a distinct resolution. The layered video encoding may generate a base layer having the lowest resolution of the video and one or more enhancement layers that improve the resolution of the base layer.

Examples of the buffer may include but are not limited to EEPROM flash memory cache memory SD RAM DDR RAM or storage units such as a file server used in a network attached storage NAS mode a block based storage server such as used in a storage area network SAN or other type of storage server etc.

The order in which the method is described is not intended to be construed as a limitation and any number of the described method blocks may be combined or otherwise performed in any order to implement the method or an alternate method. Additionally individual blocks may be deleted from the method without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure described herein. Furthermore the method may be implemented in any suitable hardware software firmware or combination thereof that exists in the related art or that is later developed.

The depicted method may be implemented on the control module of the monitoring unit . In an embodiment the method is based on i the different latencies associated with the different video layers and the penalty associated with late transmission of the captured video ii maximum allowed budget for transmission iii different per unit cost of transmission over each wireless communication channel and iv time varying available bandwidths of different wireless communication channels. The control module may assign the video layers to different communication channels for transmission where the assignment may vary over time based on the above four inputs and constraints. For the purpose of scheduling the control module may divide time into fixed sized intervals called timeslots.

For each video layer and for each communication channel the control module may output the transmission schedule of the video layer on that channel. The control module may be configured to execute the method at each stop for example stop S of the mobile object to schedule a video layer transmission until the next stop for example stop S. For ease of calculating the minimum transmission cost timeslot t may be initialized from 1 at the departure of the mobile object from the stop S with D time slots until the departure time from the stop S. In some embodiments since calculation of minimum transmission cost is useful only if multiple video layers are available for transmission the control module may be configured to schedule the transmission of video layers one by one starting from layer 1 representing the base layer to the highest layer in the video.

At any point if a video layer cannot be transmitted due to exceeding the video transmission budget the control module may terminate the method and no subsequent video layers may be scheduled for transmission. For each video layer the control module computes the cost of transmitting the video layer on each communication channel while meeting the latency requirement based on the corresponding SLA parameter and selects or assigns the communication channel which has the lowest transmission cost for the video layer. The video layer may be then scheduled for transmission on the selected communication channel.

The control module may be configured to compute values of various parameters at initialization and at the end of assigning each video layer to a communication channel. In an embodiment these parameters may include 1 ts j i t representing the number of bits or data units of each video layer vj that should be transmitted over each of the communication channels wi in a timeslot t 2 RB i t representing the residual bandwidth over the communication channels wi in the timeslot t after transmitting if any of the already scheduled video layers and 3 c j representing the transmission cost for each video layer vj. In one example ts j i t may be initialized to zero 0 RB i t may be initialized to B i t and c j may be initialized to zero 0 where 

t timeslot t 1 2 . . . D where D total number of timeslots in the estimated travel time of the mobile object traveling between the predetermined locations along the predefined route 

i channel vector i 1 2 . . . K where K total number of communication channels available during the estimated travel time of the mobile object traveling between the predetermined locations along the predefined route 

j video layer vector j 1 2 . . . L where L total number of video layers generated for a received video by the layering module .

The method handles time varying bandwidth of the communication channels. The method assumes that the actual available bandwidth of a communication channel is same as the predicted bandwidth i.e. the prediction is accurate over the scheduling duration i.e. the estimated travel time between the predetermined locations along the predefined route . Also the travel time data is assumed to be accurate for the number of timeslots in the scheduling duration.

As shown in the control module may perform various steps to schedule each of the video layers for transmission over the communication channels on which the corresponding video layer has the minimum transmission cost. Within the scheduling duration for each video layer the control module may iterate over each available communication channel and computes the transmitted data buffered data and penalty of late transmission of the video layers as discussed below.

At step the control module may set a video layer vector i for which the transmission cost is to be computed over different communication channels. In one example the control module may set the video layer vector to 1 corresponding to the base layer of the video having the lowest resolution.

At step the control module may check various conditions for the set video layer vector. In one example the control module may check whether 1 the set video layer vector is less than or equal to the total number of the generated video layers and 2 the total transmission cost of the video layers over the respective communication channels is less than the total budget for video transmission represented by D C where Crepresents maximum transmission cost allowed per timeslot. If values of the set video layer vector is greater than L and that of the total transmission cost is equal to or greater than D CMAX then a step is performed else a step is performed.

At step video layers may be transmitted according to the computed schedule in the timeslots from 1 to D based on certain conditions. A first scheduling condition may include a value of the video layer vector being greater than L . This condition may represent that either there is only one video layer available for transmission or all the video layers below the video layer L have already been scheduled. A second scheduling condition may include a value of the total transmission cost of the current video layer and the already scheduled video layers being greater than D CMAX . This condition may represent that the total transmission cost of the video layer which is indicated by the set video layer vector and that of the already scheduled lower layers exceeds the allowed budget i.e. D C for the video transmission over the scheduling duration. The scheduling duration corresponds to the estimated travel time of the mobile object traveling between the predetermined locations along the predefined route. In an embodiment when both the conditions are true i.e. if the sum of the transmission cost c j s of the current video layer vand the transmission cost of all lower video layers that have already been scheduled is more than the allowed budget i.e. D CMAX for the video transmission over the timeslots to D in the scheduling duration then the current layer and all higher video layers are not transmitted and the scheduling method is terminated.

At step a video layer corresponding to the set value of the video layer vector is selected. For example when the set value of the video layer vector is 1 the control module may select the base layer of the video having the lowest resolution.

At step the residual bandwidth on each of the wireless communication channels is computed. Each of the wireless communication channels have limited bandwidth which may be used by multiple devices for transmission of data. Residual bandwidth of a wireless communication channel may refer to a bandwidth available over the communication channel in at least one timeslot in the scheduling duration after any of the scheduled video layers is transmitted. The control module computes the residual bandwidths of all the communications channels available over the scheduling duration based on the bandwidth map data and the travel time data.

At step a value of the channel vector i is set. In one example the control module may set the value of channel vector to 1 which may correspond to a first communication channel available over the scheduling duration. In a similar manner the control module may set the value of channel vector from 1 to K for computing transmission cost of the selected video layer on different wireless communication channels available over the scheduling duration.

At step the control module may check whether the value of the channel vector is less than or equal to K which represents the total number of communication channels available over the scheduling duration. The value of the channel vector greater than K represents that the corresponding communication channels are unavailable for video transmission. If a value of the channel vector is greater than K steps and are performed else a step is performed by the control module .

At step a value of the timeslot t is set. In one example the control module may set the value of the timeslot to 1 representing a first timeslot over the scheduling duration for the preset communication channel indicated by the channel vector i .

At step the control module may check whether the value of the timeslot is less than or equal to D which represents the total number of timeslots over the scheduling duration. The value of the timeslot T greater than D represents that there are no more timeslots available in the scheduling duration. If the value of the timeslot is greater than D steps and are performed else steps and are performed by the control module .

At step amount of data to transmit buffer size and penalty are calculated for the selected video layer in the preset communication channel during the preset timeslot. The control module may compute various transmission data for the selected video layer. The transmission data may include but not limited to the data units of the selected video layer to be transmitted a buffer size required for storing the selected video layer potential penalty that may be levied if the selected video layer is not delivered to the CMS within the predefined delay etc. For each of the communication channel the transmission data may be computed iteratively over the timeslots from 1 to D. Computation of the transmission data is discussed below using generalized equations based on variables t representing the timeslots in the scheduling duration i representing the channel vector and j representing the video layer vector.

The control module computes temporary values of the transmission data since the video layer is yet to be transmitted or scheduled. However the final assignment of a communication channel to a video layer is determined only after considering all available communication channels for determining the transmission data for each video layer. The temporary transmission data is represent in Equations 1 2 and 3 based on the assumption that the preset video layer is transmitted over a selected communication channel. 0 1 

In Equation 1 buf j i t represents an assumed buffer size at the end of the timeslot. The buffer size is initialized to 0 . 2 

In Equation 2 ts j i t represents an assumed assignment of the amount of data of the video layer vto be transmitted over a communication channel win the timeslot t. 3 

In Equation 3 pen j i t represents an assumed penalty for late transmission at the end of timeslot t for the assumed data in Equation 2 being delayed by more than maximum allowed latency dfor each video layer.

For a given timeslot t the amount of data ts j i t that is available for transmission is the sum of the buffered data at the end of previous slot and the data generated in the previous slot i.e. buf j i t 1 R j . Since not more than RB i t amount of data can be transmitted in the given timeslot the assumed transmitted data is shown in Equation 4 min 1 4 

In Equation 4 RB i t represents the residual bandwidth which is a product of the amount of data R j in a video layer to be transmitted and the bandwidth B i t available in the communication channel for transmission.

The amount of data left in the buffer at the end of given timeslot t is the amount of buffered data at the end of the previous slot i.e. t 1 and the generated data R j reduced by the transmitted data ts j i t which will no longer be present in the buffer. The amount of data left in the buffer at the end of the given timeslot t is shown in Equation 5. 1 5 

Further the penalty for late transmission is the amount of data left in the buffer from the delayed timeslots i.e. dslots earlier multiplied by the user define penalty pto be paid per unit data per timeslot or time interval for the delay in transmission of the video layer. If a timeslot duration is less than or equal to the delay in transmission of the video layer i.e. t d then the data left from dslot earlier is 0 and therefore the penalty pis also zero. The amount of data left in the buffer from the previous timeslots may be obtained by subtracting the amount of data is generated in the last dslots i.e. R j d from the current buffer size buf j i t . The assumed penalty for late transmission of the video layers is shown in Equation 6. max 0 if and 0 if 6 

At step the timeslot is incremented by a value 1 . Once the data units the required buffer size and the potential penalty associated with the selected video layer are calculated for a preset timeslot the control module may increment the timeslot by the value 1 to calculate the transmission data for the next timeslot. Based on the incremented value of the timeslot T the step may be performed again by the control module .

At step a cost of transmitting the selected video layer over the preset communication channel is calculated. When the calculation of the transmission data for the selected video layer is complete for all the timeslots in the scheduling duration the control module may calculate the cost of transmitting the selected layer over the preset communication channel.

Based on Equations 1 to 6 the temporary total transmission cost for each of the video layers for each of the available communication channels over all the timeslots t may be computed. This temporary total transmission cost c j i is the sum of the assumed cost of transmitting the amount of data ts j i t of the video layers i.e. transmission cost of the video layers and the assumed penalty for late transmission of the video layers pen j i t over all the timeslots t as shown in Equation 7. 7 

At step the channel vector i is incremented by a value 1 . Once the transmission cost for the preset video layer over the preset communication channel is calculated the control module may increment the channel vector i by 1 to calculate the transmission data and the transmission cost for the selected video layer for the next available communication channel in the scheduling duration. Based on the incremented value of the channel vector i the step may be performed again by the control module .

At step a communication channel with the lowest transmission cost for the preset video layer is selected. The channel vector having value in excess of K represents that the transmission cost for the preset video layer is already calculated for each of the available communication channels. From these available communication channels the control module may select a communication channel for transmission for which the preset video layer has the minimum transmission cost c j . The control module also assigns the preset video layer having the minimum transmission cost c j to the selected communication channel.

At step transmission schedule and the transmission cost is confirmed for the assigned video layer over the selected communication channel. The control module may check the buffer in the transmitting module to confirm whether 1 the selected communication channel is already buffered or scheduled to transmit the assigned video layer or 2 the selected communication channel has no available bandwidth to support further transmission. If the assigned video layer is not scheduled for transmission with the selected communication channel and has bandwidth available for transmission the control module confirms the selected communication channel as available for transmission of the assigned video layer. The control module then also retrieves and confirms the transmission cost of the assigned video layer calculated at step for transmission over the selected communication channel. Generalized equation for the assigned video layers ts j s t scheduled for transmission over the respective selected communication channels is shown in Equation 8 . Also generalized equations for the transmission cost c j of the video layers is shown in Equation 9 and for the residual bandwidth RB s t of the selected communication channels for transmission of the next video layer which is used at step for the next video layer is shown in Equation 10 . and for all 0 0 8 9 and for remains unchanged 10 

At step a value of the video layer vector is incremented by 1 and the total transmission cost of the video is updated. When the assigned video layer is scheduled for transmission over the selected communication channel the control module may increment the value of the video layer vector j by 1 to schedule the next video layer for transmission over the corresponding communication channel for which this next video layer has the minimum transmission cost. The control module may compute the total transmission cost of the captured video by summing the calculated minimum transmission cost for each video layer over the respective communication channels. Hence after scheduling each video layer for transmission the control module may update the total transmission cost of the video over the available communication channels in the scheduling duration. Based on the incremented value of the video layer vector T the step may be performed again by the control module . The steps through are repeated for scheduling the next higher layer until all the layers are scheduled.

The assumptions made in the scheduling method may be valid if the duration of travel between two consecutive predetermined locations is below a relatively small time threshold for example up to 5 minutes. However the predictions for the computed data might not be accurate for longer inter location travel duration. In such a scenario various modifications may be made to the method according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.

The inter location travel may be divided into multiple epochs the number of which may not be known in advance by the control module and the last epoch might be of a shorter duration if the inter location travel duration is not an exact multiple of a predetermined epoch duration . The epoch may be defined as a fixed number of timeslots covering a short period of time e.g. 1 minutes less than the predefined time threshold.

For each epoch various parameters may be re initialized for implementing the above method . These parameters may include timeslot T the bandwidths B i t of the available communication channels the initial buffer size buf j i t for each video layer etc. The timeslot t may be re initialized to zero. The bandwidths B i t of the available communication channels may be re initialized at the beginning of each epoch based on the latest bandwidth predicted by using the bandwidth map data and by computing the residual bandwidth as discussed above for each communication channel and for each timeslot in the epoch. The initial buffer size for each video layer may be set to the buffer size at the end of the last epoch for each epoch but except the first epoch in the inter location interval. In other words the initial buffer size buf j i 0 may be set to the buffer size of the video layer at the end of the previous epoch. Further the minimum transmission cost may be computed again for the video layers over the available communication channels in each epoch.

The modifications may be useful due to various reasons. In one example the predictions for both bandwidth and travel time may be more accurate when the prediction duration e.g. an epoch is smaller than the inter location travel duration. In another example the communication channel selected and assigned to a video layer may vary from epoch to epoch. Therefore the scheduling method may leverage time varying wireless communication channels for example by assigning more video layers to a particular communication channel in those epochs in which the communication channel has high bandwidth and less video layers may be assigned to the communication channel in the epochs where the communication channel has low bandwidth. Upon performing these modifications the above discussed scheduling method may be executed separately for each epoch by the control module .

The order in which the method is described is not intended to be construed as a limitation and any number of the described method blocks may be combined or otherwise performed in any order to implement the method or an alternate method. Additionally individual blocks may be deleted from the method without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure described herein. Furthermore the method may be implemented in any suitable hardware software firmware or combination thereof that exists in the related art or that is later developed.

At step a video bandwidth map data for one or more communication channels travel time data for a mobile object and SLA parameters for video transmission are received. In communication with one or more imaging units such as the imaging unit the monitoring unit may receive a video for being transmitted to the central monitoring system . The monitoring unit may also receive bandwidth map data via a suitable interface. The bandwidth map data may include signal strength bandwidth map channel usage cost etc. for each of the available communication channels. The bandwidth map provides a representation of bandwidths for the communication channels available between the predetermined locations along the predefined routes. The channel usage cost refers to the cost that may be incurred if data e.g. in bits is transmitted over a particular communication channel. The channel usage cost may be same or different for each of the communication channels.

The monitoring unit may also receive the travel time data and SLA parameters via the suitable interface. The interface may include software interfaces for example an application programming interface a graphical user interface etc. hardware interfaces for example cable connectors a keyboard an interactive display screen etc. or both. The travel time data may include an estimated travel time between various predetermined locations along various predefined routes dwell time at each location position of each location etc. for the mobile object from which the received video is to be transmitted. This estimated travel time may be used as the video scheduling duration within which the received video is to be transmitted. The video scheduling duration may be divided into multiple timeslots. The SLA parameters may include the maximum latency allowed for video transmission the video transmission budget penalty cost for late video transmission etc. The video transmission budget refers to a maximum average cost for transmitting the video over the scheduling duration.

At step the received video is transformed into a plurality of video layers. The monitoring unit may transform the received video into multiple video layers. The video layers may be encoded into same or different video coding standards at a constant bit rate. Each of the video layers has a distinct resolution and generates an amount of data units in each timeslot based on it resolution and encoding standard.

At step a transmission cost of each of the plurality of video layers for transmission over the one or more communication channels based on the bandwidth map data the travel time data and the SLA parameters is computed. The monitoring unit may calculate 1 the amount of data units associated with each video layer based on its resolution and the encoding standard and 2 penalty cost for each video layer based on its maximum transmission latency allowed the calculated amount of data units and user provided penalty cost for late transmission. The monitoring unit uses the calculated values of the data units and penalty cost for computing the cost of transmission of each of the video layers over each of the available communication channels in the scheduling duration as discussed above.

At step a communication channel among the one or more communication channels is selected for each of the plurality of video layers such that the selected communication channel provides a minimum transmission cost for the corresponding video layer among the plurality of video layers. Basis the computed transmission cost the monitoring unit selects a communication channel for which a particular video layer has the minimum transmission cost. In a similar manner at least one communication channel is selected for each of the video layers having the minimum transmission cost over the selected at least one communication channel.

At step each of the plurality of video layers is scheduled for transmission over the corresponding selected communication channel. The monitoring unit creates a transmission schedule for each of the video layers. The transmission schedule includes each of the video layers being assigned to the respectively selected communication channels. In the transmission schedule the video layers are arranged in a sequence to be followed for transmission of the video layers.

At step one or more of the scheduled video layers are transmitted according to the SLA parameters. Once all the video layers are scheduled the monitoring unit transmits the video layers according to the created transmission schedule. In one example a first video layer such the base layer of the received video may be transmitted first followed by subsequent higher or enhancement layers in ascending order of the their respective resolutions. The monitoring unit may continue to transmit the video layers according to the SLA parameters. For example each of the video layers is associated with the minimum transmission cost basis its transmission over the scheduled or selected communication channel. The monitoring unit may stop the scheduled transmission of the video layers when the total transmission cost associated with the transmitted video layers exceeds the video transmission budget.
