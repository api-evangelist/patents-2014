title: Method for terminating a rope
abstract: A method for terminating a rope sliding a socket over the rope which includes unlaying the outer strands of the rope, sliding a wedge onto the core such that the outer strands surround the wedge, the wedge includes a central bore axially aligned with the socket, further sliding the wedge such that the core enters the central bore and is terminated by the wedge, pressing the outer strands of the rope against the wedge, sliding the socket over the wedge such that the outer strands are captured between the wedge and the socket, and swaging the socket such that the outer strands are secured.

Currently the arresting gear system on aircraft carriers rely on a purchase cable to transfer energy from the landing aircraft to arresting gear engines located below the deck. Each end of the purchase cable is fitted with a terminal. The purchase cable terminal on the top deck end connects to a cross deck pendant which is engaged by the landing aircraft s tail hook. On the opposite end of the purchase cable the terminal connects the purchase cable to anchors after the cable has been reeved through to the arresting engine.

The purchase cable terminal is a critical safety item. The failure of a terminal during aircraft arrestment could result in the loss of life loss of an aircraft and or property damage. When a purchase cable is replaced a new terminal needs to be attached to new cable in order to connect the purchase cable with the cross deck pendant. Currently this requires the user to pour molten zinc into the socket terminal which is a toxic hazardous and time consuming process.

The United States Navy has been investigating to utilize a hybrid rope construction with an outer lay of metallic strands and a synthetic fiber load carrying core. Therefore a quick easy method to terminate a rope is required to meet the demands of in service Navy use.

The present invention is directed to a method for terminating a rope with the needs enumerated above and below.

The present invention is directed to a method for terminating a rope with a core the method comprising of sliding a socket over the rope unlaying the outer strands of the rope sliding a wedge with a central bore onto the core such that the outer strands surround the wedge further sliding the wedge such that the core enters the central bore and is terminated by the wedge pressing the outer strands of the rope against the wedge sliding the socket over the wedge such that the outer strands are captured between the wedge and the socket and swaging the socket such that the outer strands are secured.

It is a feature of the present invention to provide a method for terminating a rope that is quick not toxic and easy.

It is a feature of the present invention to provide a method for terminating a rope that withstands aircraft arresting loads.

The preferred embodiments of the present invention are illustrated by way of example below and in . The rope utilized in the method for terminating a rope shown in has outer strands surrounding a core . The method includes sliding a socket over the rope unlaying the outer strands of the rope sliding a wedge shown in onto the core such that the outer strands surround the wedge . The wedge includes a central bore axially aligned with the socket . When sliding the wedge onto the core the core enters the central bore and is terminated by the wedge . After sliding the wedge onto the core the method further includes pressing the outer strands of the rope against the wedge as shown in sliding the socket over the wedge such that the outer strands are captured between the wedge and the socket as shown in and swaging the socket such that the outer strands are secured.

In the description of the present invention the invention will be discussed in an aircraft and ship environment however this invention can be utilized for any type of application that requires use of a method for terminating a rope.

As shown in the rope utilized in the method for terminating a rope has a high strength light weight fiber inner core and an outer layer or lay of metallic wire strands . In the preferred embodiment the core is manufactured from synthetic load bearing material. However any type material that is wear and abrasion resistant can be used for the outer layer or lay. As shown in the core may have larger inner synthetic strands while the outer strands are smaller outer metallic strands.

A socket may be defined but without limitation as a hollow object into which something fits. In the preferred embodiment the socket may have grooves machined in its inner diameter to accept the outer strands . The grooves may be machined to match the lay angle thereby providing a smooth load transition into the terminal. A wedge may be defined but without limitation as an object which captures and separates layers of a rope. As shown in in the preferred embodiment the wedge includes the central bore which transitions into a side bore and an opposite side bore that both lead out of the wedge . The wedge may also have a rounded end . Alternatively the wedge may be a potted socket and or may have grooves machined on its outer diameter to accept the outer strands .

As shown in the method may additionally include the step of having the core pass through the central bore into and out of the side bore then wrapping the core around the rounded end of the wedge then having the core enter the opposite side bore such that the core terminates in the opposite side bore . As shown in the core of the rope passes through the central bore of the wedge passes through the side bore around the rounded end of wedge into the opposite side bore and terminating therein. After the core is wrapped around the wedge the socket is slid over the wedge and outer strands as shown in . Alternatively or additionally as shown in the central bore may transition into a voided area of conical shape or conical void the core then brooms outward to fill the conical void and fining the conical void with a resin or zinc binder such that the core terminates in the wedge .

As shown in the method for terminating a rope may also include placing a crush plate on the edge of the wedge where the core is terminated also defined as the rounded end of the wedge . A crush plate may be defined but without limitation as an object which translates compression force and prevents abrasion to mating components. As shown in additionally or alternatively a clevis may be threaded onto the socket and torqued to a value necessary to provide clamp force greater than the expected maximum load of the rope . A clevis may be defined but without limitation as a U shaped or forked metal connector within which another part can be fastened by means of a bolt or pin passing through the ends of the connector. The clevis may be locked into place using a pin bolt weld threaded interface or any other means practicable.

Swaging may be defined but without limitation as a forging process wherein split dies are used to reduce the diameter of the socket around the metallic wire strands and the wedge creating a permanent mechanical joint.

When introducing elements of the present invention or the preferred embodiment s thereof the articles a an the and said are intended to mean there are one or more of the elements. The terms comprising including and having are intended to be inclusive and mean that there may be additional elements other than the listed elements.

Although the present invention has been described in considerable detail with reference to certain preferred embodiments thereof other embodiments are possible. Therefore the spirit and scope of the appended claims should not be limited to the description of the preferred embodiment s contained herein.
