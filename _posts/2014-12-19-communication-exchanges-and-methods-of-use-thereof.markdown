In some embodiments the recipients onboard to the illustrative electronic communications exchange of the instant invention via the channel s to receive distributions according to the recipients rules. In some embodiments during the onboarding process the recipients can perform at least one or more of the following activities in one or more predetermined or non predetermined order 

1 Agree to a Business Exchange Contract which can include but not limited to legal terms of the illustrative electronic communications exchange of the instant invention rules and obligations of the channel system s and of the exchange in some embodiments the instant invention assumes that there is a relationship between the recipients and the channel s separately from the relationship between i the channel s and or the recipients and ii with the exchange 

2 Verify Identify which can include but is not limited to providing information to verify the recipient s identity in some embodiments the instant invention assumes that the authentication has been established by the channel and the recipient and

3 Establish rules which can include but is not limited to establishing rules for the receipt of distributions such as but is not limited to i general rule s applying to a all senders b all channels and or c all distribution types ii specific rule s applying to a a single sender b a single channel and or c a single distribution type or any combination of i a to ii c .

As shows in some embodiments the illustrative electronic communications exchange of the instant invention can mediate capturing applying distributing and or maintaining rules among parties in accordance with at least the following 

Senders the sender attributes and or rules define identify the rules by which distributions can be delivered for example in some embodiments the sender rules may include but are not limited to supported channel s enabled source s identity validation and consent e.g. legal consent requirement s timing of delivery etc. in some embodiments the sender rules may be also set for a specific distribution type across a category of distribution types or across all distribution types 

Sources the source systems integrate with the illustrative electronic communications exchange of the instant invention to capture the sender rules as well as defining the source system rules regarding the types of distributions enabled through the source system s 

Exchange the illustrative electronic communications exchange of the instant invention facilitates the capturing of the sender rules and or the recipient rules through the source s channel s and or administrative interface s ensuring that all rules are being followed during the delivery process and distributing appropriate rule information to the senders the recipients the sources and the channels 

Channels the channels integrate with the illustrative electronic communications exchange of the instant invention to capture the recipient rules and or broadcast to the exchange channel specific rules defining at least one of the type s of distributions that can be supported delivery timing capabilities validation capabilities e.g. identity verification etc. and

Recipients the recipient rules can define identify select at least one of the channel s that the recipients would like to use the type of communications distributions that the recipients would like to distribute validation information etc. in some embodiments the recipients may set rules for at least one of a distribution type a single sender across an industry and or universally.

In some embodiments the illustrative electronic communications exchange of the instant invention allows the senders and the recipients at least to set rules and to define the scope of those rules such that through a single action the recipients and the senders can define one or more rule that will apply across a single sender channel or any combination of the senders and or the channels. For example in some embodiments through a particular channel each recipient could set one or more rule s to receive client statements e.g. bank statements account statements trade confirmations other personal information and define that such recipient would like the rule s to apply across at least one of a distribution type across an account across a single sender across an industry across all senders available on the exchange etc. In some embodiments the illustrative electronic communications exchange of the instant invention allows to simplify the senders experience around defining rule s .

Typically within many industries capturing a rule from a recipient must also include the capturing of a legal consent for the sender to apply that rule. For example within the brokerage industry after capturing a rule to distribute communications electronically e.g. account statements trade confirmations government mandated materials about investments etc. an investor must agree to terms and conditions to legally receive that content through a digital channel. In some embodiments within the exchange of the instant invention allows to capture the consent by allowing the recipient to set rule s and then receive notification s that the recipient s consent is also required through a particular channel selected by such recipient.

For example in some embodiments if a recipient sets rule s to receive statements from any company that the recipient has one or more relationship s through a particular channel the exchange would initiate an account discovery process to identify such relationship s . In some embodiments once such relationship s has have been identified if a consent is required the exchange would deliver a message through the channel to the recipient requesting the recipient to agree to the consent language. Once the recipient agrees such rule s would not be applicable.

In some embodiments the illustrative electronic communications exchange of the instant invention performs the discovery of relationships which includes but is not limited to processes to identify relationships between the senders and the recipients enabling the flow of information.

In some embodiments the discovery can be done using for example at least one of at least three following approaches or any combination of these approaches

In some embodiments the result of the discovery process depends at least in part on the sender s distribution rules.

In some embodiments the illustrative electronic communications exchange of the instant invention performs the delivery of distributions from the sender s to the recipient s based at least in part upon defined rules.

In some embodiments the delivery of distributions can be done using at least one of at least three of the following approaches or any combination of these approaches 

In some embodiments the above illustrative approaches are defined by variations on at least three steps in the distribution process 

In some embodiments the illustrative electronic communications exchange of the instant invention keeps an audit trail as the distributions flow through the exchange such audit trail can include but is not limited to updates to rules and attributes and other changes that occurs with and or caused by the recipients the senders the channels the exchange and or the sources. In some embodiments through the integration with the channel s the exchange updates matches validates the exchange collected data. In some embodiments the illustrative electronic communications exchange of the instant invention allows the senders to gain insight into the delivery of their distributions. For example the audit trail data and or the audit trail data enriched with data provided by various channels and or sources can be used to provide at least one of the following but is not limited to 

i comprehensive audit trail of distributions useful for example to demonstrate regulatory compliance and or delivery 

iii allowing the senders to perform anonymous analysis utilizing various analytical tools to determine for example which components of the distribution are most interesting to the recipients and

iv determining how to integrate communications and or combine content effectively for various classes of the recipients and
