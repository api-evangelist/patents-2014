The assignments may be represented by an icon . The icon of one of the assignments may be associated with a type of job such as a download job or a configuration job and may be the same icon used in other GUI interfaces such as in an assignment navigator.

The scheduler panel may show various assignments as a graphic bar . A title may be derived from a name of a respective assignment . A start time may be indicated by a vertical black bar on the left that may have a diamond ending. If an assignment is an override assignment then a horizontal line which extends from the left side vertical bar to a right side vertical bar indicates an amount of time that an override is in effect i.e. the override duration. The right side vertical bar may have a second diamond ending.

Referring to an exemplary three hour configuration override assignment is shown. If the override assignment results in an error an assignment graphic bar may be displayed to indicate that there was an error. The assignment graphic bar and or the icon may flash or blink or have a specific color such as red to indicate the occurrence of the error. If the assignment is in progress then a progress bar not shown may also be shown to show the percentage of completion of the assignment and the time elapsed. If the assignment is on time then the progress bar may be green if it is a little late then it may be amber and if the assignment is either stopped incomplete or a delay has caused a conflict with another assignment bar then the progress bar may be red may flash and may display a warning message to alert a user.

Hovering a mouse cursor over an assignment may bring up a tool tip with additional details as shown in . In the embodiment shown in the tool tip includes additional details such as a start time which may include date and time e.g. 6 Mar. 2007 override duration e.g. 3 hours type of job e.g. configuration and status e.g. running . In some embodiments there may be more detail in the tooltip than shown in this screen shot such as progress of particular gaming machines associated with the assignment. In the event that some EGMs have completed the assignment or some have not this information may be obtained by clicking the assignment graphic bar to obtain a summary of the status of the EGMs affected.

In the embodiment shown in the scheduler panel shows recurring assignments . Temporally sequential assignments are linked by a recurrence indicator . Each recurrence indicator links the previous assignment with the next occurrence the assignment .

In the embodiment shown in the scheduler panel shows multi job assignment starting at about 3 30 am on Monday. The multi job assignment represents an assignment that was set up to run two jobs in sequence such as two downloads. However the multi job assignment may be a download followed by a configuration or any combination of two or more jobs.

In some embodiments assignments may be changed so that they schedule one or more jobs describing what to do. In that case configuration or download instructions about what to configuration or download may be shared at different times or for different EGMs such that the instruction don t need to be re entered.

In some embodiments double clicking on icon or opening an assignment may open a detail window with a view similar to the tooltip and the detail window may be focused only on an assignment in question. The detail window may show the individual status for each EGM and in the case of configurations for each option. Two or more of these may be opened at once to aid in comparing results.

Assignments which include override assignment recurring assignments and multi job assignments are displayed at locations in the scheduler panel so as to keep the display of the assignments compact while at the same time avoiding overlaps. In the embodiment illustrated in all recurring assignments scheduled during a time period of interest may be displayed near the top and may be horizontally aligned. Then each one of the recurring assignments during the time period of interest may be taken in start time order and displayed beginning at the top left corner. Initially each one recurring assignments during the time period of interest may be displayed one row below the ones already displayed until the start time has shifted forward far enough that it can be drawn in a new column without overwriting the previous ones. At this point the current row may be reset to the top and this may be repeated for each subsequent ones of the recurring assignments during the time period of interest.

In some embodiments a displayed assignment may also include one or more progress indicators that may show how much of the job has completed. Because a job could involve more than one EGM the percentage shown may be the average percent complete for all EGMs or the percent complete for the one that is least complete in order to give operator some idea of how much longer it will take to complete the job or some other useful measure of completion. The scheduler panel may also provide some readily apparent indicator that an assignment has encountered a kind of error. The error indicator may be clicked on that indicator to see details of the error such as identify one or more EGMs gaming machines that have been unable to receive or have encountered delays in receiving a download or reconfiguration or have refused the download or reconfiguration because of an incompatibility issue.

Software packages added to the software library may be verified from the package data using an MD5 or SHA1 hashing algorithm to validate the data or some other verification tool. The verification string may be added to a package header and used to re verify the package when it is downloaded to the EGM .

All verification failures and related errors may be logged and the log entry may contain the date and time the ID of the person running the process at the time and the specific type of error that occurred. They may also be displayed on the correct display area.

The SDDP server may be utilized to provide selected EGMs with the communications port location and IP address used for sending software package data to the EGM . All data within a download package may be compressed using conventional compression techniques and transmitted in compressed format. On receipt EGM may decompress the downloaded software package.

Referring to gaming network is shown in representative form. The download and configuration management server system may be a portion of the slot management system which provides a suite of subsystems designed to provide customizable solutions by allowing users to select products within the suite to meet their needs for particular facilities such as a casino manager seeking to manage a single or multiple properties. Download and Configuration Download and Config are two of the subsystems offered in the suite that provides a user such as the Slot Operations staff an efficient mechanism to remotely configure electronic gaming machine EGM .

The download and configuration software utilized together with the apparatuses as shown in the figures may be used to enable a casino s staff such as slot operations staff to schedule and change a game s on the casino floor from a keyboard.

configure download and activate changes to games on the floor without touching an EGM on the floor. download and configuration software application may be loaded on control station to enable the sending of information over the casino network using G2S HTTPS standardized message protocols that manage the downloaded content. From control station a user such as casino staff can change cabinet or game options or games in respective EGMs . There may be numerous selections that the staff can schedule to configure or make a minor change. Table 1 below list some examples of the types of software that may be downloaded or options which may be re configured 

In order to implement the download and configuration features one approach is to install slot management system at a facility such as the commercially available Bally Live slot management system. The implementation of the download and configuration features further contemplates the implementation of server hardware and related equipment as shown in the figures and particularly including software to perform the needed functions for communicating relevant data and instructions the implementation of download ready EGMs such as EGMs with an Alpha operating system with remote download and configuration capability. An example system for implementing the download and configuration management server system may be a commercially available Bally One System together with a commercially available Bally Live Floor program. Another example implementation of the download and configuration management server system may be in conjunction with other slot management systems incorporating a commercially available Bally Live Core program.

An exemplary process for using the download and configuration server system is as follows a casino operator decides to change game themes on one or more EGMs such as V20D 20 EGMs. The software game themes may be located on the SDDP Server . Download management tools may be located on an Application Database Server System. One or more servers separate from the SDDP Server may contain the game theme software such as for security or redundancy purposes. The Alpha EGMs are identified on the casino floor using the BCP . A download management tool such as the BCP scheduler may be used through a menu to identify the date and time to download the game packages i.e. the game packages to send to the specific EGMs the date and time to automatically activate the games on the EGMs after the download. At the selected date and time the EGM may open communication with the Download Database. The EGM request software from the SDDP server . The SDDP server downloads the specified game information to the EGM using a secure transmission protocol such as HTTPS. The download to the EGM may occur in the background operation of the Alpha OS so that game play is not interfered with. The EGM may de activate game operation a pre determined amount of time subsequent to the last play on the EGM such as five minutes and issue a message on one of its display panels that it is temporarily offline at which point the EGM can initiate installation of the downloaded software. A record of the transmissions and corresponding activity of the EGM is relayed to a retrievable storage on the network such that a privileged user may operate the BCP to run the reports identifying the old and new games date changed and by whom. User privileges may be restricted as discussed previously to provide additional levels of security and flexibility within the system and for the casino operator or users of slot management system and download and configuration server network .

The download and configuration management server system may a plurality for example 10 EGMs through a single Cisco 2950 switch. As the number of EGMs increases the type and or number of servers switches firewalls and pipelines may be changed to accommodate higher traffic volumes and improve or avoid degradation of performance.

Discovery method to dynamically find gaming networked components using DHCP DNS LDAP and Active Directory to locate services within the gaming network that are available in a casino.

In one embodiment the exemplary process of networked component discovery may take advantage of network infrastructure available on a Windows network such as the Bally One slot management system 

An application finds a DNS server which is referred to by the network setup. The network setup may have been manual or by DHCP.

At the application then does a look up of a specific name of an LDAP server in a scope guaranteed to be at all casinos if the service is available and receives the results.

At the application queries the LDAP server for the assigned name of the resource database entry or web service entry and receives results therefrom. The entry may include the user name and password to use to connect to the database or may specify that the user is to use their own credentials.

At the application may use the information from the LDAP server to login with a user authentication web service .

At the application queries the LDAP server for the assigned name of an activity recorder and receives results therefrom and at the application connects to the activity recorder .

At the application queries the LDAP server for the assigned name of other web services and receives results therefrom and at the application connects to the web services .

At the application queries the LDAP server for the assigned name of database and receives results therefrom and at the application connects to the database .

There may be any number of DNS or LDAP servers to handle the process of networked component discovery. Also the data returned back from the LDAP or DNS servers may be different from results returned to other machines based off of information obtained from the network card connecting to the network. For example the north east portion of the casino may force all requests to a different web service than the South east portion. The LDAP server may be implemented by a third party vendor such as Microsoft or by the system vendor such as Bally Technologies . The same is true of the DNS server. The results may also be returned by the version of the software the client is able to support. For example the results may indicate a first server for version 1.0 of a protocol and a second server for version 2.0 of the same protocol.

Benefits and features of the discovery process and mechanism may include one or more of the following 

Benefit 1. Currently every server and workstation such as control station may need to be configured manually which may cause a significant workload on casino personnel. In addition the potential for mis configuration which may be the result of manual configuration may cause serious side effects including system downtime.

Benefit 2. The discovery process allows for dynamic configuration based on server availability and load. The system can report into the LDAP server the performance information about load and server availability. The LDAP server can then make decisions based on this information to route new connections to servers better able to handle the load.

Benefit 3. The discovery process allows for upgrading a small part of the casino to a new version of code and not have everyone go to it until the code has proven itself in a live environment. This provides a staged deployment capability that does not require the casino to be down during an upgrade process. It also allows for field trial capability without risking the entire casino operation.

Benefit 4. Resources can be spread throughout the casino. Not all servers need to be in the server room. There can be several closets on the floor with servers running. The servers can handle a section of the floor. This prevents a disaster in the computer room from downing the entire casino.

Benefit 5. If a closet handling a section of the floor is no longer available a different closet can then take over.

System and Method for one way delivery of notifications from server to clients using a modified UDP multicast.

In a strict client server system a server doesn t initiate communications with its clients. Instead the server responds to requests from the clients. In a strict client server system when the server has knowledge a change in a system or component of a system the server cannot notify the clients that might be interested in or need to know of the change. Similarly the server cannot notify clients of events or current status of events. One technique to overcome these issues is for the clients to poll the server.

Among other things the server maintains a database storing a plurality of tables. For the sake of clarity the plurality of tables is described below as including table and table . 

The DCM engine service may include an application programming interface suite a user interface UI notification processor and a UDP broadcast processor . The UDP broadcast processor may be simply one of various components in the DCM engine server . The UDP broadcast processor may be integrated as part of the DCM server CPU central processing unit by including executable UDP broadcast coding performing the functions as described above and utilizing accessible memory for storing information about each client such as registration information. The UDP broadcast processor may be generally responsible for sending UDP messages to the registered clients in the network. The UDP broadcast processor may send UDP messages to all registered clients which are listening to receive UDP messages on a specific port. This allows one way server to client s communications in what is otherwise a strict client to server to client architecture.

The DCM engine sends the IP address associated with the client to a database which stores the IP address. The DCM engine may also store in the database information indicative of types of notifications to be provided to the client .

The client sends a Port request message to the DCM engine . The DCM engine responds to the Port request message by providing the client with a Port number message which includes a port number. The client listens to the port identified by the port number for notifications from the DCM engine .

In some embodiments the client may register with the DCM engine as part of a boot up or log in procedure of the client . In some embodiments the client may register with the DCM engine as part as opening starting an application. In some embodiments the client may register with the DCM engine at any time. For example a user of the client might initiate registration of the client .

In some embodiments when the DCM engine wants to send out a notification the UDP broadcast processor see may query the database for a list of clients that have registered for a particular type of notification. The database replies with the list. The UDP broadcast processor then formats and sends the notification to all clients on the list using the assigned port number.

In some embodiments the client may unregister with the DCM engine as part of a shut down or log out procedure of the client . In some embodiments the client may unregister with the DCM engine as part as closing ending an application. In some embodiments the client may unregister with the DCM engine at any time. For example a user of the client might initiate unregistration of the client .

In some embodiments an EGM may be associated with a number of other EGMs to constitute a group of EGMs. In some embodiments an EGM may belong to any number of groups and in some embodiments an EGM group can be assigned to another EGM group allowing for nested collections.

Within the download and configuration management server system DCM and a client running an application such as control panel a non limiting example of which is Bally Control Panel BCP a user can associate an EGM with an EGM Collection Group. An EGM group is simply a collection of EGMs. An EGM group can contain other EGM groups i.e. nested grouping. An EGM can belong to 0 or more EGM groups.

Among other things the control panel may enable an operator user of the client and or control station to 

In some embodiments the download and configuration management server system perform dynamic configuration assignments that may be applied concurrently to respective EGMs of an EGM group along with dynamic download assignments that may be scheduled independently of the configuration assignments.

For example a new O S version download may be scheduled to occur during off peak hours for Sunday night. A configuration assignment may be scheduled to decrease the payout percentage of the bar top machines during happy hour each day of the week and a Stars and Stripes configuration can have other configuration changes when a scheduled upcoming tournament is to be sponsored.

All of these assignments may be scheduled and allows for the casino manager to look at his casino from different perspectives and manage the casino effectively.

Referring to a collection of gaming machines and grouping or associational relationships is shown. The relationships may be made by including relational coding in the control panel such as a DCM server and a user interface including a display and keyboard. By using conventional relational programming the features and capabilities of the DCM server may be extended from a single gaming machine or a floor of gaming machines so that collections and groups of gaming machines may be virtually created. For instance in shown by example 

Another group bar top or counter top configuration group includes EGM and EGM based on casino location and another group Star and Stripes group includes EGM based on the game theme.

By selectively grouping a casino operator can download software specific to gaming machines having a particular operating system O S location on the floor or game theme to name a few examples.

Method and system for providing download and configuration job progress tracking and display via host user interface.

Download and configuration capabilities in the gaming environment create considerable operational challenges. For example a download may require a considerable volume of gaming content to be transferred over the network. Many casinos are open 24 7 and consequently some casinos may require a download to take place without disrupting normal gaming activities. In order to not tax the network resources of a casino a limit on the download bandwidth may be imposed even though doing so may increase the download time. It may not be unusual for some download jobs to take 30 minutes or more. Thus a way of easily monitoring download progress would be invaluable to casino operators.

A download system may be centralized and push the data down to the gaming machines . In this case a content server see pushing the data knows the amount of data that has been downloaded at any time. However in a pull system where the gaming machines are told where to go for the data and the gaming machines are taking pulling the data from the content server the content server generally does not know the amount of data a given gaming machine has downloaded.

Until recently the gaming industry has been a collection of proprietary systems and communication protocols. In many cases a casino had to buy the entire system games controllers and backend system from one company. Most casinos would prefer to use a mix of manufacturers games on the gaming floor and then pick the best backend system that suits their needs. Until recently this was not a realistic expectation.

A few years ago several gaming entities came together and created the Gaming Standards Association GSA in order to define standardized protocols by which games gaming controllers and backend systems could communicate. The standardized protocols allows interoperability of different manufacturers equipment as well as giving casinos freedom to choose whichever manufacturers the casinos want for the various components of a gaming system. One of the GSA protocols is Game to System G2S protocol which defines the messages between a gaming machine and a backend system. G2S protocol includes messages for handling software download and configuration of the gaming machines.

The download and configuration system uses standard G2S protocols and messages. The EGM may convey information such as download progress information to the G2S Host using G2S messages . For example the EGM may use the G2S packageStatus message to convey download progress information.

The G2S Host may provide messages form the EGM to a message queue which provides the messages to a download and configuration manager DCM engine . The download and configuration manager DCM engine read messages from the message queue and processes them. The aforementioned communication chain from the EGM to the DCM engine may be implemented using message structure and protocol conforming to standard G2S and standard Microsoft Message Queues MSMQs .

The download and configuration system further includes a plurality of communication devices which may be embodied in computing devices computer systems desktop computer laptop computers etc. The communication devices may communicate with the DCM engine and may implement logic modules executable instructions software etc. that provide a user interface such as a graphical user interface. In some embodiments the communication devices and the DCM engine may have a client server architecture where the communication devices may implement a client application such as a Bally Control Panel client application that provides among other things a graphical user interface.

In a client server architecture communications between a Bally Control Panel BCP client application and the DCM engine are typically via a standard communication protocol such as simple object access protocol SOAP which is a true client server architecture where a server never initiates any communication. Therefore information like job progress info that needs to be asynchronously sent to the BCP client application cannot be sent via the normal communication channel. In some embodiments the BCP client application may poll the DCM engine for any possible notification messages. However polling is inefficient.

In some embodiments the download and configuration system is configured to allow for one way messages from the DCM engine to the BCP client application of the communication devices . The DCM engine may include a broadcast processor such as the UDP broadcast processor see to facilitate one way messages from the DCM engine to the BCP client application of the communication devices . The DCM engine may provide registered clients with one way messages which may conform to a UDP multicast message.

In one embodiment a download progress protocol used between the DCM message engine and other backend applications and or system components . The packageStatus message is converted into a proprietary one and given to the UDP broadcast processor see of the DCM engine for distribution to the Bally Control Panel BCP applications that have registered with the UDP broadcast processor to receive download configuration progress notification messages. The UDP Broadcast Processor uses a modified form of UDP multicast for distributing the notification messages to the BCP client s . This is not a true broadcast to all devices on the network which helps to minimize the bandwidth used to notify clients.

This feature provides the ability to view the percentage download progress in the Host UI part of BCP using a messaging scheme which overcomes the BCP initiated protocol used for all other messaging between BCP and DCM Client Server . The Host UI displays the progress bar based on the percentage download communicated from the gaming device downloading entity to the DCM engine. All downloading gaming devices may also send a download complete message. This information can also be used by the DCM and BCP to estimate future download time and bandwidth requirements.

The gaming environment controller may take the form of a conventional mainframe or mini computer that includes a processing unit a system memory and a system bus that couples various system components including the system memory to the processing unit . The gaming environment controller will at times be referred to in the singular herein but this is not intended to limit the embodiments to a single computing system since in typical embodiments there will be more than one computing system or other device involved.

Non limiting examples of commercially available systems include but are not limited to an 80 86 or Pentium series microprocessor from Intel Corporation U.S.A. a PowerPC microprocessor from IBM a Sparc microprocessor from Sun Microsystems Inc. a PA RISC series microprocessor from Hewlett Packard Company or a 68xxx series microprocessor from Motorola Corporation.

The drives and and their associated computer readable media provide nonvolatile storage of computer readable instructions data structures program modules and other data for the gaming environment controller . Although the depicted gaming environment controller employs hard disk optical disk and magnetic disk those skilled in the relevant art will appreciate that other types of computer readable media that can store data accessible by a computer may be employed such as magnetic cassettes flash memory cards digital video disks DVD Bernoulli cartridges RAMs ROMs smart cards etc.

Logic modules such as program modules applications etc. can be stored in the system memory such as an operating system one or more application programs such as a control panel application and or download and configuration applications including assignment scheduling and management and application assignment templates etc. Logic modules such as program modules applications etc. can be stored in the other programs or modules and program data . The system memory may also include communications programs for example player access logic .

An operator such as casino personnel can enter commands and information into the gaming environment controller through input devices such as a touch screen or keyboard and or a pointing device such as a mouse . Other input devices can include a microphone joystick game pad tablet scanner etc. These and other input devices are connected to the processing unit through an interface such as a serial port interface that couples to the system bus although other interfaces such as a parallel port a game port a wireless interface or a universal serial bus USB can be used. A monitor or other display device is coupled to the system bus via a video interface such as a video adapter. The gaming environment controller can include other output devices such as speakers printers etc.

The gaming environment controller can operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers and or devices for example the server computing system . The server computing system can be another personal computer a server another type of computer or a collection of more than one computer communicatively linked together and typically includes many or all of the elements described above for the gaming environment controller . The server computing system is logically connected to one or more of the gaming environment controllers under any known method of permitting computers to communicate for example through one or more LANs and or WANs such as the Internet. Such networking environments are well known in wired and wireless enterprise wide computer networks intranets extranets and the Internet. Other embodiments include other types of communication networks including telecommunications networks cellular networks paging networks and other mobile networks.

When used in a LAN networking environment the gaming environment controller is connected to the LAN through an adapter or network interface communicatively linked to the system bus . When used in a WAN networking environment the gaming environment controller may include a modem or other device such as the network interface for establishing communications over the WAN . The modem is shown in as communicatively linked between the interface and the WAN .

In a networked environment program modules application programs data or portions thereof can be stored in the server computing system . In the depicted embodiment the gaming environment controller is communicatively linked to the server computing system through the LANs and or WAN for example with TCP IP middle layer network protocols. However other similar network protocol layers are used in other embodiments such as User Datagram Protocol UDP . Those skilled in the relevant art will readily recognize that the network connections shown in are only some examples of establishing communication links between computers and other links may be used including wireless links.

The server computing system includes server applications for the routing of instructions programs data and agents between the gaming machines and the gaming environment controller . For example the server applications may include conventional server applications such as WINDOWS NT 13.0 Server and or WINDOWS 2000 Server available from Microsoft Corporation in Redmond Wash. Additionally or alternatively the server applications can include any of a number of commercially available Web servers such as INTERNET INFORMATION SERVICE from Microsoft Corporation and or IPLANET from Netscape America On Line AOL . The server applications may include applications for interfacing with a control panel application. The server applications may also include applications for downloading applications structured data data etc. to gaming machines . The server applications may also include applications for configuring gaming machines such as by setting various operational parameters of the gaming machines .

The server computing system may also include an assignment validator . Among other things the assignment validator may comprise an ordered listing of executable instructions for implementing logical functions. In particular the assignment validator may include logic for among other things validating a download assignment and or validating a configuration assignment. In other embodiments the assignment validator may comprise an ordered listing of executable instructions for implementing logical functions and may be implemented at gaming environment controller .

The gaming machines may include game stations not shown such as but not limited to one or more electronic gaming machines poker tables one or more blackjack tables roulette tables keno tables craps tables etc. The gaming machines may include one or more sensors detectors input devices output devices actuators and or controllers such as programmed a microprocessor DSP ASIC and or Field Programmable Gate Array FPGA or the like. The controllers may execute one or more gaming applications.

In some embodiments a casino a manager may schedule when assignments such as but not limited to download assignments and or configuration assignments occur. Any number of assignments may be applied to an EGM or gaming machine . With this flexibility comes a potential for sending conflicting or contradictory assignments.

An example would be that a bank of gaming machines may be scheduled to receive a new game theme to add to the list of games a player can choose from. However the new game theme may require that the gaming machines also contain a specific version of the O S in order to support the new game theme. The assignment validator may among other things validate the download assignment of the new game theme and may provide an indication of whether the game theme requires an O S download that has not yet been scheduled.

The assignment validator saves the casino manager the headache of downloading code that would not be able to either install and or execute correctly once installed.

The assignment validator may validate a download assignment and or may validate a configuration assignment.

The assignment validator validates a download assignment and calculates the chances of its success based on the current information. The assignment validator verifies if the download assignment before the download assignment commences downloading to the gaming machines . The assignment validator verifies whether the download assignment will apply the changes successfully on the gaming machines at the execution time of the download assignment. In addition the assignment validator may inform the user about any reasons that would cause download assignment to fail. Validation checks that may be performed for download assignments may include 

The assignment validator validates a configuration assignment and may calculate based at least on the current information the chances of success of the configuration assignment. The assignment validator may verify whether the configuration assignment will successfully apply changes on the gaming machines at the execution time of the configuration assignment. The assignment validator may inform the user about any reasons that would cause the configuration assignment to fail. Validation checks that may be performed for configurations assignments may include 

With in some cases thousands of possible configuration options that may be modified and the way a casino manager may want to manage their floor the potential for conflicting configurations may frequently occur. The assignment validator helps the manager in planning floor configurations.

Gaming machine configuration changes such as denomination reel speed game volume wagers per line and number of available lines and content download changes may be occur on a pre defined time based schedule called a profile. A user such as slot manager or other authorized personnel may use a control panel See to among other things select a gaming machine that is to be changed select the configuration or content that should be changed select the values for the configuration or the game theme to be changed and the time and date profile for the change s . The user may also use the control panel to submit an assignment with the profile to a server which may then implement that profile driven set of changes. A profile driven configuration change assignment or instruction set may include a schedule and a set of machines assigned to that schedule.

For example a slot manager may want to eliminate all penny and nickel denominations from games every Friday night at 5 pm and then add back the nickel denominations on Saturday morning at 9 am but continue to eliminate all penny denominations. The slot manager would create a time based profile that would affect that change precisely at 5 P.M. on every Friday and at 9 A.M. on Saturday. This profile could be created and implemented in advance for one or more machines and then set to run.

In a typical casino there may be several technical and operational challenges to be overcome for creating a configuration change profile that may be executed a wide variety of device types.

First the user might not be able set absolute values for configuration changes when some gaming machines or devices handle or implement the configuration change in different ways. For example if the user wants to set the reel spin speed on a gaming machine to a low reel speed that configuration setting value may be completely different on a Bally machine compared to an IGT machine. A Bally machine may have a scale of 1 5 for reel speed with 1 being slow and 5 being fast compared to an IGT machine that has a scale of 1 10 with 1 being slow and 10 being fast. Instructing the system to change the reel speed to high across all machines on the floor would require a different configuration value for reel speed on a Bally machine and an IGT machine.

Most of the profile driven changes may instruct the machine to change to a specific value that corresponds to a low medium or high setting. In some embodiments profile driven changes may instruct the machine to change to a relative value such as a low medium or high setting and the machine may translate the relative value to a specific value such as 3 . In some embodiments profile driven changes may instruct the machine to change to a relative value such as a low medium or high setting and the machine may retrieve a specific value corresponding to the relative value from a database.

Second because in a typical casino there are different machines from different manufacturers on the floor and each machine may use a different scale or value range for some configurable options and the type of machine or its settings may have changed between the time the profile was created and the change occurs then in some embodiments the machine is interrogated for the machine s current configuration at the time of the configuration change. Interrogation at or near the time of the configuration change is one way learning how to make the change in the correct way by knowing exactly how the machine is configured at the time of the change. Thus the system may be able to provide a dynamic machine inventory at the time that a configuration change is to occur.

Third there may be a table such as a lookup table or translation table for each game theme manufacturer that correlates the defined generic gaming machine settings such as low medium and high settings to a specific gaming machine setting value.

For example in the case of setting reel speed a profile driven configuration change may show a generic gaming machine setting of low medium or high over a time period for one or more gaming machines. These gaming machines may be from a combination of different manufacturers that have a different setting value corresponding to a medium reel speed. When the system implements a profile driven configuration change the system may interrogate the gaming machines to determine among other things the respective manufacturer and the respective game theme for each of the interrogated gaming machines. In some embodiments based at least on knowledge of the manufacturer of a respective gaming machine system the system may refer to a lookup table all in real time and lookup a reel speed value corresponding to the desired generic gaming machine setting for medium reel speed.

As another example a user may want to configure one or more of the gaming machines to have a high reel speed on Friday nights. On one Friday night a gaming machine may have a first game theme such as a Bally Winning Times game and then on next Friday night the gaming machine may have a second game theme such as a Bally Fixin 2 Win game where the first and the second game themes have different respective reel speed value ranges. By interrogating the gaming machine before reconfiguring the gaming machine the system may know the current game theme of the gaming machine and thereby determine the appropriate specific gaming machine setting value that corresponds to the desired generic gaming machine setting.

A profile driven configuration change may work on a variety of games in the casino or arcade market for class 2 or 3 lottery or central determination.

Referring to a command and control server is communicatively coupled to a plurality of gaming machines individually referenced as and collectively referenced as . The command and control server is communicatively coupled to a database which stores a number of profiles and may also store a number of lookup tables associating gaming machines and values of specific operational parameters to generic settings that may have a relative value.

A casino having a command and control server which may also include or be embodied in a download and configuration server system may desire to implement profile driven gaming machines or other devices configurations. Among other things the command and control server may implement profile driven gaming machines configurations based at least on knowledge of one or more of the following 

The volume profile has a horizontal axis and a vertical axis . The horizontal axis is in units of time in this case a unit represents twelve hours. The temporal length of the volume profile may be set a determined value in this case a five and one half days are shown from Wednesday at noon to Monday at midnight. Also the duration of any setting can be set to a predetermined length where durations of different settings may be the same or different.

The vertical axis shows the value of the generic gaming machine setting that is to be set on the gaming machines relative to time. The vertical axis is in units of generic gaming machine setting for audible volume which are low volume medium volume and high volume. While the range of the vertical axis is over three units of generic gaming machine settings in volume profile other profiles may have wider or smaller ranges corresponding to more or fewer units of generic gaming machine settings respectively.

It should be noted that the values of the generic gaming machine setting are not specific values such as a specific number like 3. Instead the values of the generic gaming machine setting are relative values such as low medium or high level. This is done because each gaming machine or game theme can have a different definition of low volume. For example a Bally machine has a volume scale of 0 10. An IGT machine might have a volume scale of 0 100 and the command and control system would need to know what to set the volume to when instructed to set the volume to low based on what is on the machine when the change is due to occur.

The minimum wager profile shows a minimum wager level that may be assigned to one or more gaming machines as a function of time. The minimum wager profile has a horizontal axis and a vertical axis . Just like the volume profile the horizontal axis is in units of time. Similar to the volume profile the vertical axis shows relative setting values instead of specific setting values.

The vertical axis shows the value of the generic gaming machine setting that is to be set on the gaming machines relative to time. The vertical axis is in units of generic gaming machine setting for minimum wager which are low minimum wager medium minimum wager and high minimum wager. While the range of the vertical axis is over three units of generic gaming machine settings in exemplary profile other profiles may have wider or smaller ranges corresponding to more or fewer units of generic gaming machine settings respectively. A profile with generic gaming machine settings such as low medium and high may be used to set among others the following operational gaming machine parameters 

A profile with absolute or specific gaming machine settings may be used to set among others the following operational gaming machine parameters 

In the case of an absolute configuration like denomination there is no need for a low medium or high level. The profile can instruct the machine to convert to a specific denomination.

In one embodiment the command and control server may use a look up table when a profile driven change instruction set is scheduled to be made. The look up table may include information about each gaming machine or other devices at the casino. In some embodiments there may be multiple look up tables where different tables are associated with different operational parameters of gaming machines or other devices.

Table 2 is an exemplary lookup table for volume settings. When a volume change is requested by a profile driven schedule the command and control server may interrogate a gaming machine to obtain the gaming machine s characteristics. The command and control server may use a lookup table such as Table 2 which may be stored in the database to implement a profile driven change. The command and control server may use the lookup table to determine the value of game volume setting corresponding to the generic gaming machine setting of the profile. For instance the command and control sever may attempt to change the game volume on floor machines to high on Friday at noon. If the game volume change was to be made on a gaming machine such as WMS Bluebird Slant that was running the Top Gun game theme then the game volume level setting would be 88 as shown in Table 2 above.

Typically there are hundreds of cabinets on the floor of a casino. In some situations it may be desired to change the configuration of each cabinet. The command and control sever may determine a specific game volume setting that corresponds to a generic gaming machine value specified in a profile driven change by using a lookup table such as game volume Table 2. Using Table 2 the command and control sever may determine the specific game volume setting for a gaming machine based on knowledge of the gaming machine s manufacturer cabinet type game theme.

Slot managers and or manufacturers may create lookup tables on installation of the command and control sever and the lookup tables may be changed if new gaming machines and or game themes are introduced into the casino. In some embodiments the lookup tables may be changed if there are new generic gaming machine settings such as going from three level settings e.g. low medium high to five level settings e.g. very low low medium high very high .

Another example of a profile driven change would be minimum wager. In this case an operator wants to control the amount of the minimum wager that a customer makes on a gaming machine. One way to control the amount of the minimum wager on a slot title is by setting slot title to have a number of lines and setting a minimum number of coins to be wager per line.

Here is an example of a lookup table for minimum wager. In this case only Bally and WMS are show for one of each of their games but other manufacturers would be added as they are connected to the command and control system.

Referring to the command and control server may use G2S to communicate with the gaming machines and has the capability to interrogate the gaming machines . From the interrogation of a gaming machine the command and control server may lean many or all of the gaming machine s settings including game theme current denominations current game volume current game reel speed current wager options and line options current host settings and almost all other machine settable parameters. The command and control server may request and get these values in real time.

In one embodiment a user or an external system may specify a profile to modify some or any of a gaming machine s available options or meta options like Minimum wager. A wager profile input file which may be used to set wager amount can easily be formatted to specify a series of times and a list of options and values for any options as shown below 

When the command and control server executes the profile command and control server may use a table to resolve what each item means on a per EGM basis. The table may be generic and may include columns for OptionName OptionValue G2S DeviceClass G2S OptionGroup G2S Optionitem and G2SOptionValue.

When the command and control server creates a job the command and control server may look up the Optionitem Name in the table for the given EGM s theme paytable and denomination. If one or more matching rows exists then the option may be mapped to the actual G2S options and the command and control server sends the appropriate command for example MinBetAmount becomes Bal MinBetPerLine and Bal MinNumberOfLines . If no rows match the command and control server may still send the command if it happens to match a actual G2SOption for that game. Like BAL GameSpeed . If there is still no match then an error may be logged.

In addition wildcards in the lookup table may be supported which may reduce the number of rows. For instance if the same thing is done for every pay table then instead of having rows for each pay table we would just put a in that column.

In some embodiments a lookup table may include a manufacture column. In that case the lookup table may support meta options that may be displayed in the control panel and may allow users to make generic assignments that work across disparate manufacturers. These meta options may be displayed in standard configuration wizards as well as the special profile wizard.

The control and command server may use XML data in the format above to build a visual representation of the profile curve as shown in figures above.

In one embodiment the operations represented by the method can be implemented by computer readable instructions encoded on or otherwise stored on a computer readable medium and executable by a processor. For example some operations of the method can be implemented in software stored in database of the command and control server and executable by a processor such as processing unit .

In one embodiment one or more of the gaming machines may include a processing unit similar to processing unit a storage unit or memory similar to system memory and a bus similar to bus coupling the respective processor and storage unit of the gaming machine. The storage unit may also include a hard disk drive similar to hard disk drive for reading from and writing to a hard disk an optical disk drive similar to an optical disk drive for reading from and writing to removable optical disks similar to optical disks and a magnetic disk drive similar to magnetic disk drive for reading from and writing to removable magnetic disks similar to magnetic disks . Thus corresponding operations of the method that are related to the gaming machines can also be implemented in software or other computer readable instructions stored in the storage unit of the gaming machine and executable by the processor of the gaming machine .

At a block the command and control center receives and stores in the storage unit s such as database profile driven configuration changes or other profile based requests to change configuration settings that are input by the user. As previously explained above the information specified in the profile driven configuration changes may include an identification of particular gaming machines that are assigned to the requests for configuration changes as well as including generalized and or specific values for configuration settings.

At a block a processor which may be similar to processing unit of the command and control center examines the stored profile s to determine whether a configuration change is due. In one embodiment the processor of the command and control center includes or is coupled to a scheduler that is adapted to examine the stored profile s according to a time schedule such as a periodic frequency of hourly every 12 hours every 24 hours or other timeframe configurable by the user. The scheduler repeatedly examines the stored profile s according to the time schedule until a configuration change is determined to be due at a block .

If the configuration change is determined to be due at the block the processor of the command and control server at a block generates a list of gaming machines that are to receive configuration changes. In one embodiment the list of gaming machines can be generated from the gaming machines specified in the profile.

At a block the processor of the command and control server chooses a first gaming machine from the list. In one embodiment the command and control server then interrogates or otherwise queries that first gaming machine at a block for current specific values for its configuration settings e.g. manufacturer cabinet game theme reel speed current denomination game volume wager and line options etc. . Obtaining the current specific values for configuration settings at the block for each of the gaming machines enables the command and control server to generate an updated inventory of the gaming machines and their current configuration settings. For instance certain gaming machines may have been replaced removed or may have had their configuration settings modified between the time that the profile was created and when a configuration change specified in the profile is due. Interrogating the gaming machine s with queries at the block enables the processor of the command and control server to determine whether the proposed configuration settings specified in the profile are still appropriate and to make revisions if appropriate.

In one embodiment the gaming machine s can provide their current configuration settings at the block independently of a query from the command and control server . For instance rather than specifically interrogating the gaming machine s whether via a global interrogation or selective individual interrogations one embodiment can provide one or more gaming machines that report their current configuration settings to the command and control server according to a time schedule and or in response to some condition being met.

At a block the processor of the command and control server accesses or otherwise identifies one or more lookup tables such as the Table 2 and Table 3 above that have entries for the gaming machine . At a block the processor of the command and control server uses the look up table s to match the information specified in the profile e.g. the generalized values of the configuration settings indicated in the profile driven configuration changes to specific values of current configuration settings. With this use of the look up tables the processor of the command and control server is thus able to provide a translation from the generalized values to specific values for configuration settings.

At a block the command and control server generates a configuration change command and sends the generated command to the gaming machine . In one embodiment the generated command instructs the target gaming machine to change to the new configuration setting value upon receipt of the command. Thus the command and control server can send the generated command to the target gaming machine just before the time frame when the change is to take effect thereby directly controlling the timing of the change. In another embodiment the command and control server can send the generated command to the target gaming machine at any suitable length of time e.g. at a greater lead time prior to the scheduled configuration change so that the target gaming machine can set itself to run or otherwise perform the configuration change when the change is due.

In some situations the target gaming machine may have credits that are due or otherwise currently engaged in a game with a player when the configuration change command is received. Accordingly at a block for one embodiment the configuration change is not performed immediately. Rather for example the command and control server can continue to send re send the configuration change command to the target gaming machine if the target gaming machine has credits that are due or is otherwise currently engaged in a game with a player until the gaming machine is ready to perform the configuration change at a block .

The operations described above in blocks are repeated if the processor of the command and control server determines at a block that there are additional gaming machines in the generated list that are scheduled for configuration changes. When there are no such other gaming machines scheduled for configuration changes then the method reverts back to the block to examine the stored profiles for upcoming configuration changes that are coming due.

Electronic gaming machines may combine hardware and software to deliver gaming applications to customers. The software may include operating system and game software both of which have configurable parameters or options. Each configurable option has a variable name and one or more valid values that can be set only valid values can be set in the software. Table 4 below includes examples of configurable options valid option values and the option variable name 

Typically available configurable options valid option values and option variable names comprise a set that is unique to each gaming machine manufacturer s operating system and game software. Further each of the game themes from a single manufacturer can have a completely different configurable option list with unique option values and option variable names so there is a unique set of this data for each manufacturer and game combination.

The operation of the gaming machine may be changed by making changes to the configurable options within the permitted or valid configurable option values. For example the game volume may be changed to low by changing the G Vol option variable to or changed to high by changing the G Vol option variable to 9. The game volume is controlled by a single configurable option just as the Bill Stacker Limit or wager Per Line is. Changing those individual configurable options to one of the valid option values has an affect on the gaming machine .

In some situations to efficiently change configurations on a gaming floor the following issues may need to be overcome 

First for many gaming floor changes casino directors might not think in terms of absolute values of configuration options casino directors may think in relative terms such as low medium and high. As an example casino directors may think of game volume as low medium and high. On a busy Friday night casino directors may want the volume on all electronic gaming machines to be set to high but casino directors may want to have the game volume set to low after midnight. Casino directors may want to set options like game volume minimum wager game speed and other game settings to a subjective or relative value and the casino directors may think of the functioning of gaming machines in relative terms fast game slow game game volume loud etc. even though operational parameters of gaming machines may be set to absolute values.

Second Casino directors may want to make changes to the floor as a whole not to individual gaming machines. Casino directors may want to set the entire floor game volume to high with one command. However as previously described the game floor typically includes of a wide variety of gaming machines from different manufacturers and gaming machines such as and may be running different game themes. In addition one manufacturer s valid option values and or option variable names may be inconsistent with another manufacturer s valid option values and or option variable names and a manufacturer s valid option values and or option variable names may be inconsistent across different game themes. For example see Table 5 below.

In one embodiment the aforementioned issues among other issues may be resolved by employing a meta option. A meta option is a configuration option that does not use an absolute option value as the setting but instead uses a generic or subjective value such as 

In one embodiment a meta option may be one way of identifying a configuration option s change that is associated by business logic to a set of pre defined configuration option values. Before a meta option change occurs the meta option associated to specific configuration option values is done and is stored in a database such as database in schema. As one example a meta option may be a volume change of the gaming machines .

Table 6 shows a meta option volume look up table. In the meta option volume look up table generic or subjective volume settings are associated with specific valid configuration option values.

In one embodiment a casino manager may set a meta option volume change to set all game volumes to a desired subjective volume level. The command and control server may use meta option volume look up table which may be stored in database to find valid configuration names and options e.g. option variable name and option setting associated with a subjective volume level for various gaming machines .

For example if the meta option change sets the volume of the gaming machines to low the command and control server may interrogate the gaming machines to determine the current floor configuration e.g. number and types of gaming machines current game themes etc. When the command and control server interrogates the gaming machine the command and control server determines that the gaming machine is an Aristocrat Queen of the Nile game. The command and control server may use the meta option volume look up table to determine the valid configuration name for gaming machine is Game Vol Level and the valid configuration option corresponding to a subjective volume setting of low is 2. When the command and control server interrogates another gaming machine such as gaming machine the command and control server may detect that gaming machine is a Bally gaming machine with a game theme of Winning Times. The command and control server may use the meta option volume look up table to determine that the G Vol variable of gaming machine should be set to 1. 

Another use of meta options among others is setting a minimum wager level. Setting the minimum wager level may be accomplished by changing the number of lines and or the wager per line that define the minimum number of credits that can be wagered on a single game play. A meta option minimum wager look up table is constructed and includes types of gaming machine and game themes. Typically a casino may have gaming machines from multiple manufacturers and in that case the meta option minimum wager look up table typically includes every type of gaming machine at the casino for all of the manufacturers. Table 7 below is an exemplary meta option minimum wager look up table 

In the meta option minimum wager look up table generic or subjective minimum wager betting settings are associated with specific valid configuration option values.

In one embodiment a casino manager may set a meta option minimum wager change to set all game minimum wagers to a desired subjective minimum wager level. The command and control server may meta option minimum wager look up table which may be stored in database to find valid configuration names and options e.g. option variable name and option setting associated with a subjective minimum wager level e.g. low minimum bet medium minimum bet high minimum bet for various gaming machines .

For example if the meta option change sets the minimum wager of the gaming machines to low minimum bet the command and control server may interrogate the gaming machines to determine the current floor configuration e.g. number and types of gaming machines current game themes etc. Based on an interrogation of one of the gaming machines the command and control server may determine that the interrogated gaming machine is an IGT Fort Knox 94 Penny Game. The command and control server may use the meta option minimum wager look up table to determine that valid configuration names for the gaming machine are Bet and Lines which have valid configuration options corresponding to the low minimum bet setting of 2 and 1 respectively. When the command and control server interrogates another gaming machine such as gaming machine the command and control server may detect that gaming machine is a Bally Winning Times 90 Nickel game. The command and control server may use the meta option minimum wager look up table to determine that the B Lines variable and the Num Lines variable of gaming machine should be set to 2 and 9 respectively.

Second the meta option is one practical way to set an option across a diverse floor with machines that 1 have different valid option values and 2 name the option variable in different ways.

Third the meta option the setting of floor wide parameters or global parameters that are not necessarily defined by one single configuration option. In one embodiment a meta option may be nested into another meta option. For example a nested meta option may include a meta option volume change and a meta option minimum wager change applied globally and or across a floor of the casino.

At a meta option is defined. The meta option is the change that may be applied to one or more electronic gaming machines. Examples of meta options are volume level slot game reel speed game mix and minimum wager.

At the meta option values are established. In some embodiments the meta option values may be generic subjective values. In some embodiments the meta option values may be relative values. Examples of the meta option values include but are not limited to low medium and high or slow or fast or of current value.

At configuration options for a gaming machine and game themes combination are compiled into a list table. For each of the configuration options valid configuration option values and variable names may also be compiled into the list table.

are selected to be changed on each electronic gaming machine to achieve the desired change effect. For example if the meta option change is to set all volumes to low the specific configuration option may be game volume. If the meta option change is to set the speed of all slot game themes to fast the specific configuration option may be reel speed. If the meta option change is to set all minimum wagers to high the specific configuration options may be wagers per line and number of lines.

At a meta option look up table that cross references the meta option values e.g. low medium and high of the meta option to variable names and to valid option values for each manufacturer and game theme combination.

At the meta option look up table is committed to the database for future use by an application like a profile driven gaming machine configurator.

Referring to a first table definition schema is logically coupled to a second table definition schema . The first table definition schema and the second table definition may be part of a meta option look up table stored in database .

The database may take a variety of forms including but not limited to a structured query language SQL database. A database schema of database defines a meta option look up table.

A gaming environment may include a download and configuration management DCM engine. A DCM engine may command and control of a download and configuration system. Clients command and control the DCM system by consuming using the application programming interface API extended by the DCM engine. This API is exposed to clients via many different protocols UDP SOAP TCP Named Pipes custom protocols which are all callable at the same time. This allows the DCM system to interface with many different systems technologies and platforms.

A DCM engine facilitates communication between the G2S Host DCM system Databases manages the execution of assignments and their status and contains most of the system s business logic.

A DCM engine may be a Component of SOA architecture which delivers solutions to business agility and with flexibility. Because this service exists independently of one another as well as of the underlying IT infrastructure they can be combined and reused with maximum flexibility.

The functionality of a DCM engine may be made available for access consumption by other systems clients. One goal among others of the consumption process is to deliver new dynamic applications that enable increased productivity and enhanced insight into business performance. Users can consume the composed service through a number of avenues including Web portals rich clients various business applications complex services or cross functional business processes.

A DCM engine is well defined by XML messages invokable Interfaces. Each interaction is independent of each and every other interaction and the interconnect protocols of the communicating devices i.e. the infrastructure components that determine the communication system do not affect the interfaces . Because interfaces are platform independent a client from any device using any operating system in any language can use the service.

Referring to a networked system may include a download and configuration management DCM engine server in accordance with one or more embodiments. DCM Engine may run on a collection of technologies such as SOAP XML. Interactions between a communicating system and the DCM Engine may be done by XML messages through SOAP protocol. The DCM Engine may communicate to a G2S Host and with various databases .

Due to the decoupled nature of the networked system the DCM engine may maintain DCM system state information during processing and system interactions. The DCM engine may maintain DCM system state information by persisting state information using a key value dictionary. The DCM engine includes a DCM engine state management that among other things functions to persist and maintain the state of DCM operations even after a communication failure.

The DCM Engine which may run as a Microsoft Windows service may be able to run by itself on a separate server. In some embodiments the server running the DCM engine does not run any G2S Hosts or any Databases. In some embodiments the DCM Engine may be physically disconnected from the G2S Host and may run on its own processes and may remotely connect to the G2S host which may run on its own processes. In that case the DCM engine may maintain state information about the status of scheduled DCM assignments. Whenever there is a change in the status of a Download Install or Configuration on a respective gaming machine the G2S Host is updated by the respective gaming machine through G2S messages which are based on the operations. Thus the status of the various operations is known via the G2S messages which may be validated. The G2S messages may be stored to a database by the G2Shosts for persistence see . Based on the statuses of the operations the messages get updated on a DCM Message Queue and corresponding databases. From this DCM Message Queue the messages are read and as per the various operations. Status updates that correspond to the messages read by the DCM message queue are sent to end users or business process which invoked them.

Referring to in the case of a power or communication failure the DCM Engine might not be able to communicate with the G2S Host . When the power or communication link has been restored the DCM Engine receives the status notifications from the various databases . The DCM engine may broadcast status updates to registered end users and or business processes in order to update registered end users and or business processes as to the status of DCM jobs such as download jobs and configuration jobs.

Among other things the DCM Engine processes each message from a DCM Job status message queue. The DCM Engine identifies a respective Job ID from a respective message and gets assignment or job bundle information from the database . The DCM Engine parses through the assignment or job bundle identifying the next assignment or job to be run which may depend on the on error conditions of the previous assignment or job. The DCM engine includes a Work Flow module that then calls a JobCreator passing in a new Job ID that has to be executed. This cycle is executed for each job in that job bundle or assignment until all the jobs are executed.

The DCM Engine offers intelligence that manages multiple client requests to ensure that execution of requests are guaranteed efficient and prioritized based on a predetermined priority schedule.

Casino personal may use an assignment creator modifier application for creating assignment templates for jobs such as jobs for downloads and configurations. The assignment creator modifier application may be stored on a control station or client or a server such as casino management system server . The assignment creator modifier application may have a client server architecture.

An assignment template is a reusable Download and Configuration Manager DCM assignment describing what G2S download or configuration options are to be used.

An assignment template allows the user of the DCM system to save commonly created assignments as reusable assignment templates for later use which saves time because the user does not need to routinely create common assignments.

The assignment creator modifier application reduces the complexity associated with creating assignments with advanced configurations which require additional effort in comparison with common assignments. An assignment template may apply to any download and configuration assignment for any G2S enabled gaming device regardless of the manufacturer.

The following example demonstrates the use of an Assignment Template named Fast Reel Speed . The saved Assignment Template has been reopened and becomes an assignment under construction . Now changes can be made before it is submitted for approval and executed.

Referring to a top level window or screen of an assignment creator modifier graphical user interface GUI is shown. Such window or screen may be displayed on a display at a control station or client . Other windows or screens shown in respectively may also be displayed on a display at a control station or client .

When an assignment creator modifier application first loads the user e.g. casino personnel is presented with a graphical user interface that includes an input box Name and an input box Description . The user provides an assignment name or identifier in the input box and provides information describing the assignment template being created using input box . Among other things the user may describe the function of the assignment template and any other information that the user may decide to input.

The assignment creator modifier application GUI also includes a save button a back button a next button and a cancel button . The back button and next button are used to navigate between screens of the assignment creator modifier application GUI. In screen the back button is inoperative because screen is the top level screen of the assignment creator modifier application GUI and is shaded to signify inoperability.

The save button is used to save a copy of the current assignment template being created and the cancel button causes the assignment creator modifier application to quit. If the current assignment template being created has not yet been saved then information provided by the user is not saved if the cancel button is selected. If the current assignment template has been saved then information provided since the most recent save is not saved if the cancel button is selected. The assignment creator modifier application GUI includes a box Version that displays the current version of the assignment being created.

Referring to the lower level window or screen of the assignment creator modifier graphical user interface GUI is shown. The screen allows a user to choose which options may be set by the assignment template being created. A window displays selectable options for the assignment template being created. The selectable options may have a tree structure where the branches are expandable and collapsible.

The user selects an option and clicks on an add button . The selected option is then displayed in a window . In some embodiments once an option has been selected the option is no longer displayed in window . The user may de select any one of the selected options by using a remove button . The user selects the option to be de selected and actuates by for example clicking on the remove button . After the remove button has been actuated the option for de selection is removed from window .

In some embodiments once an option has been added to window the option is no longer displayed in window . Similarly once an option has been removed from window the option is only displayed in window .

Referring to the lower level window or screen of the assignment creator modifier graphical user interface GUI is shown. The screen allows a user to change the value for the configuration options which remain in the assignment. The user selects one of the selected options in window . In window the user sets a value for the option.

Referring to the lower level window or screen of the assignment creator modifier graphical user interface GUI is shown. The screen allows the user review the completed assignment as applied in a window . If the user decides to change assignment as applied the user may use back button to navigate to the appropriate screen.

Referring to the lower level window or screen of the assignment creator modifier graphical user interface GUI is shown. The screen includes a window that allows the user to review the completed and applied assignment. Typically a supervisor reviews the current and applied assignment template. The window includes a finish button which is used to save the completed and applied assignment.

Another novel feature when scheduling an assignment is that one can make the assignment temporary . This is a mechanism by which a DCM operator can schedule option changes that may be in effect for a limited period of time. When the time expires the system automatically runs a job to restore the EGM s options to their previous state. This saves the operator from having to schedule two jobs and also relieves them of the burden of knowing what to do to restore the previous state.

One example of the use of the GUI display panel would be to Configure the attract sound for the Halloween weekend to be spooky across many game themes. When the override expires the system may restore the sound to each of them correctly without the operator needing to know in each case what that value was. This is accomplished in part by keeping track of each option change the system makes in the DCM engine programming such as with modules for an Option Item Assigned Value and Configuration.

At a user of the client creates an assignment bundle. The assignment bundle may be a collection of jobs. In some situations the various jobs in the assignment bundle may be processed sequentially and in other situations some or all of the various jobs may be processed concurrently. In some embodiments the user may define the sequence in which the jobs are processed. In other embodiments logic of the download and configuration management server system may define the sequence in which the jobs are processed.

Normally the client is running assignment bundle software that presents an assignment bundle graphical user interface and which may be integrated in the control panel . When an assignment bundle application first loads the user e.g. casino personnel is presented with a graphical user interface for creating an assignment bundle.

Referring to a top level window or screen of an assignment bundle graphical user interface GUI is shown. Such window or screen may be displayed on a display at the client via the host user interface of the client . A window shows possible jobs that may be included in an assignment bundle such as Download Install Various Options to be configured on the EGM s . A window shows jobs that have been selected for inclusion in the assignment bundle. Add button allows the user to add one of the possible jobs to the number of selected jobs . Remove button allows the user to delete one of the selected jobs and the deleted job is then listed in the possible jobs . The user may specify an execution sequence for the selected jobs .

The assignment bundle may be applied to multiple gaming devices on the floor. Workflow may be configured in such way that once the DCM Engine picks up a job from a Queue and the assignment has been processed on the EGM the DCM Engine may determine to pick the next job from the same Queue to be processed on those EGMS. Typically the DCM Engine may determine to pick the next job based on the status of the current job.

At the assignment bundle is submitted for processing at a scheduled time which is typically after the time the assignment bundle was submitted but the scheduled time may be the same as the time at which the assignment bundle was submitted. The assignment bundle may be submitted to the download and configuration management server system .

At a job of the assignment bundle is executed. In some embodiments the DCM engine executes the jobs in accordance with the predetermined sequence.

At the G2S host sends a message to the gaming device where the gaming device is the target of the current or immediately preceding job being executed at the DCM engine . For example the current job being executed by the DCM engine may be an assignment to download content to the gaming device and the G2S host may send the message while the job to download content is still being executed at the DCM engine or the G2S host may send the message once the job to download content is no longer being executed at the DCM engine .

At the gaming device applies the current job. For example the gaming device may begin downloading content from a content server. Similarly the gaming device may apply configuration changes which causes the gaming device to be reconfigured.

At the gaming device returns status information of the gaming device . For example the status information may indicate an amount of content that has been downloaded or current configuration settings etc.

At the G2S host receives a message from the gaming device that includes the status information. The status information is provided to the DCM engine .

At the DCM engine determines whether the current job has been performed success or is being performed successfully. If the determination is no then the process continues at where the DCM engine cancels the current job. In some situations if one job in an assignment bundle is cancelled then all subsequent jobs of the assignment bundle that have not yet been executed by the DCM engine are also cancelled. In some situations if one job in an assignment bundle is cancelled then subsequent jobs of the assignment bundle that have not yet been executed by the DCM engine may still be executed. The DCM engine notifies the client of the failure of the job and then at the client notifies the user of the failed job.

On the other hand if the determination at is yes the DCM engine notifies the client of the success of the job and then at the client notifies the user of the successful completion of the job.

In addition the determination at is yes then at the DCM engine determines whether there are any more jobs in the assignment bundle. If the determination is no then the DCM engine notifies the client of the success of the assignment bundle and then at the client notifies the user of the successful completion of the assignment bundle.

On the other hand if the determination at is no the process continues at where the DCM engine begins execution of a job of the assignment bundle that has not yet been executed.

Referring to a user authorization Authweb system is shown and which may be a Service Oriented security system. The architecture of the Authweb system follows Service Oriented Architecture SOA which offers the advantage of being interoperable with various systems and technologies.

The Authweb system includes a web server such as an internet information server and a security store that is communicatively coupled to the web server . The web server hosts a user authorization web service and caches user security credentials in a memory for current user security sessions .

The security store stores user security credentials for users of the Authweb system . Among other things the security store provides requested user security credentials to the web server . The security store may also determine whether a logon request is valid based at least on information provided in the logon request.

The security store may take a variety of forms including one or more servers running a version of Microsoft Windows operating system one or more databases one or more servers running a version of UNIX operating system or Linux operating system etc. In the embodiment shown in the security store includes one or more servers running a version of Microsoft Windows operating system which comprise a Windows server domain and the web server communicates with the Windows server domain via lightweight directory access protocol LDAP .

The web server is communicatively coupled to a DCM engine and a control station or computing device or the like running an application such as a control panel which may take the form of a Bally control panel. Communications between the control panel and the user authorization web service may be via a communication protocol such as hypertext transfer protocol over secure socket layer HTTPS as may be the communications between the DCM engine and the user authorization web service .

A user may use the control panel to log into a system and or the DCM engine . The user authorization web service may be a gateway to the system and or the DCM engine . The user authorization web service receives login information from the control panel are retrieves a security credential that corresponds to the login information. The retrieved security credential is cached in a memory of the web server . Upon successfully logging in a security session is established at the user authorization web service . From time to time the user authorization web service may use the cached security credential and may maintain the session of the control panel and or create a new session.

The User Authorization System offers a single role based authorization security solution for multiple systems platforms and technologies.

Referring to a logon process is shown. A client application such as a Bally control panel provides logon credentials such as a user name and password to a user authorization web service . The user authorization web service sends a security query to a security store . The security query may include information indicative of the logon credentials and or may include the security credentials themselves.

The security store sends a security response to the user authorization web service . The security response may carry security credentials and or information indicative of whether allow the application to logon. In some embodiments the security store may determine whether a logon request from the application is valid based at least on information carried by the security query . For example the security store may compare security credentials carried by the security query with valid security credentials stored in the security store. If the security store determines that the logon request is valid the security store may include a user security credential for a user account that is associated with the logon credentials in the security response . If the security store determines that the logon request is invalid the security store may include information indicative of the invalidity of the logon request in the security response . In some embodiments if the security store determines that the logon request is invalid the security store will not include user security credentials in the security response and the absence of the user security credential is an indicator that the logon request is invalid.

Based at least in part on the security response the user authorization web service may create user security session and provide security session information to the client application . The security response may include a user security credential that is associated with a user account that matches the logon credentials . In some embodiments the user security session may expire after a period of time and the security session information may include a token or information indicative of when the user security session will expire.

The client application may create a logon lease . If the logon lease expires then the client application may be logged out.

The Scheduler Scheduler Service may be implemented as an executable program. There are two types of Scheduling Download Scheduling and Config Scheduling.

Configuration assignments may be run in order by schedule type Permanent Permanent with start date Re occurring Override One Time Override. Within a schedule type the assignment with the earlier start date may be initiated first. Within matching start dates assignments having static collections may be initiated before dynamic if still tied those assignments with earlier create dates may be initiated first. Configuration assignments of permanent and permanent with start date may only contain static collections.

Download Scheduling gets the start date that download process begins. It may take an indeterminate amount of time for the downloaded package to be ready to be installed on a given EGM. Also to avoid download conflict if multiple download assignments exist for the same module type on an EGM the assignment with the latest creation date takes precedence.

The Web Service may use a Windows Server version 2000 or 2003 hereby incorporated by reference with the following Windows components running 

Processing The Scheduler Service may query the Schedule database for jobs that are scheduled to be run. The Scheduler may initiate the processing of the jobs by notifying the GUI Download Web Service or the GUI Configuration Web Service.

Interface Exports The Scheduler Service may consume the Activity Web Service to log its processing events. It also interacts with the Schedule SQL database with ActiveX Data Objects ADO commands.

The download Web service includes a presentation layer a business logic layer a data access layer and a data tier . The presentation layer includes an application such as a control panel or Bally control panel. The business logic layer includes an option configuration handler . The data access layer includes a configuration web service and an activity web server . The data tier includes a core database and a configuration database .

The configuration web service communicates with the application the option configuration handler the activity web server the core database and the configuration database .
