title: Delivery time optimization
abstract: Techniques for optimizing a delivery time for the delivery of messages are described. According to various embodiments, members of an online social network service that are currently located in a particular geographic location (e.g., a particular time zone) are identified. Thereafter, messages (e.g., e-mails) are transmitted to the members at multiple local times (e.g., multiple times of the day). It is then determined that one or more of the messages that were transmitted at a particular local time have received a highest value for a response metric among the messages, the response metric indicating responses by the members to the messages. The particular local time is then classified as an optimum local message delivery time for the particular geographic location.

The present application relates generally to data processing systems and in one specific example to techniques for optimizing a delivery time for the delivery of messages.

Online social network services such as LinkedIn feature a wide range of products that are offered to millions of members. Further such online social network services typically send a very large number of e mails to members where such e mails may include information describing news updates features products offers etc. associated with the online social network service.

Example methods and systems for optimizing a delivery time for the delivery of messages are described. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of example embodiments. It will be evident however to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details.

According to various example embodiments a delivery time optimization system is configured to identify the optimum time for delivering messages e.g. e mails to users in different geographic locations e.g. different time zones . The system may identify optimum local message delivery times by performing various message response experiments with respect to users in each location. For example the system may send messages to users in each location at different e.g. random times of the day and by analyzing how the users interact with the transmitted e mails the system may determine which times of the day produce the best responses to the messages e.g. as measured by click through rates in that time zone. For instance in some embodiments the system may identify a test segment base of for example 5000 members of an online social network service that are currently located in a particular time zone. Thereafter during an experiment cycle e.g. one week the system may transmit 5000 instances of an e mail one to each of the 5000 members at random times of the day. In other words each of the 5000 members may receive the e mail once during the week long experiment cycle at a random time of the day. By analyzing response metric associated with each of the e mails the system may determine that for example e mails transmitted at a particular time of day e.g. 2 35 PM or at a particular time interval e.g. between 1.30 PM and 4 PM tend to receive much higher response metrics e.g. click through rates in comparison to the messages transmitted at other times of the day or at other time intervals. The delivery time optimization system may then classify such a time or time interval as an optimum local delivery time. In some embodiments the delivery time optimization system may classify the optimum local delivery time as a time interval e.g. a one hour bucket that includes the original e mail transmission time that was associated with the highest response metric. For example if messages transmitted at 2 35 PM tend to have the best response metrics the system may determine that the optimum local delivery time is 2 PM to 3 PM.

In some embodiments the geographic locations described herein may correspond to any known type of location such as a time zone building street neighbourhood suburb city county state region country latitude longitude etc. In some embodiments the messages described herein may be any type of electronic message including an e mail text message e.g. a short messaging service SMS message a multimedia messaging service MMS message etc. an instant message associated with an online social network e.g. Facebook LinkedIn Wechat WhatsApp etc. a chat message associated with an online chat service and so on.

In some embodiments the response metrics described herein may correspond to any type of metric for measurement of how a user interacts with or responds to a content item such as a message. For example the response metric may correspond to an access rate indicating rates at which users open view or access a message e.g. by clicking on the message in an inbox in order to open and view the message . Such an access rate may measure the number of access events in comparison to a number of impressions e.g. the number of times the message was transmitted . The response metric may also correspond to a raw number of access events a number of access events during a predetermined time interval and so on. In some embodiments the response metric may correspond to a click through rate indicating rates at which users click on some content within the message e.g. a reference link that takes the user to a site . Such a click through rate may measure the number of clicks in comparison to a number of impressions e.g. the number of times the message was rendered to users . The response metric may also correspond to a raw number of clicks a number of clicks during a predetermined time interval and so on. In some embodiments the response metric may correspond to a reply rate indicating rates at which users reply to the message. Such a reply rate may measure the number of replies in comparison to a number of impressions e.g. the number of times the message was rendered and viewed by users or the number of times the message was transmitted to users . The response metric may also correspond to a raw number of replies a number of replies to during a predetermined time interval and so on. Similarly other types of response metrics capturing other possible types of responses may be utilized e.g. specific user interface movements such as swipes expanding content zooming in and out of content conversions deletions of content unsubscribes marking content as spam hover responses etc. .

After the delivery time optimization system determines optimum local delivery times for a particular geographic location if the delivery time optimization system determines that a given member is located in the particular geographic location the delivery time optimization system may adjust the message delivery preferences of that member to reflect the optimal local message delivery time. Accordingly when a message is to be transmitted to that given member at the particular geographic location the message may be transmitted at the optimal local message delivery time based on these updated preferences.

In some embodiments the delivery time optimization system may simply transmit e mails at random times of the day during an experiment cycle as described above. In other embodiments the delivery time optimization system may transmit the e mails at predetermined or fixed times of the day as opposed to random times of the day . For example the delivery time optimization system may display a user interface enabling a user of the delivery time optimization system to specify exact times when e mails should be transmitted or to specify that e mails should be transmitted at fixed intervals e.g. every second every minute every 30 minutes every hour etc. .

In some embodiments the techniques described herein may be utilized to determine not only an optimum time of the day to transmit e mails but also an optimum day of the week to transmit e mails. For example the system may transmit e mails to each of the 5000 members in the test base at the same time of the day e.g. 10 AM on a random weekday doing the given experiment cycle and may analyze the results to determine if e mails transmitted on a certain day of the week tend to produce greater response metrics.

In some embodiments the delivery time optimization system may identify optimum local delivery times based on experiments performed on a small test base segment of members of an online social network e.g. a test base of 5 of members . The test base may represent members in different time zones in proportion to how members in the total member base are located in different time zones. For example if half of all the members of the social network are located in time zone A and the other half of all the members are located in time zone B then experimentation may be performed on 5 of all the members where half of that 5 of members are in time zone A and the other half of that 5 of members are in time zone B. Thereafter once the optimum local message delivery time is determined based on the experimentation on the test base the message delivery preferences of the other members of the online social network may be automatically updated to indicate the optimum local message delivery times for each member based on where that member is located. In this manner experiments may be performed with respect to for example 5 of the member base of the social network continuously while the results are continuously and automatically applied to the message delivery preferences of the other 95 of the member base of the social network.

In some embodiments the techniques described above may be utilized to calculate not only an optimal local message delivery time but also the second optimal local message delivery time third optimal local message delivery time fourth optimal local message delivery time and so on. For example the system may identify the times that have the second highest response metric third highest response metric fourth highest response metric and so on. This may be beneficial if for example a situation arises where a message cannot be transmitted to a given member in a particular location at the corresponding optimum local message delivery time for that particular location perhaps because delivery of the message at that time would violate a message campaign rule e.g. by transmitting too many messages to the user during a given time interval by transmitting too many messages to the user within a certain time of each other etc. or perhaps because there is a delivery failure with a message delivery system. In this situation the delivery time optimization system may separate transmit that message to the user at the second optimum local message delivery time as necessary. This approach may also be beneficial in a situation where two or more e mails are to be transmitted to the user at the same time. In such case the delivery time optimization system may identify the importance of each of the e mails e.g. by assigning important values to the emails based on pre existing criteria identifying sample importance values associated with different types of e mails and the more important e mail may be transmitted to the user at the optimum local message delivery time while the second more important e mail may be transmitted to the user at the second optimum local message delivery time and so on.

The system may determine that a member is currently located in a particular time zone based on for example member profile attributes of the member e.g. a user specified country attribute contact information a current educational attribute a current employer attribute social activity information associated with the member e.g. a check in at a venue via a post on an online social network geo location information accessed from a mobile device of the member IP address information obtained from login requests to a website received from the member and so on.

In accordance with one example embodiment the system may utilize a combination of member profile attributes and IP address login information associated with members in order to determine that the member is currently located in a particular time zone. For example the system may first analyze member profile attributes of the member in order to determine if they are currently located in a particular country. For example the system may identify whether a user specified country attribute identifying a particular country is defined in the member profile information of the member e.g. as a result of the member specifying their current country of residence when they opened a member account on the online social network service . Thereafter the system may access publicly available time zone information indicating time zones associated with each of a plurality of countries. If the system determines that a single time zone is associated with the particular country the system may determine that the member is currently located in that single time zone. On the other hand if the system determines that multiple time zones are associated with the particular country then the system may access the last IP address associated with the last member login request from that member e.g. from the last time that member logged into a website . Based on this IP address the system may determine a geographic location e.g. a city associated with the IP address and a time zone associated with that geographic location in order to ultimately identify the specific time zone from among the multiple time zones in that country that the particular member is currently located in.

As shown in the data layer includes several databases such as a database for storing profile data including both member profile data as well as profile data for various organizations. Consistent with some embodiments when a person initially registers to become a member of the social network service the person will be prompted to provide some personal information such as his or her name age e.g. birthdate gender interests contact information hometown address the names of the member s spouse and or family members educational background e.g. schools majors matriculation and or graduation dates etc. employment history skills professional organizations and so on. This information is stored for example in the database with reference number . Similarly when a representative of an organization initially registers the organization with the social network service the representative may be prompted to provide certain information about the organization. This information may be stored for example in the database with reference number or another database not shown . With some embodiments the profile data may be processed e.g. in the background or offline to generate various derived profile data. For example if a member has provided information about various job titles the member has held with the same company or different companies and for how long this information can be used to infer or derive a member profile attribute indicating the member s overall seniority level or seniority level within a particular company. With some embodiments importing or otherwise accessing data from one or more externally hosted data sources may enhance profile data for both members and organizations. For instance with companies in particular financial data may be imported from one or more external data sources and made part of a company s profile.

Once registered a member may invite other members or be invited by other members to connect via the social network service. A connection may require a bi lateral agreement by the members such that both members acknowledge the establishment of the connection. Similarly with some embodiments a member may elect to follow another member. In contrast to establishing a connection the concept of following another member typically is a unilateral operation and at least with some embodiments does not require acknowledgement or approval by the member that is being followed. When one member follows another the member who is following may receive status updates or other messages published by the member being followed or relating to various activities undertaken by the member being followed. Similarly when a member follows an organization the member becomes eligible to receive messages or status updates published on behalf of the organization. For instance messages or status updates published on behalf of an organization that a member is following will appear in the member s personalized data feed or content stream. In any case the various associations and relationships that the members establish with other members or with other entities and objects are stored and maintained within the social graph shown in with reference number .

The social network service may provide a broad range of other applications and services that allow members the opportunity to share and receive information often customized to the interests of the member. For example with some embodiments the social network service may include a photo sharing application that allows members to upload and share photos with other members. With some embodiments members may be able to self organize into groups or interest groups organized around a subject matter or topic of interest. With some embodiments the social network service may host various job listings providing details of job openings with various organizations.

As members interact with the various applications services and content made available via the social network service the members behavior e.g. content viewed links or member interest buttons selected etc. may be monitored and information concerning the member s activities and behavior may be stored for example as indicated in by the database with reference number .

With some embodiments the social network system includes what is generally referred to herein as a delivery time optimization system . The delivery time optimization system is described in more detail below in conjunction with .

Although not shown with some embodiments the social network system provides an application programming interface API module via which third party applications can access various services and data provided by the social network service. For example using an API a third party application may provide a user interface and logic that enables an authorized representative of an organization to publish messages from a third party application to a content hosting platform of the social network service that facilitates presentation of activity or content streams maintained and presented by the social network service. Such third party applications may be browser based applications or may be operating system specific. In particular some third party applications may reside and execute on one or more mobile devices e.g. phone or tablet computing devices having a mobile operating system.

Turning now to a delivery time optimization system includes a location module a delivery time optimization module and a database . The modules of the delivery time optimization system may be implemented on or executed by a single device such as a delivery time optimization device or on separate devices interconnected via a network. The aforementioned delivery time optimization device may be for example one or more client machines or application servers. The operation of each of the aforementioned modules of the delivery time optimization system will now be described in greater detail in conjunction with .

In some embodiments the delivery time optimization system may perform the operation for a single member of an online social network service or a group of members of the online social network service e.g. a portion or all of the members . In some embodiments the method in may be performed on a first group of members of the online social network service that are currently located in a particular geographic location e.g. a test base of 5 of users at the location . Thereafter once the optimum local message delivery time is determined pursuant to the method the message delivery preferences of a second distinct group of members that are also currently located in the particular geographic location may be automatically updated to indicate the optimum local message delivery time. For example the second group of members may be the remaining 95 of users at the location. In this manner experiments may be performed with respect to for example 5 of relevant users continuously while the results are continuously and automatically applied to the message delivery preferences of the other 95 of relevant users.

Certain embodiments are described herein as including logic or a number of components modules or mechanisms. Modules may constitute either software modules e.g. code embodied 1 on a non transitory machine readable medium or 2 in a transmission signal or hardware implemented modules. A hardware implemented module is a tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain manner. In example embodiments one or more computer systems e.g. a standalone client or server computer system or one or more processors may be configured by software e.g. an application or application portion as a hardware implemented module that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.

In various embodiments a hardware implemented module may be implemented mechanically or electronically. For example a hardware implemented module may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured e.g. as a special purpose processor such as a field programmable gate array FPGA or an application specific integrated circuit ASIC to perform certain operations. A hardware implemented module may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry e.g. as encompassed within a general purpose processor or other programmable processor that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware implemented module mechanically in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry or in temporarily configured circuitry e.g. configured by software may be driven by cost and time considerations.

Accordingly the term hardware implemented module should be understood to encompass a tangible entity be that an entity that is physically constructed permanently configured e.g. hardwired or temporarily or transitorily configured e.g. programmed to operate in a certain manner and or to perform certain operations described herein. Considering embodiments in which hardware implemented modules are temporarily configured e.g. programmed each of the hardware implemented modules need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example where the hardware implemented modules comprise a general purpose processor configured using software the general purpose processor may be configured as respective different hardware implemented modules at different times. Software may accordingly configure a processor for example to constitute a particular hardware implemented module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware implemented module at a different instance of time.

Hardware implemented modules can provide information to and receive information from other hardware implemented modules. Accordingly the described hardware implemented modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple of such hardware implemented modules exist contemporaneously communications may be achieved through signal transmission e.g. over appropriate circuits and buses that connect the hardware implemented modules. In embodiments in which multiple hardware implemented modules are configured or instantiated at different times communications between such hardware implemented modules may be achieved for example through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware implemented modules have access. For example one hardware implemented module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware implemented module may then at a later time access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware implemented modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices and can operate on a resource e.g. a collection of information .

The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed at least partially by one or more processors that are temporarily configured e.g. by software or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured such processors may constitute processor implemented modules that operate to perform one or more operations or functions. The modules referred to herein may in some example embodiments comprise processor implemented modules.

Similarly the methods described herein may be at least partially processor implemented. For example at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or processors or processor implemented modules. The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors not only residing within a single machine but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments the processor or processors may be located in a single location e.g. within a home environment an office environment or as a server farm while in other embodiments the processors may be distributed across a number of locations.

The one or more processors may also operate to support performance of the relevant operations in a cloud computing environment or as a software as a service SaaS . For example at least some of the operations may be performed by a group of computers as examples of machines including processors these operations being accessible via a network e.g. the Internet and via one or more appropriate interfaces e.g. Application Program Interfaces APIs . 

Example embodiments may be implemented in digital electronic circuitry or in computer hardware firmware software or in combinations of them. Example embodiments may be implemented using a computer program product e.g. a computer program tangibly embodied in an information carrier e.g. in a machine readable medium for execution by or to control the operation of data processing apparatus e.g. a programmable processor a computer or multiple computers.

A computer program can be written in any form of programming language including compiled or interpreted languages and it can be deployed in any form including as a stand alone program or as a module subroutine or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.

In example embodiments operations may be performed by one or more programmable processors executing a computer program to perform functions by operating on input data and generating output. Method operations can also be performed by and apparatus of example embodiments may be implemented as special purpose logic circuitry e.g. a field programmable gate array FPGA or an application specific integrated circuit ASIC .

The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client server relationship to each other. In embodiments deploying a programmable computing system it will be appreciated that that both hardware and software architectures require consideration. Specifically it will be appreciated that the choice of whether to implement certain functionality in permanently configured hardware e.g. an ASIC in temporarily configured hardware e.g. a combination of software and a programmable processor or a combination of permanently and temporarily configured hardware may be a design choice. Below are set out hardware e.g. machine and software architectures that may be deployed in various example embodiments.

The example computer system includes a processor e.g. a central processing unit CPU a graphics processing unit GPU or both a main memory and a static memory which communicate with each other via a bus . The computer system may further include a video display unit e.g. a liquid crystal display LCD or a cathode ray tube CRT . The computer system also includes an alphanumeric input device e.g. a keyboard or a touch sensitive display screen a user interface UI navigation device e.g. a mouse a disk drive unit a signal generation device e.g. a speaker and a network interface device .

The disk drive unit includes a machine readable medium on which is stored one or more sets of instructions and data structures e.g. software embodying or utilized by any one or more of the methodologies or functions described herein. The instructions may also reside completely or at least partially within the main memory and or within the processor during execution thereof by the computer system the main memory and the processor also constituting machine readable media.

While the machine readable medium is shown in an example embodiment to be a single medium the term machine readable medium may include a single medium or multiple media e.g. a centralized or distributed database and or associated caches and servers that store the one or more instructions or data structures. The term machine readable medium shall also be taken to include any tangible medium that is capable of storing encoding or carrying instructions for execution by the machine and that cause the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies of the present invention or that is capable of storing encoding or carrying data structures utilized by or associated with such instructions. The term machine readable medium shall accordingly be taken to include but not be limited to solid state memories and optical and magnetic media. Specific examples of machine readable media include non volatile memory including by way of example semiconductor memory devices e.g. Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory EPROM Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory EEPROM and flash memory devices magnetic disks such as internal hard disks and removable disks magneto optical disks and CD ROM and DVD ROM disks.

The instructions may further be transmitted or received over a communications network using a transmission medium. The instructions may be transmitted using the network interface device and any one of a number of well known transfer protocols e.g. HTTP . Examples of communication networks include a local area network LAN a wide area network WAN the Internet mobile telephone networks Plain Old Telephone POTS networks and wireless data networks e.g. WiFi LTE and WiMAX networks . The term transmission medium shall be taken to include any intangible medium that is capable of storing encoding or carrying instructions for execution by the machine and includes digital or analog communications signals or other intangible media to facilitate communication of such software.
