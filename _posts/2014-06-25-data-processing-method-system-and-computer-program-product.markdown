Outsourcing may be understood to describe a situation where a client organization imposes a specific set of tasks upon a third party. The third party may be a separate or an auxiliary organization. The third party may be located in an another country or a location near the client organization. One example of outsourcing is a third party providing information technology services for an automobile and or a machine tools manufacturer. These information technology services might range from supply chain management to the control of manufacturing processes. Some of these information technology services might be performed in one country whereas other information technology services may be performed in a different country.

An outsourcing environment may be understood to include objects processes and circumstances defining how the third party performs tasks for the client organization. The elaboration of the outsourcing environment may include information system configuration requirements access control requirements or restriction enclosed for the sake of security. The objects in the outsourcing environment may include equipment such as computers configured according to the configuration requirements. It may be desirable for the client organization to define a part of an outsourcing environment for the third party in order to mitigate risk and maintain accountability within the client organization. Thus the third party may be required to operate under restrictions outside its control.

One or more technical restrictions may be imposed on the users user computers and or server computers in an outsourcing environment. It may be desirable to constrain the communication of computers in an outsourcing environment to one local area network LAN or to limit the communications of computers in an outsourcing environment to an explicitly defined set of computers. Network connectivity in an outsourcing environment may be limited to users and computers directed to perform specific tasks. It may also be desirable to restrict user access to computers and or to restrict the interactions between computers.

The outsourcing environment may limit communications and or the exchange of data between computers. In particular the outsourcing environment may limit the open TCP IP ports and or the services which may be enabled or run on user computers. In addition it may not be possible to operate a web server or configure a computer system to accept connections conforming to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP or HTTPS in the outsourcing environment. Also it may not be possible to operate a database server in the outsourcing environment in particular it may not be possible to configure a computer to accept connections conforming to database protocols such as Transparent Network Substrate Oracle SQL Net Oracle Tabular Data Stream Microsoft or similar protocols Microsoft is a trademark of Microsoft Corporation Oracle is a trademark of Oracle Corporation . Furthermore it may not be possible to make changes to the system registry on a user computer in the outsourcing environment. Moreover direct access to the Internet may not be allowed in the outsourcing environment.

Thus it is a problem to obtain and store user data in an outsourcing environment. This problem is solved according to the independent claims. Preferred embodiments are defined in the dependent claims.

According to an aspect of this application a data processing method for obtaining and storing user data in an outsourcing environment is provided. The method includes providing a user interface on a user computer. The method further includes determining an indicator which indicates whether there is synchronization data in the user database wherein the synchronization data is for synchronization with a remote database which is located on a remote computer. The method also includes obtaining user data with the user interface. In addition the method includes storing the user data in the user database if the indicator indicates that there is synchronization data in the user database.

Thus the method may decrease the mental and physical effort required from a user in order to perform a task e.g. storing data since the user does not need to worry about where data is stored. In addition the indicator may enable an improved continued man machine interaction by facilitating the storage and synchronization of data.

It may be that if the indicator indicates that there is no synchronization data in the user database the method further includes verifying whether the remote database is available. In the negative the method may further include storing the user data in the user database attempting to synchronize the user database with the remote database after storing the user data in the user database. Otherwise in the affirmative the method may include storing the user data in the remote database.

Furthermore it may be that if the indicator indicates that there is synchronization data in the user database the method further includes verifying whether the remote database in available. In the affirmative the method may also include synchronizing the user database with the remote database and recording a timestamp of the user database.

Determining the indicator may comprise obtaining a current timestamp of the user database and comparing the current timestamp with the recorded timestamp. Alternatively determining the indicator may comprise examining an indicator value. If the indicator value indicates that there is no synchronization data in the user database the method may further comprise verifying whether the remote database is available. In the affirmative the method may comprise copying the data in the user database to the remote database and setting the stored value to indicate that there is no synchronization data in the user database.

The user computer and the remote computer may be connected by a network. In this case the remote computer may be accessed by the user computer using a virtual private network VPN and or a remote graphical user interface.

Providing the user interface on the user computer may comprise executing a computer program on the remote computer from the user computer. The computer program is preferably configured so that input of the user data is prohibited or blocked if the computer program is executed directly on the user computer. In other words if the computer program is copied from the remote computer to the user computer the computer program cannot be executed on the user computer.

It may be that the method further includes receiving user input selecting the user database as a default database. In this case an attempt to synchronize the user database with the remote database is only made after receiving a signal to synchronize the user database with the remote database. The signal may comprise user input.

It may be that the indicator indicates that there is synchronization data in the user database. If the indicator so indicates the method may further include verifying whether the remote database is available. In the affirmative the method may include opening a connection from the user computer to the remote computer and synchronizing the user database with the remote database. In addition the method may include copying stored user data including the synchronized data from the remote database to the user computer before closing the connection to the remote database. Stored user data may be understood as user data obtained with the user interface and stored in the remote database. In the negative i.e. if the remote database is unavailable the method may include storing user data in the user database and attempting to synchronize the user database with the remote computer. Attempting to synchronize the user database with the remote computer may be understood as attempting to synchronize the user database with the remote database.

It may be that if user input to shut down the user interface is received an attempt is made to synchronize the user database with the remote database if there is synchronization data in the user database. This may include providing a notification on the user interface if the attempt to synchronize was unsuccessful.

According to another aspect a computer program product including computer readable instructions is provided. Computer readable instructions may be stored on a computer readable medium and or provided as a data stream. The computer program product when loaded and executed on a computer system may cause the computer system to perform operations according to the method steps described above.

According to yet another aspect a data processing system for obtaining and storing user data in an outsourcing environment is provided. The system includes a user computer and the user computer includes a user database and a user interface wherein the user interface is operable to obtain user data. Furthermore the system includes an indicator which indicates whether there is synchronization data in the user database. Accordingly the user computer is operable to determine the indicator. In addition the synchronization data is for synchronization with a remote database which is located on a remote computer. Moreover the user computer is operable to store the user data in the user database if the indicator indicates that there is synchronization data in the user database. In addition the system is preferably operable to perform operations according to any of the method steps described above.

The subject matter described in the specification can be implemented as a method or as a system possibly in the form of one or more computer program products. The subject matter described in the specification can be implemented in a data signal or on a machine readable medium where the medium is embodied in one or more information carriers such as a CD ROM a DVD ROM a semiconductor memory or a hard disk. Such computer program products may cause a data processing apparatus to perform one or more operations described in the specification.

In addition subject matter described in the specification can also be implemented as a system including a processor and a memory coupled to the processor. The memory may encode one or more programs to cause the processor to perform one or more of the methods described in the specification. Further subject matter described in the specification can be implemented using various machines.

Details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying exemplary drawings and description below. Other features will be apparent from the description the drawings and from the claims.

The following technical terms are used throughout the description. The terms may refer but are not limited to the following explanations.

The user data may be understood as data input by a user or data input by means of a batch process. When stored in a database user data may be understood to form all or part of the contents of the database. User data may be distinguished from metadata which describes the structure of and constraints on the database. User data may also be distinguished from indexes which may be understood as data structures that support efficient access to user data.

A user computer may be understood as any computer which is accessible by a user. The user computer may be a client a server a personal computer a mainframe or a mobile computing device.

An admin computer may be understood as a computer from which administrative tasks can be performed. The admin computer may be the same as the user computer or the admin computer may be separate from the user computer. The admin computer may be a client a server a personal computer a mainframe or a mobile computing device.

A remote computer may be understood as a computer which is separate from the user computer. The remote computer may be connected to the user computer via a network. The remote computer may be spatially distant from the user computer and or the admin computer. The remote computer may be a client a server a personal computer a mainframe or a mobile computing device.

A client computer may be understood as a computer which is separate from the user computer. The client computer may also be separate from the remote computer and the admin computer. The client computer may be administered by the client organization and may be spatially distant from the user computer and or the admin computer. The client computer may be a client a server a personal computer a mainframe or a mobile computing device.

A user interface may be understood to allow a user to interact with a computer. In other words a user interface acts as a bridge between applications and users.

A Virtual Private Network VPN may be understood as a network where packets that are internal to a private network pass across a public network e.g. the Internet without this being apparent to hosts on the private network. A VPN may encrypt packets which pass across the public network. It may be a characteristic of a VPN that when a computer such as the user computer can only connect to one

VPN at a time. In other words given a first VPN and a second VPN when the user computer connects to the second VPN the user computer can no longer connect to the first VPN.

A remote graphical user interface or remote graphic interface may allow a user to use a remote system as if he were sitting directly in front of it. Examples of programs providing a remote graphical user interface include Microsoft Terminal

Services Microsoft Remote Desktop and Citrix Independent Computer Architecture ICA Citrix and ICA are trademarks of Citrix Systems Inc. .

A database may be understood as a managed collection of data. A database may be relational object oriented object relational or the database may be structured according to another model.

A spreadsheet worksheet or sheet may be understood as an electronic representation of multiple cells or fields that together make up a grid consisting of rows and columns. A spreadsheet may be displayed inside an application program such as Microsoft Excel Excel is a trademark of Microsoft Corporation .

Synchronization may involve copying data from one database to another. In particular synchronization may involve copying data from a user database to a remote database when the data to be copied from the user database is not present on the remote database.

The availability of a computer or database may be understood to refer to the ability of a user to access the computer or the database respectively. Thus if a user computer can access a database the database is available if a user computer cannot access the database the database is unavailable.

In the following text a detailed description of examples will be given with reference to the drawings. It should be understood that various modifications to the examples may be made. In particular elements of one example may be combined and used in other examples to form new examples.

According to the specific example depicted in the remote computer contains a TrackIT folder and a remote DB folder . A folder may be understood as synonymous with a directory i.e. a means of grouping files. The folder TrackIT may comprise a computer program which can be executed from the user computer in order to provide the user interface on the user computer. The computer program in the TrackIT folder may be referred to as TrackIT or TrackIT.xls. Accordingly the computer program may be an Excel spreadsheet comprising macros. A macro may be understood to refer to a unit of code written using Microsoft s Visual Basic for Applications programming language Visual Basic is a trademark of Microsoft Corporation . The remote DB folder may include the remote database. TrackIT and remote DB may be folders accessible using Microsoft Windows file sharing protocols. The remote computer may be accessible from the user computer and or the admin computer using a virtual private network VPN and or a remote graphical user interface. The client computer may be accessible from the user computer and or the admin computer using a virtual private network and or a remote graphical user interface. The VPN used to access the remote computer may be different from the VPN used to access the client computer .

It should be noted that while only one user computer one remote computer one admin computer and one client computer are depicted multiple user computers remote computers admin computers and or client computers are possible.

The remote computer and the admin computer may be understood to be part of a tracking computer network. When connected to the remote computer the user computer may also be understood to be part of the tracking computer network. Due constraints imposed by a specific environment e.g. the outsourcing environment when connected to the client computer the user computer may be understood to be outside the tracking computer network.

A user database may also be referred to as user DB . The user database may be located on or at the user computer . The user DB may also be referred to as the backup database. The remote database may be located on the remote computer . The remote database may also be referred to as the server database.

Alternatively the user DB may be located on another computer connected to the user computer via a network. In particular the network connecting the user computer to the one or more computers upon which the user DB is stored may be faster and or more reliable than a network connecting the user computer to the remote computer .

According to one example the TrackIT program may be executed in order to design fields parameters and configure settings for the TrackIT program. In addition a database may be created in the remote DB folder and reports may be generated using the database. TrackIT may be run from the user computer and the parameters for tracking may be loaded in the user computer from the remote computer . In particular the TrackIT program may be understood to provide instructions i.e. source code in the form of macros which define how an application e.g. Microsoft Excel is executed. Moreover tasks may be stored in a database located in the remote DB folder and task reports may be generated from the database. In some cases the TrackIT program stores user data in the user database when access to the remote database on the remote computer is lost.

The first mode automatic synchronization may be desirable when communications between the user computer and the remote computer are intermittent. Intermittent communications may result in the remote computer being unavailable to the user computer or inaccessible from the user computer for a period of time. In particular intermittent communications between the user computer and the remote computer may occur when the network connection between the user computer and the remote computer is lost or goes out of service at varying intervals.

The second mode manual synchronization may be desirable if communications between the user computer and the remote computer are extremely slow or temporarily disabled. Intermittent or extremely slow communications between the user computer and the remote computer may occur due to the use of a virtual private network and or a remote graphical user interface and or because of the spatial distance separating the user computer from the remote computer . Automatic or manual synchronization mode may be selected in the setup sheet for example the setup sheet depicted in .

In step S user data is saved or stored in response to a mouse click on either a pause task button or a start task submit task button as depicted on the tracker sheet. In step S the TrackIT program verifies the availability of the remote database. User data is saved on the remote database if the remote database is available otherwise the user data is saved on the user database . In step S an attempt is made to synchronize the user database with the remote database. In step S an alert is generated which indicates a result of the attempt to synchronize.

As an alternative to the steps S to S it is possible that determining the indicator comprises examining a stored value also referred to as an indicator value. If the stored value indicates that there is synchronization data in the user database an alert may be provided similar to the alert provided in step S. The steps S to S described above as well as the described alternative thereto may have the advantage of reducing computer resource consumption. In other words it may be the case that checking the timestamp of a file is more efficient than opening a database and examining its contents.

Other error messages are also possible. If an error message is generated only the intro sheet with the corresponding error message will be displayed. No other sheets e.g. the tracker sheet will be accessible.

Clicking on the get pause report button may populate a drop down list cell with the key values of the tasks paused. According to the example depicted in a policy number of the task is the key value. This is defined in the key column of the design sheet. Thus when a task is paused the policy number of the task is copied to the drop down list cell . The synchronize data button may be used in manual synchronization mode to attempt to synchronize the user database with the remote database. Furthermore the background of a synchronize data button may be green if there is no data to be synchronized or if synchronization was successful. The background of the synchronize data button may be red in order to alert the user that synchronization has failed. A leftmost column includes a parameters column . The parameters column begins under a break complete button . The parameters column may contain the names of parameters of the task being tracked. A details column beginning under a pause task button may contain details associated with each named parameter. According to the example depicted the parameter names provided in column and the format of data entered in the details column are defined in the design sheet. A go button can be used to load a pause task after a key value from the drop down list cell has been selected. After clicking on the go button the corresponding details of the task will be loaded in the details column and the timer will resume with the time that was saved when the task was paused. The pause task button may be used to pause the task the user is currently tracking. The task can only be paused after the key parameter as defined in the key column of the design sheet has been entered. The break complete button may be used to track breaks. Thus after a task has been started using the start task submit task button a user may click on the break complete button in order to track a break from the task. The break complete button may be used to track time spent resting or relaxing. The values corresponding to a TrackIT administrator and a tracker name are the respective values entered for tracker administrator and tracker name in the setup sheet depicted into .

Other entry types are also possible. The other columns depicted such as a call date column correspond to task parameters.

Other entry types are also possible. Other columns displayed in may include parameters and parameter details tracked for a task.

The personal computer may further include a hard disk drive for reading from and writing to a hard disk not shown and an external disk drive for reading from or writing to a removable disk . The removable disk may be a magnetic disk for a magnetic disk driver or an optical disk such as a CD ROM for an optical disk drive. The hard disk drive and the external disk drive are connected to the system bus by a hard disk drive interface and an external disk drive interface respectively. The drives and their associated computer readable media provide nonvolatile storage of computer readable instructions data structures program modules and other data for the personal computer . The data structures may include relevant data for the implementation of the data processing method for obtaining and storing data in an outsourcing environment. The relevant data may be organized in a database for example a relational or object database.

Although the exemplary environment described herein employs a hard disk not shown and an external disk it should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other types of computer readable media which can store data that is accessible by a computer such as magnetic cassettes flash memory cards digital video disks random access memories read only memories and the like may also be used in the exemplary operating environment.

A number of program modules may be stored on the hard disk external disk ROM or RAM including an operating system not shown one or more application programs other program modules not shown and program data . The application programs may include at least a part of the functionality as depicted in .

A user may enter commands and information as discussed below into the personal computer through input devices such as keyboard and mouse . Other input devices not shown may include a microphone or other sensors joystick game pad scanner or the like. These and other input devices may be connected to the processing unit through a serial port interface that is coupled to the system bus or may be collected by other interfaces such as a parallel port interface game port or a universal serial bus USB . Further information may be printed using printer . The printer and other parallel input output devices may be connected to the processing unit through parallel port interface . A monitor or other type of display device is also connected to the system bus via an interface such as a video input output . In addition to the monitor computing environment may include other peripheral output devices not shown such as speakers or other audible output.

The computing environment may communicate with other electronic devices such as a computer telephone wired or wireless personal digital assistant television or the like. To communicate the computer environment may operate in a networked environment using connections to one or more electronic devices. depicts the computer environment networked with remote computer . The remote computer may be another computing environment such as a server a router a network PC a peer device or other common network node and may include many or all of the elements described above relative to the computing environment . The logical connections depicted in include a local area network LAN and a wide area network WAN . Such networking environments are commonplace in offices enterprise wide computer networks intranets and the Internet and may particularly be encrypted.

When used in a LAN networking environment the computing environment may be connected to the LAN through a network I O . When used in a WAN networking environment the computing environment may include a modem or other means for establishing communications over the WAN . The modem which may be internal or external to computing environment is connected to the system bus via the serial port interface . In a networked environment program modules depicted relative to the computing environment or portions thereof may be stored in a remote memory storage device resident on or accessible to remote computer . Furthermore other data relevant to the data processing system and method described above may be resident on or accessible via the remote computer . It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the electronic devices may be used.

The computing system described above is only one example of the type of computing system that may be used to implement the data processing method for obtaining and storing user data in an outsourcing environment.
