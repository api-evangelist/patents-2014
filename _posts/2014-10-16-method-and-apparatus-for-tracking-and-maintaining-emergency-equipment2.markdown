title: Method and apparatus for tracking and maintaining emergency equipment
abstract: Embodiments of the invention provide a uniquely accountable mechanism to provide emergency responders with accurate and verifiable data regarding the location and operational readiness of emergency equipment immediately upon notification of an emergency. The invention tracks, records, and establishes workflows to maintain emergency medical equipment, such as automated external defibrillators (AEDs), by non-technical, non-healthcare providers for use by emergency responders in pre-hospital, pre-EMS medical emergencies. The unique and verifiable data obtained from this process is used as part of an emergency notification system that provides emergency responders, such as sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) responders, in an organizational setting, with immediate and accurate information identifying the nearest operationally ready medical device at the time of the emergency, which information has heretofore never been available to emergency responders such as SCA responders.

This application is a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 269 030 filed May 2 2014 and claims priority to U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61 892 836 filed Oct. 18 2013 each of which application is incorporated herein in its entirety by this reference thereto.

The invention relates to tracking the location and operational readiness of emergency equipment. More particularly the invention relates to providing an emergency responder with the accurate location of the nearest operationally ready emergency equipment to retrieve and use during an emergency within the operationally clinically appropriate period of time.

Out of hospital sudden cardiac arrests SCA claim the life of approximately 375 000 victims each year in the U.S. SCAs claim more lives than Alzheimer s assault with firearms breast cancer colorectal cancer HIV diabetes house fires motor vehicle accidents prostate cancer suicides and industrial accidents combined. Sudden cardiac arrest is most often caused by an abrupt deterioration of the heart s normal rhythm. This electrical rhythm normal sinus rhythm causes the heart to contract regularly and pump blood to the brain and throughout the body. In sudden cardiac arrest the normal sinus rhythm abruptly deteriorates into a chaotic electrical rhythm called ventricular fibrillation that fails to contract the heart. As a result blood is not pumped out from the heart. The result is immediate unconsciousness and collapse which if untreated progresses rapidly to death.

Since the 1970 s defibrillation has been the standard of care for cardiac arrests in medical settings such as the hospital intensive care unit the emergency room or the ambulance. Defibrillation is the delivery of a therapeutic dose of electrical energy to the heart with a medical device called a defibrillator. In these medical settings a manual defibrillator is used. The manual defibrillator requires a healthcare professional usually a physician to analyze the patient s heart rhythm on a cardiac monitor. When ventricular fibrillation is detected the healthcare professional administers a shock to the heart with the defibrillator. The defibrillator s shock quiets the heart s chaotic rhythm and allows the heart s normal rhythm to take over. In this way the defibrillator converts the heart s abnormal rhythm ventricular fibrillation back into the heart s normal rhythm However the majority of SCAs do not occur in medical settings where healthcare professionals and proper equipment are readily available. Unfortunately the majority of sudden cardiac arrests occur in the community where people live work and play. The cardiac arrest victim is usually located far away from healthcare professionals and the life saving medical equipment.

Prior to the late 1980 s nearly all patients who suffered a cardiac arrest out of the hospital died. The addition of the defibrillator for use by paramedics on ambulances improved survival but the time required for paramedics to arrive to the scene of a cardiac emergency was still too long. Multiple research studies performed on out of hospital cardiac arrest determined that time to defibrillation is the most significant determinant of whether the individual can survive the cardiac arrest. Studies have concluded that a defibrillatory shock must be applied to the heart within four minutes of collapse. Yet most EMS response times are far in excess of four minutes. EMS response times are typically between 8 to 12 minutes.

To improve survival the medical community embraced a new technology the automated external defibrillator AED in the late 1980 s. The AED is a computerized device that includes a software algorithm that was developed to read the victim s cardiac rhythm and then advise the rescuer whether to press the shock button to apply a defibrillatory shock. In contrast to AEDs manual defibrillators require that the healthcare provider using the medical device be familiar with cardiac rhythms and be able to read the cardiac rhythm on a cardiac monitor which is attached to the patient s chest. The medical professional then determines whether or not a shock is indicated. The manual defibrillator plays the roll of delivering the shock but does not diagnose the rhythm nor determine whether a shock is indicated.

However an AED assumes both that the individual using the device does not know how to read cardiac rhythms and that the user would not be able to determine whether or not a shock is indicated. The AED itself includes an algorithm that analyzes the heart rhythm and determines whether or not a shock would be beneficial. Because the AED does not require any medical knowledge other than how to turn on the AED and follow the voice prompts it can be used by non healthcare providers and can be located in the community where people live work and play i.e. the locations where the majority of out of hospital sudden cardiac arrests occur. AEDs have been successfully used in the community by non healthcare providers since 1988 in the U.S.

AEDs have been conclusively determined to read cardiac rhythms accurately and properly advise whether a shock should be delivered. Their use by non healthcare professionals has been proven to be safe. AED presence and use has expanded from the ambulance to the fire department to police departments and in the last ten years to workplace settings thus providing non healthcare professionals i.e. the lay public the opportunity to provide the life saving shock. Multiple reports in the medical literature have demonstrated that when an AED is applied prior to the arrival of emergency medical services EMS the chances of survival increase from approximately 8 to over 30 .

In 1993 the inventor recommended that organizations such as corporate entities should develop internal emergency response programs because of the time requirement to deliver a shock. These programs would include medical oversight an emergency response plan training and practice for members of the workforce to provide cardiopulmonary resuscitation CPR and operate an AED in their workplace and proper maintenance of the AEDs installed at their facility. AED programs are implemented so that trained responders in an organization can provide CPR and the benefit of an AED to co workers and visitors of the organization prior to the arrival of EMS. An important part of the program was to develop a system that would ensure that the AEDs would work properly when these medical devices were needed.

In the early 2000 s organizations began adopting the strategy of providing an onsite emergency response that included trained responders and AEDs. Some of the earliest adopters of AED Programs included airlines such as American Airlines and United Airlines. The Federal Aviation Administration FAA mandated AED programs for all airlines that land in the United States.

As of 2013 more than two million AEDs have been sold over one million of these to private sector organizations.

1 The defibrillator unit a computerized device that is capable of reading the cardiac rhythm and advising whether or not a shock is indicated 

3 Pads that are to be placed on the patient s chest to read the cardiac rhythm and deliver the shock and

Currently six major original equipment manufacturers OEMs manufacture and distribute eleven models of AEDs in the US. The major OEMs in the U.S. are Philips Physio Control ZOLL Medical HeartSine Defibtech and Cardiac Science.

An essential element of an AED program is establishing a system for proper maintenance of the AED unit itself. For example AED pads expire between 2 and four years from the date of production depending on the manufacturer s make and model and require replacement. Similarly AEDs use several types of batteries including lithium batteries and standard AA batteries which expire between four and seven years from the time they are placed into service and must be replaced. In addition approximately 10 15 of AEDs have manufacturing errors that can occur on an individual device basis or a design flaw on a make and model basis. These manufacturing and design errors typically require that the machine be repaired or replaced all together. Therefore regular surveillance is required to ensure that the AED is properly functioning when it is needed in an emergency such as a sudden cardiac arrest.

AED units perform automated daily self checks. During their daily self check an AED unit tests itself to ensure that all of its parts meet minimum operational specifications. When an AED does not meet these minimum requirements depending on the manufacturer s make and model it beeps turns off its ready light and or changes its status from a to an x to indicate a problem exists. Manufacturer recommendations for regular AED maintenance vary but most at the minimum require that an AED must be visually inspected once a month by an individual given responsibility for maintaining the proper functioning of the AED usually called an AED coordinator to determine if the AED is properly functioning.

This inspection process requires that the AED coordinator visually inspects the AED to ensure that the ready light is still blinking and that it is the correct color and to ensure that the AED is not beeping or otherwise emitting a sound that indicates a problem exists. The AED coordinator must also ensure that pads and batteries are not expired and are still present and that the AED unit has not been otherwise damaged or misplaced.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA regulates medical devices in the United States and collects post approval data on device malfunctions. Patients healthcare facilities healthcare providers or device manufacturers can report adverse events. FDA adverse event reporting is required by law if the device failure involves a patient fatality. Although the reporting is mandatory it is likely that many non healthcare professionals are unaware of this reporting requirement. In 2011 medical researchers performed a review of AED device failures reported to the FDA. They published their results in the Annals of Emergency Medicine. They reported that between 1993 and 2008 40 787 AED adverse events were reported to the FDA. A fatality occurred in 1 284 of these AED adverse events. Researchers sought to determine the cause of the AED failure in these fatal events.

For cases in which the researchers reasonably believed that they could draw a conclusion as to cause they attributed approximately 50 of AED failures to battery or power problems and 45 of AED failures to pads connectors. A significant majority of these AED problems could have been detected by a reliable AED maintenance program following the manufacturer s recommended guidelines. When an AED Program is implemented at a new facility a workforce volunteer is recruited to become the AED coordinator for that facility. One of this individual s ongoing responsibilities is to perform the monthly maintenance inspection of the AEDs in their facility. The AED coordinator can be in charge of inspecting between one and 30 AEDs depending on the size of the facility and the resources invested in the organization s AED Program.

A systematic and sustainable AED maintenance program with strict accountability is lacking in the marketplace. The majority of AED maintenance programs in the industry use as their sole mechanism an automated email notification system that sends reminder emails to perform monthly maintenance to the facility s designated AED coordinator.

AED program management providers typically collect the contact information for the AED coordinator including their email address and store this information in a database. Once the AEDs have been placed into service the AED coordinator is sent an email notification on a monthly basis to perform the required AED maintenance.

3 Lack of accountability where there is a failure of the program vendor and or manager to follow up on the lack of performance by the responsible party and

4 Lack of accountability where there are inadequate mechanisms to determine if physical inspection of the device was actually performed.

A variety of common technical issues cause AED program notification systems to fail. Notification emails may not reach the intended recipient because of technical errors such as inaccurate data acquisition or data entry such as simple spelling errors or data input errors. Notification emails also fail because the recipient s email server inadvertently blocks it especially with common email carriers such as Hotmail AOL Yahoo or Google. The recipient s email server may also misdirect the email to the Junk or Spam folder. Any of these technical errors result in lack of notification of the responsible party.

Approximately 25 of AED coordinators discontinue providing maintenance due to relocation to another facility reassignment to other job responsibilities illness retirement or leaving the company. Often another AED coordinator is not designated because the organization does not realize that maintenance is no longer being performed. Reassignment of this responsibility often is overlooked because the AED coordinators are volunteers and performing maintenance is not part of their official job description. Other AED coordinators simply believe they are too busy or are not motivated to complete their AED maintenance responsibilities. They often do not notify the organization that they are no longer willing to perform their AED maintenance responsibilities. The result is that any AED device for which the party is responsible is no longer properly monitored and maintained. This significantly increases the risk that when the AED is required for a sudden cardiac arrest it does not function properly and a life is not saved.

Email notification systems are automated database driven systems that routinely lack back up mechanisms such as people to contact AED coordinators who are not performing the required timely maintenance. Typically an AED coordinator s failure to perform the required in person maintenance occurs because 

The vast majority of AED program vendors who use automated email notification systems provide no personal follow up when maintenance is not properly completed.

Lack of accountability also exists because of inadequate mechanisms to confirm that the required timely maintenance was actually performed as reported. Email notification systems require only that the recipient responds to the email notification or enters a response into the AED management database indicating that a physical inspection has been performed. Because AED coordinators are volunteers and the AED program is seldom part of the organization s core business nor the AED coordinator s job description and the AED coordinator may simply electronically respond to the automated notification email rather than perform the required physical inspection. Simply checking the required box electronically to confirm that the email has been received provides no assurance that the AED is properly maintained.

In the inventor s experience based on 24 years of managing AED programs when an organization s AED program is audited to determine 

the result is that a minimum of 25 35 of AEDs are not in compliance. Of the non compliant AEDs 20 of the devices do not have an active AED coordinator assigned or their location is not known. An additional 10 15 of the machines have an assigned AED coordinator who is unwilling to perform the physical inspection.

These findings and the lack of accountability for maintaining functioning AEDs are major contributors to the significant number of AED failures reported to the FDA.

Embodiments of the invention provide a uniquely accountable mechanism to provide emergency responders with accurate and verifiable data regarding the location and operational readiness of emergency equipment immediately upon notification of an emergency. The invention tracks records and establishes workflows to maintain emergency medical equipment such as automated external defibrillators AEDs by non technical non healthcare providers for use by emergency responders in pre hospital pre EMS medical emergencies. The unique and verifiable data obtained from this process is used as part of an emergency notification system that provides emergency responders such as sudden cardiac arrest SCA responders in an organizational setting with immediate and accurate information identifying the nearest operationally ready medical device at the time of the emergency which information has heretofore never been available to emergency responders such as SCA responders.

The unique and verifiable data obtained from this process is used as part of an emergency notification system that provides emergency responders such as sudden cardiac arrest SCA responders in an organizational setting with immediate and accurate information identifying the nearest operationally ready medical device at the time of the emergency which information has heretofore never been available to emergency responders such as SCA responders.

Thus embodiments of the invention provide a bi directional system of accountability and management in which an emergency services provider can track the status of all its AEDs inform users of this status and allow the users to communicate maintenance results back to the provider. A pervasive problem in the industry is that this accountability is currently lacking. Within a given organization s emergency response team neither the organizers nor the potential responder has any idea of the status of devices for use in an emergency such as an AED.

Embodiments of the invention also provide a mobile application that ensures that emergency equipment such as an AED is verifiably physically inspected and properly maintained on a regular e.g. monthly basis. In this example the information regarding location and AED operational state is captured and linked to an emergency notification application to notify SCA responders to a victim of an SCA of the location of the nearest functioning AED see U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 269 030 filed May 2 2014 which application is incorporated herein in its entirety by this reference thereto .

While the invention is discussed in connection with AEDs those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention is equally applicable to any emergency equipment e.g. fire extinguishers first aid kits etc. Further while the invention is discussed in connection with SCAs those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention is equally application to any medical emergencies as well as non medical emergencies and all of their specific subsets. Accordingly the invention is not limited to AEDs or medical devices.

Central to the invention described herein is a database maintained by an emergency services management system which may be operated by a third party or by the emergency services provider and containing all of the AEDs for a given site such as a company campus. The database stores information such as serial number model name location and maintenance status. In embodiments of the invention the database accommodates characteristics of one or more of medical equipment supplies medications and non medical equipment and or supplies.

4 Additional characteristics of equipment including brand description different sizes i.e. airways or gloves.

Each AED is equipped with a provider supplied label or other identification token in connection with its use at the emergency services user s company site. The label contains a label that can be scanned electronically such as a QR code barcode NFC or RFID tag and the like along with some readable text describing the AED and its location. A designated person can use the mobile app to scan the label and thus proceed with maintenance or be apprised of any anomalies with a given AED. In embodiments of the invention the data contained in a label comprises 

In addition to AEDs embodiments of the invention comprehend medical and or other complex kits which have a variety of contents including some requiring some not requiring expirations others with variable numbers etc. To register complex kits the database allows a selection process from a pre developed master list including all common types of emergency equipment supplies medications kits etc. An authorized user registers a complex kit by selecting from a master product list. The complex kit can reflect what the user already has or what the user would like to create. The user selects from master list or adds on if an item is not on the master list. Embodiments of the invention record the contents to provide the information for periodic inspections only or to procure user selections.

When the app prompts a user with Do you Have an Emergency the user responds No. At this point if the mobile user is authorized a screen appears with a list of AEDs in the site. Each entry in the list populated from the aforementioned database contains two elements the location and the status OK or Due of the AED. When the user clicks on an entry in the list an image of a camera is displayed and the user is asked to hold the camera up to the barcode. The barcode is scanned automatically. In other embodiments of the invention an NFC dialog etc. may be displayed by the app.

On a successful scan a maintenance checklist screen is displayed this screen is specific to a given AED model and contains a list of instructions. The user can also click on Show Image on the first instruction to get a pictorial representation of the AED and how to perform maintenance.

The user clicks on the appropriate radio button when the user is ready to communicate the maintenance results to the provider. If maintenance is unsuccessful the user must enter a description of the cause. There is also a link on the screen to telephone the provider. Once the user hits the Submit button the results are communicated back to the provider s database via a Web service.

There are also a number of instances where a scan does not bring up the maintenance screen. These include 

In all of these cases the app updates the maintenance status to Alert and calls a Web service to update the database to this effect. The Web service generates an email to the user indicating that the provider has been notified of the issue and that the user is to be contacted. Note that if the scanner is unable to read the barcode and the scanner never brings up either the maintenance screen or an error screen then the user can hit the Back button. This brings up a screen that allows the user to type in the serial number which is listed in the readable text next to the barcode. If the serial number matches a record in the database the proper checklist screen appears and the user can continue with maintenance.

In a user registers for the maintenance app . The app communicates using a Web service with an AED program management database verifies that the registrant is an authorized AED coordinator for that facility based on first name last name email address and mobile phone number and maintained in an AED program management database .

The app starts . The app communicates with the server using a Web service and requests a list of facility specific AEDs based on registration data previously entered and verified in the AED program management database. The server communicates with the app using a Web service and requests a list of facility specific AEDs from the AED maintenance database. If the registrant is an authorized AED coordinator an AED list appears. If not authorized no AED list appears and instead a more information screen appears .

The user selects an AED from the list . The app uses native and library code to control the device s camera function to take a picture of for example the QR code label on the AED .

The user scans the label on the selected AED . The app processes the label and extracts data embedded in label. The app compares the data with the AED selected from the list. If the label data matches the AED data stored in the AED program management database for the selected AED then the app populates a custom AED inspection checklist based on the manufacturer s recommendations for that make and model. If label data does not match AED selected then an error message appears on phone using code in the app e.g. Error Message label does not match selected AED machine. Incorrect location or AED not registered AED program management database .

The geo location of the authorized AED coordinator is captured by the AED maintenance smartphone app when they scan the label and the location is then reported to the AED program management database. This ensures that the AED being inspected is in the correct location and that the AED coordinator is in front of the AED at the time of the inspection .

Upon discovering the victim of an SCA a bystander can initiate an emergency notification to the trained responders in their facility using an alert app whether or not they are trained in emergency skills. The alert app and the AED maintenance smartphone app share the same database. Based on the victim s geo location the geo location of the facility s AEDs and the operational status recorded for each AED the AED program management database determines the location of the AED that is nearest to the victim s location and prioritizes AEDs on the basis of operational status. This allows the alert app to provide the location of the nearest functioning AED immediately to the facility s trained emergency medical responders via text message .

The geo location of each AED is captured by the AED maintenance smartphone app and recorded into the AED program management database when the AED is placed into service .

The alert app captures the geo location of the bystander and by inference the location of the victim .

The user completes and submits the AED inspection report . The AED program management database prioritizes the readiness of the AED into categories of Operational Alert pending or Not in service e.g. due to pad and or battery expirations or AED operation issues. This information is maintained along with the geo location of the AED .

If user indicates that that the AED passes inspection by selecting appropriate radio button then the app communicates with the AED program management database using a Web service and the maintenance record is updated in the AED program management database. If the AED does not pass inspection the user indicates that the AED fails and is provided with a text field to describe the issue. In all cases of AED failure to pass inspection the app communicates with the AED program management database information is stored in the database and the system sends a notification or email of the maintenance issue to responsible parties e.g. Alert AED requires service .

The app checks the battery and pad expiration dates for the AED . The app compares the current date with the battery and pad expiration dates contained in label data. If the battery and or pads have expired the app communicates with the AED maintenance database using a Web service and the system sends a notification email of the maintenance issue to responsible parties e.g. Alert AED requires service .

The AED program management database prioritizes the readiness of the AED into categories of Operational Alert pending or Not in service due to pad and or battery expiration or AED operation issues. This information is maintained along with the geo location of the AED .

Central to the invention described herein is a database maintained by the emergency services management system which may be operated by a third party or by the emergency services provider and which contains information for all of the AEDs for a given site such as a company campus. The database stores information such as serial number model name location and maintenance status. In embodiments of the invention the database accommodates characteristics of one or more of medical equipment supplies medications and non medical equipment and or supplies.

For example the database has many tables each table holding many defining characteristics that are drawn from to make an appropriate analysis e.g. a company table with unique company ID a person responder table each with unique person ID multiple training tables with unique session ids equipment configuration tables in which each piece of equipment has a specific equipment ID and equipment maintenance tables in which each inspection has a specific maintenance ID. The following discussion describes the system database structure as shown in which is a block schematic diagram showing a system database structure according to the invention.

AEDs are recorded in the database based on preconfigured company AED configuration and AED maintenance tables.

In the company table each parent company is assigned a unique company ID that includes defining characteristics such as address state and facilities. Each facility is recorded as a sub company of the parent company and is assigned a unique company ID associated with the parent company. The company table also includes defining characteristics for each facility such as address state and GPS coordinates. The GPS coordinates of each facility company sub company are mapped based on the physical address of the facility.

In the AED configuration table each AED is assigned a unique ID and additional defining characteristics such as GPS coordinates serial number specific location in the facility accessory expiration dates etc. The AEDs are statically related to a company usually a sub company and or facility via a company ID. A Web based user interface is used to register each AED including defining characteristics such as the specific location of the AED e.g. kitchen 10th floor West elevators. The specific GPS location of the AED is recorded during initial registration of the AED when the installer is physically present at the location of installation and is based on the geo location of the installer s phone. In embodiments of the invention the GPS location of the AED is re confirmed each month during an inspection.

The AED maintenance table stores maintenance data for each AED with defining characteristics such as the date of the inspection whether the inspection determined the AED was operational alerts generated the issue generated and the GPS location at which maintenance was performed. Each time a maintenance is performed the record is stored in the AED maintenance table with a unique maintenance ID. The maintenance is related to an AED via its unique AED ID.

In embodiments of the invention system tracking of responders involves a person responder table 21 and training tables 22.

Each responder is registered into the person table with a unique person ID that also includes defining characteristics such as email and cell phone number.

Each responder is related to a facility via the company ID that is established during initial registration for training.

A separate training table is created for each responder for emergency training courses with separate tables for online and skills completion for each course. This data is then related to the trainee via the unique person ID. Data in these tables determine which persons are the eligible responders who are to be notified in case of a particular emergency.

In operation a bystander at an emergency sends their GPS coordinates via a Web service to the emergency response notification system . The dynamic GPS location of the responder is obtained when a responder receives an emergency notification and indicates an intention to respond via an acknowledgement link on a mobile device.

The system prioritizes equipment and responders based on the distance time that they are from the victim. For example responders who are farther than three minutes away from the emergency scene are given lower priority and are notified only after responders and AEDs that have the best opportunity to impact clinical outcome are notified. The notion of nearest responder equipment is based on known clinical outcomes for a particular emergency based on response time. Because the distance time element varies per emergency a different formula for evaluation is used based on the type of emergency. In embodiments of the invention the emergency response notification system first calculates the distance time equivalent between the bystander and the responder . The emergency response notification system then calculates the distance time equivalent between the bystander and the AEDs located in the facility. The distance for the responder to retrieve the emergency equipment and bring it to the scene of the emergency must be less than the pre determined maximum time allowed for the response if the response is to be clinically efficacious. For example for sudden cardiac arrests this time is three minutes from collapse to first defibrillation. This translates to an approximately 1000 foot round trip i.e. running from the victim s side to get an AED 1000 feet away and return to the victim or 2000 feet one way. Embodiments of the invention consider only one way travel i.e. the distance taken when responder runs from a current location to retrieve the AED and then runs directly to the victim.

Responders are identified who are proximate to both AEDs and the scene of the emergency such that meet the distance and time requirements . If the responder is identified as located sufficiently near to the scene of the emergency then a notification is sent to the responder directing the responder to the location of AEDs that are identified as meeting the time and distance requirements. Responders who do not meet the time and distance criteria are not alerted AEDs that do no meet the time and distance criteria are not considered.

Prior to sending the notification the AEDs are assessed for their operational readiness. The emergency equipment identified as meeting the time and distance requirements is assessed prioritized based on its operational status. First the rules engine queries the AED configuration table to assess whether the nearest AEDs selected have accessories within their expiration period. Next the rules engine queries the AED maintenance table to determine the date of the last successful maintenance inspection and to confirm the GPS location of the AED.

Priority 1. Emergency equipment that has been inspected and deemed operational within past thirty days whose location has been confirmed and for which all accessories are within a recorded expiration period.

Priority 2. Emergency equipment that has been inspected and deemed operational within past sixty days whose location has been confirmed and for which all accessories are within their recorded expiration period.

Unavailable emergency equipment . A designation of non compliance is rendered under the following conditions and the AED is not provided as a selection to the responder if 

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the foregoing discussion provides an example of the invention used in connection with AEDs. The invention is applicable to any other type of emergency equipment. Further the intervals for inspection etc. are provided in view of a presently preferred embodiment of the invention. Thus other intervals for inspection can be established as appropriate.

In embodiments of the invention a communication mechanism between the mobile app and the provider s database is in the form of RESTful Web services REST short for Representational State Transfer is a stateless resource oriented client server model that makes explicit use of HTTP methods . The data transfer protocol is JSON Java Script Object Notation the mobile app sends request data in this format and parses the similarly formatted response data. In embodiments of the invention there are three Web services that make up AED maintenance the AED list service the AED maintenance service and the AED error service.

After initial registration has been started the app invokes the AED list service. This service runs asynchronously because the user should not experience any apparent delays while the app is running. This service is also called when the app is restarted by the mobile operating system because cell phones are constantly pausing resuming and restarting apps this insures that the user sees the latest state of the database. The list service takes a facility id and an authorization as input. Not everyone in an organization has AED maintenance privileges and therefore the authorization scheme serves to prevent the AED list from displaying for those users. For those users with the proper authorization the AED list is populated with records from the database.

When the user clicks on a given row in the AED list the app brings up the scanner. In embodiments of the invention the software library for the scanner is an open source library called ZXing.Net.Mobile which is based on the ZXing library pronounced Zebra Crossing . The app scans the barcode and if the scan is successful it parses the information it retrieved and saves the various pieces internally. It does sanity checks and if there are errors such as a battery and or pad expiration date is earlier than today or there is a mismatch of some kind then the app puts up an error screen and calls the AED error service discussed below .

As previously mentioned on a successful scan the user sees the maintenance checklist. Once maintenance is performed either successfully or not the user clicks the Submit button which calls the AED maintenance service. The app passes the following parameters to the AED maintenance service 

The database is updated based on these values. In the case of a maintenance error the AED maintenance service generates an AED Alert Confirmation email. The email contains information about who reported the error in which site the error occurred the location where the error occurred and the error message that the user entered in the app. In the case of scanning error e.g. not a proprietary barcode scanning mismatch or component expiration the app calls the AED error service. The error service accepts the following parameters 

No database update happens here but the error service generates an AED maintenance error report email which is sent to both the provider and the user. The email contains information about who reported the error in which site the error occurred the app revision and the error message.

The AED maintenance smartphone application uses a secure database that maintains a hierarchy of facilities responsible parties and AED asset data. For each AED the data maintained includes for example 

10 The contact information for the responsible party at that facility including first and last name phone number email address and physical address.

An electronically readable label such as a QR code barcode NFC or RFID tag is placed on each AED and or AED cabinet when each machine is installed. The label contains essential AED asset data that can include any asset data stored in the database including for example serial number location make model and pad and battery expiration dates. Identifying text is also printed on the label to assist with immediate identification such as location make and model and serial number. The text serves as a failsafe if the label is not readable.

AED coordinators responsible for AED maintenance at their facility download the AED maintenance smartphone application from for example the Android or iPhone app stores onto their smartphones. The AED coordinators register using their organization s predetermined code. Next they localize themselves into their facility which is facilitated by a drop down menu. Additionally the AED coordinators enter their smartphone telephone number which is then stored in the database. The database recognizes the user as being authorized or not authorized to view and manage AEDs at their facility based on their first name last name and email address. The AED coordinator s authorization and list of AEDs is linked to their smartphone number. No individual except the responsible party has access to that list either in the database or on their smartphones. In embodiments of the invention authorized users may include a single person per facility one person may be authorized for multiple facilities and any number of persons may be authorized for any number of facilities as desired.

To perform an inspection the inspector must be pre authorized by his organization. Hierarchical access to information is recorded in the database. Otherwise. the inspector cannot receive any object data. While the primary storage of all equipment related location characteristics and operational status data is located on a database server the authorized inspector maintains a local cache of data on his mobile device relating to objects under his authorization that is periodically synched with the database.

On a periodic e.g. monthly basis the AED program management system sends the AED coordinator an email notification and a text notification to complete the required AED maintenance. The mobile application adds an important layer of accountability to the currently available AED program management systems. Instead of an unverified reply to an electronic message the AED maintenance smartphone application verifies that the AED coordinator is physically present at the AED s location. Specifically the mobile application requires the responsible party to scan the QR code that has been placed on the AED and or its cabinet.

Upon receiving notification to perform maintenance the AED coordinator opens the mobile application. An authorized AED coordinator then views a display of their AEDs listed by location.

The AED coordinator travels to one of the AED locations displayed on the screen. The user selects an AED by clicking on its location. Upon clicking on the AED a scanner pops up and allows the AED coordinator to scan the QR code. If the QR code matches the expected data in the AED management database a brief inspection procedure appears on the mobile application. The inspection procedure is customized to meet the requirements of each manufacturer s make and model. The app includes clickable custom images to assist the AED coordinator to properly find view and interpret the ready light. The inspection of the ready light indicates that the AED is or is not working properly based on its daily self checks.

Once the inspection procedure appears the AED coordinator completes the process displayed on the screen and has two options depending on the inspection s outcome. The AED Coordinator can either 

If the requirements are not met the AED coordinator is prompted to type in a brief description of the problem and then submit a request for assistance. The AED coordinator s request for assistance is immediately uploaded to the AED program management database and provided as an alert to the AED program management vendor who monitors the AED management program.

If an alert is received AED personnel from the organization s AED management program service provider call the AED coordinator within for example 24 hours to assist with the detected AED issue. In addition to sending a request for assistance the AED coordinator may call directly from the mobile application if a problem is detected that requires immediate attention.

An alert notification is sent to the organization s AED management program service provider. The user is given the option of calling the AED management program service provider directly from the application or receiving assistance initiated by the AED program management service provider within the next for example 24 hours.

Scanning the label a requirement for completing the maintenance provides true accountability that the AED coordinator has actually physically attended and inspected the AED. If the AED coordinator fails to scan the label complete the inspection checklist and click the appropriate radio button indicating the status of the AED then the AED program management database continues to display the AED s status as Due and still requires maintenance.

When AED maintenance has not been performed within the prescribed time period a member of the responsible vendor team of AED program specialists calls the AED coordinator directly and repeatedly until maintenance has been completed.

In addition the AED coordinator continues to receive notification emails and texts until the required maintenance is performed. If the AED coordinator cannot be reached within a prescribed period of time the AED program specialist contacts the responsible organization s AED program manager to determine whether the individual is still at the facility or whether a new AED coordinator must be appointed and educated about the process.

An additional feature of the mobile application is the ability to communicate status and requirements with other departments or personnel involved in an organization s AED management program. AED alerts can be sent to 

1 The purchasing agent to prompt ordering and shipping new replacement parts e.g. for expired pads and batteries 

4 The organizational managers to ensure that they are aware of the status of the AEDs in the company and

Prior to this mobile application no mechanism existed to ensure the accountability that those charged with AED maintenance actually perform the required physical inspections. Nor has there been a mechanism that accurately records and reports the correlation between the physical location of the AED its serial number and pad and battery expirations.

The geo location of each AED is captured by the smartphone app and recorded into the database when the AED is placed into service. The geo location of the responsible party is captured from their smartphone when the label is scanned and then reported to the database. Embodiments of the invention verify that visual inspection has actually been performed for the AED that is expected to be at that location.

The ability to locate AEDs precisely assists manufacturers of AEDs to locate AEDs that are under FDA recall. The FDA issues recalls when it determines that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that certain AEDs are defective requiring repair or replacement. Since 2005 there have been 68 AED recalls including 17 Class I recalls most severe warnings affecting 385 922 AEDs. It has been difficult if not impossible for OEMs to repair and replace many of these AEDs due to poor tracking of critical location data.

Because the important responsibility of maintaining functioning AEDs is assigned primarily to volunteer members of the workforce the app was designed to be simple to use have a clear and user friendly interface and must minimize the time required to perform maintenance. The automated reporting feature allows the mobile application to report directly to the database as well as to parties who are responsible for resolving outstanding issues. The app enhances communication between responsible parties and ensures accurate recording of the status of AED assets.

The mobile application must be supported by knowledgeable personnel who timely deal with AED issues that are identified and a strict regimen of personal follow up must occur when maintenance is not performed.

Different mechanisms can be used to ensure that the inspector is geographically located near the object e.g. the AED requiring inspection and that the object is the intended object. In embodiments of the invention a mechanism is used that ensures that the inspector who is assessing operational condition is geographically located near and is hierarchically authorized to inspect the device and or object that requires periodic inspection.

When responding to an emergency the location of the object is provided to responding user including for example its text location its location on a map its location on a blue print with guidance such as Waze with step by step directional assistance with a GPS image with voice prompts etc.

While the discussion herein concerns an embodiment of the invention that is concerned with AEDs the invention has broad applicability to any emergency and or medical equipment supplies etc. The equipment supplies etc. are referred to generically herein as objects. The object is an item or information or anything else that is required during an emergency. During medical emergencies the object can be an AED a first aid kit a medical kit medication injury specific kits gurneys stretchers splints other medical supplies or any piece of emergency medical equipment supply or medication. During a non medical emergency an object can include a fire extinguisher evacuation equipment such as stair chairs radios other communication equipment vests flags bullhorns flashlights search and rescue equipment etc.

In embodiment of the invention information is gathered from the periodic inspection. A primary purpose of confirming geographic location and operational status is to provide an object during an emergency to responding emergency personnel.

A primary purpose in gathering and ensuring the operational status of the object is to provide the location and operational status of the equipment to responding emergency personnel in a workplace. Relying on an emergency app such as the EU Alert app the location and operational status of the equipment is communicated via for example text SMS voice etc. to a layperson responder in a workplace who is notified of an emergency and then responds. The emergency responder often needs to bring medical equipment or other emergency equipment and or supplies to the emergency and can be informed immediately of such object s confirmed location and its operational status.

The equipment is selected based on the type of emergency the role of the responder the actions specified by the organization s emergency response plan and then assessed by a rules engine as to its operational status. The object is selected based on its proximity to the emergency and the particular emergency responder who has acknowledged that he is responding.

The operational status is determined by preconfigured rules that ensure that the responder is not directed to equipment that has not been confirmed as being in a specific location or that has not been recently inspected or that has expired accessories or that has been determined to have an issue pending resolution.

During the initial installation of the object the authorized individual registers the object at its intended static location. Registration includes a text description of the location. Additionally the user s mobile device establishes the GPS or other electronically determined geo location of the device. Subsequent inspections rely on either or both of the text description of the location and the recorded GPS location.

A mobile device e.g. a smartphone etc. locally stores the pre configured specific location of the object e.g. emergency response equipment supply medication tool etc. as well as its registered characteristics. These characteristics can include serial number equipment type brand description location point of contact expiration dates last use etc.

The inspector receives a periodic notification e.g. via text SMS or email to inspect the object. The inspector who is authorized by the database is provided with information regarding the locations of the objects to be inspected on the user s app interface for example building 10A fifth floor conference room. Upon reaching a selected object. The mobile device confirms the GPS location of the inspector and the GPS location of the object. The authorized user is presented with the pre established inspection tool dependent on the object type brand etc. The data includes expiration of the object or its accessories supplies or medications the quantity the contents if a kit last inspection date and operation status prior to current inspection.

Embodiments of the invention also provide for the automatic procurement of a series of shipping receipt installation and or confirmation emails. Thus when maintenance is performed and content expires a series of emails is triggered for example because the AED pads have been ordered. This lets the coordinator know that such supplies etc. are to be replaced depending on who places the order for such supplies and allows the order and its progress to be tracked in connection for example with the replacement supplies.

In another instance the relationship between the inspector and the object is established using i beacon technology attached to the object that communicates with the mobile device with or without GPS. Alternatively the relationship between the inspector and the object is established using any of NFC technology that communicates with the mobile device object scanning and or recognition software with or without GPS barcodes and or QR codes affixed to the object with or without GPS and RFID or audio and or light sensors that are part of or attached or affixed to the object with or without GPS.

The location of the equipment is confirmed periodically most commonly monthly that it is located where it was registered or where it was officially moved to and re registered. This ensures that emergency responders do not try to retrieve equipment that has been moved or that has operational problems. If necessary the emergency responder can then be sent to other equipment supplies etc.

Another purpose of confirming geographic location is to detect equipment that has been moved taken out of service or that is otherwise not in the anticipated location and then to remedy the situation.

Another purpose for confirming operational status is to resolve the issue and make the unit operational again for example if the object requires replacement of accessory parts. Otherwise at the time of an emergency the object is found to be defective or non operational or the contents of the object are found to have been used and require replacement. In such cases the inspector can send an alert stating that the inspection did not meet its requirements and some requirement must be addressed.

Embodiments of the invention provide for brand specific checklists images and or prompts. For example brand specific maintenance checklists and information are provided for AED s and other equipment and contents of equipment e.g. an AED manufacture specific maintenance checklist is pro vided as per the manufacture s recommendation in which the images can be brand specific.

Also included are tutorials for how to perform variety of maintenance task as appropriate e.g. a tutorial on how to use the app and or brand specific instructions on how to install any replacement accessories.

The mobile application herein disclosed provides detailed information regarding the operational status of the AED to the AED program management database. This allows the database to prioritize the readiness of the AED into categories of 

This prioritization allows an emergency alert system such as EU Alert to notify trained responders to an SCA of the location of the nearest functioning AED based on a hierarchy of readiness which is a process that does not exist in any other system.

Upon discovering the victim of an SCA a bystander whether or not they are trained in emergency skills can initiate an emergency notification to the trained responders in their facility using EU Alert. EU Alert captures the geo location of the bystander and by inference the location of the victim. The AED maintenance app captures the geo location of each AED and stores the information in the AED program management database. In embodiments of the invention EU Alert and the AED maintenance smartphone application share the same database. Based on the victim s geo location the geo location of the facility s AEDs and the operational status recorded for each AED the AED program management database determines the location of the AED that is nearest to the victim s location and prioritizes AEDs on the basis of operational status. This allows the EU Alert app to provide the location of the nearest functioning AED to the facility s trained emergency medical responders immediately via text message.
