Provided are modified FIX polypeptides. The FIX polypeptides are modified to exhibit improved properties such as increased coagulant activity compared to unmodified FIX polypeptides. Also provided are nucleic acid molecules encoding these polypeptides and methods of using the modified FIX polypeptides.

Recombinantly produced Factor IX FIX polypeptides have been approved for treatment of hemophilia in particular hemophilia B. Also of therapeutic interest are FIX polypeptides that exhibit anticoagulant activities useful in the treatment of thrombolytic diseases. Hence FIX like other coagulation factors are important therapeutic agents for procoagulant and anticoagulation therapies. There is a need for FIX polypeptides for therapeutic use. Therefore among the objects herein it is an object to provide modified FIX polypeptides that are designed to have improved therapeutic properties.

Provided are modified FIX polypeptides. The modified FIX polypeptides provided have improved procoagulant therapeutic properties compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide. For example among the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein are those that exhibit increased coagulant activity increased catalytic activity increased resistance to AT III heparin and or the AT III heparin complex and or improved pharmacokinetic properties such as i decreased clearance ii altered e.g. increased or decreased volume of distribution iii enhanced in vivo recovery iv enhanced total protein exposure in vivo i.e. AUC v increased serum half life and or phase and or vi increased mean resonance time MRT . In some examples the improved pharmacokinetic properties are a result of increased glycosylation and or decreased binding to the low density lipoprotein receptor related protein LRP . Also provided are nucleic acids encoding the modified FIX polypeptides and methods of using the modified FIX polypeptides such as for treatment of bleeding disorders.

Unless defined otherwise all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as is commonly understood by one of skill in the art to which the invention s belong. All patents patent applications published applications and publications Genbank sequences databases websites and other published materials referred to throughout the entire disclosure herein unless noted otherwise are incorporated by reference in their entirety. In the event that there are a plurality of definitions for terms herein those in this section prevail.

As used herein coagulation pathway or coagulation cascade refers to the series of activation events that leads to the formation of an insoluble fibrin clot. In the coagulation cascade or pathway an inactive protein of a serine protease also called a zymogen is converted to an active protease by cleavage of one or more peptide bonds which then serves as the activating protease for the next zymogen molecule in the cascade. In the final proteolytic step of the cascade fibrinogen is proteolytically cleaved by thrombin to fibrin which is then crosslinked at the site of injury to form a clot.

As used herein hemostasis refers to the stopping of bleeding or blood flow in an organ or body part. The term hemostasis can encompass the entire process of blood clotting to prevent blood loss following blood vessel injury to subsequent dissolution of the blood clot following tissue repair.

As used herein clotting or coagulation refers to the formation of an insoluble fibrin clot or the process by which the coagulation factors of the blood interact in the coagulation cascade ultimately resulting in the formation of an insoluble fibrin clot.

As used herein a protease is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of covalent peptidic bonds. These designations include zymogen forms and activated single two and multiple chain forms thereof. For clarity references to proteases refer to all forms. Proteases include for example serine proteases cysteine proteases aspartic proteases threonine and metallo proteases depending on the catalytic activity of their active site and mechanism of cleaving peptide bonds of a target substrate.

As used herein serine proteases or serine endopeptidases refer to a class of peptidases which are characterized by the presence of a serine residue in the active site of the enzyme. Serine proteases participate in a wide range of functions in the body including blood clotting and inflammation as well as functioning as digestive enzymes in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The mechanism of cleavage by serine proteases is based on nucleophilic attack of a targeted peptidic bond by a serine. Cysteine threonine or water molecules associated with aspartate or metals also can play this role. Aligned side chains of serine histidine and aspartate form a catalytic triad common to most serine proteases. The active site of serine proteases is shaped as a cleft where the polypeptide substrate binds.

As used herein a factor IX or FIX polypeptide refers to any factor IX polypeptide including but not limited to a recombinantly produced polypeptide a synthetically produced polypeptide and a factor IX polypeptide extracted or isolated from cells or tissues including but not limited to liver and blood. Alternative names that are used interchangeably for factor IX include Factor 9 Christmas factor plasma thromboplastin component PTC coagulation factor IX and serum factor IX. Abbreviations for factor IX include FIX and F9. Factor IX includes related polypeptides from different species including but not limited to animals of human and non human origin. Human factor IX hFIX includes factor IX allelic variant isoforms such as the allelic variant having a T148A SEQ ID NO 20 or 325 or T412P mutation synthetic molecules from nucleic acids protein isolated from human tissue and cells and modified forms thereof. Exemplary unmodified mature human factor IX polypeptides include but are not limited to unmodified and wild type native factor IX polypeptides such as the polypeptide containing a sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 and the unmodified and wild type precursor factor IX polypeptide that includes a propeptide and or a signal peptide such as the precursor FIX polypeptide that has the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO 2 . One of skill in the art would recognize that the referenced positions of the mature factor IX polypeptide SEQ ID NO 3 differ by 46 amino acid residues when compared to the precursor FIX polypeptide SEQ ID NO 2 which is the factor IX polypeptide containing the signal peptide and propeptide sequences Thus the first amino acid residue of SEQ ID NO 3 corresponds to the forty seventh 47 amino acid residue of SEQ ID NO 2.

The term factor IX also encompasses the activated form of the factor IX polypeptide called factor IXa FIXa containing the FIX light chain corresponding to amino acids 47 191 of SEQ ID NO 2 and amino acids 1 145 of SEQ ID NO 3 and FIX heavy chain corresponding to amino acids 227 461 of SEQ ID NO 2 and amino acids 181 415 of SEQ ID NO 3 linked by a disulfide bond between residues 132C and 289C corresponding to the mature FIX polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 . FIXa is produced from a mature FIX polypeptide e.g. that set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 by proteolytic cleavage after amino acid residues R145 and R180. Proteolytic cleavage can be carried out for example by activated factor XI FXIa or the tissue factor activated factor VII TF FVIIa complex. The FIX polypeptides provided herein can be further modified such as by chemical modification or post translational modification. Such modifications include but are not limited to glycosylation pegylation albumination farnysylation carboxylation hydroxylation phosphorylation and other polypeptide modifications known in the art.

Factor IX includes factor IX from any species including human and non human species. FIX polypeptides of non human origin include but are not limited to murine canine feline leporine avian bovine ovine porcine equine piscine ranine and other primate factor IX polypeptides. Exemplary FIX polypeptides of non human origin include for example chimpanzee SEQ ID NO 4 rhesus macaque SEQ ID NO 5 mouse SEQ ID NO 6 rat SEQ ID NO 7 Guinea pig SEQ ID NO 8 pig SEQ ID NO 9 dog SEQ ID NO 10 cat SEQ ID NO 11 rabbit SEQ ID NO 12 chicken SEQ ID NO 13 cow SEQ ID NO 14 sheep SEQ ID NO 15 frog SEQ ID NO 16 zebrafish SEQ ID NO 17 and Japanese pufferfish SEQ ID NO 18 .

Reference to FIX polypeptides also includes precursor polypeptides and mature FIX polypeptides in single chain or two chain forms truncated forms thereof that have activity and includes allelic variants and species variants variants encoded by splice variants and other variants including polypeptides that have at least 40 45 50 55 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 96 97 98 99 or more sequence identity to the precursor polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO 2 or the mature form thereof SEQ ID NO 3 . Included are modified FIX polypeptides such as those of SEQ ID NOS 75 272 and 326 417 and variants thereof. Also included are those that retain at least an activity of a FIX such as FVIIIa binding factor X binding phospholipid binding and or coagulant activity of a FIX polypeptide. By retaining activity the activity can be altered such as reduced or increased as compared to a wild type FIX so long as the level of activity retained is sufficient to yield a detectable effect. FIX polypeptides include but are not limited to tissue specific isoforms and allelic variants thereof synthetic molecules prepared by translation of nucleic acids proteins generated by chemical synthesis such as syntheses that include ligation of shorter polypeptides through recombinant methods proteins isolated from human and non human tissue and cells chimeric FIX polypeptides and modified forms thereof. FIX polypeptides also include fragments or portions of FIX that are of sufficient length or include appropriate regions to retain at least one activity upon activation if needed of a full length mature polypeptide. FIX polypeptides also include those that contain chemical or posttranslational modifications and those that do not contain chemical or posttranslational modifications. Such modifications include but are not limited to pegylation albumination glycosylation farnysylation carboxylation hydroxylation phosphorylation and other polypeptide modifications known in the art.

As used herein corresponding residues refers to residues that occur at aligned loci. Related or variant polypeptides are aligned by any method known to those of skill in the art. Such methods typically maximize matches and include methods such as using manual alignments and by using the numerous alignment programs available for example BLASTP and others known to those of skill in the art. By aligning the sequences of polypeptides one skilled in the art can identify corresponding residues using conserved and identical amino acid residues as guides. For example by aligning the sequences of factor IX polypeptides one of skill in the art can identify corresponding residues using conserved and identical amino acid residues as guides. For example the tyrosine in amino acid position 1 Y1 of SEQ ID NO 3 mature factor IX corresponds to the tyrosine in amino acid position 47 Y47 of SEQ ID NO 2. In other instances corresponding regions can be identified. For example the Gla domain corresponds to amino acid positions Y1 through V46 of SEQ ID NO 3 and to amino acid positions Y47 through V92 of SEQ ID NO 2. One skilled in the art also can employ conserved amino acid residues as guides to find corresponding amino acid residues between and among human and non human sequences. For example amino acid residues Q11 and P74 of SEQ ID NO 3 human correspond to R11 and Q74 of SEQ ID NO 14 bovine . Corresponding positions also can be based on structural alignments for example by using computer simulated alignments of protein structure. In other instances corresponding regions can be identified.

As used herein the same with reference to an amino acid replacement refers to the identical replacement at the reference amino acid position in SEQ ID NO 3 in a corresponding position in another Factor IX polypeptide. For example the same replacement with reference to the replacement of tyrosine at amino acid residue R318 in SEQ ID NO 3 is the replacement of tyrosine at amino acid residue R319 in SEQ ID NO 14 see for example . For example the same replacement with reference to the replacement of asparagine at amino acid residue E410 in SEQ ID NO 3 is the replacement of asparagine at amino acid residue S410 in SEQ ID NO 366. It is understood that reference to replacement of the same amino acid refers to replacement of amino acid residues that differ at the corresponding position from the replaced residue.

As used herein a proregion propeptide or pro sequence refers to a region or a segment that is cleaved to produce a mature protein. This can include segments that function to suppress proteolytic activity by masking the catalytic machinery and thus preventing formation of the catalytic intermediate i.e. by sterically occluding the substrate binding site . A proregion is a sequence of amino acids positioned at the amino terminus of a mature biologically active polypeptide and can be as little as a few amino acids or can be a multidomain structure.

As used herein mature factor IX refers to a FIX polypeptide that lacks a signal sequence and a propeptide sequence. Typically a signal sequence targets a protein for secretion via the endoplasmic reticulum ER golgi pathway and is cleaved following insertion into the ER during translation. A propeptide sequence typically functions in post translational modification of the protein and is cleaved prior to secretion of the protein from the cell. Thus a mature FIX polypeptide is typically a secreted protein. In one example a mature human FIX polypeptide is set forth in SEQ ID NO 3. The amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 differs from that of the precursor polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO 2 in that SEQ ID NO 3 is lacking the signal sequence which corresponds to amino acid residues 1 28 of SEQ ID NO 2 and also lacks the propeptide sequence which corresponds to amino acid residues 29 46 of SEQ ID NO 2. Reference to a mature FIX polypeptide encompasses the single chain zymogen form and the two chain form. Thus reference to a mature FIX polypeptide also refers to the two chain form containing the heavy chain and light chain without the activation peptide corresponding to amino acids 192 226 of SEQ ID NO 2 joined by disulfide bonds.

As used herein wild type or native with reference to FIX refers to a FIX polypeptide encoded by a native or naturally occurring FIX gene including allelic variants that is present in an organism including a human and other animals in nature. Reference to wild type factor IX without reference to a species is intended to encompass any species of a wild type factor IX. Included among wild type FIX polypeptides are the encoded precursor polypeptide fragments thereof and processed forms thereof such as a mature form lacking the signal peptide as well as any pre or post translationally processed or modified forms thereof. Also included among native FIX polypeptides are those that are post translationally modified including but not limited to modification by glycosylation carboxylation and hydroxylation. Native FIX polypeptides also include single chain and two chain forms. For example humans express native FIX. The amino acid sequence of exemplary wild type human FIX are set forth in SEQ ID NOS 2 and 3 and allelic variants thereof. Other animals produce native FIX including but not limited to chimpanzee SEQ ID NO 4 rhesus macaque SEQ ID NO 5 mouse SEQ ID NO 6 rat SEQ ID NO 7 Guinea pig SEQ ID NO 8 pig SEQ ID NO 9 dog SEQ ID NO 10 cat SEQ ID NO 11 rabbit SEQ ID NO 12 chicken SEQ ID NO 13 cow SEQ ID NO 14 sheep SEQ ID NO 15 frog SEQ ID NO 16 zebrafish SEQ ID NO 17 Japanese pufferfish SEQ ID NO 18 .

As used herein species variants refer to variants in polypeptides among different species including different mammalian species such as mouse and human.

As used herein a splice variant refers to a variant produced by differential processing of a primary transcript of genomic DNA that results in more than one type of mRNA.

As used herein a zymogen refers to a protease that is activated by proteolytic cleavage including maturation cleavage such as activation cleavage and or complex formation with other protein s and or cofactor s . A zymogen is an inactive precursor of a proteolytic enzyme. Such precursors are generally larger although not necessarily larger than the active form. With reference to serine proteases zymogens are converted to active enzymes by specific cleavage including catalytic and autocatalytic cleavage or by binding of an activating co factor which generates an active enzyme. For example generally zymogens are present in a single chain form. Zymogens generally are inactive and can be converted to mature active polypeptides by catalytic or autocatalytic cleavage at one or more proteolytic sites to generate a multi chain such as a two chain polypeptide. A zymogen thus is an enzymatically inactive protein that is converted to a proteolytic enzyme by the action of an activator. Cleavage can be effected by autoactivation. A number of coagulation proteins are zymogens they are inactive but become cleaved and activated upon the initiation of the coagulation system following vascular damage. With reference to FIX the FIX polypeptides exist in the blood plasma as zymogens until cleavage by proteases such as for example activated FXI FXIa or FVIIa in association with TF to produce the two chain form of FIX FIXa .

As used herein an activation sequence refers to a sequence of amino acids in a zymogen that is the site required for activation cleavage or maturation cleavage to form an active protease. Cleavage of an activation sequence can be catalyzed autocatalytically or by activating partners.

As used herein activation cleavage is a type of maturation cleavage which induces a conformation change that is required for the development of full enzymatic activity. This is a classical activation pathway for example for serine proteases in which a cleavage generates a new N terminus that interacts with the conserved regions of the protease such as Asp194 in chymotrypsin to induce conformational changes required for activity. Activation can result in production of multi chain forms of the proteases. In some instances single chain forms of the protease can exhibit proteolytic activity.

As used herein activated Factor IX or FIXa refers to any two chain form of a FIXa polypeptide. A two chain form typically results from proteolytic cleavage but can be produced synthetically. Activated Factor IX thus includes the zymogen like two chain form with low coagulant activity a fully activated form that occurs upon binding to FVIIIa and FX and mutated forms that exist in a fully activated two chain form or undergo conformational change to a fully activated form. For example a single chain form of FIX polypeptide see e.g. SEQ ID NO 3 is proteolytically cleaved after amino acid residues R145 and R180 of the mature FIX polypeptide. The cleavage products FIX heavy chain and FIX light chain which are held together by a disulfide bond between amino acid residues 132C and 289C in the FIX of SEQ ID NO 3 form the two chain activated FIX enzyme. Proteolytic cleavage can be carried out for example by activated factor XIa FXIa and activated factor VIIa FVIIa in complex with TF.

As used herein a property of a FIX polypeptide refers to a physical or structural property such three dimensional structure pI half life conformation and other such physical characteristics.

As used herein an activity of a FIX polypeptide refers to any activity exhibited by a factor IX polypeptide. Such activities can be tested in vitro and or in vivo and include but are not limited to coagulation or coagulant activity pro coagulant activity proteolytic or catalytic activity such as to effect factor X FX activation antigenicity ability to bind to or compete with a polypeptide for binding to an anti FIX antibody ability to bind factor VIIIa or factor X and or ability to bind to phospholipids. Activity can be assessed in vitro or in vivo using recognized assays for example by measuring coagulation in vitro or in vivo. The results of such assays indicate that a polypeptide exhibits an activity that can be correlated to activity of the polypeptide in vivo in which in vivo activity can be referred to as biological activity. Assays to determine functionality or activity of modified forms of FIX are known to those of skill in the art. Exemplary assays to assess the activity of a FIX polypeptide include prothromboplastin time PT assay or the activated partial thromboplastin time aPTT assay to assess coagulant activity or chromogenic assays using synthetic substrates to assess catalytic or proteolytic activity.

As used herein exhibits at least one activity or retains at least one activity refers to the activity exhibited by a modified FIX polypeptide as compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide of the same form and under the same conditions. For example a modified FIX polypeptide in a two chain form is compared with an unmodified FIX polypeptide in a two chain form under the same experimental conditions where the only difference between the two polypeptides is the modification under study. In another example a modified FIX polypeptide in a single chain form is compared with an unmodified FIX polypeptide in a single chain form under the same experimental conditions where the only difference between the two polypeptides is the modification under study. Typically a modified FIX polypeptide that retains or exhibits at least one activity of an unmodified FIX polypeptide of the same form retains a sufficient amount of the activity such that when administered in vivo the modified FIX polypeptide is therapeutically effective as a procoagulant therapeutic. Generally for a modified FIX polypeptide to retain therapeutic efficacy as a procoagulant the amount of activity that is retained is or is about 0.5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 200 300 400 500 or more of the activity of an unmodified FIX polypeptide of the same form that displays therapeutic efficacy as a procoagulant. The amount of activity that is required to maintain therapeutic efficacy as a procoagulant can be empirically determined if necessary. Typically retention of 0.5 to 20 0.5 to 10 0.5 to 5 of an activity is sufficient to retain therapeutic efficacy as a procoagulant in vivo.

It is understood that the activity being exhibited or retained by a modified FIX polypeptide can be any activity including but not limited to coagulation or coagulant activity pro coagulant activity proteolytic or catalytic activity such as to effect factor X FX activation antigenicity ability to bind to or compete with a polypeptide for binding to an anti FIX antibody ability to bind factor VIIIa or factor X and or ability to bind to phospholipids. In some instances a modified FIX polypeptide can retain an activity that is increased compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide. In some cases a modified FIX polypeptide can retain an activity that is decreased compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide. Activity of a modified FIX polypeptide can be any level of percentage of activity of the unmodified polypeptide where both polypeptides are in the same form including but not limited to 1 of the activity 2 3 4 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 95 96 97 98 99 100 200 300 400 500 or more activity compared to the polypeptide that does not contain the modification at issue. For example a modified FIX polypeptide can exhibit increased or decreased activity compared to the unmodified FIX polypeptide in the same form. For example it can retain at least about or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 95 96 97 98 or at least 99 of the activity of the unmodified FIX polypeptide. In other embodiments the change in activity is at least about 2 times 3 times 4 times 5 times 6 times 7 times 8 times 9 times 10 times 20 times 30 times 40 times 50 times 60 times 70 times 80 times 90 times 100 times 200 times 300 times 400 times 500 times 600 times 700 times 800 times 900 times 1000 times or more times greater than unmodified FIX. The particular level to be retained is a function of the intended use of the polypeptide and can be empirically determined Activity can be measured for example using in vitro or in vivo assays such as those described herein.

As used herein coagulation activity or coagulant activity or pro coagulant activity refers to the ability of a polypeptide to effect coagulation. Assays to assess coagulant activity are known to those of skill in the art and include prothrombin time PT assay or the activated partial thromboplastin time aPTT assay.

As used herein catalytic activity or proteolytic activity with reference to FIX refers to the ability of a FIX protein to catalyze the proteolytic cleavage of a substrate and are used interchangeably. Assays to assess such activities are known in the art. For example the proteolytic activity of FIX can be measured using chromogenic substrates such as Mes CHD Gly Arg AMC where cleavage of the substrate is monitored by absorbance and the rate of substrate hydrolysis determined by linear regression.

As used herein domain typically a sequence of three or more generally 5 or 7 or more amino acids refers to a portion of a molecule such as proteins or the encoding nucleic acids that is structurally and or functionally distinct from other portions of the molecule and is identifiable. For example domains include those portions of a polypeptide chain that can form an independently folded structure within a protein made up of one or more structural motifs and or that is recognized by virtue of a functional activity such as proteolytic activity. A protein can have one or more than one distinct domains. For example a domain can be identified defined or distinguished by homology of the sequence therein to related family members such as homology to motifs that define a protease domain or a Gla domain. In another example a domain can be distinguished by its function such as by proteolytic activity or an ability to interact with a biomolecule such as DNA binding ligand binding and dimerization. A domain independently can exhibit a biological function or activity such that the domain independently or fused to another molecule can perform an activity such as for example proteolytic activity or ligand binding. A domain can be a linear sequence of amino acids or a non linear sequence of amino acids. Many polypeptides contain a plurality of domains. Such domains are known and can be identified by those of skill in the art. For exemplification herein definitions are provided but it is understood that it is well within the skill in the art to recognize particular domains by name. If needed appropriate software can be employed to identify domains.

As used herein a protease domain is the catalytically active portion of a protease. Reference to a protease domain of a protease includes the single two and multi chain forms of any of these proteins. A protease domain of a protein contains all of the requisite properties of that protein required for its proteolytic activity such as for example the catalytic center. In reference to FIX the protease domain shares homology and structural feature with the chymotrypsin trypsin family protease domains including the catalytic triad. For example in the mature FIX polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 the protease domain corresponds to amino acid positions 181 to 412.

As used herein a gamma carboxyglutamate Gla domain refers to the portion of a protein for example a vitamin K dependent protein that contains post translational modifications of glutamate residues generally most but not all of the glutamate residues by vitamin K dependent carboxylation to form Gla. The Gla domain is responsible for the high affinity binding of calcium ions and binding to negatively charged phospholipids. Typically the Gla domain starts at the N terminal extremity of the mature form of vitamin K dependent proteins and ends with a conserved aromatic residue. In a mature FIX polypeptide the Gla domain corresponds to amino acid positions 1 to 46 of the exemplary polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO 3. Gla domains are well known and their locus can be identified in particular polypeptides. The Gla domains of the various vitamin K dependent proteins share sequence structural and functional homology including the clustering of N terminal hydrophobic residues into a hydrophobic patch that mediates interaction with negatively charged phospholipids on the cell surface membrane. Exemplary other Gla containing polypeptides include but are not limited to FVII FX prothrombin protein C protein S osteocalcin matrix Gla protein Growth arrest specific protein 6 Gas6 and protein Z.

As used herein an epidermal growth factor EGF domain EGF 1 or EGF 2 refers to the portion of a protein that shares sequence homology to a specific 30 to 40 amino acid portion of the epidermal growth factor EGF sequence. The EGF domain includes six cysteine residues that have been shown in EGF to be involved in disulfide bonds. The main structure of an EGF domain is a two stranded beta sheet followed by a loop to a C terminal short two stranded sheet. FIX contains two EGF domains EGF 1 and EGF 2. These domains correspond to amino acid positions 47 83 and 84 125 respectively of the mature FIX polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO 3.

As used herein unmodified polypeptide or unmodified FIX and grammatical variations thereof refer to a starting polypeptide that is selected for modification as provided herein. The starting polypeptide can be a naturally occurring wild type form of a polypeptide. In addition the starting polypeptide can be altered or mutated such that it differs from a native wild type isoform but is nonetheless referred to herein as a starting unmodified polypeptide relative to the subsequently modified polypeptides produced herein. Thus existing proteins known in the art that have been modified to have a desired increase or decrease in a particular activity or property compared to an unmodified reference protein can be selected and used as the starting unmodified polypeptide. For example a protein that has been modified from its native form by one or more single amino acid changes and possesses either an increase or decrease in a desired property such as a change in a amino acid residue or residues to alter glycosylation can be a target protein referred to herein as unmodified for further modification of either the same or a different property. Exemplary modified FIX polypeptides known in the art include any FIX polypeptide described in for example Schuettrumpf et al. 2005 105 6 2316 23 Melton et al. 2001 12 4 237 43 Cheung et al. 1992 267 20529 20531 Cheung et al. 1996 93 11068 11073 Hopfner et al. 1997 16 6626 6635 Sichler et al. 2003 278 4121 4126 Begbie et al. 2005 94 6 1138 47 Chang J. et al. 1998 273 20 12089 94 Yang L. et al. 2002 277 52 50756 60 Yang L. et al. 2003 278 27 25032 8 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 969 040 5 621 039 6 423 826 7 125 841 6 017 882 6 531 298 U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 20030211094 20070254840 20080188414 2008000422 20080050772 20080146494 20080050772 20080187955 20040254106 20050147618 20080280818 20080102115 20080167219 and 20080214461 and International Patent Publication Nos.

As used herein modified factor IX polypeptides and modified factor IX refer to a FIX polypeptide that has one or more amino acid differences compared to an unmodified factor IX polypeptide. The one or more amino acid differences can be amino acid mutations such as one or more amino acid replacements substitutions insertions or deletions or can be insertions or deletions of entire domains and any combinations thereof. Typically a modified FIX polypeptide has one or more modifications in primary sequence compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide. For example a modified FIX polypeptide provided herein can have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 30 40 50 or more amino acid differences compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide. Any modification is contemplated as long as the resulting polypeptide exhibits at least one FIX activity associated with a native FIX polypeptide such as for example catalytic activity proteolytic activity the ability to bind FVIIIa or the ability to bind phospholipids.

As used herein antithrombin III or AT III is a serine protease inhibitor serpin . AT III is synthesized as a precursor protein containing 464 amino acid residues SEQ ID NO 21 that is cleaved during secretion to release a 432 amino acid mature antithrombin SEQ ID NO 22 .

As used herein heparin refers to a heterogeneous group of straight chain highly sulfated glycosaminoglycans having anticoagulant properties. Heparin can bind to AT III to form the AT III heparin complex.

As used herein increased resistance to AT III and or heparin refers to any amount of decreased sensitivity of a polypeptide such as a modified FIX polypeptide to the inhibitory effects of AT III alone heparin alone and or the AT III heparin complex compared with a reference polypeptide such as an unmodified FIX polypeptide. Increased resistance to AT III heparin and or an AT III heparin complex can be assayed by assessing the binding of a modified FIX polypeptide to AT III heparin and or an AT III complex. Increased resistance also can be assayed by measuring inhibition of the catalytic or coagulant activity of a FIX polypeptide in the presence of AT III heparin or an AT III heparin complex. Assays to determine the binding of a polypeptide to an inhibitor or the inhibition of enzymatic activity of a polypeptide by an inhibitor are known in the art. For covalent inhibitors such as for example AT III or an AT III heparin complex a second order rate constant for inhibition can be measured. For non covalent inhibitors such as for example heparin a kcan be measured. In addition surface plasma resonance such as on a BIAcore biosensor instrument also can be used to measure the binding of FIX polypeptides to AT III heparin and or an AT III heparin complex using one or more defined conditions. However for covalent inhibitors such as AT III or an AT III heparin complex only an on rate can be measured using BIAcore for non covalent inhibitors such as heparin both the on rate and off rate can be measured. Assays to determine the inhibitory effect of for example AT III heparin on FIX coagulant activity also are known in the art. For example the ability of a modified FIX polypeptide to cleave its substrate FX in the presence or absence of AT III heparin can be measured and the degree to which AT III heparin inhibits the reaction determined. This can be compared to the ability of an unmodified FIX polypeptide to cleave its substrate FX in the presence or absence of AT III. Alternatively the second order rate constant for inhibition of a FIX polypeptide can be measured and compared to the second order rate constant for inhibition of an unmodified FIX polypeptide. When comparing second order rate constants for inhibition increased resistance to inhibition means a decreased second order rate constant of inhibition. A modified polypeptide that exhibits increased resistance to AT III and or heparin exhibits for example an increase of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 200 300 400 500 or more resistance to the effects of AT III heparin and or an AT III heparin complex respectively compared to an unmodified polypeptide.

As used herein cofactors refer to proteins or molecules that bind to other specific proteins or molecules to form an active complex. In some examples binding to a cofactor is required for optimal proteolytic activity. For example FVIIIa is a cofactor of FIXa. Binding of FVIIIa to FIXa induces conformational changes that result in increased proteolytic activity of FIXa for its substrate FX.

As used herein a glycosylation site refers to an amino position in a polypeptide to which a carbohydrate moiety can be attached. Typically a glycosylated protein contains one or more amino acid residues such as asparagine or serine for the attachment of the carbohydrate moieties.

As used herein a native glycosylation site refers to the position of an amino acid to which a carbohydrate moiety is attached in a wild type polypeptide. There are six native glycosylation sites in FIX two N glycosylation sites at N157 and N167 and six O glycosylation sites at S53 S61 T159 T169 T172 and T179 corresponding to amino acid positions in the mature FIX polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO 3.

As used herein a non native glycosylation site refers to the position of an amino acid to which a carbohydrate moiety is attached in a modified polypeptide that is not present in a wild type polypeptide. Non native glycosylation sites can be introduced into a FIX polypeptide by amino acid replacement. O glycosylation sites can be created for example by amino acid replacement of a native residue with a serine or threonine. N glycosylation sites can be created for example by establishing the motif Asn Xaa Ser Thr Cys where Xaa is not proline. Creation of this consensus sequence by amino acid modification can involve for example a single amino acid replacement of a native amino acid residue with an asparagine a single amino acid replacement of a native amino acid residue with a serine threonine or cysteine or a double amino acid replacement involving a first amino acid replacement of a native residue with an asparagine and a second amino acid replacement of native residue with a serine threonine or cysteine.

As used herein increased levels of glycosylation and any grammatical variations thereof refers to an increased amount of carbohydrate linked to a polypeptide as compared with a reference polypeptide or protein. The carbohydrate can be N linked O linked C linked or be attached by any other linkage. The level of glycosylation can be increased by at least about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 200 300 400 500 or more compared to the level of glycosylation of an unmodified polypeptide. Assays to determine the level of glycosylation i.e. amount of carbohydrate of a polypeptide are known in the art. For example the carbohydrate content or level of glycosylation can be assessed by high pH anion exchange chromatography fluorophoreassisted carbohydrate electrophoresis FACE sequential exoglycosidase digestions mass spectrometry NMR gel electrophoresis or any other method described herein or known in the art.

As used herein biological activity refers to the in vivo activities of a compound or physiological responses that result upon in vivo administration of a compound composition or other mixture. Biological activity thus encompasses therapeutic effects and pharmaceutical activity of such compounds compositions and mixtures. Biological activities can be observed in in vitro systems designed to test or use such activities. Thus for purposes herein a biological activity of a FIX polypeptide encompasses the coagulant activity.

As used herein a pharmacokinetic property refers to a property related to the action of a drug or agent such as a FIX polypeptide in the body and in particular the rate at which drugs are absorbed distributed metabolized and eliminated by the body. Pharmacokinetics can be assessed by various parameters. These include but are not limited to clearance volume of distribution in vivo recovery total modified FIX polypeptide exposure in vivo serum half life and mean resonance time MRT . Pharmacokinetic properties of polypeptide can be assessed using methods well known in the art such as for example administering the polypeptide to a human or animal model and assessing the amount of FIX in the body at various time points. The various parameters such as clearance volume of distribution in vivo recovery total modified FIX polypeptide exposure in vivo serum half life and mean resonance time MRT are assessed using calculations well known in the art and described herein.

As used herein improved pharmacokinetic properties refers to a desirable change in a pharmacokinetic property of a polypeptide such as a modified FIX polypeptide compared to for example an unmodified FIX polypeptide. The change can be an increase or a decrease.

As used herein clearance refers to the removal of an agent such as a polypeptide from the body of a subject following administration. Clearance can be assessed using methods well known in the art such as those described in Example 6. For example assays in which a FIX polypeptide is administered to mice can be performed and the clearance of the polypeptide from the body assessed by measuring the amount of FIX in the plasma at various time points and calculating the clearance as Dose AUC. Improved clearance of a modified FIX polypeptide compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide refers to a decrease in clearance of a modified FIX polypeptide compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide. The clearance of a modified FIX polypeptide can be decreased by at least or about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 or 99 compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide.

As used herein mean resonance time MRT refers to the amount of time a FIX polypeptide resides in the body following administration. MRT can be assessed using methods well known in the art such as those described in Example 6. For example assays in which a FIX polypeptide is administered to mice can be performed and the MRT of the polypeptide assessed by measuring the amount of FIX in the plasma at various time points and calculating the MRT as AUMC AUC where AUCis total area under the curve and AUMCis the total area under the first moment versus time curve. Improved MRT of a modified FIX polypeptide compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide refers to an increase in MRT of a modified FIX polypeptide compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide. The MRT of a modified FIX polypeptide can be increased by at least or about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 200 300 400 500 or more compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide.

As used herein in vivo recovery refers to the percentage of FIX polypeptide detectable in the circulation after a period of time following administration in relation to the total amount of FIX polypeptide administered. In vivo recovery can be assessed using methods well known in the art such as those described in Example 6. For example assays in which a FIX polypeptide is administered to mice can be performed and the in vivo recovery of the polypeptide assessed by measuring the amount of FIX in the plasma at Cand comparing it to the amount of FIX administered. Improved in vivo recovery of a modified FIX polypeptide compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide refers to an increase in in vivo recovery of a modified FIX polypeptide compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide. The in vivo recovery of a modified FIX polypeptide can be increased by at least or about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 200 300 400 500 or more compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide.

As used herein plasma half life t refers the elimination half life of a FIX polypeptide or the time at which the plasma concentration of the FIX polypeptide has reached one half of its initial or maximal concentration following administration. Reference to plasma half life includes plasma half life during the and or phase. Plasma half life can be assessed using methods well known in the art such as those described in Example 6. For example assays in which a FIX polypeptide is administered to mice can be performed and the plasma half life of the polypeptide assessed by measuring the amount of FIX in the plasma at various time points. The T for example is calculated as ln 2 divided by the negative slope during the terminal phase of the log linear plot of the plasma FIX concentration versus time curve. Improved plasma half life of a modified FIX polypeptide compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide refers to an increase in plasma half life of a modified FIX polypeptide compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide. The plasma half life of a modified FIX polypeptide can be increased by at least or about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 200 300 400 500 or more compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide.

As used herein exposure in vivo refers to the amount of FIX polypeptide in the circulation following administration in relation to the plasma area under the concentration time curve or AUC of FIX polypeptide administered. Exposure in vivo can be assessed using methods well known in the art such as those described in Example 6. For example assays in which a FIX polypeptide is administered to mice can be performed and the in vivo recovery of the polypeptide assessed by measuring the amount of FIX in the plasma at various time points i.e. AUC and comparing it to the amount of FIX administered. Improved exposure in vivo of a modified FIX polypeptide compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide refers to an increase in exposure in vivo of a modified FIX polypeptide compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide. The exposure in vivo of a modified FIX polypeptide can be increased by at least or about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 200 300 400 500 or more compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide.

As used herein volume of distribution refers to the distribution of a FIX polypeptide between plasma and the rest of the body following administration. It is defined as the volume in which the amount of polypeptide would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the observed concentration of polypeptide in the plasma. Volume of distribution can be assessed using methods well known in the art such as those described in Example 6. For example V which is the steady state volume of distribution calculated as MRT Cl and V which is the volume of distribution based on the terminal elimination constant calculated as C1 ln 2 T can be assessed in assays in which a FIX polypeptide is administered to mice and the concentration of the FIX in the plasma is determined at various time points. Improved volume of distribution of a modified FIX polypeptide compared with an unmodified FIX polypeptide depending on the protein s mechanism of clearance and safety profile can refer to either an increase or a decrease in the volume of distribution of a modified FIX polypeptide. For example in cases where the polypeptide is distributed among multiple compartments a decreased volume of distribution of a modified FIX polypeptide could result in significantly increased drug exposure and activity in the compartment of interest e.g. the vascular compartment versus an extravascular compartment compared with an unmodified FIX polypeptide. In other cases for example when drug safety is limited by C redistribution into other compartments e.g. binding to the surface of endothelial cells can result in a longer terminal half life and or duration of action within the compartment of interest and an superior safety profile compared to the unmodified FIX polypeptide. The volume of distribution of a modified FIX polypeptide can be decreased by at least or about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 or 99 compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide. In other examples the volume of distribution of the modified FIX polypeptide is increased by at least or about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 200 300 400 500 or more of the volume of distribution of an unmodified FIX polypeptide.

As used herein the term assess and grammatical variations thereof is intended to include quantitative and qualitative determination in the sense of obtaining an absolute value for the activity of a polypeptide and also of obtaining an index ratio percentage visual or other value indicative of the level of the activity. Assessment can be direct or indirect. For example detection of cleavage of a substrate by a polypeptide can be by direct measurement of the product or can be indirectly measured by determining the resulting activity of the cleaved substrate.

As used herein chymotrypsin numbering refers to the amino acid numbering of a mature bovine chymotrypsin polypeptide of SEQ ID NO 19. Alignment of a protease domain of another protease such as for example the protease domain of Factor IX can be made with chymotrypsin. In such an instance the amino acids of Factor IX that correspond to amino acids of chymotrypsin are given the numbering of the chymotrypsin amino acids. Corresponding positions can be determined by such alignment by one of skill in the art using manual alignments or by using the numerous alignment programs available for example BLASTP . Corresponding positions also can be based on structural alignments for example by using computer simulated alignments of protein structure. Recitation that amino acids of a polypeptide correspond to amino acids in a disclosed sequence refers to amino acids identified upon alignment of the polypeptide with the disclosed sequence to maximize identity or homology where conserved amino acids are aligned using a standard alignment algorithm such as the GAP algorithm. The corresponding chymotrypsin numbers of amino acid positions 181 to 415 of the FIX polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 are provided in Table 1. The amino acid positions relative to the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 are in normal font the amino acid residues at those positions are in bold and the corresponding chymotrypsin numbers are in italics. For example upon alignment of the mature Factor IX SEQ ID NO 3 with mature chymotrypsin SEQ ID NO 19 the valine V at amino acid position 181 in Factor IX is given the chymotrypsin numbering of V16. Subsequent amino acids are numbered accordingly. In one example a glutamic acid E at amino acid position 213 of the mature factor IX SEQ ID NO 3 corresponds to amino acid position E49 based on chymotrypsin numbering. Where a residue exists in a protease but is not present in chymotrypsin the amino acid residue is given a letter notation. For example A95a and A95b by chymotrypsin numbering correspond to A261 and A262 respectively by numbering relative to the mature Factor IX sequence SEQ ID NO 3 .

As used herein nucleic acids include DNA RNA and analogs thereof including peptide nucleic acids PNA and mixtures thereof. Nucleic acids can be single or double stranded. When referring to probes or primers which are optionally labeled such as with a detectable label such as a fluorescent or radiolabel single stranded molecules are contemplated. Such molecules are typically of a length such that their target is statistically unique or of low copy number typically less than 5 generally less than 3 for probing or priming a library. Generally a probe or primer contains at least 14 16 or 30 contiguous nucleotides of sequence complementary to or identical to a gene of interest. Probes and primers can be 10 20 30 50 100 or more nucleotides long.

As used herein the amino acids that occur in the various sequences of amino acids provided herein are identified according to their known three letter or one letter abbreviations Table 2 . The nucleotides which occur in the various nucleic acid fragments are designated with the standard single letter designations used routinely in the art.

As used herein an amino acid is an organic compound containing an amino group and a carboxylic acid group. A polypeptide contains two or more amino acids. For purposes herein amino acids include the twenty naturally occurring amino acids non natural amino acids and amino acid analogs i.e. amino acids wherein the carbon has a side chain .

In keeping with standard polypeptide nomenclature described in 243 3557 3559 1968 and adopted in 37 C.F.R. 1.821 1.822 abbreviations for the amino acid residues are shown in Table 2A 

It should be noted that all amino acid residue sequences represented herein by formulae have a left to right orientation in the conventional direction of amino terminus to carboxyl terminus. In addition the phrase amino acid residue is broadly defined to include the amino acids listed in the Table of Correspondence Table 2 and modified and unusual amino acids such as those referred to in 37 C.F.R. 1.821 1.822 and incorporated herein by reference. Furthermore it should be noted that a dash at the beginning or end of an amino acid residue sequence indicates a peptide bond to a further sequence of one or more amino acid residues to an amino terminal group such as NHor to a carboxyl terminal group such as COOH.

As used herein naturally occurring amino acids refer to the 20 L amino acids that occur in polypeptides.

As used herein non natural amino acid refers to an organic compound containing an amino group and a carboxylic acid group that is not one of the naturally occurring amino acids listed in Table 2. Non naturally occurring amino acids thus include for example amino acids or analogs of amino acids other than the 20 naturally occurring amino acids and include but are not limited to the D isostereomers of amino acids. Exemplary non natural amino acids are known to those of skill in the art and can be included in a modified Factor IX polypeptide.

For purposes herein conservative amino acid substitutions may be made in any of polypeptides and domains thereof provided that the resulting protein exhibits an activity of a FIX. Conservative amino acid substitutions such as those set forth in Table 2B are those that do not eliminate proteolytic activity. Suitable conservative substitutions of amino acids are known to those of skill in this art and may be made generally without altering the biological activity of the resulting molecule. Those of skill in this art recognize that in general single amino acid substitutions in non essential regions of a polypeptide do not substantially alter biological activity see e.g. Watson et al. 4th Edition 1987 The Benjamin Cummings Pub. co. p. 224 . Also included within the definition is the catalytically active fragment of an MTSP particularly a single chain protease portion. Conservative amino acid substitutions are made for example in accordance with those set forth in Table 2B as follows 

As used herein a DNA construct is a single or double stranded linear or circular DNA molecule that contains segments of DNA combined and juxtaposed in a manner not found in nature. DNA constructs exist as a result of human manipulation and include clones and other copies of manipulated molecules.

As used herein a DNA segment is a portion of a larger DNA molecule having specified attributes. For example a DNA segment encoding a specified polypeptide is a portion of a longer DNA molecule such as a plasmid or plasmid fragment which when read from the 5 to 3 direction encodes the sequence of amino acids of the specified polypeptide.

As used herein the term polynucleotide means a single or double stranded polymer of deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotide bases read from the 5 to the 3 end. Polynucleotides include RNA and DNA and can be isolated from natural sources synthesized in vitro or prepared from a combination of natural and synthetic molecules. The length of a polynucleotide molecule is given herein in terms of nucleotides abbreviated nt or base pairs abbreviated bp . The term nucleotides is used for single and double stranded molecules where the context permits. When the term is applied to double stranded molecules it is used to denote overall length and will be understood to be equivalent to the term base pairs. It will be recognized by those skilled in the art that the two strands of a double stranded polynucleotide can differ slightly in length and that the ends thereof can be staggered thus all nucleotides within a double stranded polynucleotide molecule can not be paired. Such unpaired ends will in general not exceed 20 nucleotides in length.

As used herein similarity between two proteins or nucleic acids refers to the relatedness between the sequence of amino acids of the proteins or the nucleotide sequences of the nucleic acids. Similarity can be based on the degree of identity and or homology of sequences of residues and the residues contained therein. Methods for assessing the degree of similarity between proteins or nucleic acids are known to those of skill in the art. For example in one method of assessing sequence similarity two amino acid or nucleotide sequences are aligned in a manner that yields a maximal level of identity between the sequences. Identity refers to the extent to which the amino acid or nucleotide sequences are invariant. Alignment of amino acid sequences and to some extent nucleotide sequences also can take into account conservative differences and or frequent substitutions in amino acids or nucleotides . Conservative differences are those that preserve the physico chemical properties of the residues involved. Alignments can be global alignment of the compared sequences over the entire length of the sequences and including all residues or local the alignment of a portion of the sequences that includes only the most similar region or regions .

As used herein the terms homology and identity are used interchangeably but homology for proteins can include conservative amino acid changes. In general to identify corresponding positions the sequences of amino acids are aligned so that the highest order match is obtained see e.g. Lesk A. M. ed. Oxford University Press New York 1988 Smith D. W. ed. Academic Press New York 1993I Griffin A. M. and Griffin H. G. eds. Humana Press New Jersey 1994 von Heinje G. Academic Press 1987 and Gribskov M. and Devereux J. eds. M Stockton Press New York 1991 Carillo et al. 1988 48 1073 .

As use herein sequence identity refers to the number of identical amino acids or nucleotide bases in a comparison between a test and a reference polypeptide or polynucleotide. Homologous polypeptides refer to a pre determined number of identical or homologous amino acid residues. Homology includes conservative amino acid substitutions as well identical residues. Sequence identity can be determined by standard alignment algorithm programs used with default gap penalties established by each supplier. Homologous nucleic acid molecules refer to a pre determined number of identical or homologous nucleotides. Homology includes substitutions that do not change the encoded amino acid i.e. silent substitutions as well identical residues. Substantially homologous nucleic acid molecules hybridize typically at moderate stringency or at high stringency all along the length of the nucleic acid or along at least about 70 80 or 90 of the full length nucleic acid molecule of interest. Also contemplated are nucleic acid molecules that contain degenerate codons in place of codons in the hybridizing nucleic acid molecule. For determination of homology of proteins conservative amino acids can be aligned as well as identical amino acids in this case percentage of identity and percentage homology varies . Whether any two nucleic acid molecules have nucleotide sequences or any two polypeptides have amino acid sequences that are at least 80 85 90 95 96 97 98 or 99 identical can be determined using known computer algorithms such as the FAST A program using for example the default parameters as in Pearson et al. 85 2444 1988 other programs include the GCG program package Devereux J. et al. 12 I 387 1984 BLASTP BLASTN FASTA Atschul S. F. et al. 215 403 1990 Martin J. Bishop ed. Academic Press San Diego 1994 and Carillo et al. 48 1073 1988 . For example the BLAST function of the National Center for Biotechnology Information database can be used to determine identity. Other commercially or publicly available programs include DNAStar MegAlign program Madison Wis. and the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group UWG Gap program Madison Wis. . Percent homology or identity of proteins and or nucleic acid molecules can be determined for example by comparing sequence information using a GAP computer program e.g. Needleman et al. 48 443 1970 as revised by Smith and Waterman 2 482 1981 . Briefly a GAP program defines similarity as the number of aligned symbols i.e. nucleotides or amino acids which are similar divided by the total number of symbols in the shorter of the two sequences. Default parameters for the GAP program can include 1 a unary comparison matrix containing a value of 1 for identities and 0 for non identities and the weighted comparison matrix of Gribskov et al. 14 6745 1986 as described by Schwartz and Dayhoff eds. National Biomedical Research Foundation pp. 353 358 1979 2 a penalty of 3.0 for each gap and an additional 0.10 penalty for each symbol in each gap and 3 no penalty for end gaps.

Therefore as used herein the term identity represents a comparison between a test and a reference polypeptide or polynucleotide. In one non limiting example at least 90 identical to refers to percent identities from 90 to 100 relative to the reference polypeptides. Identity at a level of 90 or more is indicative of the fact that assuming for exemplification purposes a test and reference polynucleotide length of 100 amino acids are compared no more than 10 i.e. 10 out of 100 of amino acids in the test polypeptide differ from that of the reference polypeptides. Similar comparisons can be made between test and reference polynucleotides. Such differences can be represented as point mutations randomly distributed over the entire length of an amino acid sequence or they can be clustered in one or more locations of varying length up to the maximum allowable e.g. 10 100 amino acid difference approximately 90 identity . Differences are defined as nucleic acid or amino acid substitutions insertions or deletions. At the level of homologies or identities above about 85 90 the result should be independent of the program and gap parameters set such high levels of identity can be assessed readily often without relying on software.

As used herein it also is understood that the terms substantially identical or similar varies with the context as understood by those skilled in the relevant art but that those of skill can assess such.

Provided herein are modified Factor IX FIX polypeptides including modified FIXa polypeptides and catalytically active fragments thereof. Factor IX polypeptides play a role in the regulation of and process of hemostasis and hence can be used as therapeutic agents. Effective delivery of therapeutic proteins such as FIX for clinical use is a major challenge to pharmaceutical science. Once in the blood stream these proteins are constantly eliminated from circulation within a short time by different physiological processes involving metabolism as well as clearance using normal pathways for protein elimination such as glomerular filtration in the kidneys or proteolysis in blood. Once in the luminal gastrointestinal tract these proteins are constantly digested by luminal proteases. The latter can be a limiting process affecting the half life of proteins used as therapeutic agents in intravenous injection. Additionally inhibitors in the blood can specifically inhibit the activity of the therapeutic protein. For example antithrombin AT III heparin and the AT III heparin complex can inhibit the coagulant activity of FIX. More efficacious variants of FIX with improved properties including improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties increased catalytic activity and or increased resistance to inhibitors are needed.

The modified FIX polypeptides provided herein exhibit improved properties including improved pharmacokinetic properties such as increased serum half life increased resistance to inhibitors such as antithrombin III AT III heparin and the AT III heparin complex increased catalytic activity or any combination thereof. Hence provided are modified FIX polypeptides that have increased coagulant activity. Accordingly these polypeptides have a variety of uses and applications for example as therapeutics for modulating hemostasis. The following discussion provides a review of the coagulation process and the role of Factor IX in this process before a discussion of Factor IX and modifications thereof.

Hemostasis is the physiological mechanism that stems the bleeding that results from injury to the vasculature. Normal hemostasis depends on cellular components and soluble plasma proteins and involves a series of signaling events that ultimately leads to the formation of a blood clot. Coagulation is quickly initiated after an injury occurs to the blood vessel and endothelial cells are damaged. In the primary phase of coagulation platelets are activated to form a homeostatic plug at the site of injury. Secondary hemostasis follows involving plasma coagulation factors which act in a proteolytic cascade resulting in the formation of fibrin strands which strengthen the platelet plug.

Upon vessel injury the blood flow to the immediate injured area is restricted by vascular constriction allowing platelets to adhere to the newly exposed fibrillar collagen on the subendothelial connective tissue. This adhesion is dependent upon the von Willebrand factor vWF which binds to the endothelium within three seconds of injury thereby facilitating platelet adhesion and aggregation. Activation of the aggregated platelets results in the secretion of a variety of factors including ADP ATP thromboxane and serotonin. Adhesion molecules fibrinogen vWF thrombospondin and fibronectin also are released. Such secretion promotes additional adhesion and aggregation of platelets increased platelet activation and blood vessel constriction and exposure of anionic phospholipids on the platelet surface that serve as platforms for the assembly of blood coagulation enzyme complexes. The platelets change shape leading to pseudopodia formation which further facilitates aggregation to other platelets resulting in a loose platelet plug.

A clotting cascade of peptidases the coagulation cascade is simultaneously initiated. The coagulation cascade involves a series of activation events involving proteolytic cleavage. In such a cascade an inactive protein of a serine protease also called a zymogen is converted to an active protease by cleavage of one or more peptide bonds which then serves as the activating protease for the next zymogen molecule in the cascade ultimately resulting in clot formation by the cross linking of fibrin. For example the cascade generates activated molecules such as thrombin from cleavage of prothrombin which further activates platelets and also generates fibrin from cleavage of fibrinogen. Fibrin then forms a cross linked polymer around the platelet plug to stabilize the clot. Upon repair of the injury fibrin is digested by the fibrinolytic system the major components of which are plasminogen and tissue type plasminogen activator tPA . Both of these proteins are incorporated into polymerizing fibrin where they interact to generate plasmin which in turn acts on fibrin to dissolve the preformed clot. During clot formation coagulation factor inhibitors also circulate through the blood to prevent clot formation beyond the injury site.

The interaction of the system from injury to clot formation and subsequent fibrinolysis is described below.

The clotting of blood is actively circumvented under normal conditions. The vascular endothelium supports vasodilation inhibits platelet adhesion and activation suppresses coagulation enhances fibrin cleavage and is anti inflammatory in character. Vascular endothelial cells secrete molecules such as nitrous oxide NO and prostacylin which inhibit platelet aggregation and dilate blood vessels. Release of these molecules activates soluble guanylate cyclases sGC and cGMP dependent protein kinase I cGKI and increases cyclic guanosine monophosphate cGMP levels which cause relaxation of the smooth muscle in the vessel wall. Furthermore endothelial cells express cell surface ADPases such as CD39 which control platelet activation and aggregation by converting ADP released from platelets into adenine nucleotide platelet inhibitors. The endothelium also plays an important role in the regulation of the enzymes in the fibrinolytic cascade. Endothelial cells directly promote the generation of plasmin through the expression of receptors of plasminogen annexin II and urokinase as well as the secretion of tissue type and urokinase plasminogen activators all of which promote clot clearance. In a final layer of prothrombotic regulation endothelial cells play an active role in inhibiting the coagulation cascade by producing heparan sulfate which increases the kinetics of antithrombin III inhibition of thrombin and other coagulation factors.

Under acute vascular trauma however vasoconstrictor mechanisms predominate and the endothelium becomes prothrombotic procoagulatory and proinflammatory in nature. This is achieved by a reduction of endothelial dilating agents adenosine NO and prostacyclin and the direct action of ADP serotonin and thromboxane on vascular smooth muscle cells to elicit their contraction Becker Heindl et al. 2000 . The chief trigger for the change in endothelial function that leads to the formation of haemostatic thrombus is the loss of the endothelial cell barrier between blood and extracellular matrix ECM components Ruggeri 2002 Nat Med 8 1227 1234 . Circulating platelets identify and discriminate areas of endothelial lesions and adhere to the exposed sub endothelium. Their interaction with the various thrombogenic substrates and locally generated or released agonists results in platelet activation. This process is described as possessing two stages 1 adhesion the initial tethering to a surface and 2 aggregation the platelet platelet cohesion Savage et al. 2001 8 270 276 .

Platelet adhesion is initiated when the circulating platelets bind to exposed collagen through interaction with collagen binding proteins on the cell surface and through interaction with vWF also present on the endothelium. vWF protein is a multimeric structure of variable size secreted in two directions by the endothelium basolaterally and into the bloodstream. vWF also binds to factor VIII which is important in the stabilization of factor VIII and its survival in the circulation.

Platelet adhesion and subsequent activation is achieved when vWF binds via its A1 domain to GPIb part of the platelet glycoprotein receptor complex GPIb IX V . The interaction between vWF and GPIb is regulated by shear force such that an increase in the shear stress results in a corresponding increase in the affinity of vWF for GPIb. Integrin 1 2 also known on leukocytes as VLA 2 is the major collagen receptor on platelets and engagement through this receptor generates the intracellular signals that contribute to platelet activation. Binding through 1 2 facilitates the engagement of the lower affinity collagen receptor GP VI. This is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is the receptor that generates the most potent intracellular signals for platelet activation. Platelet activation results in the release of adenosine diphosphate ADP which is converted to thromboxane A2.

Platelet activation also results in the surface expression of platelet glycoprotein IIb IIIa GP IIb IIIa receptors also known as platelet integrin IIb 3. GP IIb IIIa receptors allow the adherence of platelets to each other i.e. aggregation by virtue of fibrinogen molecules linking the platelets through these receptors. This results in the formation of a platelet plug at the site of injury to help prevent further blood loss while the damaged vascular tissue releases factors that initiate the coagulation cascade and the formation of a stabilizing fibrin mesh around the platelet plug.

The coagulation pathway is a proteolytic pathway where each enzyme is present in the plasma as a zymogen or inactive form. Cleavage of the zymogen is regulated to release the active form from the precursor molecule. The pathway functions as a series of positive and negative feedback loops that control the activation process where the ultimate goal is to produce thrombin which can then convert soluble fibrinogen into fibrin to form a clot. The coagulation factors and other proteins participate in blood coagulation through one or more of the intrinsic extrinsic or common pathway of coagulation. As discussed below these pathways are interconnected and blood coagulation likely occurs through a cell based model of activation.

The generation of thrombin has historically been divided into three pathways the intrinsic suggesting that all components of the pathway are intrinsic to plasma and extrinsic suggesting that one or more components of the pathway are extrinsic to plasma pathways that provide alternative routes for the generation of activated factor X FXa and the final common pathway which results in thrombin formation . These pathways participate together in an interconnected and interdependent process to effect coagulation. A cell based model of coagulation was developed that describes these pathways Hoffman et al. 2001 Thromb Haemost 85 958 965 . In this model the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways are effected on different cell surfaces the tissue factor TF bearing cell and the platelet respectively. The process of coagulation is separated into distinct phases initiation amplification and propagation during which the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways function at various stages to produce the large burst of thrombin required to convert sufficient quantities of fibrinogen to fibrin for clot formation.

FVII is considered to be the coagulation factor responsible for initiating the coagulation cascade which initiation is dependent on its interaction with TF. TF is a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed by a variety of cells such as smooth muscle cells fibroblasts monocytes lymphocytes granulocytes platelets and endothelial cells. Myeloid cells and endothelial cells only express TF when they are stimulated such as by proinflammatory cytokines. Smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts however express TF constitutively. Accordingly once these cells come in contact with the bloodstream following tissue injury the coagulation cascade is rapidly initiated by the binding of TF with factor VII or FVIIa in the plasma. TF FVIIa complexes can be formed by the direct binding of FVIIa to TF or by the binding of FVII to TF and then the subsequent activation of FVII to FVIIa by a plasma protease such as FXa FIXa FXIIa or FVIIa itself. The TF FVIIa complex remains anchored to the TF bearing cell where it activates small amounts of FX into FXa in what is known as the extrinsic pathway of coagulation.

The TF FVIIa complex also cleaves small amounts of FIX into FIXa. FXa associates with its cofactor FVa to also form a complex on the TF bearing cell that can then covert prothrombin to thrombin. The small amount of thrombin produced is however inadequate to support the required fibrin formation for complete clotting. Additionally any active FXa and FIXa are inhibited in the circulation by antithrombin III AT III and other serpins which are discussed in more detail below. This would normally prevent clot formation in the circulation. In the presence of injury however damage to the vasculature results in platelet aggregation and activation at this site of thrombin formation thereby allowing for amplification of the coagulation signal.

Amplification takes place when thrombin binds to and activates the platelets. The activated platelets release FV from their alpha granules which is activated by thrombin to FVa. Thrombin also releases and activates FVIII from the FVIII vWF complex on the platelet membrane and cleaves FXI into FXIa. These reactions generate activated platelets that have FVa FVIIIa and FIXa on their surface which set the stage for a large burst of thrombin generation during the propagation stage.

Propagation of coagulation occurs on the surface of large numbers of platelets at the site of injury. As described above the activated platelets have FXIa FVIIIa and FVa on their surface. It is here that the extrinsic pathway is effected. FXIa activates FIX to FIXa which can then bind with FVIIIa. This process in addition to the small amount of FIXa that is generated by cleavage of FIX by the TF FVIIa complex on the TF bearing cell generates a large amount FIXa in complex with its cofactor FVIIIa calcium and a suitable phospholipid surface. This complex is termed the tenase or Xase complex and it cleaves and activates the Factor X FX to Factor Xa FXa . The FXa molecules bind to FVa to generate the prothrombinase complexes that activate prothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin acts in a positive feedback loop to activate even more platelets and again initiates the processes described for the amplification phase.

Very shortly there are sufficient numbers of activated platelets with the appropriate complexes to generate the burst of thrombin that is large enough to generate sufficient amounts of fibrin from fibrinogen to form a hemostatic fibrin clot. Fibrinogen is a dimer soluble in plasma which when cleaved by thrombin releases fibrinopeptide A and fibrinopeptide B. Fibrinopeptide B is then cleaved by thrombin and the fibrin monomers formed by this second proteolytic cleavage spontaneously forms an insoluble gel. The polymerized fibrin is held together by noncovalent and electrostatic forces and is stabilized by the transamidating enzyme factor XIIIa FXIIIa produced by the cleavage of FXIII by thrombin. Thrombin also activates TAFI which inhibits fibrinolysis by reducing plasmin generation at the clot surface. Additionally thrombin itself is incorporated into the structure of the clot for further stabilization. These insoluble fibrin aggregates clots together with aggregated platelets thrombi block the damaged blood vessel and prevent further bleeding.

During coagulation the cascade is regulated by constitutive and stimulated processes to inhibit further clot formation. Regulation is important to a limit ischemia of tissues by fibrin clot formation and b prevent widespread thrombosis by localizing the clot formation only to the site of tissue injury.

Regulation is achieved by the actions of several inhibitory molecules. For example antithrombin III AT III and tissue factor pathway inhibitor TFPI work constitutively to inhibit factors in the coagulation cascade. TFPI predominantly inhibits FXa and FVIIa TF complex. In contrast AT III which is a serine protease inhibitor serpin predominantly inhibits thrombin FXa and FIXa. The inhibition of these coagulation factors by AT III is enhanced greatly by heparin which binds AT III to induce an activating conformational change that accelerates the inhibitory reaction. Heparin also can inhibit the activity of the FIXa FVIIIa complex in an AT III independent manner Yuan et al. 2005 Biochemistry 44 3615 3625 . An additional factor Protein C which is stimulated via platelet activation regulates coagulation by proteolytic cleavage and inactivation of FVa and FVIIIa. Protein S enhances the activity of Protein C. Further another factor which contributes to coagulation inhibition is the integral membrane protein thrombomodulin which is produced by vascular endothelial cells and serves as a receptor for thrombin. Binding of thrombin to thrombomodulin inhibits thrombin procoagulant activities and also contributes to protein C activation.

Fibrinolysis the breakdown of the fibrin clot also provides a mechanism for regulating coagulation. The crosslinked fibrin multimers in a clot are broken down to soluble polypeptides by plasmin a serine protease. Plasmin can be generated from its inactive precursor plasminogen and recruited to the site of a fibrin clot in two ways by interaction with tissue plasminogen activator tPA at the surface of a fibrin clot and by interaction with urokinase plasminogen activator uPA at a cell surface. The first mechanism appears to be the major one responsible for the dissolution of clots within blood vessels. The second although capable of mediating clot dissolution can play a major role in tissue remodeling cell migration and inflammation.

Clot dissolution also is regulated in two ways. First efficient plasmin activation and fibrinolysis occur only in complexes formed at the clot surface or on a cell membrane while proteins free in the blood are inefficient catalysts and are rapidly inactivated. Second plasminogen activators and plasmin are inactivated by molecules such as plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 PAI 1 and PAI 2 which act on the plasminogen activators and 2 antiplasmin and a 2 macroglobulin that inactivate plasmin. Under normal circumstances the timely balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis results in the efficient formation and clearing of clots following vascular injury while simultaneously preventing unwanted thrombotic or bleeding episodes.

Factor IX is a vitamin K dependent serine protease and is an important coagulation factor in hemostasis. It is synthesized as a single chain zymogen in the liver and circulates in the blood in this inactivated state until activated as part of the coagulation cascade. Following activation from the FIX zymogen to activated FIX FIXa by FXIa or the TF FVIIa complex FIXa binds its cofactor FVIIIa. The resulting FIXa FVIIIa complex binds and activates FX to FXa thus continuing the coagulation cascade described above to establish hemostasis. The concentration of FIX in the blood is approximately 4 5 g mL and it has a half life of approximately 18 24 hours.

Hemophilia B also known as Christmas disease or factor IX deficiency is caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of FIX resulting from any one or more of a variety of mutations in the FIX gene. While less prevalent than Hemophilia A Hemophilia B remains a significant disease in which recurrent joint bleeds can lead to synovial hypertrophy chronic synovitis with destruction of synovium cartilage and bone leading to chronic pain stiffness of the joints and limitation of movement because of progressive severe joint damage. Recurrent muscle bleeds also produce acute pain swelling and limitation of movement while bleeding at other sites can contribute to morbidity and mortality. Treatment is typically by replacement therapy with recombinant FIX rFIX . Provided herein are modified FIX polypeptides that are designed to have increased coagulation activity upon activation and that can serve as improved therapeutics to treat diseases and conditions amenable to factor IX therapy such as Hemophilia B.

The human FIX gene is located on the X chromosome and is approximately 34 kb long with eight exons. The human FIX transcript is 2803 nucleotides and contains a short 5 untranslated region an open reading frame including stop codon of 1383 nucleotides and a 3 untranslated region. The 1383 nucleotide open reading frame or FIX mRNA SEQ ID NO 1 encodes a 461 amino acid precursor polypeptide Swiss Prot accession no. P00740 SEQ ID NO 2 containing a 28 amino acid N terminal signal peptide amino acids 1 28 of SEQ ID NO 2 that directs the factor IX polypeptide to the cellular secretory pathway. In addition the hydrophobic signal peptide the FIX precursor polypeptide also contains an 18 amino acid propeptide aa 29 46 of SEQ ID NO 2 that when cleaved releases the 415 amino acid mature polypeptide SEQ ID NO 3 that circulates in the blood as a zymogen until activation to FIXa. In addition to the signal peptide and propeptide the FIX precursor also contains the following segments and domains a Gla domain aa 47 92 of SEQ ID NO 2 corresponding to aa 1 46 of the mature FIX protein set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 epidermal growth factor EGF like domain 1 EGF1 aa 93 129 of SEQ ID NO 2 corresponding to aa 47 83 of the mature FIX protein set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 EGF2 aa 130 171 of SEQ ID NO 2 corresponding to aa 84 125 of the mature FIX protein set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 a light chain aa 47 191 of SEQ ID NO 2 corresponding to aa 1 145 of the mature FIX protein set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 an activation peptide aa 192 226 of SEQ ID NO 2 corresponding to aa 146 180 of the mature FIX protein set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 a heavy chain aa 227 461 of SEQ ID NO 2 corresponding to aa 181 415 of the mature FIX protein set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 and a serine protease domain aa 227 459 of SEQ ID NO 2 corresponding to aa 181 413 of the mature FIX protein set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 .

Like other vitamin K dependent proteins such as prothrombin coagulation factors VII and X and proteins C S and Z the Gla domain of FIX is a membrane binding motif which in the presence of calcium ions interacts with the phospholipid membranes of cells. The vitamin K dependent proteins require vitamin K for the posttranslational synthesis of carboxyglutamic acid an amino acid clustered in the Gla domain of these proteins. The FIX Gla domain has 12 glutamic acid residues each of which are potential carboxylation sites. Many of them are therefore modified by carboxylation to generate carboxyglutamic acid residues. There are a total of eight Ca binding sites of both high and low affinity in the FIX Gla domain that when occupied by calcium ions facilitate correct folding of the Gla domain to expose hydrophobic residues in the FIX polypeptide that are inserted into the lipid bilayer to effect binding to the membrane.

In addition to the Gla domain the FIX polypeptide also contains two EGF like domains. Each EGF like domain contains six highly conserved cysteine residues that form three disulphide bonds in each domain in the same pattern observed in the EGF protein. The first EGF like domain EGF1 is a calcium binding EGF domain containing a high affinity Ca binding site Rao et al. 1995 82 131 141 that when occupied by a calcium ion contributes to the correct folding of the molecule and promotes biological activity. The second EGF domain EGF2 does not contain a calcium binding site.

The serine protease domain or catalytic domain of FIX is the domain responsible for the proteolytic activity of FIXa. Like other serine proteases FIX contains a serine protease catalytic triad composed of H221 D269 and S365 corresponding to H57 D102 and S195 by chymotrypsin numbering .

Activation of mature FIX to FIXa is effected by proteolytic cleavage of the R145 A146 bonds and R180 V181 bonds numbering relative to the mature FIX polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 releasing the activation peptide that corresponds to aa 146 180 of the mature FIX protein set forth in SEQ ID NO 3. Thus following activation FIXa consists of two chains the light chain and heavy chain. The light chain contains the Gla domain EGF1 and EGF2 domains and the heavy chain contains the protease domain. The two chains are held together by a single disulphide bond between C132 and C289.

The Factor IX precursor polypeptide undergoes extensive posttranslational modification to become the mature zymogen that is secreted into the blood. Such posttranslation modifications include carboxylation hydroxylation cleavage of the signal peptide and propeptide O and N linked glycosylation sulfation and phosphorylation. The N terminal signal peptide directs the polypeptide to the endoplasmic reticulum ER after which it is cleaved Immediately prior to secretion from the cell the propeptide is cleaved by processing proteases such as for example PACE furin that recognize at least two arginine residues within four amino acids prior to the cleavage site.

A single enzyme vitamin K dependent gamma carboxylase catalyzes the carboxylation FIX in the ER Berkner 2000 130 1877 80 . In the carboxylation reaction the carboxylase binds to the FIX propeptide and catalyzes a second carboxylation on the carbon of the glutamic acid residues i.e. Glu to carboxyglutamyl or Gla in the Gla domain of the polypeptide. Assuming all glutamic acid residues are carboxylated FIX contains 12 Gla residues where the first 10 are at homologous positions of other vitamin K dependent proteins. The Gla domain of FIX then processively carboxylates all glutamates in the cluster before releasing the substrate Morris et al. 1995 Berkner 2000 Stenina et al. 2001 .

FIX also is partially hydroxylated. This modification is performed by a dioxygenase which hydroxylates the carbon of D64 corresponding to the mature FIX polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 in EGF1. Approximately one third of human FIX polypeptides are hydroxylated. Although D64 contributes to the high affinity Ca binding site in the EGF1 domain of FIX the hydroxylation of this residue does not appear to be necessary for Ca binding nor for biological activity Derian et al. 1989 264 6615 6618 Sunnerhagen et al. 1993 268 23339 23344 . Additional post translational modifications include sulfonation at the tyrosine at position 155 and phosphorylation at the serine residue at position 158. These post translational modifications of Factor IX have been implicated in contributing to in vivo recovery of FIX Kaufman 1998 Thromb. Haemost. 79 1068 1079 U.S. Pat. No. 7 575 897 .

FIX is N linked glycosylated at asparagine residues in the activation peptide corresponding to N157 and N167 of the mature FIX polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO 3. Post translational modification also results in the serine residue at position 53 corresponding to the mature FIX polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 having O linked disaccharides and trisaccharides while the serine residue at position 61 contains an O linked tertrasaccharide. Nishimura et al. 1989 264 20320 20325 Harris et al. 1993 32 6539 6547 . Additionally the threonine residues at amino acid positions 159 and 169 corresponding to the mature FIX polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 are O glycosylated Agarwala et al. 1994 33 5167 5171 . The threonine residues at amino acid positions 172 and 179 also may be O glycosylated.

Factor IX circulates predominantly as a zymogen with minimal proteolytic activity until it is activated by proteolytic cleavage. Activation can be effected by the TF FVIIa complex or Factor XIa. Activation by TF FVIIa is through the intrinsic pathway while activation by FXIa is through the extrinsic pathway described above. The process of activation appears to be sequential with initial cleavage of the Arg145 Ala146 bond followed by cleavage of the Arg180 Val181 bond Schmidt et al. 2003 Trends Cardio. Med. 13 39 45 . The proteolytic cleavage releases the activation peptide forming the two chain FIXa molecule containing the light chain corresponding to amino acid positions 1 145 of SEQ ID NO 3 and heavy chain corresponding to amino acid positions 181 415 of SEQ ID NO 3 held together by a disulphide bond between the two cysteines at amino acid positions 132 and 289 numbering corresponding to the mature FIX polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 .

At least two exosites in FX appear to be involved in binding to TF in the TF FVIIa complex to form the FIX TF FVIIa ternary complex Chen et al. 2002 Thromb. Haemost. 88 74 82 . Studies suggest that the EGF1 domain of FIX is required for FIX activation by the TF FVIIa complex. For example mutation of G48 relative to the mature FIX polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 in the EGF1 domain of FIX reduces its activation by TF FVIIa Wu et al. 2000 84 626 634 . Further the EGF1 domain of FIX has been shown to interact with TF in the TF FVIIa complex Zhong et al. 2002 277 3622 . In contrast however the EGF1 domain does not appear to be required for FIX activation by FXIa. The Gla domain also is involved in binding to the TF FVIIa complex and therefore in activation. The Gla domain of FIX interacts with the same region in TF as FX which also is activated by the TF FVIIa complex Kirchhofer et al. 2000 39 7380 7387 .

Following cleavage and release of the activation peptide a new amino terminus at V181 corresponding to the mature FIX polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 V16 by chymotrypsin numbering is generated. Release of the activation peptide facilitates a conformational change whereby the amino group of V181 inserts into the active site and forms a salt bridge with the side chain carboxylate of D364. Such a change is required for conversion of the zymogen state to an active state as the change converts the hydroxyl side chain of S365 to a reactive species that is able to hydrolyze the cleavage site of its substrate FX. The activated FIXa polypeptide remains in a zymogen like conformation until additional conformational changes are induced such as by binding with FVIIIa to generate a FIXa polypeptide with maximal catalytic activity.

FIX plays an important role in the coagulation pathway and a deficiency or absence of FIX activity leads to hemophilia B. Once activated from FIX to FIXa FIXa in turn functions to activate the large amounts of FX to FXa that are required for coagulation. To do so FIXa must first bind to its cofactor Factor VIIIa to form the FIXa FVIIIa complex also called the intrinsic tenase complex on the phospholipid surface of the activated platelet. Both the Gla domain and EGF2 domain of FIX are important for stable binding to phospholipids. The FIXa FVIIIa complex then binds FX to cleave this coagulation factor to form FIXa.

FIXa is virtually inactive in the absence of its cofactor FVIIIa and physiologic substrate FX. Experimental studies indicate that this can be attributed mainly to the 99 loop. When FIXa is not bound by its cofactor Y177 locks the 99 loop in an inactive conformation in which the side chains of Y99 and K98 by chymotrypsin numbering corresponding to Y266 and K265 of the mature FIX polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 impede substrate binding. Binding of FVIIIa to FIXa unlocks and releases this zymogen like conformation and FX is then able to associate with the FIXa FVIIIa complex and rearrange the unlocked 99 loop subsequently binding to the active site cleft Sichler et al. 2003 J. Biol. Chem. 278 4121 4126 . The binding of FIXa to phospholipids and the presence of Ca further enhances the reaction.

Several models of the FIXa FVIIIa interaction have been proposed see e.g. Autin et al. 2005 3 2044 2056 Stoilova McPhie et al. 2002 99 1215 1223 Bajaj et al. 2001 276 16302 16309 Schmidt et al. 2003 13 39 45 . FIXa binds to FVIIIa in an interaction involving more than one domain of the FIXa polypeptide. FVIIIa is a heterodimer composed of three noncovalently associated chains A1 A2 and A3 C1 C2. A3 C1 C2 also is referred to as the light chain. The protease domain of FIXa appears to interact with the A2 subunit of FVIIIa. Studies suggest that the 293 helix 126 helix by chymotrypsin numbering 330 helix 162 helix by chyotrypsin numbering and N346 N178 by chymotrypsin numbering of FIXa are involved in the interaction with the A2 subunit of FVIIIa. The EGF1 EGF2 domains of FIXa interact with the A3 subunit of FVIIIa. Further it is postulated that the Gla domain of FIXa interacts with the C2 domain of FVIIIa. Calcium ions and phospholipids also contribute to binding of FIXa and FVIIIa. For example the presence of phospholipids increases the binding of FIXa to FVIIIa by approximately 2000 fold Mathur et al. 1997 272 . Following binding of FX by the FIXa FVIIIa complex the protease domain or catalytic domain of FIXa is responsible for cleavage of FX at R194 I195 to form FXa.

The activity of FIXa is regulated by inhibitory molecules such as the AT III heparin complex as discussed above and other clearance mechanisms such as the low density lipoprotein receptor related protein LRP . LRP is a membrane glycoprotein that is expressed on a variety of tissues including liver brain placenta and lung. LRP binds a wide range of proteins and complexes in addition to FIXa including but not limited to apolipoproteins lipases proteinases proteinase inhibitor complexes and matrix proteins. The zymogen or inactive form of FIX does not bind LRP. Rather upon activation an LRP binding site is exposed Neels et al. 2000 96 3459 3465 . This binding site is located in a loop in the protease domain spanning residues 342 to 346 of the mature FIX polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 Rohlena et al. 2003 278 9394 9401 .

Factor IX is integrally involved in the blood coagulation process where in its activated form FIXa it forms a tenase complex with FVIIIa and activates FX to FXa. FXa in conjunction with phospholipids calcium and FVa converts prothrombin to thrombin which in turn cleaves fibrinogen to fibrin monomers thus facilitating the formation of a rigid mesh clot. Many studies have demonstrated the ability of exogenous FIX to promote blood clotting in patients with hemophilia. For example hemophilia B patients who are deficient in FIX can be treated by replacement therapy with exogenous FIX. Early replacement therapies utilized plasma purified FIX such as therapeutics marketed as MonoNine Factor IX and Alpha nine SD Factor IX. Plasma purified FIX complex therapeutics also have been used including Bebulin VH a purified concentrate of FIX with FX and low amounts of FVII Konyne 80 Bayer a purified concentrate of FIX with FII FX and low levels of FVII PROPLEX T Baxter International a heat treated product prepared from pooled normal human plasma containing FIX with FII FVII and FX and Profilnine SD Alpha Therapeutic Corporation . More recently however a human recombinant Factor IX BeneFIX Coagulation Factor IX Recombinant Wyeth has been approved for use in the control and prevention of bleeding episodes in hemophilia B patients including control and prevention of bleeding in surgical settings. BeneFIX Coagulation Factor IX Recombinant has an amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO 20 and is identical to the Ala148 allelic form of plasma derived Factor IX. Thus compared to the wild type FIX polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 BeneFIX Coagulation Factor IX Recombinant contains a T148A mutation.

In addition to its use as a procoagulant inactive forms of FIX or forms with reduced catalytic activity can be used as an anticoagulant such as in the treatment of thrombotic diseases and conditions.

Typically FIX is administered intravenously but also can be administered orally systemically buccally transdermally intramuscularly and subcutaneously. FIX can be administered once or multiple times. Generally multiple administrations are used in treatment regimens with FIX to effect coagulation.

As discussed herein below modified FIX polypeptides provided herein also can be used in any treatment or pharmaceutical method in which an unmodified or wildtype or other therapeutically active FIX polypeptide is known to be used. In such uses methods and processes the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein exhibit improved properties compared to a wildtype or the unmodified FIX polypeptide.

Provided herein are modified factor IX polypeptides. The FIX polypeptides can be modified by deletions insertions or replacement substitution of one or more amino acid residues in the primary sequence of a wildtype or unmodified FIX polypeptide. The resulting modified polypeptides exhibit improved properties or activities compared to the unmodified or wildtype FIX polypeptide. For example the modified factor IX polypeptides including modified FIXa polypeptides and fragments of modified factor IX and factor IXa polypeptides can have altered posttranslational modification such as altered glycosylation including hyperglycosylation and or altered phosphorylation or sulfation such as decreased phosphorylation or sulfation increased resistance to inhibitors such as AT III and or heparin decreased binding to LRP increased catalytic activity improved pharmacokinetic properties including decreased clearance and increased serum half life in vivo increased coagulant activity or any combination thereof. Typically the modified FIX polypeptides exhibit procoagulant activity. Thus provided herein are modified FIX polypeptides that exhibit increased coagulant activity upon activation from their single chain zymogen form and subsequent binding to the cofactor FVIIIa. Such modified FIX polypeptides can be administered to patients with diseases or conditions characterized by insufficient coagulation such as for example hemophilia B.

In some examples the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein exhibit increased resistance to inhibitors including AT III heparin and the AT III heparin complex compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide. Such modified FIX polypeptides can exhibit increased coagulant activity compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide. In further examples the modified factor IX polypeptides provided herein exhibit altered posttranslation modification such as altered glycosylation levels and or altered types of glycosylation compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide.

In some examples the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein exhibit increased glycosylation compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide. Thus provided herein are hyperglycosylated FIX polypeptides. The modified FIX polypeptides can exhibit increased glycosylation by virtue of the incorporation of at least one non native glycosylation site i.e. a glycosylation site that is not found in the unmodified or wild type FIX polypeptide to which a carbohydrate moiety is linked. Such modified FIX polypeptides can exhibit improved pharmacokinetic properties in vivo including decreased clearance and increased serum half life. The introduction of a non native glycosylation site and subsequent carbohydrate moiety can further improve the activity of the modified FIX polypeptide by sterically hindering the interaction of the FIX polypeptide with one or more other proteins. For example a glycosylation site can be introduced such that when a carbohydrate moiety is attached at this site it sterically hinders the interaction of the modified FIX polypeptide with the AT III heparin complex resulting in a polypeptide with increased resistance to AT III heparin. This can further reduce clearance of the polypeptide from the circulation. Thus the effects of the introduction of a new glycosylation site can be several fold if the carbohydrate moiety also sterically hinders an interaction with another protein s such as the AT III heparin complex.

For example the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein can contain one or more modifications that introduce one or more non native glycosylation sites compared to the unmodified FIX polypeptide. For example 1 2 3 4 5 6 or more non native glycosylation sites can be introduced. Glycosylation sites that can be introduced include but are not limited to N glycosylation sites O glycosylation sites or a combination thereof. Thus when produced in a cell that facilitates glycosylation or following in vitro glycosylation the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein can contain 1 2 3 4 5 6 or more carbohydrate moieties each linked to different non native glycosylation sites in addition to the carbohydrate moieties linked to the native glycosylation sites e.g. the native glycosylation sites corresponding to S53 S61 N157 N167 T159 T169 T172 and T179 of the mature FIX polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 . In a particular example the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein contain one or more non native N glycosylation sites. Thus the modified FIX polypeptides can exhibit increased levels of N glycosylation compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide.

The modified FIX polypeptides with increased glycosylation also can exhibit for example increased solubility increased AT III heparin resistance increased serum half life decreased immunogenicity and or increased coagulant activity compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide. Such modified FIX polypeptides can be used in the treatment of bleeding disorders or events such as hemophilias or injury where the FIX polypeptides can function to promote blood coagulation. In some instances the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein that exhibit increased glycosylation also can contain one or more modifications that render the protein inactive or mostly inactive. Such polypeptides therefore can exhibit increased anti coagulant activity and can be used in the treatment of thrombotic events conditions or diseases. Typically however the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein are procoagulants.

The modified FIX polypeptides provided herein also can exhibit other activities and or properties. For example some of the modified FIX polypeptides contain one or more modifications that increase catalytic activity. In other examples the modified FIX polypeptides contain one or more modifications that decrease phosphorylation sulfation hydroxylation and or glycosylation. In further examples the modified FIX polypeptides contain modifications that interfere with the interaction between FIX and LRP. By interrupting the binding of FIX to LRP the clearance of FIX from circulation can be decreased. Hence modifications that reduce the binding of FIX to LRP can improve the pharmacokinetic properties of FIX in vivo.

The modifications such as amino acid replacements described herein such as those modifications that introduce one or more non native glycosylation sites or increase resistance to inhibitors can be made in any FIX polypeptide e.g. unmodified or wildtype FIX polypeptide including a precursor FIX polypeptide with a sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO 2 a mature FIX polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 or in a FIX polypeptide having a sequence of amino acids that exhibits at least 40 50 60 70 80 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 or 99 sequence identity to the FIX polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NOS 2 or SEQ ID NO 3. It is understood that reference herein to amino acid residues is with respect to the numbering of the mature FIX polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO 3. It is within the level of one of skill in the art to identify a corresponding amino acid residue in another FIX polypeptide of any form such as a precursor mature or other active form by alignment of the sequence of the other FIX polypeptide with SEQ ID NO 3 see e.g. . Any amino acid replacement provided herein can be made at a corresponding amino acid residue that differs or is not the same as the replacement amino acid residue. It is within the level of one of skill in the art to test any resulting modified FIX polypeptide for activity or property as described herein.

For example the modifications such as an amino acid replacement can be made in any species allelic or modified variant such as those described in the art. Allelic variants of FIX include but are not limited to T148A and T412P. Any of the amino acid replacements provided herein can be a Factor IX that contains mutations T148A or T412P. For example the modifications such as any amino acid replacement can be made in a FIX polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO 325 or SEQ ID NO 20. Exemplary species variants for modification herein include but are not limited to human and non human polypeptides including FIX polypeptides from chimpanzee rhesus macaque mouse rat guinea pig pig dog cat rabbit chicken cow sheep frog zebrafish and Japanese pufferfish FIX polypeptides whose sequences are set forth in SEQ ID NOS 4 18 respectively. Modifications in a FIX polypeptide can be made to a FIX polypeptide that also contains other modifications such as those described in the art including modifications of the primary sequence and modifications not in the primary sequence of the polypeptide see e.g. Section D.6 which describes exemplary modified FIX polypeptides to which the amino acid modifications described herein can be made .

In other examples the modifications such as an amino acid replacement can be made in any active fragment of a FIX polypeptide such as an active fragment of SEQ ID NO 2 or SEQ ID NO 3 or an active fragment of a species allelic or modified variant such as those described in the art. The active fragment contains a contiguous sequence of amino acids containing the catalytically active domain of the polypeptide or a catalytically active portion thereof containing the amino acid modifications such as amino acid replacements describes herein. The active fragment exhibit at least 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 95 or more of the activity of the mature form of the polypeptide such as the FIX polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO 3.

Modification of FIX polypeptides also include modification of polypeptides that are hybrids of different FIX polypeptides and also synthetic FIX polypeptides prepared recombinantly or synthesized or constructed by other methods known in the art based upon the sequence of known polypeptides. For example based on alignment of FIX with other coagulation factor family members including but not limited to factor FVII FVII and factor X FX homologous domains among the family members are readily identified. Chimeric variants of FIX polypeptides can be constructed where one or more amino acids or entire domains are replaced in the FIX amino acid sequence using the amino acid sequence of the corresponding family member. Additionally chimeric FIX polypeptides include those where one or more amino acids or entire domains are replaced in the human FIX amino acid sequence using the amino acid sequence of a different species. Such chimeric proteins can be used as the starting unmodified FIX polypeptide herein.

Modifications provided herein of a starting unmodified reference polypeptide include amino acid replacements or substitutions additions or deletions of amino acids or any combination thereof. For example modified FIX polypeptides include those with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 30 40 50 or more modified positions. In some examples a modification that is made to alter one activity or property of FIX also can or instead affect one more other activities or properties. For example a modification made to increase resistance to inhibitors also or instead can increase catalytic activity. In another example a modification made to introduce a new glycosylation site also can result in increased resistance to inhibitors and or increased catalytic activity. In a further example a modification made to decrease binding to LRP can also or instead increase resistance to an inhibitor such as AT III heparin. Thus although the modifications described herein typically are described in relation to their intended affect on FIX activities or properties it is understood that any of the modifications described herein alone or in conjunction with one or more other modifications can result in changes in other unpredicted activities or properties.

Any modification provided herein can be combined with any other modification known to one of skill in the art. Typically the resulting modified FIX polypeptide exhibits increased coagulation activity when it is in its two chain form. The activities or properties that can be altered as a result of modification include but are not limited to coagulation or coagulant activity pro coagulant activity proteolytic or catalytic activity such as to effect factor X FX activation antigenicity ability to bind to or compete with a polypeptide for binding to an anti FIX antibody ability to bind FVIIIa antithrombin III heparin and or factor X ability to bind to phospholipids three dimensional structure pI and or conformation. Included among the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein are those that have increased resistance to antithrombin III AT III increased resistance to heparin altered glycosylation such as increased glycosylation increased catalytic activity and improved pharmacokinetic properties such as i decreased clearance ii altered volume of distribution iii enhanced in vivo recovery iv enhanced total protein exposure in vivo i.e. AUC v increased serum half life and or phase and or vi increased mean resonance time MRT .

In some examples a modification can affect two or more properties or activities of a FIX polypeptide. For example a modification can result in increased AT III resistance and increased catalytic activity of the modified FIX polypeptide compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide. In another example a modification that introduces a non native N glycosylation site and thus can increase the glycosylation levels of the polypeptide when expressed in an appropriate cell such as a mammalian cell also can result in increased catalytic activity of the modified FIX polypeptide compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide. Modified FIX polypeptides provided herein can be assayed for each property and activity to identify the range of effects of a modification. Such assays are known in the art and described below. Typically changes to the properties and or activities of the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein are made while retaining other FIX activities or properties such as but not limited to binding to FVIIIa and or binding and activation of FX. Hence modified FIX polypeptides provided herein retain FVIIIa binding and or FX binding and activation as compared to a wild type or starting form of the FIX polypeptide. Typically such activity is substantially unchanged less than 1 5 or 10 changed compared to a wild type or starting protein. In other examples the activity of a modified FIX polypeptide is increased or is decreased as compared to a wild type or starting FIX polypeptide. Activity can be assessed in vitro or in vivo and can be compared to the unmodified FIX polypeptide such as for example the mature wild type native FIX polypeptide SEQ ID NO 3 the wild type precursor FIX polypeptide SEQ ID NO 2 or any other FIX polypeptide known to one of skill in the art that is used as the starting material.

The modifications provided herein can be made by standard recombinant DNA techniques such as are routine to one of skill in the art. Any method known in the art to effect mutation of any one or more amino acids in a target protein can be employed. Methods include standard site directed mutagenesis of encoding nucleic acid molecules or by solid phase polypeptide synthesis methods.

Other modifications that are or are not in the primary sequence of the polypeptide also can be included in a modified FIX polypeptide or conjugate thereof including but not limited to the addition of a carbohydrate moiety the addition of a polyethylene glycol PEG moiety the addition of an Fc domain a serum albumin and or other protein. For example such additional modifications can be made to increase the stability or half life of the protein.

The resulting modified FIX polypeptides include those that are single chain zymogen polypeptides and those that are two chain zymogen like polypeptides i.e. FIXa polypeptides that are not bound to the cofactor FVIIIa . Any modified FIX polypeptide provided herein that is a single chain polypeptide can be activated to generate a modified FIXa i.e. a two chain form . The activities of a modified FIX polypeptide are typically exhibited in its two chain form.

Provided herein are modified FIX polypeptides that contain one or more amino acid replacements as described herein below with numbering of residues with respect to the numbering of SEQ ID NO 3. The same amino acid replacements can be made in corresponding amino acid residues in another FIX polypeptide see e.g. for exemplification of identification of corresponding amino acid residues . The amino acid replacements confer altered glycosylation e.g. by introduction of non native glycosylation sites or elimination of native glycosylation sites increased resistance to AT III and or heparin increased catalytic activity decreased LRP binding and or altered posttranslational modifications. The resulting modified FIX polypeptides exhibit improved therapeutic efficacy for example due to improved pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic activity.

In particular non limiting examples of amino acid replacements in modified FIX polypeptides provided herein below are at any one or more amino acid residues 155 318 338 343 403 and or 410 with numbering with respect to the mature FIX polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 corresponding to amino acid residues 155 150 170 175 233 and or 240 respectively by chymotrypsin numbering . The residues corresponding to any of 155 318 338 343 403 and or 410 in other FIX polypeptides can be determined by sequence alignment with SEQ ID NO 3 see e.g. . It is understood that the amino acid replacements provided herein at any of amino acid residues 155 318 338 343 403 and or 410 with numbering with respect to SEQ ID NO 3 can be made in other FIX polypeptides as described elsewhere herein. It is also understood that residues corresponding to any of the other amino acid replacements provided herein also can be identified in other FIX polypeptides as exemplified herein e.g. .

In particular provided herein are amino acid replacements of tyrosine at amino acid residue Y155 Y155F Y155L Y155H R318A R318Y R318E R318F R318W R318D R318I R318K R318L R318M R318N R318S R318V R318Y R338A R338E T343R T343E T343D T343F T343I T343K T343L T343M T343Q T343S T343V T343W T343Y R403A R403E E410Q E410S E410N E410A E410D or a conservative amino acid replacement see e.g. Table 2B . In some examples the amino acid replacement is Y155F R318Y R318E R338E T343R R403E and or E410N or conservative amino acid replacements thereof.

For example as shown by the data herein amino acid replacement at position R318 with reference to SEQ ID NO 3 150 by chymotrypsin numbering confers resistance to inhibition by the AT III heparin complex. An amino acid replacement at position R338 R170 by chymotrypsin numbering also confers resistance to inhibition by the AT III heparin complex. In this respect the amino acid position R338 is the site of a natural mutation R170L that has been reported to exhibit 5 10 fold enhanced clotting activity in an in vitro clotting assay International Pat. Pub. No. WO 2010029178 . The assay as described was performed with conditioned media rather than purified protein and the protein concentration was measured using an ELISA assay. Consequently these data could reflect a higher fraction of active material in the R338L R170L preparation as compared to the wildtype comparator preparation or a higher level of contaminants that are active in a clotting assay. Nevertheless as shown herein there is a 3.5 to 4 fold increased efficiency for FX activation by variants containing A E and L at position 338 170 . As found herein the R338E mutation in addition exhibited an approximately 88 fold resistance to inhibition by the heparin AT III complex as well as 2 fold enhanced binding to the co factor FVIIIa.

A 4 amino acid thrombin loop swap mutation into FIX from positions 342 345 174 177 by chymotrypsin numbering has been reported to reduce the binding of FIXa to sLRP see Rohlena et al. 2003 9394 9401 . Mutation of the residue at position T343 T175 by chymotrypsin numbering did not confer any significant affect on the pharmacokinetic PK properties of FIX. It is found herein that the mutation T343R T175R by chymotrypsin numbering however increases the catalytic efficacy for activation of FX by a factor of about 3.1 produces an approximately 5.6 fold resistance to the heparin AT III complex and increases the affinity for FVIIIa by a factor of approximately 1.6 fold.

Also as shown herein mutations at position R403 R233 by chymotrypsin numbering confer resistance to inhibition by the heparin AT III complex. Mutations at position E410 E240 by chymotypsin numbering such as E410N produce a significant heretofore unobserved 1.3 to 2.8 fold increase in the catalytic efficacy for activation of FX.

Also as shown therein there is a synergy in mutations at R338 and T343 R170 and T175 by chymotrypsin numbering particularly R338E and T343R in enhanced binding to the co factor FVIII. Synergy also was observed between mutations at positions R338 and E410 R170 and E240 by chymotrypsin numbering particularly R338E and E410N. The two double mutants exemplified herein R338E T343R and R338E E410N exhibit 24 to 28 fold improved binding to FVIIIa while each of the single mutations alone enhance binding by 1.6 2.2 fold each.

Other exemplary amino acid replacements in a FIX polypeptide provided herein found to confer an altered property or activity as described below can be at any amino acid residue from among 1 5 53 61 64 85 103 104 105 106 108 148 157 158 159 167 169 172 179 202 203 204 205 228 239 241 243 247 249 251 257 259 260 262 284 293 312 314 315 316 317 319 320 321 333 342 345 346 392 394 400 412 or 413 with reference to SEQ ID NO 3 or at a corresponding amino acid residue. For example exemplary amino acid replacements in a FIX polypeptide provided herein also include but are not limited to Y1N K5A S53A S61A S61C S61D S61E S61F S61G S61I S61K S61L S61P S61R S61V S61W S61Y D64A D64C D64F D64H D64I D64L D64M D64N D64P D64R D64S D64T D64W D85N A103N D104N N105S N105T K106N K106S K106T V108S V108T T148A N157D N157E N157F N157I N157K N157L N157M N157Q N157R N157V N157W N157Y S158A S158D S158E S158F S158G S158I S158K S158L S158M S158R S158V S158W S158Y T159A N167D N167Q N167E N167F N167G N167H N167I N167K N167L N167M N167P N167R N167V N167W N167Y T169A T169D T169E T169F T169G T169I T169K T169L T169M T169P T169R T169S T169V T169W T169Y T172A T172D T172E T172F T172G T172I T172K T172L T172M T172P T172R T172S T172V T172W T172Y T179A V202M V202Y D203N D203M D203Y D203F D203H D203I D203K D203L D203R D203V D203W A204M A204Y A204F A204I A204W F205S F205T K228N E239A E239S E239R E239K E239D E239F E239I E239L E239M E239N E239T E239V E239W E239Y T241N H243S H243T K247N N249S N249T I251S H257F H257E H257D H257I H257K H257L H257M H257Q H257R H257S H257V H257W H257Y N260S A262S A262T Y284N K293E K293A R312A R312Y R312L R312C R312D R312E R312F R312I R312K R312L R312M R312P R312Q R312S R312T R312V R312W R312Y F314N H315S K316M K316D K316F K316H K316I K316L K316M K316R K316S K316T K316V K316W K316Y G317N S319N A320S L321N L321S L321T R333A R333E F342I F342D F342E F342K F342L F342M F342S F342T F342V F342W F342Y Y345A Y345T N346D N346Y N346E N346F N346H N346I N346K N346L N346M N346Q N346R N346T N346V N346W K392N K394S K394T K400A K400E K400C K400D K400F K400G K400L K400M K400P K400S K400T K400V K400Y T412A T412V T412C T412D T412E T412F T412G T412I T412M T412P T412W T412Y K413N in a mature FIX polypeptide having a sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 or the same replacement in a corresponding amino acid residue position.

For example exemplary properties and activities that are altered by the modifications e.g. amino acid replacements provided herein are described as follows.

The modified factor IX polypeptides provided herein can exhibit altered glycosylation levels and or altered types of glycosylation compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide. In some examples the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein exhibit increased glycosylation compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide. Thus among the modified FIX polypeptides described herein are hyperglycosylated FIX polypeptides.

Many mammalian proteins are glycosylated with variable numbers of carbohydrate chains each of which can have differing carbohydrate structures. Such carbohydrates can have an important role in the stability solubility activity serum half life and immunogenicity of the protein. Thus the properties and activities of a protein can be altered by modulating the amount and or type of glycosylation. For example glycosylation can increase serum half life of polypeptides by increasing the stability solubility and reducing the immunogenicity of a protein. This is of particular interest for therapeutic polypeptides where increased solubility serum half life and stability of the therapeutic polypeptide can result in increased therapeutic efficacy.

Oligosaccharides are important in intra and inter cell events such as a recognition signaling and adhesion. Carbohydrates also assist in the folding of secreted proteins. Glycosylation sites provide a site for attachment of monosaccharides and oligosaccharides to a polypeptide via a glycosidic linkage such that when the polypeptide is produced for example in a eukaryotic cell capable of glycosylation it is glycosylated. There are several types of protein glycosylation. N linked and O linked glycosylation are the major classes in which an asparagine residue or a serine or threonine residue respectively is modified. Other types of glycans include glycosaminoglycans and glycosylphophatidylinositol GPI anchors. Glycosaminoglycans are attached to the hydroxy oxygen of serine while GPI anchors attach a protein to a hydrophobic lipid anchor via a glycan chain. C glycosylation also can occur at the consensus sequence Trp X X Trp where the indol side chain of the first tryptophan residue in the sequences is modified with an mannopyranosyl group Furmanek et al. 2000 47 781 789 .

The presence of a potential glycosylation site does not however ensure that the site will be glycosylated during post translational processing in the ER. Furthermore the level of glycosylation can vary at any given site as can the glycan structures. The differences in levels and types of glycosylation at particular sites can be attributed at least in part to the sequence context and secondary structure around the potential glycosylation site.

O linked glycosylation involves the attachment of the sugar units such as N acetylgalactosamine via the hydroxyl group of serine threonine hydroxylysine or hydroxyproline residues. It is initiated by the attachment of one monosaccharide following which others are added to form a mature O glycan structure. There is no known motif for O glycosylation although O glycosylation is more probable in sequences with a high proportion of serine threonine and proline residues. Further secondary structural elements such as an extended turn also may promote O glycosylation. O glycosylation lacks a common core structure. Instead several types of glycans can be attached at the selected O glycosylation sites including O N acetylgalactosamine O GalNAc O N acetylglucosamine O GlcNAc O fucose and O glucose.

In contrast to O glycosylation the N linked glycosylation consensus sequence motif is well characterized. During N linked glycosylation a 14 residue oligosaccharide is transferred to the asparagine residue in the Asn X Ser Thr Cys consensus motif where X is any amino acid except Pro. Glycosyltransferases then enzymatically trim the saccharide and attach additional sugar units to the mannose residues. The sequence adjacent to the consensus motif also can affect whether or not glycosylation occurs at the consensus sequence. Thus the presence of the Asn X Ser Thr Cys consensus sequence is required but not necessarily sufficient for N linked glycosylation to occur. In some instances changes to the adjacent sequence results in glycosylation at the consensus motif where there previously was none Elliot et al. 2004 279 16854 16862 .

N linked oligosaccharides share a common core structure of GlcNAcMan. There are three major types of N linked saccharides in mammals high mannose oligosaccharides complex oligosaccharides and hybrid oligosaccharides. High mannose oligosaccharides essentially contain two N acetylglucosamines with several mannose residues. In some instances the final N linked high mannose oligosaccharide contains as many mannose residues as the precursor oligosaccharide before it is attached to the protein. Complex oligosaccharides can contain almost any number of mannose N acetylglucosamines and fucose saccharides including more than the two N acetylglucosamines in the core structure.

Glycosylation can increase the stability of proteins by reducing the proteolysis of the protein and can protect the protein from thermal degradation exposure to denaturing agents damage by oxygen free radicals and changes in pH. Glycosylation also can allow the target protein to evade clearance mechanisms that can involve binding to other proteins including cell surface receptors. The sialic acid component of carbohydrate in particular can enhance the serum half life of proteins. Sialic acid moieties are highly hydrophilic and can shield hydrophobic residues of the target protein. This increases solubility and decreases aggregation and precipitation of the protein. Decreased aggregation reduces the likelihood of an immune response being raised to the protein. Further carbohydrates can shield immunogenic sequences from the immune system and the volume of space occupied by the carbohydrate moieties can decrease the available surface area that is surveyed by the immune system. These properties can lead to the reduction in immunogenicity of the target protein.

Modifying the level and or type of glycosylation of a therapeutic polypeptide can affect the in vivo activity of the polypeptide. By increasing the level of glycosylation recombinant polypeptides can be made more stable with increased serum half life reduced serum clearance and reduced immunogenicity. This can increase the in vivo activity of the polypeptide resulting in reduced doses and or frequency of dosing to achieve a comparable therapeutic effect. For example a hyperglycosylated form of recombinant human erythropoietin rHuEPO called Darbepoetin alfa DA has increased in vivo activity and prolonged duration of action. The increased carbohydrate and sialic acid content of the hyperglycosylated DA polypeptide results in a serum half life that is three times greater than that of the unmodified rHuEPO. This increased serum half life results in increased bioavailability and reduced clearance which can allow for less frequent dosing and or lower dosages with associated increased convenience for the patient reduced risk of adverse effects and improved patient compliance.

Provided herein are modified FIX polypeptides that are modified to exhibit altered glycosylation compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide. The modified FIX polypeptides can exhibit increased or decreased glycosylation such as by the incorporation of non native glycosylation sites or the deletion of native glycosylation sites respectively. For example the modified FIX polypeptides can contain 1 2 3 4 or more non native N glycosylation sites. The non native N glycosylation sites can be introduced by amino acid replacement s or substitution s insertion s or deletion s or any combination thereof wherein the amino acid replacement s insertion s and or deletion s result in the establishment of the glycosylation motif Asn Xaa Ser Thr Cys where Xaa is not proline. In other examples the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein can have a reduced number of glycosylation sites compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide typically resulting in a reduced level of glycosylation compared to the unmodified FIX polypeptide. In further examples the modified FIX polypeptides exhibit the same levels of glycosylation as wild type FIX but exhibit different types of glycosylation. For example a modified FIX polypeptide can exhibit the same number of glycosylation sites and the same level of glycosylation as an unmodified FIX polypeptide but can have different types of glycosylation such as for example different relative amounts of N and O glycosylation compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide.

In particular examples a non native N glycosylation site is introduced by amino acid replacement. In some instances the creation of a non native N glycosylation site by amino acid replacement requires only one amino acid replacement. For example if the unmodified FIX polypeptide contains a Gly Ala Ser sequence then an N glycosylation site can be created by a single amino acid substitution of the glycine with an asparagine to create an Asn Ala Ser N glycosylation motif. In another example if the unmodified FIX polypeptide contains an Asn Trp Met sequence then an N glycosylation site can be created by a single amino acid substitution of the methionine with a cysteine or threonine or serine . In other instances the creation of a non native N glycosylation site by amino acid replacement requires more than one amino acid replacement. For example if the unmodified FIX polypeptide contains a Gly Arg Phe sequence then an N glycosylation site can be created by two amino acid replacements an amino acid substitution of the glycine with an asparagine and an amino acid substitution of the phenylalanine with a cysteine or threonine or serine to create a Asn Arg Ser Thr Cys N glycosylation motif Thus one of skill in the art can introduce one or more non native N glycosylation sites at any position in the FIX polypeptide.

The position at which a non native glycosylation site is introduced into the FIX polypeptide to generate the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein is typically selected so that any carbohydrate moieties linked at that site do not adversely interfere with the structure function and or procoagulant activity of the FIX polypeptide or that the amino acid modification s made to the polypeptide to introduce the non native glycosylation site do not adversely interfere with the structure function or activity of the FIX polypeptide. Thus a non native glycosylation site can be introduced into any position in a FIX polypeptide provided the resulting modified FIX polypeptide retains at least one activity of the wild type or unmodified FIX polypeptide. Conversely one or more non native glycosylation sites can be introduced into the modified FIX polypeptide at sites that may be involved in the interaction of FIX with an inhibitory molecule. The carbohydrate moiety that is linked to the new glycosylation site can sterically hinder the interaction between the inhibitory molecule and the modified FIX. Such steric hindrance can result in a modified FIX polypeptide with increased coagulant activity. For example a carbohydrate moiety that is linked to a non native glycosylation site contained in the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein can sterically hinder the interaction of the modified FIX with the AT III heparin complex. This can result in increased resistance of the modified FIX polypeptide to the inhibitory effects of AT III heparin.

Thus a non native glycosylation site can be introduced into the Gla domain EGF1 domain EGF2 domain activation peptide and or the protease domain provided the resulting modified FIX polypeptide retains at least one activity of the wild type or unmodified FIX polypeptide. In other examples a non native glycosylation site is introduced into the EGF2 domain or the protease domain. The resulting modified FIX polypeptide retains at least one activity of the unmodified FIX polypeptide. In some examples the modified FIX polypeptide retains at least 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 95 or more of the catalytic activity of the unmodified FIX polypeptide. In other examples the modified FIX polypeptide retains at least 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 95 or more of the binding activity for FX of the unmodified FIX polypeptide. In other examples the modified FIX polypeptide retains at least 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 95 or more of the binding activity for FVIIIa of the unmodified FIX polypeptide. In some assays and or under some conditions the modified FIX polypeptides can exhibit increased activity compared with the unmodified FIX protein e.g. pharmacodynamic activity in vivo and or catalytic activity in the presence of ATIII heparin or plasma 

Table 3 provides non limiting examples of exemplary amino acid replacements corresponding to amino acid positions of a mature FIX polypeptide as set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 that are included in a modified FIX polypeptide to increase glycosylation levels by introducing a non native N glycosylation site. In reference to such mutations the first amino acid one letter abbreviation corresponds to the amino acid that is replaced the number corresponds to the position in the mature FIX polypeptide sequence with reference to SEQ ID NO 3 and the second amino acid one letter abbreviation corresponds to the amino acid selected that replaces the first amino acid at that position. The amino acid positions for mutation also are referred to by the chymotrypsin numbering scheme where appropriate i.e. when the mutation is located within the FIX protease domain . In instances where a modified amino acid position does not have a corresponding chymotrypsin number i.e. is not within amino acid positions 181 to 415 corresponding to a mature FIX polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 and is not set forth in Table 1 above the position is denoted in brackets using mature FIX numbering. For example A103N does not have a corresponding chymotrypsin number and is set forth as A 103 N when referring to chymotrypsin numbering. In Table 3 below the sequence identifier SEQ ID NO is identified in which exemplary amino acid sequences of the modified FIX polypeptide are set forth. Also identified in Table 3 are the positions of the non native glycosylation sites generated by the modifications.

In some instances only one amino acid replacement is required to create a non native N glycosylation site. For example the aspartic acid Asp D at position 85 corresponding to the mature FIX polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 can be replaced with an asparagine Asn N to generate a non native glycosylation site in the EGF2 domain at amino acid position 85 in the resulting modified FIX polypeptide. In another example the isoleucine Ile I at position 251 corresponding to the mature FIX polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 can be replaced with a serine Ser S to generate a non native N glycosylation site in the protease domain at amino acid position 249 in the resulting modified FIX polypeptide. In other instances two amino acid replacements are required to create a new glycosylation site. For example the alanine Ala A at position 103 based on numbering of a mature FIX set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 can be replaced with an asparagine Asn N and the asparagine at position 105 can be replaced with a serine Ser S to create a non native N glycosylation site in the EGF2 domain at amino acid position 103 in the resulting modified FIX polypeptide. In another example the threonine Thr T at position 241 is replaced with an asparagine and the histidine His H at position 243 is replaced with a serine to create a non native N glycosylation site in the protease domain at amino acid position 243.

The modified FIX polypeptides provided herein can contain modifications that result in the introduction of two or more non native N glycosylation sites. For example the modifications set forth in Table 3 can be combined resulting in a modified FIX polypeptide that contains 2 3 4 5 6 or more non native N glycosylation sites. Any two or more of the modifications set forth in Table 3 can be combined. For example included among the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein are modified FIX polypeptides that contain the amino acid substitutions D104N K106S K228N resulting in a FIX polypeptide with two non native glycosylation sites at amino acid positions 104 and 228 respectively numbering corresponding to the mature FIX polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 . In another example a modified FIX polypeptide can contain amino acid substitutions D85N K247N N249S K392N K394S resulting in a FIX polypeptide with three non native glycosylation sites at amino acid positions 85 247 and 392 respectively numbering corresponding to the mature FIX polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 . Table 4 sets forth exemplary FIX polypeptides having two or more non native N glycosylation sites.

The modified FIX polypeptides provided herein can contain one or more non native glycosylation sites such as one or more non native N glycosylation sites. Thus when expressed in a cell that facilitates glycosylation or when glycosylated using in vitro techniques well know in the art the modified FIX polypeptides can exhibit increased levels of glycosylation compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide. The level of glycosylation can be increased by at least or at least about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 200 300 400 500 or more compared to the level of glycosylation of unmodified or wild type FIX polypeptide.

The modifications described herein to introduce one or more non native glycosylation sites can be combined with any other mutation described herein or known in the art. Typically the resulting modified FIX polypeptide exhibits increased coagulant activity compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide. For example one or more modifications that introduce one or more non native glycosylation sites can be combined with modification s that increase resistance to an inhibitor such as AT III and or heparin increase catalytic activity increase intrinsic activity increase binding to phospholipids decrease binding to LRP and or improve pharmacokinetic and or pharmacodynamic properties.

The modified FIX polypeptides provided herein that contain one or more non native glycosylation sites and have altered glycosylation such as increased levels of glycosylation retain at least one activity of FIX such as for example catalytic activity for its substrate FX. Typically the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein retain at least or at least about 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 95 or more of the catalytic activity exhibited by an unmodified FIX polypeptide. Increased levels of glycosylation can improve the pharmacokinetic properties of the modified FIX polypeptides by endowing the variant with one or more of the following properties i decreased clearance ii altered volume of distribution iii enhanced in vivo recovery iv enhanced total protein exposure in vivo i.e. AUC v increased serum half life and or phase and or vi increased mean resonance time MRT compared to an unmodified FIX. The coagulant activity of the modified FIX polypeptides with altered glycosylation can be increased by at least or at least about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 200 300 400 500 or more compared to the coagulation activity of unmodified or wild type FIX polypeptide either in vivo or in vitro.

The modified FIX polypeptides provided herein can have a reduced number of glycosylation sites compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide. Typically a reduction in the number of glycosylation sites results in a reduced level of glycosylation compared to the unmodified FIX polypeptide. The native glycosylation sites that can be removed include for example native N glycosylation sites at amino acid positions corresponding to positions 157 and 167 of the mature FIX set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 and native O glycosylation sites at amino acid positions corresponding to positions 53 61 159 169 172 and 179 of the mature FIX set forth in SEQ ID NO 3.

Any one or more native glycosylation sites can be removed by amino acid replacement s insertion s or deletion s or any combination thereof. For example an amino acid replacement deletion and or insertion can be made to destroy the Asn Xaa Ser Thr Cys motif where Xaa is not a proline thereby removing an N glycosylation site at position 157 or 167. In other examples O glycosylation sites are removed such as by amino acid replacement or deletion of the serine residues at positions 53 or 61 or amino acid replacement or deletion of the threonine residues at positions 159 or 169. The resulting modified FIX polypeptide retains at least one activity of the unmodified FIX polypeptide. In some examples the modified FIX polypeptide retains at least 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 95 or more of the catalytic activity of the unmodified FIX polypeptide. In other examples the modified FIX polypeptide retains at least 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 95 or more of the binding activity for FX of the unmodified FIX polypeptide. In other examples the modified FIX polypeptide retains at least 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 95 or more of the binding activity for FVIIIa of the unmodified FIX polypeptide. In some assays and or under some conditions the modified FIX polypeptides can exhibit enhanced properties compared with unmodified FIX e.g. including but not limited to increased in vivo recovery increased AUC in vivo and or decreased clearance in vivo .

Table 5 provides non limiting examples of exemplary amino acid replacements corresponding to amino acid positions of a mature FIX polypeptide as set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 that are included in a modified FIX polypeptide to decrease glycosylation levels by removing or eliminating a native N glycosylation site. In Table 5 below the sequence identifier SEQ ID NO is identified in which exemplary amino acid sequences of the modified FIX polypeptide are set forth.

The modifications described herein to eliminate one or more native glycosylation sites can be combined with any other mutation described herein or known in the art. Typically the resulting modified FIX polypeptide exhibits increased coagulant activity compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide. For example one or more modifications that eliminate one or more native glycosylation sites can be combined with modification s that introduce a non native glycosylation site increase resistance to an inhibitor such as AT III and or heparin increase catalytic activity increase intrinsic activity increase binding to phospholipids or improve pharmacokinetic and or pharmacodynamic properties.

The modified FIX polypeptides provided herein that eliminate one or more native glycosylation sites retain at least one activity of FIX such as for example catalytic activity for its substrate FX. Typically the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein retain at least or at least about 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 95 or more of the catalytic activity exhibited by an unmodified FIX polypeptide. In some instances the coagulant activity of the modified FIX polypeptides with altered glycosylation can be increased by at least or at least about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 200 300 400 500 or more compared to the coagulation activity of unmodified or wild type FIX polypeptide either in vivo or in vitro.

The activity of FIX can be inhibited by factors in the blood as part of the regulation of the coagulation process. Thus provided herein are modified FIX polypeptides that exhibit increased resistance to the inhibitory effects of inhibitors including AT III and heparin. In some examples the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein exhibit reduced binding affinity for heparin and or a decreased second order rate constant for inhibition by AT III alone and or the AT III heparin complex. In further examples the modified FIX polypeptides exhibit increased resistance to the AT III alone or heparin alone. Thus provided herein are modified FIX polypeptides that exhibit increased resistance to AT III the AT III heparin complex and or heparin.

Antithrombin III also known as antithrombin or AT III is an important anticoagulant serpin serine protease inhibitor . AT III is synthesized as a precursor protein containing 464 amino acid residues SEQ ID NO 21 . In the course of secretion a 32 residue signal peptide is cleaved to generate a 432 amino acid mature human antithrombin SEQ ID NO 22 . The 58 kDa AT III glycoprotein circulates in the blood and functions as a serine protease inhibitor serpin to inhibit a large number of serine proteases of the coagulation system. The principal targets of AT III are thrombin factor Xa and factor IXa although AT III also has been shown to inhibit the activities of FXIa FXIIa and to a lesser extent FVIIa.

The action of AT III is greatly enhanced by glycosaminoglycans such as the naturally occurring heparan sulphate or the various tissue derived heparins that are widely used as anticoagulants in clinical practice. Unlike other serpins which typically are effective without binding a secondary molecule the reaction of AT III in the absence of heparin with is target coagulations factors is unusually slow. In the absence of heparin the reactive loop sequence of AT III provides the determinants of the slow reactivity. Mutagenesis of the conserved P2 P1 residues in the reactive loop center of AT III for example affects the interaction of AT III with proteases in the absence but not the presence of heparin.

AT III binds in a highly specific manner to a unique pentasaccharide sequence in heparin that induces a conformational change in the reactive center loop. In such a conformation the reactive center loop of AT III can more efficiently interact with the reactive site of the serine protease and effect inhibition. Evidence suggests that binding of heparin to AT III generates new exosites that promote the interaction of FIXa thrombin and FXa with AT III. The tyrosine at position 253 and the glutamic acid at position 255 for example have been shown to be key determinants of an exosite on AT III that is generated by heparin binding and that promotes the rapid increased inhibition of FIXa by AT III compared to the inhibition observed with AT III alone Izaguirre et al. 2006 281 13424 13432 .

Mutational studies also have given some indication of which residues in Factor IXa are involved in the interaction with AT III heparin. For example modification of the arginine at position 318 of the mature FIX polypeptide corresponding to position 150 by chymotrypsin numbering reduces the reactivity of this mutant with AT III heparin by 33 fold to 70 fold Yang L. et al. 2003 278 27 25032 8 . The impairment of the reactivity between the FIXa mutant and AT III is not as noticeable when AT III is not bound to heparin however indicating that the interaction between the arginine at position 318 of the mature FIXa polypeptide and AT III is effected when AT III is in the heparin activated conformation.

Heparin can inhibit the activity of FIXa in the intrinsic tenase complex in both an AT III dependent manner as discussed above and an AT III independent manner. Studies indicate that the AT III independent inhibition of FIXa activity by heparin is the result of oligosaccharide binding to an exosite on FIXa that disrupts the FVIIIa FIXa interaction Yuan et al. 2005 44 3615 3625 Misenheimer et al. 2007 46 7886 7895 Misenheimer et al. 2010 49 9977 10005 . The heparin binding exosite is in the Factor IXa protease domain in an electropositive region extending from the arginine at position 338 corresponding to position 170 by chymotrypsin numbering to at least the arginine at position 403 corresponding to position 233 by chymotrypsin numbering . This exosite overlaps with a region of FIXa that is critical to the interaction of FIXa with its cofactor FVIIIa. Thus binding of heparin to FIXa inhibits the interaction of FIXa with FVIIIa thus reducing the intrinsic tenase activity.

Modifications can be made to a FIX polypeptide that increase its resistance to AT III heparin and or the AT III heparin complex. Generally such modified FIX polypeptides retain at least one activity of a FIX polypeptide. Typically such modifications include one or more amino acid substitutions at any position of the FIX polypeptide that is involved in the interaction of FIXa with AT III heparin an or the AT III heparin complex. Such modifications can for example result in a reduced rate of interaction of the modified FIXa polypeptide with AT III alone a reduced rate of interaction of the modified FIXa polypeptide to the AT III heparin complex and or a reduced binding affinity of the modified FIXa polypeptide for heparin alone. In some examples the modification s introduces one or more non native glycosylation sites. The carbohydrate moiety that is linked to the new glycosylation site can sterically hinder the interaction of the modified FIX with the AT III heparin complex resulting in increased resistance of the modified FIX polypeptide to the inhibitory effects of AT III heparin. The modified FIXa polypeptides therefore exhibit increased resistance to the naturally inhibitory effects of AT III AT III heparin and or heparin with respect to intrinsic tenase activity. When evaluated in an appropriate in vitro assay or in vivo such as following administration to a subject as a pro coagulant therapeutic the modified FIX polypeptides display increased coagulant activity as compared with unmodified FIX polypeptides.

As described herein below one of skill in the art can empirically or rationally design modified FIXa polypeptides that display increased resistance to AT III AT III heparin and or heparin. Such modified FIX polypeptides can be tested in assays known to one of skill in the art to determine if the modified FIX polypeptides display increased resistance to AT III AT III heparin and or heparin. For example the modified FIX polypeptides can be tested for binding to AT III AT III heparin and or heparin. Generally a modified FIX polypeptide that has increased resistance to AT III AT III heparin and or heparin will exhibit decreased binding and or decreased affinity for heparin and or a decreased rate of interaction with AT III and or AT III heparin. Typically such assays are performed with the activated form of FIX FIXa and in the presence or absence of the cofactor FVIIIa and phospholipids.

Provided herein are modified FIX polypeptides exhibiting increased resistance to AT III AT III heparin and or heparin. FIX polypeptide variants provided herein have been modified at one or more of amino acid positions 202 203 204 205 228 239 257 260 293 312 316 318 319 321 333 338 342 346 400 403 or 410 corresponding to amino acid positions 38 39 40 41 63 74 92 95 126 143 145 148 150 151 153 165 170 174 178 230 233 and 240 respectively by chymotrypsin numbering . These amino acid residues can be modified such as by amino acid replacement deletion or substitution. The identified residues can be replaced or substituted with any another amino acid. Alternatively amino acid insertions can be used to alter the conformation of a targeted amino acid residue or the protein structure in the vicinity of a targeted amino acid residue.

Any amino acid residue can be substituted for the endogenous amino acid residue at the identified positions. Typically the replacement amino acid is chosen such that it interferes with the interaction between FIX and AT III or heparin. For example modifications can be made at amino acid positions 260 293 333 338 346 400 and 410 corresponding to amino acid positions 95 126 165 170 178 230 233 and 240 respectively by chymotrypsin numbering to interfere with the interaction of the FIX polypeptide with heparin. In other examples modifications are made at amino acid positions 203 204 205 228 239 312 314 316 318 319 321 and 342 corresponding to amino acid positions 39 40 41 63 74 143 145 148 150 151 153 and 174 respectively by chymotrypsin numbering to interfere with the interaction of the FIX polypeptide with AT III.

In some examples a new glycosylation site is introduced by amino acid replacement. The carbohydrate moiety that is linked to the new glycosylation site can sterically hinder the interaction of the modified FIX with the AT III heparin complex resulting in increased resistance of the modified FIX polypeptide to the inhibitory effects of AT III heparin. For example the glutamic acid Glu E at position 410 corresponding to position 240 by chymotrypsin numbering can be replaced with an asparagine Asn N to introduce a new glycosylation site at position 410. In other examples the glutamic acid Glu E at position 239 corresponding to position 74 by chymotrypsin numbering is replaced with an asparagine Asn N to introduce a new glycosylation site at position 239. Other mutations that introduce a new glycosylation site to increase resistance to AT III heparin include for example D203N F205T R318N A320S N260S and F314N K316S corresponding to D39N F41T R150N A152S N95S and F145N K148S by chymotrypsin numbering .

In other examples in which modifications are made to increase resistance to AT III AT III heparin and or heparin the valine residue at position 202 corresponding to position 38 by chymotrypsin numbering is replaced with a methionine Met M or tyrosine Tyr Y the aspartic acid Asp D at position 203 corresponding to position 39 by chymotrypsin numbering is replaced with a methionine Met M or tyrosine Tyr Y the alanine Ala A at position 204 corresponding to position 40 by chymotrypsin numbering is replaced with a methionine Met M or tyrosine Tyr Y the glutamic acid at position 239 corresponding to position 74 by chymotrypsin numbering is replaced with serine Ser S alanine Ala A arginine Arg R or lysine Lys K the histidine at position 257 corresponding to position 92 by chymotrypsin numbering is replaced with phenylalanine Phe F tyrosine Tyr Y glutamic acid Glu E or serine Ser S the lysine Lys K at position 293 corresponding to position 143 by chymotrypsin numbering is replaced with alanine Ala A or glutamine Gln Q the arginine Arg R at position 312 corresponding to position 143 by chymotrypsin numbering is replaced with alanine Ala A or glutamine Gln Q the lysine at position 316 corresponding to 148 by chymotrypsin numbering is replaced with asparagine Asn N alanine Ala A glutamic acid Glu E serine Ser S or methionine Met M the arginine Arg R at position 318 corresponding to position 150 by chymotrypsin numbering is replaced with alanine Ala A glutamic acid Glu E tyrosine Tyr Y phenylalanine Phe F or tryptophan Trp W the arginine Arg R at position 333 corresponding to position 165 by chymotrypsin numbering is replaced with alanine Ala A or glutamic acid Glu E the arginine Arg R at position 338 corresponding to position 170 by chymotrypsin numbering is replaced with alanine Ala A or glutamic acid Glu E the lysine Lys K at position 400 corresponding to position 230 by chymotrypsin numbering is replaced with alanine Ala A or glutamic acid Glu E and or the arginine Arg R at position 403 corresponding to position 233 by chymotrypsin numbering is replaced with alanine Ala A glutamic acid Glu E or aspartic acid Asp D .

Provided herein are modified FIX polypeptides that contain an amino acid replacement at residue R318 or at a residue in a FIX polypeptide corresponding to 318 that is a tyrosine e.g. R318Y or is a conservative amino acid replacement thereof. For example conservative amino acid residues for tyrosine include but are not limited to phenylalanine F or tryptophan W . Also provided are modified FIX polypeptides that contain an amino acid replacement at residue R403 or at a residue in a FIX polypeptide corresponding to 403 that is a glutamic acid e.g. R403E or is a conservative amino acid replacement thereof. For example conservative amino acid residues for glutamic acid include but are not limited to aspartic acid D .

In a further embodiment combination mutants can be generated. Included among such combination mutants are those having two or more mutations at amino acid positions 202 203 204 257 239 293 312 316 318 333 338 400 403 and 410 corresponding to amino acid positions 38 39 40 74 92 126 143 148 150 165 170 230 233 and 240 respectively by chymotrypsin numbering . For example a modified FIX polypeptide can possess amino acid substitutions at 2 3 4 5 or more of the identified positions. Hence a modified polypeptide can display 1 2 3 4 5 or more mutations that can result in increased resistance of the modified FIX polypeptide to the inhibitory effects of AT III AT III heparin and or heparin. Any one or more of the mutations described herein to increase resistance of the modified FIX polypeptide to the inhibitory effects of AT III AT III heparin and or heparin can be combined.

Table 6 provides non limiting examples of exemplary amino acid replacements at the identified residues corresponding to amino acid positions of a mature FIX polypeptide as set forth in SEQ ID NO 3. Included amongst these are exemplary combination mutations. As noted such FIX polypeptides are designed to increase resistance to AT III AT III heparin and or heparin and therefore have increased coagulant activity in vivo ex vivo or in in vitro assays that include ATIII heparin ATIII heparin plasma serum or blood. In reference to such mutations the first amino acid one letter abbreviation corresponds to the amino acid that is replaced the number corresponds to the position in the mature FIX polypeptide sequence with reference to SEQ ID NO 3 and the second amino acid one letter abbreviation corresponds to the amino acid selected that replaces the first amino acid at that position. The amino acid positions for mutation also are referred to by the chymotrypsin numbering scheme. In Table 6 below the sequence identifier SEQ ID NO is identified in which exemplary amino acid sequences of the modified FIX polypeptide are set forth.

The modifications described herein to increase resistance to an inhibitor such as AT III and or heparin can be combined with any other mutation described herein or known in the art. Typically the resulting modified FIX polypeptide exhibits increased coagulant activity compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide. For example one or more modifications that increase resistance to an inhibitor such as AT III and or heparin can be combined with modification s that introduce a non native glycosylation site eliminate one or more native glycosylation sites eliminate one or more of the native sulfation phosphorylation or hydroxylation sites increase catalytic activity increase intrinsic activity increase binding to phospholipids or improve pharmacokinetic and or pharmacodynamic properties. The resulting modified FIX polypeptide typically exhibits increased coagulant activity compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide.

Modified FIX polypeptides that have increased resistance for AT III alone the AT III heparin complex and or heparin alone can exhibit a reduction in the affinity for heparin the extent of inhibition under specified conditions or in the second order rate constant for inhibition by ATIII or heparin ATIII at least or at least about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 95 99 or more compared to the affinity extent of inhibition or the second order rate constant for inhibition of unmodified or wild type FIX polypeptide either in vivo or in vitro. Thus the modified FIX polypeptides can exhibit increased resistance to AT III alone the AT III heparin complex and or heparin alone that is at least or at least about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 200 300 400 500 or more of the resistance exhibited by an unmodified FIX polypeptide. Increased resistance to AT III the AT III heparin complex and or heparin by such modified FIX polypeptides also can be manifested as increased coagulation activity or improved duration of coagulation activity in vivo or in vitro in the presence of AT III the AT III heparin complex heparin blood plasma or serum. The coagulation activity of the modified FIX polypeptides can be increased by at least about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 200 300 400 500 or more compared to the coagulation activity of unmodified or wild type FIX polypeptide either in vivo or in vitro. Modified FIX polypeptides containing modifications that increase resistance to AT III the heparin AT III complex and or heparin also can exhibit an enhanced therapeutic index compared with unmodified FIXa.

The modified FIX polypeptides provided herein can contain one or more modifications to increase the catalytic activity of the polypeptide compared to an unmodified FIX. For example modifications can be made to the amino acids that are involved in the interaction of FIX with its cofactor FVIIIa such that the resulting modified FIX polypeptide has increased affinity for FVIIIa and thereby displays increased activity toward FX under conditions in which FVIIIa is not present at saturating concentrations. Modifications also can be made to the protease domain of the FIX polypeptide such that the activity or catalytic efficiency of the modified FIX polypeptide for activation of FX in the presence and or absence of the co factor FVIIIa is increased compared to the activity or catalytic efficiency of the unmodified polypeptide.

Exemplary modifications that can be included in the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein include amino acid replacements at positions 259 265 345 410 and 412 corresponding to 94 98 177 240 and 242 by chymotrypsin numbering . The amino acids at these positions can be replaced by any other amino acid residue. In some examples the tyrosine at position 259 is replaced with a phenylalanine the lysine at position 265 is replaced with a threonine and or the tyrosine at position 345 is replaced with a threonine. In further example the glutamic acid at position 410 is replaced with a glutamine serine alanine or aspartic acid. In one example the threonine at position 412 is replaced with a valine or an alanine.

The above mentioned modifications are exemplary only. Many other modifications described herein also result in increased catalytic activity. For example modifications that are introduced into the FIX polypeptide to increase resistance to an inhibitor such as AT III and or heparin introduce a non native glycosylation site eliminate one or more native glycosylation sites eliminate one or more of the native sulfation phosphorylation or hydroxylation sites increase intrinsic activity increase binding to phospholipids decrease binding to LRP and or improve pharmacokinetic and or pharmacodynamic properties can also result in a modified FIX polypeptide that exhibits increased activity.

Table 7 provides non limiting examples of exemplary amino acid replacements at the identified residues corresponding to amino acid positions of a mature FIX polypeptide as set forth in SEQ ID NO 3. In reference to such mutations the first amino acid one letter abbreviation corresponds to the amino acid that is replaced the number corresponds to the position in the mature FIX polypeptide sequence with reference to SEQ ID NO 3 and the second amino acid one letter abbreviation corresponds to the amino acid selected that replaces the first amino acid at that position. The amino acid positions for mutation also are referred to by the chymotrypsin numbering scheme. In Table 7 below the sequence identifier SEQ ID NO is identified in which exemplary amino acid sequences of the modified FIX polypeptide are set forth.

The modifications described herein to increase catalytic activity can be combined with any other mutation described herein or known in the art. Typically the resulting modified FIX polypeptide exhibits increased coagulant activity compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide. For example one or more modifications that increase catalytic activity can be combined with modification s that increase resistance to an inhibitor such as AT III and or heparin introduce a non native glycosylation site eliminate one or more native glycosylation sites eliminate one or more of the native sulfation phosphorylation or hydroxylation sites increase intrinsic activity increase binding to phospholipids or improve pharmacokinetic and or pharmacodynamic properties. The resulting modified FIX polypeptide typically exhibits increased coagulant activity compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide.

Modified FIX polypeptides that have increased catalytic activity can exhibit at least or about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 95 99 or more activity compared to the catalytic activity of unmodified or wild type FIX polypeptide either in vivo or in vitro. Increased catalytic activity of such modified FIX polypeptides also can be manifested as increased coagulation activity duration of coagulation activity and or enhanced therapeutic index. The coagulation activity of the modified FIX polypeptides can be increased by at least or at least about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 200 300 400 500 or more compared to the coagulation activity of unmodified or wild type FIX polypeptide either in vivo or in vitro.

FIXa can be cleared from systemic circulation by binding the low density lipoprotein receptor related protein LRP which is a membrane glycoprotein that is expressed on a variety of tissues including liver brain placenta and lung. Thus provided herein are modified FIX polypeptides that exhibit decreased binding to the LRP. This can result in improved pharmacokinetic properties of the modified FIX polypeptide including for example i decreased clearance ii altered volume of distribution iii enhanced in vivo recovery iv enhanced total protein exposure in vivo i.e. AUC v increased serum half life and or phase and or vi increased mean resonance time MRT . Such modified FIX polypeptides can exhibit increased coagulant activity.

The modified FIX polypeptide provided herein can contain one or more modifications in the LRP binding site. This binding site is postulated to be located in a loop in the protease domain spanning residues 342 to 346 of the mature FIX polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO 3. Modification of one or more of the residues at positions 342 346 corresponding to positions 174 178 by chymotrypsin numbering such as by amino acid replacement insertion or deletion can interfere with the interaction between the modified FIX polypeptide and LRP resulting in decreased binding affinity. The binding of the modified FIX polypeptides to LRP can be tested using assays known to one of skill in the art see e.g. Rohlena et al. 2003 J. Biol. Chem. 278 9394 9401 . The resulting improved pharmacokinetic properties also can be tested using well known in vivo assays including those described below.

Exemplary modifications that can be included in the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein include amino acid replacements at positions 343 344 345 and 346 corresponding to 175 176 177 and 178 by chymotrypsin numbering . The amino acids at these positions can be replaced by any other amino acid residue. In some examples the threonine at position 343 is replaced with a glutamine glutamic acid aspartic acid or arginine the phenylalanine at position 344 is replaced with an isoleucine the tyrosine at position 345 is replaced with a threonine alanine or an alanine and or the asparagine at position 346 is replaced with an aspartic acid or a tyrosine. Any one or more of these exemplary amino acid replacements can be combined with each other or with other modifications described herein.

Provided herein are modified FIX polypeptides that contain an amino acid replacement at residue T343 or at a residue in a FIX polypeptide corresponding to 343 that is an arginine e.g. T343R or is a conservative amino acid replacement thereof. For example conservative amino acid residues for arginine include but are not limited to lysine K .

Table 8 provides non limiting examples of exemplary amino acid replacements at the identified residues corresponding to amino acid positions of a mature FIX polypeptide as set forth in SEQ ID NO 3. In reference to such mutations the first amino acid one letter abbreviation corresponds to the amino acid that is replaced the number corresponds to the position in the mature FIX polypeptide sequence with reference to SEQ ID NO 3 and the second amino acid one letter abbreviation corresponds to the amino acid selected that replaces the first amino acid at that position. The amino acid positions for mutation also are referred to by the chymotrypsin numbering scheme. In Table 8 below the sequence identifier SEQ ID NO is identified in which exemplary amino acid sequences of the modified FIX polypeptide are set forth.

The modifications described herein to decrease binding to LRP can be combined with any other mutation described herein or known in the art. Typically the resulting modified FIX polypeptide exhibits increased coagulant activity compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide. For example one or more modifications that decrease binding to LRP can be combined with modification s that increase resistance to an inhibitor such as AT III and or heparin increase catalytic activity introduce a non native glycosylation site eliminate one or more native glycosylation sites eliminate one or more of the native sulfation phosphorylation or hydroxylation sites increase activity in the presence and or absence of FVIIIa increase binding to phospholipids or improve pharmacokinetic and or pharmacodynamic properties. The resulting modified FIX polypeptide typically exhibits increased coagulant activity compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide.

Modified FIX polypeptides that have decreased binding to LRP can exhibit at a decrease of at least or about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 95 99 or more compared to the binding of unmodified or wild type FIX polypeptide to LRP in vitro. Decreased binding to LRP by such modified FIX polypeptides can result in improved pharmacokinetic properties such as i decreased clearance ii altered volume of distribution iii enhanced in vivo recovery iv enhanced total protein exposure in vivo i.e. AUC v increased serum half life and or phase and or vi increased mean resonance time MRT . Further such alterations can result in increased coagulant activity duration of coagulation activity and or enhanced therapeutic index. The coagulation activity of the modified FIX polypeptides can be increased by at least or at least about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 200 300 400 500 or more compared to the coagulation activity of unmodified or wild type FIX polypeptide either in vivo or in vitro.

Wild type FIX is posttranslationally modified upon expression in mammalian cells. The Factor IX precursor polypeptide undergoes extensive posttranslational modification to become the mature zymogen that is secreted into the blood. Such posttranslational modifications include carboxylation hydroxylation O and N linked glycosylation sulfation and phosphorylation. As discussed above the levels of glycosylation can be altered by for example introducing new non native glycosylation sites and or eliminating native glycosylation sites. Similarly other posttranslational modifications can be altered such as by introducing and or eliminating carboxylation hydroxylation sulfation and or phosphorylation sites.

Any one or more of the native carboxylation hydroxylation sulfation or phosphorylation sites can be eliminated such as by amino acid replacement or deletion. For example unmodified FIX polypeptides can be modified by amino acid replacement of any one or more of the twelve glutamic acid residues corresponding to positions 7 8 15 17 20 21 26 27 30 33 36 and 40 of the mature FIX set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 in the Gla domain. These residues typically are carboxylated to carboxyglutamyl or Gla in wild type FIX. Thus removal of the glutamic acid residues such as by amino acid substitution or deletion can reduce the level of carboxylation in a modified FIX polypeptide compared to the unmodified FIX polypeptide. Similarly the aspartic acid residue at position 64 which normally is hydroxylated in wild type FIX can be removed such as by amino acid substitution or deletion. Additional post translational modification sites that can be eliminated include for example the tyrosine at position 155 which typically is sulfated in wild type FIX and the serine residue at position 158 which typically is phosphorylated in wild type FIX.

In other examples non native post translational modification sites can be introduced such as by amino acid replacement or insertion. For example additional glutamic acid residues can be introduced into the Gla domain. Such glutamic acid residues could be carboxylated to carboxyglutamyl or Gla in the modified FIX polypeptide upon expression in for example a mammalian cell. Similarly one or more non native hydroxylation sulfation or phosphorylation sites can be introduced.

Provided herein are modified FIX polypeptides that have one or more of the native posttranslational modification sites eliminated. The modified FIX polypeptides that have been modified to eliminate one or more post translational modification sites including carboxylation hydroxylation sulfation and or phosphorylation sites retain at least one activity of the unmodified FIX polypeptide. In some examples the modified FIX polypeptide retains at least or at least about 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 95 or more of the catalytic activity of the unmodified FIX polypeptide. In other examples the modified FIX polypeptide retains at least or at least about 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 95 or more of the binding activity for FVIIIa of the unmodified FIX polypeptide. In some assays and or under some conditions the modified FIX polypeptides can exhibit increased activity compared with the unmodified FIX protein e.g. increased pharmacodynamic activity in vivo and or activity in the presence of AT III heparin or plasma .

Provided herein are modified FIX polypeptides that contains an amino acid replacement at residue Y155 or at a residue in a FIX polypeptide corresponding to 155 that is a phenylalanine e.g. Y155F or is a conservative amino acid replacement thereof. For example conservative amino acid residues for phenylalanine include but are not limited to methionine M leucine L or tyrosine Y .

Table 9 provides non limiting examples of exemplary amino acid replacements corresponding to amino acid positions of a mature FIX polypeptide as set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 that are included in a modified FIX polypeptide to eliminate a native hydroxylation sulfation and or phosphorylation sites at positions 64 155 and 158 respectively. In Table 9 below the sequence identifier SEQ ID NO is identified in which exemplary amino acid sequences of the modified FIX polypeptide are set forth.

The modifications described herein to eliminate hydroxylation sulfation and or phosphorylation sites can be combined with any other mutation described herein or known in the art. Typically the resulting modified FIX polypeptide exhibits increased coagulant activity compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide. For example one or more modifications that eliminate one or more native hydroxylation sulfation and or phosphorylation sites can be combined with modification s that increase resistance to an inhibitor such as AT III and or heparin alter glycosylation such as increase glycosylation increase catalytic activity increase intrinsic activity increase binding to phospholipids or improve pharmacokinetic and or pharmacodynamic properties.

The modified FIX polypeptides provided herein that eliminate one or more native hydroxylation sulfation and or phosphorylation sites retain at least one activity of FIX such as for example catalytic activity for its substrate FX or binding to the co factor FVIIIa. Typically the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein retain at least or at least about 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 95 or more of the catalytic activity exhibited by an unmodified FIX polypeptide. In some instances the coagulant activity of the modified FIX polypeptides is increased by at least or at least about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 200 300 400 500 or more compared to the coagulation activity of unmodified or wild type FIX polypeptide either in vivo or in vitro.

The modified FIX polypeptides provided herein that contain one or more non native glycosylation sites have one or more native glycosylation sites eliminated have one or more native hydroxylation sulfation and or phosphorylation sites eliminated or that have modifications that can result in increased resistance to inhibitors such as AT III AT III heparin and or heparin compared to a wild type FIX polypeptide also can contain other modifications. In some examples the modified FIX polypeptides contain modifications that introduce one or more non native glycosylation sites and also contain modifications that interfere with the interaction between FIX and inhibitors such as AT III the AT III heparin complex and or and heparin. In other examples modifications that eliminate one or more native hydroxylation sulfation and or phosphorylation sites can be combined with modifications that increase resistance to inhibitors and or modifications that introduce one or more glycosylation sites. Thus one or more of the mutations set forth in Tables 3 9 above can be combined with any of the other mutations set forth in Tables 3 9 above. Thus included among the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein are those that exhibit increased glycosylation such as N glycosylation increased resistance to AT III AT III heparin and or heparin decreased hydroxylation sulfation and or phosphorylation and or increased catalytic activity compared with an unmodified FIX polypeptide.

Further any of the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein can contain any one or more additional modifications. In some examples the additional modifications result in altered properties and or activities compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide. Typically such additional modifications are those that themselves result in an increased coagulant activity of the modified polypeptide and or increased stability of the polypeptide. Accordingly the resulting modified FIX polypeptides typically exhibit increased coagulant activity.

The additional modifications can include for example any amino acid substitution deletion or insertion known in the art typically any that increases the coagulant activity and or stability of the FIX polypeptide. Any modified FIX polypeptide provided herein can contain 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 or more additional amino acid modifications. Typically the resulting modified FIX polypeptide retains at least one activity of the wild type or unmodified polypeptide such as for example catalytic activity or binding to the co factor FVIIIa.

Additional modifications in the primary sequence can be made to the FIX polypeptide to effect post translational modifications. For example the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein can contain non native glycosylation sites including and other than those described above such as any of those described in the art including non native O linked or S linked glycosylation sites described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 20080280818 or the non native glycosylation sites described in International Patent Publication Nos. WO20091300198 and WO2009137254.

In other examples the additional modification can be made to the FIX polypeptide sequence such that its interaction with other factors molecules and proteins is altered. For example the amino acid residues that are involved in the interaction with Factor X can be modified such that the affinity and or binding of the modified FIX polypeptide to FX is increased. Other modifications include but are not limited to modification of amino acids that are involved in interactions with FVIIIa heparin antithrombin III and phospholipids.

Additional modifications also can be made to a modified FIX polypeptide provided herein that alter the conformation or folding of the polypeptide. These include for example the replacement of one or more amino acids with a cysteine such that a new disulphide bond is formed or modifications that stabilize an helix conformation thereby imparting increased activity to the modified FIX polypeptide.

Modifications also can be made to introduce amino acid residues that can be subsequently linked to a moiety such as one that acts to increase stability of the modified FIX polypeptide. For example cysteine residues can be introduced to facilitate conjugation to a polymer such polyethylene glycol PEG International Pat. Pub. No. WO2009140015 . The stability of a FIX polypeptide also can be altered by modifying potential proteolytic sites such as removing potential proteolytic sites thereby increasing the resistance of the modified FIX polypeptide to proteases see e.g. US Pat. Pub. No. 20080102115 .

Additionally amino acids substitutions deletions or insertions can be made in the endogenous Gla domain such that the modified FIX polypeptide displays increased binding and or affinity for phospholipid membranes. Such modifications can include single amino acid substitution deletions and or insertions or can include amino acid substitution deletion or insertion of multiple amino acids. For example all or part of the endogenous Gla domain can be replaced with all or part of a heterologous Gla domain. In other examples the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein can display deletions in the endogenous Gla domain or substitutions in the positions that are normally gamma carboxylated. Alternatively amino acid substitutions can be made to introduce additional potential gamma carboxylation sites.

The following sections describe non limiting examples of exemplary modifications described in the art to effect increased stability and or coagulant activity of a FIX polypeptide. As discussed above such modifications also can be additionally included in any modified FIX polypeptide provided herein. The amino acid positions referenced below correspond to the mature FIX polypeptide as set forth in SEQ ID NO 3. Corresponding mutations can be made in other FIX polypeptides such as allelic species or splice variants of the mature FIX polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO 3.

In one example additional modifications can be made to a modified factor IX polypeptide provided herein that result in increased catalytic activity toward factor X. For example modifications can be made to the amino acids that are involved in the interaction with its cofactor FVIIIa such that the resulting modified FIX polypeptide has increased affinity for FVIIIa and thereby displays increased activity toward FX under conditions in which FVIIIa is not saturating. Modifications can also be made in FIX that increase the catalytic efficiency of FIXa polypeptides and or the FIXa FVIIIa complex compared to the activity of the unmodified FIXa polypeptide or FIXa FVIIIa complex for activation of the substrate FX.

Examples of additional modifications that can be included in the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein to increase the intrinsic activity of the modified FIX polypeptide include but are not limited to those described in Hopfner et al. 1997 16 6626 6635 Kolkman et al. 2000 39 7398 7405 Sichler et al. 2003 278 4121 4126 Begbie et al. 2005 94 6 1138 47 U.S. Pat. No. 6 531 298 and U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 20080167219 and 20080214461. Non limiting examples of exemplary amino acid modifications described in the art that can result in increased intrinsic activity of the modified FIX polypeptide include any one or more of V86A V86N V86D V86E V86Q V86G V86H V86I V86L V86M V86F V86S V86T V86W V86Y Y259F A261K K265T E277V E277A E277N E277D E277Q E277G E277H E277I E277L E277M E277F E277S E277T E277W E277Y R338A R338V R338I R338F R338W R338S R338T Y345F I383V E388G. For example a modified FIX polypeptide provided herein can contain the amino acid substitutions Y259F K265T Y259F K265T Y345F Y259F A261K K265T Y345F Y259F K265T Y345F I383V E388G or Y259F A261K K265T Y345F I383V E388G. In another example the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein can contain modifications that remove the activation peptide 155 177 see e.g. Begbie et al. 2005 94 6 1138 47 which can both increase activity and decrease clearance in vivo.

The modified FIX polypeptides provided herein also can contain one or more additional modifications to increase affinity for phospholipids. The coagulant activity of FIX can be enhanced by increasing the binding and or affinity of the polypeptide for phospholipids such as those expressed on the surface of activated platelets. This can be achieved for example by modifying the endogenous FIX Gla domain. Modification can be effected by amino acid substitution at one or more positions in the Gla domain of a FIX polypeptide that result in a modified FIX polypeptide with increased ability to bind phosphatidylserine and other negatively charged phospholipids. Examples of additional modifications to increase phospholipid binding and or affinity and that can be made to a modified FIX polypeptide provided herein include but are not limited to those described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 017 882. For example a modified FIX polypeptide provided herein can contain one or more modifications at amino acid positions 11 12 29 33 and or 34 corresponding to a mature FIX polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 . Exemplary of such modifications are amino acid substitutions K5I K5L K5F K5E Q11E Q11D R16E R29F and or N34E N34D N34F N34I N34L T35D and T35E.

In another aspect the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein also can contain one or more additional modifications to reduce affinity for collagen. The coagulant activity of FIX can be enhanced by reducing the binding and or affinity of the polypeptide for collagen IV which is present on the surface of the extracellular matrix on endothelial cells. A reduced binding to collagen IV can result in increased circulation of the modified FIX polypeptides and thus increased coagulant activity in vivo. This can be achieved for example by modifying the FIX Gla domain at amino acid residues 3 to 11 of a mature FIX polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 which are responsible for the interaction with collagen IV Cheung et al. 1992 267 20529 20531 Cheung et al. 1996 93 11068 11073 . Modification can be effected by amino acid substitution at one or more positions in the Gla domain of a FIX polypeptide that result in a modified FIX polypeptide with decreased ability to bind collagen IV. Examples of additional modifications to increase phospholipid binding and or affinity and that can be made to a modified FIX polypeptide provided herein include but are not limited to those described in Schuettrumpf et al. 2005 105 6 2316 23 Melton et al. 2001 12 4 237 43 and Cheung et al. 1996 93 11068 11073. For example a modified FIX polypeptide provided herein can contain are amino acid substitutions K5A and or V10K.

Additional modifications can be included that increase the activity of the FIX polypeptide by increasing the resistance of the modified FIX polypeptide to inhibitors such as for example inhibition by antithrombin III AT III heparin. Typically this can be achieved by modifying one or more residues that are involved in the interaction with AT III heparin or the AT III heparin complex. Exemplary of such modifications include those described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 7 125 841 U.S. Pat. Pub. No 20040110675 Int. Pat. Pub. No. WO2002040544 Chang J. et al. 1998 273 20 12089 94 Yang L. et al. 2002 277 52 50756 60 Yang L. et al. 2003 278 27 25032 8 Rohlena et al. 2003 278 11 9394 401 Sheehan et al. 2006 107 10 3876 82 Buyue et al. 2008 112 3234 3241. Non limiting examples of modifications that can be included to decrease inhibition by AT III and or heparin include but are not limited to modifications at amino acid positions corresponding to amino acid positions R252 H256 H257 K265 H268 K293 R318 R333 R338 K400 R403 K409 or K411 of a mature FIX polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO 3. For example the FIX polypeptides provided herein can contain the amino acid substitutions R252A H257A H268A K293A R318A R333A R338A K400A R403A R403E and or K411A.

Modifications in addition to those described above can be incorporated into the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein to alter the glycosylation of the modified FIX polypeptides compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide. For example the modified FIX polypeptides can contain one or more modifications that introduce one or more non native glycosylation sites into the modified FIX polypeptide. Thus when expressed in an appropriate system the modified FIX polypeptides can exhibit altered glycosylation patterns compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide. In some examples the modified FIX polypeptides exhibit increased glycosylation compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide such as increased N glycosylation or increased O glycosylation

Examples of additional modifications that can be included in the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein to alter the glycosylation profile of a FIX polypeptide include but are not limited to those described in International Published Application Nos. WO2009130198 WO2009051717 and WO2009137254.

Modified FIX polypeptides provided herein also can contain additional modifications that result in increased resistance of the polypeptide to proteases. For example amino acid substitutions can be made that remove one or more potential proteolytic cleavage sites. The modified FIX polypeptides can thus be made more resistant to proteases thereby increasing the stability and half life of the modified polypeptide.

Examples of additional modifications that can be included in the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein to increase resistance to proteases include but are not limited to those described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 20080102115 and International Published Application No. WO2007149406.

Further modifications to a modified FIX polypeptide provided herein can include modifications of at least one amino acid residue resulting in a substantial reduction in activity of or elimination of one or more T cell epitopes from the protein i.e. deimmunization of the polypeptide. One or more amino acid modifications at particular positions within any of the MHC class II ligands can result in a deimmunized FIX polypeptide with reduced immunogenicity when administered as a therapeutic to a subject such as for example a human subject. For example any one or more modifications disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication No. 20040254106 can be included in the modified FIX polypeptide provided herein to reduce immunogenicity.

Provided herein are modified FIX polypeptides that have two or more modifications designed to affect one or more properties or activities of an unmodified FIX polypeptide. In some examples the two or more modifications alter two or more properties or activities of the FIX polypeptide. The modifications can be made to the FIX polypeptides such that one or more of glycosylation resistance to AT III resistance to AT III heparin resistance to heparin catalytic activity binding to LRP intrinsic activity phospholipid binding and or affinity resistance to proteases half life and interaction with other factors or molecules such as FVIIIa and FX is altered. Typically the two or more modifications are combined such that the resulting modified FIX polypeptide has increased coagulant activity increased duration of coagulant activity and or an enhanced therapeutic index compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide. The modifications can include amino acid substitution insertion or deletion. The increased coagulant activity increased duration of coagulant activity and or an enhanced therapeutic index of the modified FIX polypeptide containing two or more modifications can be increased by at least or at least about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160 170 180 190 200 300 400 500 or more compared to the activity of the starting or unmodified FIXa polypeptide.

Provided herein are modified FIX polypeptides that contain two or more modifications that are introduced into an unmodified FIX polypeptide to alter one two or more activities or properties. The modified FIX polypeptides can contain 2 3 4 5 6 or more modifications.

The modified FIX polypeptides provided herein can be conjugated to a polymer such as dextran a polyethylene glycol pegylation PEG or sialyl moiety or other such polymers such as natural or sugar polymers. In one example the polypeptides are conjugated to dextrans such as described elsewhere Zambaux et al. 1998 J. Protein Chem. 17 3 279 84 . Various methods of modifying polypeptides by covalently attaching conjugating a PEG or PEG derivative i.e. PEGylation are known in the art see e.g. US20060104968 U.S. Pat. No. 5 672 662 U.S. Pat.

In some instances the modified FIX polypeptides include amino acid replacements to facilitate conjugation to another moiety. For example cysteine residues can be incorporated into the FIX polypeptide to facilitate conjugation to polymers.

FIX polypeptides including modified FIX polypeptides or domains thereof of FIX can be obtained by methods well known in the art for protein purification and recombinant protein expression. Any method known to those of skill in the art for identification of nucleic acids that encode desired genes can be used. Any method available in the art can be used to obtain a full length i.e. encompassing the entire coding region cDNA or genomic DNA clone encoding a FIX polypeptide or other vitamin K polypeptide such as from a cell or tissue source such as for example from liver. Modified FIX polypeptides can be engineered as described herein such as by site directed mutagenesis.

FIX can be cloned or isolated using any available methods known in the art for cloning and isolating nucleic acid molecules. Such methods include PCR amplification of nucleic acids and screening of libraries including nucleic acid hybridization screening antibody based screening and activity based screening.

Methods for amplification of nucleic acids can be used to isolate nucleic acid molecules encoding a FIX polypeptide including for example polymerase chain reaction PCR methods. A nucleic acid containing material can be used as a starting material from which a FIX encoding nucleic acid molecule can be isolated. For example DNA and mRNA preparations cell extracts tissue extracts e.g. from liver fluid samples e.g. blood serum saliva samples from healthy and or diseased subjects can be used in amplification methods. Nucleic acid libraries also can be used as a source of starting material. Primers can be designed to amplify a FIX encoding molecule. For example primers can be designed based on expressed sequences from which a FIX is generated. Primers can be designed based on back translation of a FIX amino acid sequence. Nucleic acid molecules generated by amplification can be sequenced and confirmed to encode a FIX polypeptide.

Additional nucleotide sequences can be joined to a FIX encoding nucleic acid molecule including linker sequences containing restriction endonuclease sites for the purpose of cloning the synthetic gene into a vector for example a protein expression vector or a vector designed for the amplification of the core protein coding DNA sequences. Furthermore additional nucleotide sequences specifying functional DNA elements can be operatively linked to a FIX encoding nucleic acid molecule. Examples of such sequences include but are not limited to promoter sequences designed to facilitate intracellular protein expression and secretion sequences designed to facilitate protein secretion. Additional nucleotide sequences such as sequences specifying protein binding regions also can be linked to FIX encoding nucleic acid molecules. Such regions include but are not limited to sequences to facilitate uptake of FIX into specific target cells or otherwise enhance the pharmacokinetics of the synthetic gene.

The identified and isolated nucleic acids can then be inserted into an appropriate cloning vector. A large number of vector host systems known in the art can be used. Possible vectors include but are not limited to plasmids or modified viruses but the vector system must be compatible with the host cell used. Such vectors include but are not limited to bacteriophages such as lambda derivatives or plasmids such as pBR322 or pUC plasmid derivatives or the Bluescript vector Stratagene La Jolla Calif. . The insertion into a cloning vector can for example be accomplished by ligating the DNA fragment into a cloning vector which has complementary cohesive termini. Insertion can be effected using TOPO cloning vectors Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. . If the complementary restriction sites used to fragment the DNA are not present in the cloning vector the ends of the DNA molecules can be enzymatically modified. Alternatively any site desired can be produced by ligating nucleotide sequences linkers onto the DNA termini these ligated linkers can contain specific chemically synthesized oligonucleotides encoding restriction endonuclease recognition sequences. In an alternative method the cleaved vector and FIX protein gene can be modified by homopolymeric tailing. Recombinant molecules can be introduced into host cells via for example transformation transfection infection electroporation and sonoporation so that many copies of the gene sequence are generated.

In specific embodiments transformation of host cells with recombinant DNA molecules that incorporate the isolated FIX protein gene cDNA or synthesized DNA sequence enables generation of multiple copies of the gene. Thus the gene can be obtained in large quantities by growing transformants isolating the recombinant DNA molecules from the transformants and when necessary retrieving the inserted gene from the isolated recombinant DNA.

For recombinant expression of one or more of the FIX proteins the nucleic acid containing all or a portion of the nucleotide sequence encoding the FIX protein can be inserted into an appropriate expression vector i.e. a vector that contains the necessary elements for the transcription and translation of the inserted protein coding sequence. Exemplary of such a vector is any mammalian expression vector such as for example pCMV. The necessary transcriptional and translational signals also can be supplied by the native promoter for a FIX genes and or their flanking regions.

Also provided are vectors that contain nucleic acid encoding the FIX or modified FIX. Cells containing the vectors also are provided. The cells include eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells and the vectors are any suitable for use therein.

Prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells including endothelial cells containing the vectors are provided. Such cells include bacterial cells yeast cells fungal cells Archea plant cells insect cells and animal cells. The cells are used to produce a FIX polypeptide or modified FIX polypeptide thereof by growing the above described cells under conditions whereby the encoded FIX protein is expressed by the cell and recovering the expressed FIX protein. For purposes herein the FIX can be secreted into the medium.

In one embodiment vectors containing a sequence of nucleotides that encodes a polypeptide that has FIX activity and contains all or a portion of the FIX polypeptide or multiple copies thereof are provided. The vectors can be selected for expression of the FIX polypeptide or modified FIX polypeptide thereof in the cell or such that the FIX protein is expressed as a secreted protein. When the FIX is expressed the nucleic acid is linked to nucleic acid encoding a secretion signal such as the mating factor signal sequence or a portion thereof or the native signal sequence.

A variety of host vector systems can be used to express the protein coding sequence. These include but are not limited to mammalian cell systems infected with virus e.g. vaccinia virus adenovirus and other viruses insect cell systems infected with virus e.g. baculovirus microorganisms such as yeast containing yeast vectors or bacteria transformed with bacteriophage DNA plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA. The expression elements of vectors vary in their strengths and specificities. Depending on the host vector system used any one of a number of suitable transcription and translation elements can be used.

Any methods known to those of skill in the art for the insertion of DNA fragments into a vector can be used to construct expression vectors containing a chimeric gene containing appropriate transcriptional translational control signals and protein coding sequences. These methods can include in vitro recombinant DNA and synthetic techniques and in vivo recombinants genetic recombination . Expression of nucleic acid sequences encoding a FIX polypeptide or modified FIX polypeptide or domains derivatives fragments or homologs thereof can be regulated by a second nucleic acid sequence so that the genes or fragments thereof are expressed in a host transformed with the recombinant DNA molecule s . For example expression of the proteins can be controlled by any promoter enhancer known in the art. In a specific embodiment the promoter is not native to the genes for a FIX protein. Promoters which can be used include but are not limited to the SV40 early promoter Bernoist and Chambon 290 304 310 1981 the promoter contained in the 3 long terminal repeat of Rous sarcoma virus Yamamoto et al. 22 787 797 1980 the herpes thymidine kinase promoter Wagner et al. 78 1441 1445 1981 the regulatory sequences of the metallothionein gene Brinster et al. 296 39 42 1982 prokaryotic expression vectors such as the lactamase promoter Jay et al. 1981 78 5543 or the tac promoter DeBoer et al. 80 21 25 1983 see also Useful Proteins from Recombinant Bacteria in Scientific American 242 79 94 1980 plant expression vectors containing the nopaline synthetase promoter Herrara Estrella et al. 303 209 213 1984 or the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S RNA promoter Garder et al. 9 2871 1981 and the promoter of the photosynthetic enzyme ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase Herrera Estrella et al. 310 115 120 1984 promoter elements from yeast and other fungi such as the Gal4 promoter the alcohol dehydrogenase promoter the phosphoglycerol kinase promoter the alkaline phosphatase promoter and the following animal transcriptional control regions that exhibit tissue specificity and have been used in transgenic animals elastase I gene control region which is active in pancreatic acinar cells Swift et al. 38 639 646 1984 Ornitz et al. 50 399 409 1986 MacDonald 7 425 515 1987 insulin gene control region which is active in pancreatic beta cells Hanahan et al. 315 115 122 1985 immunoglobulin gene control region which is active in lymphoid cells Grosschedl et al. 38 647 658 1984 Adams et al. 318 533 538 1985 Alexander et al. 7 1436 1444 1987 mouse mammary tumor virus control region which is active in testicular breast lymphoid and mast cells Leder et al. 45 485 495 1986 albumin gene control region which is active in liver Pinckert et al. 1 268 276 1987 alpha fetoprotein gene control region which is active in liver Krumlauf et al. 5 1639 1648 1985 Hammer et al. 235 53 58 1987 alpha 1 antitrypsin gene control region which is active in liver Kelsey et al. 1 161 171 1987 beta globin gene control region which is active in myeloid cells Magram et al. 315 338 340 1985 Kollias et al. 46 89 94 1986 myelin basic protein gene control region which is active in oligodendrocyte cells of the brain Readhead et al. 48 703 712 1987 myosin light chain 2 gene control region which is active in skeletal muscle Shani 314 283 286 1985 and gonadotrophic releasing hormone gene control region which is active in gonadotrophs of the hypothalamus Mason et al. 234 1372 1378 1986 .

In a specific embodiment a vector is used that contains a promoter operably linked to nucleic acids encoding a FIX polypeptide or modified FIX polypeptide or a domain fragment derivative or homolog thereof one or more origins of replication and optionally one or more selectable markers e.g. an antibiotic resistance gene . Vectors and systems for expression of FIX polypeptides include the well known vectors available for example from Invitrogen San Diego Calif. particularly those designed for secretion of the encoded proteins. Exemplary plasmid vectors for expression in mammalian cells include for example pCMV. Exemplary plasmid vectors for transformation of cells include for example the pQE expression vectors available from Qiagen Valencia Calif. see also literature published by Qiagen describing the system . pQE vectors have a phage T5 promoter recognized by RNA polymerase and a double lac operator repression module to provide tightly regulated high level expression of recombinant proteins in a synthetic ribosomal binding site RBS II for efficient translation a 6 His tag coding sequence tand T1 transcriptional terminators ColE1 origin of replication and a beta lactamase gene for conferring ampicillin resistance. The pQE vectors enable placement of a 6 His tag at either the N or C terminus of the recombinant protein. Such plasmids include pQE 32 pQE 30 and pQE 31 which provide multiple cloning sites for all three reading frames and provide for the expression of N terminally 6 His tagged proteins. Other exemplary plasmid vectors for transformation of cells include for example the pET expression vectors see U.S. Pat. No. 4 952 496 available from NOVAGEN Madison Wis. see also literature published by Novagen describing the system . Such plasmids include pET 11a which contains the T7lac promoter T7 terminator the inducible lac operator and the lac repressor gene pET 12a c which contains the T7 promoter T7 terminator and the ompT secretion signal and pET 15b and pET19b NOVAGEN Madison Wis. which contain a His Tag leader sequence for use in purification with a His column and a thrombin cleavage site that permits cleavage following purification over the column the T7 lac promoter region and the T7 terminator.

FIX polypeptides modified and unmodified can be produced by any methods known in the art for protein production including in vitro and in vivo methods such as for example the introduction of nucleic acid molecules encoding FIX into a host cell host animal and expression from nucleic acid molecules encoding FIX in vitro. FIX and modified FIX polypeptides can be expressed in any organism suitable to produce the required amounts and forms of a FIX polypeptide needed for administration and treatment. Expression hosts include prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms such as yeast plants insect cells mammalian cells including human cell lines and transgenic animals. Expression hosts can differ in their protein production levels as well as the types of post translational modifications that are present on the expressed proteins. The choice of expression host can be made based on these and other factors such as regulatory and safety considerations production costs and the need and methods for purification.

Expression in eukaryotic hosts can include expression in yeasts such as and insect cells such as cells and lepidopteran cells plants and plant cells such as tobacco corn rice algae and lemna. Eukaryotic cells for expression also include mammalian cells lines such as Chinese hamster ovary CHO cells or baby hamster kidney BHK cells. Eukaryotic expression hosts also include production in transgenic animals for example including production in serum milk and eggs. Transgenic animals for the production of wild type FIX polypeptides are known in the art U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2002 0166130 and 2004 0133930 and can be adapted for production of modified FIX polypeptides provided herein.

Many expression vectors are available and known to those of skill in the art for the expression of FIX. The choice of expression vector is influenced by the choice of host expression system. Such selection is well within the level of skill of the skilled artisan. In general expression vectors can include transcriptional promoters and optionally enhancers translational signals and transcriptional and translational termination signals. Expression vectors that are used for stable transformation typically have a selectable marker which allows selection and maintenance of the transformed cells. In some cases an origin of replication can be used to amplify the copy number of the vectors in the cells.

FIX or modified FIX polypeptides also can be utilized or expressed as protein fusions. For example a fusion can be generated to add additional functionality to a polypeptide. Examples of fusion proteins include but are not limited to fusions of a signal sequence a tag such as for localization e.g. a histag or a myc tag or a tag for purification for example a GST fusion and a sequence for directing protein secretion and or membrane association.

In one embodiment the FIX polypeptide or modified FIX polypeptides can be expressed in an active form whereby activation is achieved by incubation of the polypeptide activated factor XI FXIa following secretion. In another embodiment the protease is expressed in an inactive zymogen form.

Methods of production of FIX polypeptides can include coexpression of one or more additional heterologous polypeptides that can aid in the generation of the FIX polypeptides. For example such polypeptides can contribute to the post translation processing of the FIX polypeptides. Exemplary polypeptides include but are not limited to peptidases that help cleave FIX precursor sequences such as the propeptide sequence and enzymes that participate in the modification of the FIX polypeptide such as by glycosylation hydroxylation carboxylation or phosphorylation for example. An exemplary peptidase that can be coexpressed with FIX is PACE furin or PACE SOL which aids in the cleavage of the FIX propeptide sequence. An exemplary protein that aids in the carboxylation of the FIX polypeptide is the warfarin sensitive enzyme vitamin K 2 3 epoxide reductase VKOR which produces reduced vitamin K for utilization as a cofactor by the vitamin K dependent carboxylase Wajih et al. 280 36 31603 31607 . A subunit of this enzyme VKORC1 can be coexpressed with the modified FIX polypeptide to increase the carboxylation The one or more additional polypeptides can be expressed from the same expression vector as the FIX polypeptide or from a different vector.

Prokaryotes especially provide a system for producing large amounts of FIX see for example Platis et al. 2003 Protein Exp. Purif. 31 2 222 30 and Khalilzadeh et al. 2004 J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 31 2 63 69 . Transformation of is a simple and rapid technique well known to those of skill in the art. Expression vectors for can contain inducible promoters that are useful for inducing high levels of protein expression and for expressing proteins that exhibit some toxicity to the host cells. Examples of inducible promoters include the lac promoter the trp promoter the hybrid tac promoter the T7 and SP6 RNA promoters and the temperature regulated Ppromoter.

FIX can be expressed in the cytoplasmic environment of . The cytoplasm is a reducing environment and for some molecules this can result in the formation of insoluble inclusion bodies. Reducing agents such as dithiothreitol and mercaptoethanol and denaturants e.g. such as guanidine HCl and urea can be used to resolubilize the proteins. An alternative approach is the expression of FIX in the periplasmic space of bacteria which provides an oxidizing environment and chaperonin like and disulfide isomerases leading to the production of soluble protein. Typically a leader sequence is fused to the protein to be expressed which directs the protein to the periplasm. The leader is then removed by signal peptidases inside the periplasm. Examples of periplasmic targeting leader sequences include the pelB leader from the pectate lyase gene and the leader derived from the alkaline phosphatase gene. In some cases periplasmic expression allows leakage of the expressed protein into the culture medium. The secretion of proteins allows quick and simple purification from the culture supernatant. Proteins that are not secreted can be obtained from the periplasm by osmotic lysis. Similar to cytoplasmic expression in some cases proteins can become insoluble and denaturants and reducing agents can be used to facilitate solubilization and refolding. Temperature of induction and growth also can influence expression levels and solubility. Typically temperatures between 25 C. and 37 C. are used. Mutations also can be used to increase solubility of expressed proteins. Typically bacteria produce aglycosylated proteins. Thus for the production of the hyperglycosylated FIX polypeptides provided herein glycosylation can be added in vitro after purification from host cells.

Yeasts such as and are useful expression hosts for FIX see for example Skoko et al. 2003 Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 38 Pt3 257 65 . Yeast can be transformed with episomal replicating vectors or by stable chromosomal integration by homologous recombination. Typically inducible promoters are used to regulate gene expression. Examples of such promoters include GAL1 GAL7 and GAL5 and metallothionein promoters such as CUP1. Expression vectors often include a selectable marker such as LEU2 TRP1 HIS3 and URA3 for selection and maintenance of the transformed DNA. Proteins expressed in yeast are often soluble and co expression with chaperonins such as Bip and protein disulfide isomerase can improve expression levels and solubility. Additionally proteins expressed in yeast can be directed for secretion using secretion signal peptide fusions such as the yeast mating type alpha factor secretion signal from and fusions with yeast cell surface proteins such as the Aga2p mating adhesion receptor or the glucoamylase. A protease cleavage site e.g. the Kex 2 protease can be engineered to remove the fused sequences from the polypeptides as they exit the secretion pathway. Yeast also is capable of glycosylation at Asn X Ser Thr motifs.

Insects and insect cells particularly using a baculovirus expression system are useful for expressing polypeptides such as FIX or modified forms thereof see for example Muneta et al. 2003 J. Vet. Med. Sci. 65 2 219 23 . Insect cells and insect larvae including expression in the haemolymph express high levels of protein and are capable of most of the post translational modifications used by higher eukaryotes. Baculoviruses have a restrictive host range which improves the safety and reduces regulatory concerns of eukaryotic expression. Typically expression vectors use a promoter such as the polyhedrin promoter of baculovirus for high level expression. Commonly used baculovirus systems include baculoviruses such as nuclear polyhedrosis virus AcNPV and the nuclear polyhedrosis virus BmNPV and an insect cell line such as Sf9 derived from A7S and DpN1 . For high level expression the nucleotide sequence of the molecule to be expressed is fused immediately downstream of the polyhedrin initiation codon of the virus. Mammalian secretion signals are accurately processed in insect cells and can be used to secrete the expressed protein into the culture medium. In addition the cell lines A7S and DpN1 produce proteins with glycosylation patterns similar to mammalian cell systems.

An alternative expression system in insect cells is the use of stably transformed cells. Cell lines such as the Schnieder 2 S2 and Kc cells and C7 cells can be used for expression. The metallothionein promoter can be used to induce high levels of expression in the presence of heavy metal induction with cadmium or copper. Expression vectors are typically maintained by the use of selectable markers such as neomycin and hygromycin.

Mammalian expression systems can be used to express FIX polypeptides. Expression constructs can be transferred to mammalian cells by viral infection such as adenovirus or by direct DNA transfer such as liposomes calcium phosphate DEAE dextran and by physical means such as electroporation and microinjection. Expression vectors for mammalian cells typically include an mRNA cap site a TATA box a translational initiation sequence Kozak consensus sequence and polyadenylation elements. Such vectors often include transcriptional promoter enhancers for high level expression for example the SV40 promoter enhancer the human cytomegalovirus CMV promoter and the long terminal repeat of Rous sarcoma virus RSV . These promoter enhancers are active in many cell types. Tissue and cell type promoters and enhancer regions also can be used for expression. Exemplary promoter enhancer regions include but are not limited to those from genes such as elastase I insulin immunoglobulin mouse mammary tumor virus albumin alpha fetoprotein alpha 1 antitrypsin beta globin myelin basic protein myosin light chain 2 and gonadotropic releasing hormone gene control. Selectable markers can be used to select for and maintain cells with the expression construct. Examples of selectable marker genes include but are not limited to hygromycin B phosphotransferase adenosine deaminase xanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase aminoglycoside phosphotransferase dihydrofolate reductase and thymidine kinase. Fusion with cell surface signaling molecules such as TCR and FcRI can direct expression of the proteins in an active state on the cell surface.

Many cell lines are available for mammalian expression including mouse rat human monkey and chicken and hamster cells. Exemplary cell lines include but are not limited to BHK i.e. BHK 21 cells 293 F CHO CHO Express CHOX Excellgene Balb 3T3 HeLa MT2 mouse NS0 non secreting and other myeloma cell lines hybridoma and heterohybridoma cell lines lymphocytes fibroblasts Sp2 0 COS NIH3T3 HEK293 293S 293T 2B8 and HKB cells. Cell lines also are available adapted to serum free media which facilitates purification of secreted proteins from the cell culture media. One such example is the serum free EBNA 1 cell line Pham et al. 2003 84 332 42 . Expression of recombinant FIX polypeptides exhibiting similar structure and post translational modifications as plasma derived FIX are known in the art. Methods of optimizing vitamin K dependent protein expression are known. For example supplementation of vitamin K in culture medium or co expression of vitamin K dependent carboxylases Wajih et al. 280 36 31603 31607 can aid in post translational modification of vitamin K dependent proteins such as FIX polypeptides.

Transgenic plant cells and plants can be used for the expression of FIX. Expression constructs are typically transferred to plants using direct DNA transfer such as microprojectile bombardment and PEG mediated transfer into protoplasts and with agrobacterium mediated transformation. Expression vectors can include promoter and enhancer sequences transcriptional termination elements and translational control elements. Expression vectors and transformation techniques are usually divided between dicot hosts such as and tobacco and monocot hosts such as corn and rice. Examples of plant promoters used for expression include the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter the nopaline synthase promoter the ribose bisphosphate carboxylase promoter and the ubiquitin and UBQ3 promoters. Selectable markers such as hygromycin phosphomannose isomerase and neomycin phosphotransferase are often used to facilitate selection and maintenance of transformed cells. Transformed plant cells can be maintained in culture as cells aggregates callus tissue or regenerated into whole plants. Because plants have different glycosylation patterns than mammalian cells this can influence the choice to produce FIX in these hosts. Transgenic plant cells also can include algae engineered to produce proteins see for example Mayfield et al. 2003 100 438 442 . Because plants have different glycosylation patterns than mammalian cells this can influence the choice to produce FIX in these hosts.

Methods for purification of FIX polypeptides from host cells depend on the chosen host cells and expression systems. For secreted molecules proteins are generally purified from the culture media after removing the cells. For intracellular expression cells can be lysed and the proteins purified from the extract. When transgenic organisms such as transgenic plants and animals are used for expression tissues or organs can be used as starting material to make a lysed cell extract. Additionally transgenic animal production can include the production of polypeptides in milk or eggs which can be collected and if necessary further the proteins can be extracted and further purified using standard methods in the art.

FIX can be purified using standard protein purification techniques known in the art including but not limited to SDS PAGE size fraction and size exclusion chromatography ammonium sulfate precipitation chelate chromatography and ionic exchange chromatography. For example FIX polypeptides can be purified by anion exchange chromatography such as described in Example 1 below. Exemplary of a method to purify FIX polypeptides is by using an ion exchange column that permits binding of any polypeptide that has a functional Gla domain followed by elution in the presence of calcium. Affinity purification techniques also can be used to improve the efficiency and purity of the preparations. For example antibodies receptors and other molecules that bind FIX can be used in affinity purification. Expression constructs also can be engineered to add an affinity tag such as a myc epitope GST fusion or Hisand affinity purified with myc antibody glutathione resin and Ni resin respectively to a protein. Purity can be assessed by any method known in the art including gel electrophoresis and staining and spectrophotometric techniques.

The FIX polypeptide can be expressed and purified to be in an inactive form zymogen form or alternatively the expressed protease can be purified into an active form such as by autocatalysis. For example FIX polypeptides that have been activated via proteolytic cleavage after R145 and R180 can be prepared in vitro i.e. FIXa two chain form . The FIX polypeptides can be first prepared by any of the methods of production described herein including but not limited to production in mammalian cells followed by purification. Cleavage of the FIX polypeptides into the active protease form FIXa can be accomplished by incubation with factor XIa. In some examples this is performed in the presence of calcium and phospholipids.

Fusion proteins containing a modified FIX polypeptide and one or more other polypeptides also are provided. Pharmaceutical compositions containing such fusion proteins formulated for administration by a suitable route are provided. Fusion proteins are formed by linking in any order the modified FIX polypeptide and an agent such as an antibody or fragment thereof growth factor receptor ligand and other such agent for the purposes of facilitating the purification of a FIX polypeptide altering the pharmacodynamic properties of a FIX polypeptide by directing for example by directing the polypeptide to a targeted cell or tissue and or increasing the expression or secretion of the FIX polypeptide. Typically any FIX fusion protein retains at least about 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 or 95 coagulant activity compared with a non fusion FIX polypeptide including 96 97 98 99 or greater coagulant activity compared with a non fusion polypeptide.

Linkage of a FIX polypeptide with another polypeptide can be effected directly or indirectly via a linker. In one example linkage can be by chemical linkage such as via heterobifunctional agents or thiol linkages or other such linkages. Fusion also can be effected by recombinant means. Fusion of a FIX polypeptide to another polypeptide can be to the N or C terminus of the FIX polypeptide. Non limiting examples of polypeptides that can be used in fusion proteins with a FIX polypeptide provided herein include for example a GST glutathione S transferase polypeptide Fc domain from immunoglobulin G albumin or a heterologous signal sequence. The fusion proteins can contain additional components such as maltose binding protein MBP that aid in uptake of the protein by cells see International PCT application No. WO 01 32711 .

A fusion protein can be produced by standard recombinant techniques. For example DNA fragments coding for the different polypeptide sequences can be ligated together in frame in accordance with conventional techniques e.g. by employing blunt ended or stagger ended termini for ligation restriction enzyme digestion to provide for appropriate termini filling in of cohesive ends as appropriate alkaline phosphatase treatment to avoid undesirable joining and enzymatic ligation. In another embodiment the fusion gene can be synthesized by conventional techniques including automated DNA synthesizers. Alternatively PCR amplification of gene fragments can be carried out using anchor primers that give rise to complementary overhangs between two consecutive gene fragments that can subsequently be annealed and reamplified to generate a chimeric gene sequence see e.g. Ausubel et al. eds. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology John Wiley Sons 1992 . Moreover many expression vectors are commercially available that already encode a fusion moiety e.g. a GST polypeptide . A FIX encoding nucleic acid can be cloned into such an expression vector such that the fusion moiety is linked in frame to the protease protein.

Modified FIX polypeptides can be prepared as unmodified or naked polypeptide chains or as posttranslationally modified polypeptides. For some applications it can be desirable to prepare modified FIX in a naked form without post translational or other chemical modifications. Naked polypeptide chains can be prepared in suitable hosts that do not post translationally modify FIX. Such polypeptides also can be prepared in in vitro systems and using chemical polypeptide synthesis. For other applications particular modifications can be desired. In particular for the purposes herein glycosylation of the modified FIX polypeptides to produce hyperglycosylated FIX polypeptides is preferred. Such glycosylation can be performed in vivo using an appropriate expression system such as a mammalian expression system in vitro see e.g. Mikami et al. 2006 J. Biotechnol. 127 65 78 or a combination of in vivo and in vitro methods in which for example the FIX polypeptide is expressed in prokaryotic cells and further modified in vitro using enzymatic transglycosylation see e.g. Schwarz et al. 2010 Nature Chem. Biol. 6 264 266 . Additionally pegylation albumination carboxylation hydroxylation phosphorylation or other known modifications can be desired. Modifications can be made in vitro or for example by producing the modified FIX in a suitable host that produces such modifications.

Nucleic acid molecules encoding FIX or modified FIX polypeptides are provided herein. Nucleic acid molecules include allelic variants or splice variants of any encoded FIX polypeptide. Exemplary of nucleic acid molecules provided herein are any that encode a modified FIX polypeptide provided herein such as any encoding a polypeptide set forth in any of SEQ ID NOS 75 272. In one embodiment nucleic acid molecules provided herein have at least 50 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 91 92 93 94 95 or 99 sequence identity or hybridize under conditions of medium or high stringency along at least 70 of the full length of any nucleic acid encoding a FIX polypeptide provided herein. For example the nucleic acid molecules provided herein have at least or at least about 50 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 91 92 93 94 95 or 99 sequence identity to the nucleic acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO 1. In another embodiment a nucleic acid molecule can include those with degenerate codon sequences encoding any of the FIX polypeptides provided herein.

The activities and properties of FIX polypeptides can be assessed in vitro and or in vivo. Assays for such assessment are known to those of skill in the art and are known to correlate tested activities and results to therapeutic and in vivo activities. In one example FIX variants can be assessed in comparison to unmodified and or wild type FIX. Such assays can be performed in the presence or absence of FVIIIa phospholipids and or calcium. In vitro assays include any laboratory assay known to one of skill in the art such as for example cell based assays including coagulation assays binding assays protein assays and molecular biology assays. In vivo assays include FIX assays in animal models as well as administration to humans. In some cases activity of FIX polypeptides in vivo can be determined by assessing blood serum or other bodily fluid for assay determinants FIX variants such as those provided herein also can be tested in vivo to assess an activity or property such as therapeutic effect.

Typically assays described herein are with respect to the two chain activated form of FIX i.e. FIXa. FIX polypeptides that have been activated via proteolytic cleavage after R145 and R180 can be prepared in vitro. The FIX polypeptides can be first prepared by any of the methods of production described herein including but not limited to production in mammalian cells followed by purification. Cleavage of the FIX polypeptides into the active protease form of FIX can be accomplished by incubation with activated factor XI FXIa . The activated polypeptides can be used in any of the assays to measure FIX activities described herein. Such assays also can be performed with the single chain zymogen form. For example a single chain zymogen FIX polypeptide can provide a negative control since such a form typically does not exhibit the proteolytic or catalytic activity required for the coagulant activity of FIX. In addition such assays also can be performed in the presence of cofactors such as FVIIIa and other molecules such as phospholipids and or calcium which in can augment the activity of FIX.

Exemplary in vitro assays include assays to assess polypeptide modification and activity. Modifications can be assessed using in vitro assays that assess glycosylation carboxylation and other post translational modifications protein assays and conformational assays known in the art. Assays for activity include but are not limited to measurement of FIX interaction with other coagulation factors such as FVIIIa and factor X proteolytic assays to determine the proteolytic activity of FIX polypeptides assays to determine the binding and or affinity of FIX polypeptides for phosphatidylserines and other phospholipids and cell based assays to determine the effect of FIX polypeptides on coagulation.

Concentrations of modified FIX polypeptides can be assessed by methods well known in the art including but not limited to enzyme linked immunosorbant assays ELISA SDS PAGE Bradford Lowry BCA methods UV absorbance and other quantifiable protein labeling methods such as but not limited to immunological radioactive and fluorescent methods and related methods. Assessment of cleavage products of proteolysis reactions including cleavage of FIX polypeptides or products produced by FIX protease activity can be performed using methods including but not limited to chromogenic substrate cleavage HPLC SDS PAGE analysis ELISA Western blotting immunohistochemistry immunoprecipitation NH terminal sequencing fluorescence and protein labeling.

Structural properties of modified FIX polypeptides can also be assessed. For example X ray crystallography nuclear magnetic resonance NMR and cryoelectron microscopy cryo EM of modified FIX polypeptides can be performed to assess three dimensional structure of the FIX polypeptides and or other properties of FIX polypeptides such as Ca or cofactor binding.

Additionally the presence and extent of FIX degradation can be measured by standard techniques such as sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis SDS PAGE and Western blotting of electrophoresed FIX containing samples. FIX polypeptides that have been exposed to proteases also can be subjected to N terminal sequencing to determine location or changes in cleavage sites of the modified FIX polypeptides.

FIX polypeptides can be assessed for the presence of glycosylation using methods well known in the art. Glycosylation of a polypeptide can been characterized from its enzymatically or chemically released carbohydrate pool using a wide variety of methods such as high pH anion exchange chromatography Townsend et al. 1991 Glycobiology 1 139 147 or fluorophore assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis FACE Kumar et al. 1996 Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 24 207 214. sequential exoglycosidase digestions Watzlawick et al. 1992 Biochemistry 31 12198 12203 Tyagarajan et al. 1996 Glycobiology 6 83 93 mass spectrometry Gillece Castro et al. 1990 Meth. Enzymol. 193 689 712 Duffin et al. 1992 Anal. Chem. 64 1440 1448 Papac et al. 1997 in Techniques in Glycobiology Townsend R. R. and Hotchkiss A. T. eds. Marcel Decker Inc. New York pp. 33 52 Fu et al. 1994 Carbohydr. Res. 261 173 186 and NMR Fu et al. 1994 Carbohydr. Res. 261 173 186 .

For example chemical release can be effected by hydrazinolysis which releases N and O linked glycans from glycoproteins by incubation with anhydrous hydrazine. Enzymatic release can be effected by the endoglycosidases peptide N glycosidase F PNGase F which removes unaltered most of the common N linked carbohydrates from the polypeptide while hydrolyzing the originally glycosylated Asn residue to Asp. Hydrazinolysis or endoglycosidase treatment of FIX polypeptides generates a reducing terminus that can be tagged with a fluorophore or chromophore label. Labeled FIX polypeptides can be analyzed by fluorophore assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis FACE . The fluorescent tag for glycans also can be used for monosaccharide analysis profiling or fingerprinting of complex glycosylation patterns by HPLC. Exemplary HPLC methods include hydrophilic interaction chromatography electronic interaction ion exchange hydrophobic interaction and size exclusion chromatography. Exemplary glycan probes include but are not limited to 3 acetylamino 6 aminoacridine AA Ac and 2 aminobenzoic acid 2 AA . Carbohydrate moieties can also be detected through use of specific antibodies that recognize the glycosylated FIX polypeptide.

In one method mass spectrometry is used to assess site specific carbohydrate heterogeneity. This can involve matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry of collected HPLC fractions Sutton et al. 1994 Anal. Biochem. 218 34 46 Ploug et al. 1998 J. Biol. Chem. 273 13933 13943 or reversed phase HPLC directly coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry LC ESIMS see e.g. Huddleston et al. 1993 Anal. Chem. 65 877 884 Medzihradsky et al. 2008 Methods Mol. Biol. 446 293 316 . In one example glycosylation at potential N glycosylation sites such as an asparagine residue within an Asn X Ser Thr Cys motif is assessed by LC ESIMS. The potential N glycosylation sites in a FIX polypeptide can be identified and a proteolytic enzyme can be selected that would separate these sites on individual peptides. The digestion mixture is then analyzed by LC ESIMS a method that generates diagnostic carbohydrate ions by collisional activation 33 . These diagnostic carbohydrate ions include for example characteristic nonreducing end oxonium ions at m z 204 274 and 292 366 and 657 which indicate the presence of N acetylhexosamine neuraminic sialic acid hexosyl N acetylhexosamine and sialyl hexosyl Nacetylhexosamine respectively. In addition to identifying the presence of these ions by selective ion monitoring SIM the LC ESIMS method also analyzes the peptide to assess the molecular weight which can be used to indicate which peptide and therefore which potential N glycosylation site contains the carbohydrate.

FIX polypeptides can be assessed for the presence of post translational modifications other than glycosylation. Such assays are known in the art and include assays to measure hydroxylation sulfation phosphorylation and carboxylation. An exemplary assay to measure hydroxylation comprises reverse phase HPLC analysis of FIX polypeptides that have been subjected to alkaline hydrolysis Przysiecki et al. 1987 PNAS 84 7856 7860 . Carboxylation and carboxylation of FIX polypeptides can be assessed using mass spectrometry with matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight MALDI TOF analysis as described for other vitamin K dependent polypeptides see e.g. Harvey et al. J Biol Chem 278 8363 8369 Maun et al. Prot Sci 14 1171 1180 . The interaction of a FIX polypeptide containing the propeptide pro FIX with the carboxylase responsible for post translational carboxylate modification also can be assessed. The dissociation constant K following incubation of carboxylase with flourescein labeled pro FIX polypeptides can be measured by determining the amount of bound carboxylase by anisotropy Lin et al. 2004 J Biol Chem 279 6560 6566 . Other exemplary assays to measure carboxylation include reverse phase HPLC analysis of FIX polypeptides that have been subjected to alkaline hydrolysis Przysiecki et al. 1987 PNAS 84 7856 7860 .

Exemplary assays to measure phosphorylation include use of phosphospecific antibodies to phospho serine and or tyrosine amino acid residues or to a serine phosphorylated FIX polypeptide. P metabolic labeling of cells that produce the FIX polypeptide also can be used to assess phosphorylation wherein the labeled FIX polypeptide can be purified and analyzed for incorporation of radioactive phosphate. An exemplary assay for tyrosine sulfation includes S labeling of cells that produce the FIX polypeptide. In such method cells are incubated with either S SSOor S methionine and incorporation of the S is determined by normalization to the S methionine sample.

Modified FIX polypeptides can be tested for proteolytic activity towards both synthetic substrates and it s natural substrate Factor X. Activated forms of the modified FIX polypeptides FIXa typically are used in the assay. Assays using a synthetic substrate such as a CHSO LGR pNA peptide can be employed to measure enzymatic cleavage activity of the FIXa polypeptides. Hydrolysis of CHSO LGR pNA in the presence of FIXa can be measured by assessing the production of p nitroanaline pNA from the cleavage reaction sample. The amount of pNA in the sample is proportional to the absorbance of the sample at 405 nm and thus indicates the extent of proteolytic activity in the FIXa sample. Additional exemplary fluorogenic substrates that can be used to assess FIXa cleavage activity include but are not limited to Mes CHD Gly Arg AMC Pefafluor FIXa10148 and H Leu PHG Arg AMC Pefafluor FIXa3688 wherein cleavage is assessed by release of AMC and the fluorogenic ester substrate 4 methylumbelliferyl p guanidinobenzoate MUGB where cleavage is assessed by the release of 4 methylumbelliferone fluorophore 4 MU see e.g. Example 3 . Molecules that enhance FIXa catalytic activity such as ethylene glycol can be employed in such assays Sturzebecher et al. 1997 FEBS Lett. 412 295 300 .

Proteolytic activity of FIXa also can be assessed by measuring the conversion of factor X FX into activated factor X FXa such as described in Example 4 below. FIXa polypeptides including the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein can be incubated with FX polypeptides in the presence of FVIIIa phospholipids vesicles phosphatidylserine and or phosphatidylcholine and Ca and cleavage of FX to produce FXa can be assayed using a fluorogenic substrate such as Spectrafluor FXa CHSO D CHA Gly Arg AMC or a chromogenic substrate such as S2222 or S2765 Chromogenics AB Molndal Sweden which are specifically cleaved by FXa.

FIX polypeptides can be tested for coagulation activity by using assays well known in the art. For example some of the assays include but are not limited to a two stage clotting assay Liebman et al. 1985 PNAS 82 3879 3883 the prothrombin time assay PT which can measure TF dependent activity of FIXa in the extrinsic pathway assays which are modifications of the PT test the activated partial thromboplastin time aPTT which can measure TF independent activity of FIXa activated clotting time ACT recalcified activated clotting time the Lee White Clotting time or thromboelastography TEG Pusateri et al. 2005 Critical Care 9 S15 S24 . For example coagulation activity of a modified FIX polypeptide can be determined by a PT based assay where FIX is diluted in FIX deficient plasma and mixed with prothrombin time reagent recombinant TF with phospholipids and calcium such as that available as Innovin from Dade Behring. Clot formation is detected optically and time to clot is determined and compared against FIX deficient plasma alone. In vivo coagulation assays in animal models such as those described below also can be performed to assess the coagulation activity of FIX polypeptides.

Inhibition assays can be used to measure resistance of modified FIX polypeptides to FIX inhibitors such as for example antithrombin III AT III heparin AT III heparin complex p aminobenzamidine serine protease inhibitors and FIX specific antibodies. Assessment of inhibition to other inhibitors also can be tested and include but are not limited to other serine protease inhibitors Inhibition can be assessed by incubation of the inhibitor with FIX polypeptides that have been preincubated with and or without FVIIIa. The activity of FIX can then be measured using any one or more of the activity or coagulation assays described above and inhibition by the inhibitor can be assessed by comparing the activity of FIX polypeptides incubated with the inhibitor with the activity of FIX polypeptides that were not incubated with the inhibitor. For example the inhibition of modified FIX polypeptides by AT III heparin can be assessed as described in Example 5 below Inhibition of wild type FIXa or FIXa variants by the AT III heparin complex is assessed by incubating AT III heparin with FIXa and the measuring the catalytic activity of FIXa towards a small molecule substrate Mesyl D CHG Gly Arg AMC Pefafluor FIXa Pentapharm . Such assays can be performed in the presence or absence of FVIIIa.

FIX polypeptides also can be tested for binding to other coagulation factors and inhibitors. For example FIX direct and indirect interactions with cofactors such as FVIIIa substrates such as FX and FIX and inhibitors such as antithrombin III and heparin can be assessed using any binding assay known in the art including but not limited to immunoprecipitation column purification non reducing SDS PAGE BIAcore assays surface plasmon resonance SPR fluorescence resonance energy transfer FRET fluorescence polarization FP isothermal titration calorimetry ITC circular dichroism CD protein fragment complementation assays PCA Nuclear Magnetic Resonance NMR spectroscopy light scattering sedimentation equilibrium small zone gel filtration chromatography gel retardation Far western blotting fluorescence polarization hydroxyl radical protein footprinting phage display and various two hybrid systems.

Modified FIX polypeptide binding and or affinity for phosphatidylserine PS and other phospholipids can be determined using assays well known in the art. Highly pure phospholipids for example known concentrations of bovine PS and egg phosphatidylcholine PC which are commercially available such as from Sigma in organic solvent can be used to prepare small unilamellar phospholipid vesicles. FIX polypeptide binding to these PS PC vesicles can be determined by relative light scattering at 90 to the incident light. The intensity of the light scatter with PC PS alone and with PC PS FIX is measured to determine the dissociation constant Harvey et al. 2003 J. Biol. Chem. 278 8363 8369 . Surface plasma resonance such as on a BIAcore biosensor instrument also can be used to measure the affinity of FIX polypeptides for phospholipid membranes Sun et al. 2003 Blood 101 2277 2284 .

Non human animal models can be used to assess activity and stability of modified FIX polypeptides. For example non human animals can be used as models for a disease or condition. Non human animals can be injected with disease and or phenotype inducing substances prior to administration of FIX variants to monitor the effects on disease progression. Genetic models also are useful. Animals such as mice can be generated which mimic a disease or condition by the overexpression underexpression or knock out of one or more genes. Such animals can be generated by transgenic animal production techniques well known in the art or using naturally occurring or induced mutant strains. Examples of useful non human animal models of diseases associated with FIX include but are not limited to models of bleeding disorders in particular hemophilia. These non human animal models can be used to monitor activity of FIX variants compared to a wild type FIX polypeptide.

Animal models also can be used to monitor stability half life clearance and other pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of modified FIX polypeptides. Such assays are useful for comparing modified FIX polypeptides and for calculating doses and dose regimens for further non human animal and human trials. For example a modified FIX polypeptide can be injected into the tail vein of mice. Blood samples are then taken at time points after injection such as minutes hours and days afterwards and then the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the modified FIX polypeptides assessed such as by monitoring the serum or plasma at specific time points for FIXa activity and protein concentration by ELISA or radioimmunoassay see e.g. Example 6 . Blood samples also can be tested for coagulation activity in methods such as the aPTT assay see e.g. Example 6 .

Modified FIX polypeptides can be tested for therapeutic effectiveness using animal models for hemophilia. In one non limiting example an animal model such as a mouse can be used. Mouse models of hemophilia are available in the art and include FIX deficient mice such as those utilized in Example 7 below and mice expressing mutant FIX polypeptides and can be employed to test modified FIX polypeptides Wang et al. 1997 PNAS 94 11563 11566 Lin et al. 1997 Blood 90 3962 3966 Kundu et al. 1998 Blood 92 168 174 Sabatino et al. 2004 Blood 104 9 2767 2774 and Jin et al. 2004 Blood 104 1733 1739 see also Example 7 .

Other models of FIX deficiencies include hemophilic dogs that express defective FIX or that have been hepatectomized Evans et al. 1989 PNAS 86 10095 Mauser et al. 1996 Blood 88 3451 and Kay et al. 1994 PNAS 91 2353 2357 .

Many assays are available to assess activity of FIX for clinical use. Such assays can include assessment of coagulation protein stability and half life in vivo and phenotypic assays. Phenotypic assays and assays to assess the therapeutic effect of FIX treatment include assessment of blood levels of FIX such as measurement of serum FIX prior to administration and time points following administrations including after the first administration immediately after last administration and time points in between correcting for the body mass index BMI phenotypic response to FIX treatment including amelioration of symptoms over time compared to subjects treated with an unmodified and or wild type FIX or placebo. Examples of clinical assays to assess FIX activity can be found such as in Franchini et al. 2005 Thromb Haemost. 93 6 1027 1035 Shapiro et al. 2005 Blood 105 2 518 525 and White et al. 1997 Thromb. Haemost. 78 1 261 265. Patients can be monitored regularly over a period of time for routine or repeated administrations following administration in response to acute events such as hemorrhage trauma or surgical procedures.

Compositions for use in treatment of bleeding disorders are provided herein. Such compositions contain a therapeutically effective amount of a Factor IX polypeptide as described herein. Effective concentrations of FIX polypeptides or pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof are mixed with a suitable pharmaceutical carrier or vehicle for systemic topical or local administration. Compounds are included in an amount effective for treating the selected disorder. The concentration of active compound in the composition will depend on absorption inactivation excretion rates of the active compound the dosage schedule and amount administered as well as other factors known to those of skill in the art.

Pharmaceutical carriers or vehicles suitable for administration of the compounds provided herein include any such carriers known to those skilled in the art to be suitable for the particular mode of administration. Pharmaceutical compositions that include a therapeutically effective amount of a FIX polypeptide described herein also can be provided as a lyophilized powder that is reconstituted such as with sterile water immediately prior to administration.

Pharmaceutical compositions containing a modified FIX can be formulated in any conventional manner by mixing a selected amount of the polypeptide with one or more physiologically acceptable carriers or excipients. Selection of the carrier or excipient is within the skill of the administering profession and can depend upon a number of parameters. These include for example the mode of administration i.e. systemic oral nasal pulmonary local topical or any other mode and disorder treated. The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein can be formulated for single dosage direct administration or for dilution or other modification. The concentrations of the compounds in the formulations are effective for delivery of an amount upon administration that is effective for the intended treatment. Typically the compositions are formulated for single dosage administration. To formulate a composition the weight fraction of a compound or mixture thereof is dissolved suspended dispersed or otherwise mixed in a selected vehicle at an effective concentration such that the treated condition is relieved or ameliorated.

The modified FIX polypeptides provided herein can be formulated for administration to a subject as a two chain FIXa protein. The modified FIX polypeptides can be activated by any method known in the art prior to formulation. For example FIX can be activated by incubation with FXIa such as FXIa immobilized on beads. Calcium can be included in these processes to ensure full activation and correct folding of the modified FIXa protein. The modified FIX polypeptides provided herein also can be formulated for administration as a single chain protein. The modified FIX polypeptides provided herein can be formulated such that the single chain and two chain forms are contained in the pharmaceutical composition in any ratio by appropriate selection of the medium to eliminate or control autoactivation.

The compound can be suspended in micronized or other suitable form or can be derivatized to produce a more soluble active product. The form of the resulting mixture depends upon a number of factors including the intended mode of administration and the solubility of the compound in the selected carrier or vehicle. The resulting mixtures are solutions suspensions emulsions and other such mixtures and can be formulated as an non aqueous or aqueous mixture creams gels ointments emulsions solutions elixirs lotions suspensions tinctures pastes foams aerosols irrigations sprays suppositories bandages or any other formulation suitable for systemic topical or local administration. For local internal administration such as intramuscular parenteral or intra articular administration the polypeptides can be formulated as a solution suspension in an aqueous based medium such as isotonically buffered saline or are combined with a biocompatible support or bioadhesive intended for internal administration. The effective concentration is sufficient for ameliorating the targeted condition and can be empirically determined To formulate a composition the weight fraction of compound is dissolved suspended dispersed or otherwise mixed in a selected vehicle at an effective concentration such that the targeted condition is relieved or ameliorated.

Generally pharmaceutically acceptable compositions are prepared in view of approvals for a regulatory agency or other prepared in accordance with generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals and in humans. Pharmaceutical compositions can include carriers such as a diluent adjuvant excipient or vehicle with which an isoform is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids such as water and oils including those of petroleum animal vegetable or synthetic origin such as peanut oil soybean oil mineral oil and sesame oil. Water is a typical carrier when the pharmaceutical composition is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions also can be employed as liquid carriers particularly for injectable solutions. Compositions can contain along with an active ingredient a diluent such as lactose sucrose dicalcium phosphate or carboxymethylcellulose a lubricant such as magnesium stearate calcium stearate and talc and a binder such as starch natural gums such as gum acacia gelatin glucose molasses polvinylpyrrolidine celluloses and derivatives thereof povidone crospovidones and other such binders known to those of skill in the art. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch glucose lactose sucrose gelatin malt rice flour chalk silica gel sodium stearate glycerol monostearate talc sodium chloride dried skim milk glycerol propylene glycol water and ethanol. A composition if desired also can contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents or pH buffering agents for example acetate sodium citrate cyclodextrine derivatives sorbitan monolaurate triethanolamine sodium acetate triethanolamine oleate and other such agents. These compositions can take the form of solutions suspensions emulsion tablets pills capsules powders and sustained release formulations. Capsules and cartridges of e.g. gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator can be formulated containing a powder mix of a therapeutic compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch. A composition can be formulated as a suppository with traditional binders and carriers such as triglycerides. Oral formulation can include standard carriers such as pharmaceutical grades of mannitol lactose starch magnesium stearate sodium saccharine cellulose magnesium carbonate and other such agents. Preparations for oral administration also can be suitably formulated with protease inhibitors such as a Bowman Birk inhibitor a conjugated Bowman Birk inhibitor aprotinin and camostat. Examples of suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences by E. W. Martin. Such compositions will contain a therapeutically effective amount of the compound generally in purified form together with a suitable amount of carrier so as to provide the form for proper administration to a subject or patient.

The formulation should suit the mode of administration. For example the modified FIX can be formulated for parenteral administration by injection e.g. by bolus injection or continuous infusion . The injectable compositions can take such forms as suspensions solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles. The sterile injectable preparation also can be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent for example as a solution in 1 4 butanediol. Sterile fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including but not limited to synthetic mono or diglycerides fatty acids including oleic acid naturally occurring vegetable oils like sesame oil coconut oil peanut oil cottonseed oil and other oils or synthetic fatty vehicles like ethyl oleate. Buffers preservatives antioxidants and the suitable ingredients can be incorporated as required or alternatively can comprise the formulation.

The polypeptides can be formulated as the sole pharmaceutically active ingredient in the composition or can be combined with other active ingredients. The polypeptides can be targeted for delivery such as by conjugation to a targeting agent such as an antibody. Liposomal suspensions including tissue targeted liposomes also can be suitable as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art. For example liposome formulations can be prepared as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 522 811. Liposomal delivery also can include slow release formulations including pharmaceutical matrices such as collagen gels and liposomes modified with fibronectin see for example Weiner et al. 1985 J. Pharm. Sci. 74 9 922 5 . The compositions provided herein further can contain one or more adjuvants that facilitate delivery such as but are not limited to inert carriers or colloidal dispersion systems. Representative and non limiting examples of such inert carriers can be selected from water isopropyl alcohol gaseous fluorocarbons ethyl alcohol polyvinyl pyrrolidone propylene glycol a gel producing material stearyl alcohol stearic acid spermaceti sorbitan monooleate methylcellulose as well as suitable combinations of two or more thereof.

The active compound is included in the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in an amount sufficient to exert a therapeutically useful effect in the absence of undesirable side effects on the subject treated. The therapeutically effective concentration can be determined empirically by testing the compounds in known in vitro and in vivo systems such as the assays provided herein.

The precise amount or dose of the therapeutic agent administered depends on the particular FIX polypeptide the route of administration and other considerations such as the severity of the disease and the weight and general state of the subject. Local administration of the therapeutic agent will typically require a smaller dosage than any mode of systemic administration although the local concentration of the therapeutic agent can in some cases be higher following local administration than can be achieved with safety upon systemic administration. If necessary a particular dosage and duration and treatment protocol can be empirically determined or extrapolated. For example exemplary doses of recombinant and native FIX polypeptides can be used as a starting point to determine appropriate dosages. For example a recombinant FIX rFIXa polypeptide that has been activated to rFIXa BeneFIX Factor IX has been administered to patients with hemophilia B for the treatment of hemorrhage as well as in prophylactic and surgical settings at various doses. Dosage and duration of treatment with recombinant FIX depends on the severity of the factor IX deficiency the location and extent of bleeding and the patient s clinical condition age and recovery of factor IX. For example patients with severe Hemophilia B FIX activity of 5 5 

Thus for adult patients the number of Factor IX IU required IU body weight kg desired factor IX increase or IU dL 1.3 IU kg per IU dL and for pediatric patients the number of Factor IX IU required IU body weight kg desired factor IX increase or IU dL 1.4 IU kg per IU dL . Table 11 sets forth the typical dosing used for various bleeding episodes.

The modified FIX polypeptides provided herein can be effective at reduced dosage amounts and or reduced frequencies compared to native recombinant FIX. For example the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein can be administered at less frequent dosing intervals such as 24 hours 36 hours 48 hours 60 hours or more. In other examples fewer doses of the modified FIX polypeptides can be administered. For example the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein can be administered just once to achieve coagulation. In some embodiments the dosages of modified FIX are reduced compared to native FIX. For example the dosages can be less than or about 1 IU kg 2 IU kg 3 IU kg 4 IU kg 5 IU kg 6 IU kg 7 IU kg 8 IU kg 9 IU kg 10 IU kg 20 IU kg 30 IU kg 40 IU kg or 50 IU kg 60 IU kg 70 IU kg 80 IU kg 90 IU kg or 100 IU kg. The dose duration of treatment and the interval between injections will vary with the severity of the bleed and the response of the patient to the treatment and can be adjusted accordingly. Factors such as the level of activity and half life of the modified FIX in comparison to the unmodified FIX can be taken into account when making dosage determinations. Particular dosages and regimens can be empirically determined. For example a modified FIX polypeptide that exhibits a longer half life than an unmodified FIX polypeptide can be administered at lower doses and or less frequently than the unmodified FIX polypeptide. Similarly the dosages required for therapeutic effect using a modified FIX polypeptide that displays increased coagulant activity compared with an unmodified FIX polypeptide can be reduced in frequency and amount. Particular dosages and regimens can be empirically determined by one of skill in the art.

Pharmaceutical therapeutically active compounds and derivatives thereof are typically formulated and administered in unit dosage forms or multiple dosage forms. Formulations can be provided for administration to humans and animals in dosage forms that include but are not limited to tablets capsules pills powders granules sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions oral solutions or suspensions and oil water emulsions containing suitable quantities of the compounds or pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof. Each unit dose contains a predetermined quantity of therapeutically active compound sufficient to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier vehicle or diluent. Examples of unit dose forms include ampoules and syringes and individually packaged tablets or capsules. In some examples the unit dose is provided as a lyophilized powder that is reconstituted prior to administration. For example a FIX polypeptide can be provided as lyophilized powder that is reconstituted with a suitable solution to generate a single dose solution for injection. In some embodiments the lyophilized powder can contain the FIX polypeptide and additional components such as salts such that reconstitution with sterile distilled water results in a FIX polypeptide in a buffered or saline solution. Unit dose forms can be administered in fractions or multiples thereof. A multiple dose form is a plurality of identical unit dosage forms packaged in a single container to be administered in segregated unit dose form. Examples of multiple dose forms include vials bottles of tablets or capsules or bottles of pints or gallons. Hence multiple dose form is a multiple of unit doses that are not segregated in packaging.

The FIX polypeptides provided herein i.e. active compounds can be administered in vitro ex vivo or in vivo by contacting a mixture such as a body fluid or other tissue sample with a FIX polypeptide. For example when administering a compound ex vivo a body fluid or tissue sample from a subject can be contacted with the FIX polypeptides that are coated on a tube or filter such as for example a tube or filter in a bypass machine. When administering in vivo the active compounds can be administered by any appropriate route for example orally nasally pulmonary parenterally intravenously intradermally subcutaneously intraarticularly intracisternally intraocularly intraventricularly intrathecally intramuscularly intraperitoneally intratracheally or topically as well as by any combination of any two or more thereof in liquid semi liquid or solid form and are formulated in a manner suitable for each route of administration. The modified FIX polypeptides can be administered once or more than once such as twice three times four times or any number of times that are required to achieve a therapeutic effect. Multiple administrations can be effected via any route or combination of routes and can be administered hourly every 2 hours every three hours every four hours or more.

The most suitable route for administration will vary depending upon the disease state to be treated for example the location of the bleeding disorder. Generally the FIX polypeptides will be administered by intravenous bolus injection with an administration infusing time of approximately 2 5 minutes. In other examples desirable blood levels of FIX can be maintained by a continuous infusion of the active agent as ascertained by plasma levels. It should be noted that the attending physician would know how to and when to terminate interrupt or adjust therapy to lower dosage due to toxicity or bone marrow liver or kidney dysfunctions. Conversely the attending physician would also know how to and when to adjust treatment to higher levels if the clinical response is not adequate precluding toxic side effects . In other examples the location of the bleeding disorder might indicate that the FIX formulation is administered via alternative routes. For example local administration including administration into the brain e.g. intraventricularly might be performed when the patient is experiencing bleeding in this region. Similarly for treatment of bleeding in the joints local administration by injection of the therapeutic agent into the joint i.e. intraarticularly intravenous or subcutaneous means can be employed. In other examples topical administration of the therapeutic agent to the skin for example formulated as a cream gel or ointment or administration to the lungs by inhalation or intratracheally might be appropriate when the bleeding is localized to these areas.

The instances where the modified FIX polypeptides are be formulated as a depot preparation the long acting formulations can be administered by implantation for example subcutaneously or intramuscularly or by intramuscular injection. Thus for example the therapeutic compounds can be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil or ion exchange resins or as sparingly soluble derivatives for example as a sparingly soluble salt.

The compositions if desired can be presented in a package in a kit or dispenser device that can contain one or more unit dosage forms containing the active ingredient. The package for example contains metal or plastic foil such as a blister pack. The pack or dispenser device can be accompanied by instructions for administration. The compositions containing the active agents can be packaged as articles of manufacture containing packaging material an agent provided herein and a label that indicates the disorder for which the agent is provided.

Also provided are compositions of nucleic acid molecules encoding the modified FIX polypeptides and expression vectors encoding them that are suitable for gene therapy. Rather than deliver the protein nucleic acid can be administered in vivo such as systemically or by other route or ex vivo such as by removal of cells including lymphocytes introduction of the nucleic therein and reintroduction into the host or a compatible recipient.

Modified FIX polypeptides can be delivered to cells and tissues by expression of nucleic acid molecules. Modified FIX polypeptides can be administered as nucleic acid molecules encoding modified FIX polypeptides including ex vivo techniques and direct in vivo expression. Nucleic acids can be delivered to cells and tissues by any method known to those of skill in the art. The isolated nucleic acid sequences can be incorporated into vectors for further manipulation. As used herein vector or plasmid refers to discrete elements that are used to introduce heterologous DNA into cells for either expression or replication thereof. Selection and use of such vehicles are well within the skill of the artisan.

Methods for administering modified FIX polypeptides by expression of encoding nucleic acid molecules include administration of recombinant vectors. The vector can be designed to remain episomal such as by inclusion of an origin of replication or can be designed to integrate into a chromosome in the cell. Modified FIX polypeptides also can be used in ex vivo gene expression therapy using non viral vectors. For example cells can be engineered to express a modified FIX polypeptide such as by integrating a modified FIX polypeptide encoding nucleic acid into a genomic location either operatively linked to regulatory sequences or such that it is placed operatively linked to regulatory sequences in a genomic location. Such cells then can be administered locally or systemically to a subject such as a patient in need of treatment.

Viral vectors include for example adenoviruses adeno associated viruses AAV poxviruses herpes viruses retroviruses and others designed for gene therapy can be employed. The vectors can remain episomal or can integrate into chromosomes of the treated subject. A modified FIX polypeptide can be expressed by a virus which is administered to a subject in need of treatment. Viral vectors suitable for gene therapy include adenovirus adeno associated virus AAV retroviruses lentiviruses vaccinia viruses and others noted above. For example adenovirus expression technology is well known in the art and adenovirus production and administration methods also are well known. Adenovirus serotypes are available for example from the American Type Culture Collection ATCC Rockville Md. . Adenovirus can be used ex vivo for example cells are isolated from a patient in need of treatment and transduced with a modified FIX polypeptide expressing adenovirus vector. After a suitable culturing period the transduced cells are administered to a subject locally and or systemically. Alternatively modified FIX polypeptide expressing adenovirus particles are isolated and formulated in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier for delivery of a therapeutically effective amount to prevent treat or ameliorate a disease or condition of a subject. Typically adenovirus particles are delivered at a dose ranging from 1 particle to 10particles per kilogram subject weight generally between 10or 10particles to 10particles per kilogram subject weight. In some situations it is desirable to provide a nucleic acid source with an agent that targets cells such as an antibody specific for a cell surface membrane protein or a target cell or a ligand for a receptor on a target cell. FIX also can be targeted for delivery into specific cell types. For example adenoviral vectors encoding FIX polypeptides can be used for stable expression in nondividing cells such as liver cells Margaritis et al. 2004 J Clin Invest 113 1025 1031 . In another example viral or nonviral vectors encoding FIX polypeptides can be transduced into isolated cells for subsequent delivery. Additional cell types for expression and delivery of FIX might include but are not limited to fibroblasts and endothelial cells.

The nucleic acid molecules can be introduced into artificial chromosomes and other non viral vectors. Artificial chromosomes such as ACES see Lindenbaum et al. 2004 Nucleic Acids Res. 32 21 e172 can be engineered to encode and express the isoform. Briefly mammalian artificial chromosomes MACs provide a means to introduce large payloads of genetic information into the cell in an autonomously replicating non integrating format. Unique among MACs the mammalian satellite DNA based Artificial Chromosome Expression ACE can be reproducibly generated de novo in cell lines of different species and readily purified from the host cells chromosomes. Purified mammalian ACEs can then be re introduced into a variety of recipient cell lines where they have been stably maintained for extended periods in the absence of selective pressure using an ACE System. Using this approach specific loading of one or two gene targets has been achieved in LMTK and CHO cells.

Another method for introducing nucleic acids encoding the modified FIX polypeptides is a two step gene replacement technique in yeast starting with a complete adenovirus genome Ad2 Ketner et al. 1994 PNAS 91 6186 6190 cloned in a Yeast Artificial Chromosome YAC and a plasmid containing adenovirus sequences to target a specific region in the YAC clone an expression cassette for the gene of interest and a positive and negative selectable marker. YACs are of particular interest because they permit incorporation of larger genes. This approach can be used for construction of adenovirus based vectors bearing nucleic acids encoding any of the described modified FIX polypeptides for gene transfer to mammalian cells or whole animals.

The nucleic acids can be encapsulated in a vehicle such as a liposome or introduced into a cells such as a bacterial cell particularly an attenuated bacterium or introduced into a viral vector. For example when liposomes are employed proteins that bind to a cell surface membrane protein associated with endocytosis can be used for targeting and or to facilitate uptake e.g. capsid proteins or fragments thereof tropic for a particular cell type antibodies for proteins which undergo internalization in cycling and proteins that target intracellular localization and enhance intracellular half life.

For ex vivo and in vivo methods nucleic acid molecules encoding the modified FIX polypeptide is introduced into cells that are from a suitable donor or the subject to be treated. Cells into which a nucleic acid can be introduced for purposes of therapy include for example any desired available cell type appropriate for the disease or condition to be treated including but not limited to epithelial cells endothelial cells keratinocytes fibroblasts muscle cells hepatocytes blood cells such as T lymphocytes B lymphocytes monocytes macrophages neutrophils eosinophils megakaryocytes granulocytes various stem or progenitor cells in particular hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells e.g. such as stem cells obtained from bone marrow umbilical cord blood peripheral blood fetal liver and other sources thereof

For ex vivo treatment cells from a donor compatible with the subject to be treated or the subject to be treated cells are removed the nucleic acid is introduced into these isolated cells and the modified cells are administered to the subject. Treatment includes direct administration such as for example encapsulated within porous membranes which are implanted into the patient see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 892 538 and 5 283 187 each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . Techniques suitable for the transfer of nucleic acid into mammalian cells in vitro include the use of liposomes and cationic lipids e.g. DOTMA DOPE and DC Chol electroporation microinjection cell fusion DEAE dextran and calcium phosphate precipitation methods. Methods of DNA delivery can be used to express modified FIX polypeptides in vivo. Such methods include liposome delivery of nucleic acids and naked DNA delivery including local and systemic delivery such as using electroporation ultrasound and calcium phosphate delivery. Other techniques include microinjection cell fusion chromosome mediated gene transfer microcell mediated gene transfer and spheroplast fusion.

In vivo expression of a modified FIX polypeptide can be linked to expression of additional molecules. For example expression of a modified FIX polypeptide can be linked with expression of a cytotoxic product such as in an engineered virus or expressed in a cytotoxic virus. Such viruses can be targeted to a particular cell type that is a target for a therapeutic effect. The expressed modified FIX polypeptide can be used to enhance the cytotoxicity of the virus.

In vivo expression of a modified FIX polypeptide can include operatively linking a modified FIX polypeptide encoding nucleic acid molecule to specific regulatory sequences such as a cell specific or tissue specific promoter. Modified FIX polypeptides also can be expressed from vectors that specifically infect and or replicate in target cell types and or tissues. Inducible promoters can be use to selectively regulate modified FIX polypeptide expression. An exemplary regulatable expression system is the doxycycline inducible gene expression system which has been used to regulate recombinant FIX expression Srour et al. 2003 Thromb. Haemost. 90 3 398 405 .

Nucleic acid molecules as naked nucleic acids or in vectors artificial chromosomes liposomes and other vehicles can be administered to the subject by systemic administration topical local and other routes of administration. When systemic and in vivo the nucleic acid molecule or vehicle containing the nucleic acid molecule can be targeted to a cell.

Administration also can be direct such as by administration of a vector or cells that typically targets a cell or tissue. For example tumor cells and proliferating can be targeted cells for in vivo expression of modified FIX polypeptides. Cells used for in vivo expression of an modified FIX polypeptide also include cells autologous to the patient. Such cells can be removed from a patient nucleic acids for expression of an modified FIX polypeptide introduced and then administered to a patient such as by injection or engraftment.

The modified FIX polypeptides and nucleic acid molecules provided herein can be used for treatment of any condition for which unmodified FIX is employed. Thus for example the modified FIX polypeptides can be used as procoagulants for the treatment of bleeding disorders including congenital and acquired bleeding disorders such as hemophilia. Typically therefore the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein are procoagulants that are used in the treatment of bleeding disorders. In other particular examples however the modified FIX polypeptides can be used as anticoagulants. For example a hyperglycosylated modified FIX polypeptide that also contains one or more modifications that result in a lack of catalytic activity for it s substrate FX can be used as an anticoagulant to treat thrombotic disorders.

The modified FIX polypeptides provided herein have therapeutic activity alone or in combination with other agents. The modified polypeptides provided herein are designed to retain therapeutic activity but exhibit modified properties such as improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties increased resistance to inhibitors and or improved catalytic activity. Such modified properties and activities for example can improve the therapeutic effectiveness of the polypeptides. The modified FIX polypeptides and encoding nucleic acid molecules provided herein can be used for treatment of any condition for which unmodified FIX is employed. This section provides exemplary uses of and administration methods. These described therapies are exemplary only and do not limit the applications of modified FIX polypeptides.

The modified FIX polypeptides provided herein can be used in various therapeutic as well as diagnostic methods in which FIX is employed. Such methods include but are not limited to methods of treatment of physiological and medical conditions described and listed below. Modified FIX polypeptides provided herein can exhibit improvement of in vivo activities and therapeutic effects compared to wild type FIX including lower dosage to achieve the same effect a more sustained therapeutic effect and other improvements in administration and treatment.

The modified FIX polypeptides described herein can exhibit improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties increased catalytic activity increased resistance to inhibitors and or increased coagulant activity compared to an unmodified FIX polypeptide. Such polypeptides can be used as procoagulants for the treatment of for example bleeding disorders including congenital bleeding disorders and acquired bleeding disorders. In some examples the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein that have non native glycosylation sites also contain modifications that result in a modified FIX polypeptide that inhibits coagulation such that the modified FIX polypeptide is an anti coagulant and can be used to treat for example thrombotic diseases and disorders. The modified FIX polypeptides provided herein can be used to deliver longer lasting more stable therapies. Examples of therapeutic improvements using modified FIX polypeptides include but are not limited to lower dosages fewer and or less frequent administrations decreased side effects and increased therapeutic effects.

Typically the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein are procoagulants and can be used to treat bleeding disorders including congenital bleeding disorders and acquired bleeding disorders. In particular examples modified FIX polypeptides are intended for use in therapeutic methods in which other modified and unmodified FIX polypeptides have been used for treatment. Exemplary diseases and disorders that can be treated with the modified FIX polypeptides alone or in combination with other agents including other procoagulants include but are not limited to blood coagulation disorders hematologic diseases hemorrhagic disorders hemophiliac in particular hemophilia B and acquired blood disorders including bleeding associated with trauma and surgery. In some embodiments the bleedings to be treated by FIX polypeptides occur in organs such as the brain inner ear region eyes liver lung tumor tissue gastrointestinal tract. In other embodiments the bleeding is diffuse such as in hemorrhagic gastritis and profuse uterine bleeding.

Patients with bleeding disorders such as hemophilia are often at risk for hemorrhage and excessive bleeding during surgery including dental extraction or trauma. Such patients often have acute haemarthroses bleedings in joints chronic hemophilic arthropathy haematomas such as muscular retroperitoneal sublingual and retropharyngeal bleedings in other tissue haematuria bleeding from the renal tract cerebral hemorrhage and gastrointestinal bleedings such as UGI bleeds that can be treated with modified FIX polypeptides. Thus in some examples the modified FIX polypeptides are used to treat bleeding episodes due to trauma or surgery or lowered count or activity of platelets in a subject. Exemplary methods for patients undergoing surgery include treatments to prevent hemorrhage and treatments before during or after surgeries.

Although typically the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein exhibit improved coagulant activity compared to a modified FIX polypeptide in some examples the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein can contain one or more non native glycosylation sites and also lack functional peptidase activity. Such modified FIX polypeptides can be used in therapeutic methods to inhibit blood coagulation see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 315 995 . Modified FIX polypeptides that inhibit blood coagulation can be used in anticoagulant methods of treatment for ischemic and thrombotic disorders. In surgical patients with an increased risk of excessive clotting such as patients with deep vein thrombosis DVT or superficial vein thrombosis SVT the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein that are anticoagulants can be administered to prevent excessive clotting in surgeries. In some cases treatment is performed with FIX alone. In some cases FIX is administered in conjunction with additional anticoagulation factors as required by the condition or disease to be treated.

Treatment of diseases and conditions with modified FIX polypeptides can be effected by any suitable route of administration using suitable formulations as described herein including but not limited to injection pulmonary oral and transdermal administration. If necessary a particular dosage and duration and treatment protocol can be empirically determined or extrapolated. For example exemplary doses of recombinant and native FIX polypeptides such as recommended dosages of BeneFIX Coagulation Factor IX Recombinant as described above can be used as a starting point to determine appropriate dosages. Modified FIX polypeptides that are hyperglycosylated and have an increased half life in vivo or that have increased resistance to inhibitors or have increased catalytic activity can be effective at reduced dosage amounts and or frequencies. Dosages and dosage regimens for unmodified FIX polypeptides can be used as guidance for determining dosages for the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein. Factors such as the half life and level of activity of the modified FIX in comparison to the unmodified FIX can be used in making such determinations. Particular dosages and regimens can be empirically determined

Dosage levels and regimens can be determined based upon known dosages and regimens and if necessary can be extrapolated based upon the changes in properties of the modified polypeptides and or can be determined empirically based on a variety of factors. Such factors include body weight of the individual general health age the activity of the specific compound employed sex diet time of administration rate of excretion drug combination the severity and course of the disease and the patient s disposition to the disease and the judgment of the treating physician. The active ingredient the polypeptide typically is combined with a pharmaceutically effective carrier. The amount of active ingredient that can be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form or multi dosage form can vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration.

The effect of the FIX polypeptides on the clotting time of blood can be monitored using any of the clotting tests known in the art including but not limited to whole blood partial thromboplastin time PTT the activated partial thromboplastin time aPTT the activated clotting time ACT the recalcified activated clotting time or the Lee White Clotting time.

Upon improvement of a patient s condition a maintenance dose of a compound or compositions can be administered if necessary and the dosage the dosage form or frequency of administration or a combination thereof can be modified. In some cases a subject can require intermittent treatment on a long term basis upon any recurrence of disease symptoms or based upon scheduled dosages. In other cases additional administrations can be required in response to acute events such as hemorrhage trauma or surgical procedures.

Hemophilia is a bleeding disorder that is caused by a deficiency in one or more blood coagulation factors. It is characterized by a decreased ability to form blood clots at sites of tissue damage. Congenital X linked hemophilias include hemophilia A and hemophilia B or Christmas disease which are caused by deficiencies in FVIII and FIX respectively. Hemophilia A occurs at a rate of 1 out of 10 0000 males while hemophilia B occurs in 1 out of 50 000 males.

Patients with hemophilia suffer from recurring joint and muscle bleeds which can be spontaneous or in response to trauma. The bleeding can cause severe acute pain restrict movement and lead to secondary complications including synovial hypertrophy. Furthermore the recurring bleeding in the joints can cause chronic synovitis which can cause joint damage destroying synovium cartilage and bone.

The modified FIX polypeptides provided herein and the nucleic acids encoding the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein can be used in therapies for hemophilia including treatment of bleeding conditions associated with hemophilia. The modified FIX polypeptides provided herein can be used for example to control or prevent spontaneous bleeding episodes or to control or prevent bleeding in response to trauma or surgical procedures.

The modified FIX polypeptides herein can exhibit improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties such as improved serum half life increased resistance to inhibitors increased catalytic activity and or increased coagulant activity. Thus modified FIX polypeptides can be used to deliver longer lasting or otherwise improved therapies for hemophilia. Examples of therapeutic improvements using modified FIX polypeptides include for example but are not limited to lower dosages fewer and or less frequent administrations decreased side effects and increased therapeutic effects.

Modified FIX polypeptides can be tested for therapeutic effectiveness for example by using animal models. For example FIX deficient mice or any other known disease model for hemophilia can be treated with modified FIX polypeptides. Progression of disease symptoms and phenotypes is monitored to assess the effects of the modified FIX polypeptides. Modified FIX polypeptides also can be administered to animal models as well as subjects such as in clinical trials to assess in vivo effectiveness in comparison to placebo controls and or controls using unmodified FIX.

Hemophilia B can be effectively managed with administration of FIX therapeutics. Patients with severe Hemophilia B have an FIX activity of 5 5 

The most frequent alterations in the FIX gene in hemophilia B patients are point mutations in particular missense mutations. Most of the identified FIX mutations occur in amino acid residues in the coding region of the FIX gene often affecting evolutionarily conserved amino acids. The severity of the hemophilia depends upon the nature of the mutation. Mutations in the coding region can affect a number of different properties or activities of the FIX polypeptide including alteration of protease activity cofactor binding signal peptide or propeptide cleavage post translational modifications and inhibition of cleavage of FIX into its activated form. Other types of point mutations include nonsense mutations that produce an unstable truncated FIX polypeptide and frameshift mutations small deletions and insertions that result in a terminally aberrant FIX molecule. In addition FIX point mutations can be found in the promoter region which can disrupt the recognition sequences for several specific gene regulatory proteins resulting in reduced transcription of coagulation factor IX. Decreased FIX as a result of transcriptional abnormalities is called Hemophilia B Leyden. An exemplary mutation in the promoter region includes disruption of the HNF 4 binding site which affect regulation of FIX transcription by the androgen receptor. The severity of this type of hemophilia is governed by the levels of androgen in the blood which increase during puberty and partially alleviate the FIX transcriptional deficiency Kurachi et al. 1995 . Other missense nucleotide changes affect the processing of factor IX primary RNA transcript. For example some mutations occur at evolutionarily conserved donor splice GT and acceptor splice AG consensus sequences which can create cryptic splice junctions and disrupt assembly of spliceosomes. Some severe cases of hemophilia approximately 10 present with large deletions in the FIX gene.

Treatment of FIX deficiency and thus hemophilia B most often involves administration of FIX including recombinant forms of FIX purified plasma FIX preparations or purified plasma concentrates. Thus similarly the modified FIX polypeptides herein and nucleic acids encoding modified FIX polypeptides can be used for treatment of hemophilia B. The modified FIX polypeptides herein can exhibit improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties such as improved serum half life increased resistance to inhibitors increased catalytic activity and or increased coagulant activity. Thus modified FIX polypeptides can be used to deliver improved therapies for hemophilia. Examples of therapeutic improvements using modified FIX polypeptides include for example but are not limited to lower dosages fewer and or less frequent administrations decreased side effects and increased therapeutic effects.

Hemophilia A which accounts for approximately 85 of all cases of hemophilia results from mutations s in the factor VIII gene on the X chromosome leading to a deficiency or dysfunction of the FVIII protein. Typically treatment of hemophilia A with native FIX polypeptides including recombinant FIX polypeptides such as BeneFIX Coagulation Factor IX Recombinant or plasma purified FIX polypeptides is not recommended because the native FIX polypeptide requires FVIIIa for catalytic activity to effect coagulation. Modified FIX polypeptides however such as those described herein that contain one or more modifications to increase the FIX intrinsic activity can be used in the treatment of hemophilia B. Such polypeptides have FVIII independent activity and thus can function as a coagulant in hemophilia A patients. For example the modified FIX polypeptides described above such as those that contain one or more modifications to introduce or eliminate one or more non native glycosylation sites and or one or more modifications to increase resistance to AT III and or heparin and that also contain and one or more modifications to increase activity of the modified FIX polypeptide in the absence of FVIIIa can be used to treat bleeding episodes in patients with Hemophilia A.

Modifications to increase intrinsic activity of a FIX polypeptide such that it can act in a FVIIIa independent manner are described above and elsewhere see e.g. Hopfner et al. 1997 EMBO J. 16 6626 6635 Kolkman et al. 2000 39 7398 7405 Sichler et al. 2003 278 4121 4126 Begbie et al. 2005 94 6 1138 47 U.S. Pat. No. 6 531 298 and U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 20080167219 and 20080214461 and include but are not limited to amino acid replacements V86A V86N V86D V86E V86Q V86G V86H V86I V86L V86M V86F V86S V86T V86W V86Y Y259F A261K K265T E277V E277A E277N E277D E277Q E277G E277H E277I E277L E277M E277F E277S E277T E277W E277Y R338A R338V R338I R338F R338W R338S R338T Y345F I383V and E388G. For example a modified FIX polypeptide provided herein can contain the amino acid substitutions Y259F K265T Y259F K265T Y345F Y259F A261K K265T Y345F Y259F K265T Y345F I383V E388G or Y259F A261K K265T Y345F I383V E388G and can exhibit increased intrinsic activity. Such modified FIX polypeptides can be used therefore in the treatment of Hemophilia A.

Any of the modified FIX polypeptides and nucleic acid molecules encoding modified FIX polypeptides described herein can be administered in combination with prior to intermittently with or subsequent to other therapeutic agents or procedures including but not limited to other biologics small molecule compounds and surgery. For any disease or condition including all those exemplified above for FIX is indicated or has been used and for which other agents and treatments are available FIX can be used in combination therewith. Hence the modified FIX polypeptides provided herein similarly can be used. Depending on the disease or condition to be treated exemplary combinations include but are not limited to combination with other plasma purified or recombinant coagulation factors procoagulants anticoagulants anti coagulation antibodies glycosaminoglycans heparins heparinoids heparin derivatives heparin like drugs coumarins such as warfarin and coumarin derivatives. Additional procoagulants that can be used in combination therapies with modified FIX polypeptides provided herein that have procoagulant properties include but are not limited to vitamin K vitamin K derivatives other coagulation factors and protein C inhibitors. Additional anticoagulants that can be used in combination therapies with modified FIX polypeptides provided herein that have anticoagulant properties include but are not limited to 2 adrenoreceptor antagonists neuropeptide V2 antagonists prostacyclin analogs thromboxane synthase inhibitors calcium agonists elastase inhibitors non steroidal anti inflammatory molecules thrombin inhibitors lipoxygenase inhibitors FVIIa inhibitors FXa inhibitors phosphodiesterase III inhibitors fibrinogen vitamin K antagonists and glucoprotein IIb IIIa antagonists.

Pharmaceutical compounds of modified FIX polypeptides for nucleic acids encoding modified FIX polypeptides or a derivative or a biologically active portion thereof can be packaged as articles of manufacture containing packaging material a pharmaceutical composition which is effective for treating a FIX mediated disease or disorder and a label that indicates that modified FIX polypeptide or nucleic acid molecule is to be used for treating a FIX mediated disease or disorder.

The articles of manufacture provided herein contain packaging materials. Packaging materials for use in packaging pharmaceutical products are well known to those of skill in the art. See for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 323 907 5 033 252 and 5 052 558 each of which is incorporated herein in its entirety. Examples of pharmaceutical packaging materials include but are not limited to blister packs bottles tubes inhalers pumps bags vials containers syringes bottles and any packaging material suitable for a selected formulation and intended mode of administration and treatment. A wide array of formulations of the compounds and compositions provided herein are contemplated as are a variety of treatments for any FIX mediated disease or disorder.

Modified FIX polypeptides and nucleic acid molecules also can be provided as kits. Kits can include a pharmaceutical composition described herein and an item for administration. For example a modified FIX can be supplied with a device for administration such as a syringe an inhaler a dosage cup a dropper or an applicator. The kit can optionally include instructions for application including dosages dosing regimens and instructions for modes of administration. Kits also can include a pharmaceutical composition described herein and an item for diagnosis. For example such kits can include an item for measuring the concentration amount or activity of FIX or a FIX regulated system of a subject.

The following examples are included for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.

The nucleic acid encoding the 461 amino acid human FIX precursor polypeptide P00740 set forth in SEQ ID NO 1 was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pFUSE hIgG1 Fc2 abbreviated here as pFUSE InvivoGen SEQ ID NO 23 which contains a composite promoter hEF1 HTLV comprising the Elongation Factor 1 EF 1 core promoter and the R segment and part of the U5 sequence R U5 of the human T Cell Leukemia Virus HTLV Type 1 Long Terminal Repeat. The In Fusion CF Dry Down PCR Cloning Kit Clontech was used according to the conditions specified by the supplier.

For the In Fusion process plasmid pFUSE without the human immunoglobulin 1 hIgG1 Fc portion was linearized using polymerase chain reaction PCR with the pFUSE Acc F1 forward primer GTGCTAGCTGGCCAGACATGATAAG SEQ ID NO 24 and the pFUSE Acc R3 reverse primer CATGGTGGCCCTCCTTCGCCGGTGATC SEQ ID NO 25 and was used as Acceptor DNA. The full length coding sequence of FIX was amplified by PCR using human FIX cDNA Origene as template with the FIX wtsp Invivo F1 forward primer 

FIX variants were generated using the QuikChange Lightning Site Directed Mutagenesis Kit Stratagene according to manufacturer s instructions with specifically designed oligonucleotides that served as primers to incorporate designed mutations into the newly synthesized DNA. Complementary primers that include the desired mutations were extended during cycling using purified double stranded super coiled pFUSE plasmid DNA that contained the cloned FIX cDNA sequence as a template. Extension of the primers resulted in incorporation of the mutations of interest into the newly synthesized strands and resulted in a mutated plasmid with staggered nicks. Following amplification the mutagenesis product was digested with DpnI restriction enzyme to remove dam methylated parental strands of the derived pFUSE DNA. The DNA was then transformed into XL1Blue supercompetent cells Stratagene followed by selection on 2xYT agar plates supplemented with 25 ppm Zeocin InvivoGen . Plasmid DNA was isolated from selected clones and sequenced to verify for incorporation of mutation s at the desired location s on the FIX gene.

The nucleotide sequence of one of the oligonucleotides from each complementary primer pair used to generate the FIX variants is provided in Table 12. The nucleotide triplet sequences that encode a substituted amino acid are shown in uppercase. For example to generate a FIX variant containing the substitutions A103N N105S A 103 N N 105 S by chymotrypsin numbering SEQ ID NO 77 the A103N N105S Forward primer and a primer that is complementary to A103N N105S Forward were used to replace a 9 bp GCTgatAAC wild type sequence with a 9 bp AATgatAGC mutant sequence changed nucleotide triplets are denoted by upper case .

Table 12 below sets forth the oligonucleotide primers used for FIX mutagenesis. The mutant triplets are shown in upper case and primer names correspond to the mutation by chymotrypsin numbering produced as a result of the mutagenesis using the primer.

Table 13 below sets forth the FIX variants that were generated with the mutations indicated using numbering relative to the mature FIX polypeptide set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 and also chymotrypsin numbering.

Wild type and variant FIX polypeptides were expressed in CHO Express CHOX cells Excellgene . CHO Express CHOX cells were maintained in DM204B Complete medium Irvine Scientific and used to inoculate production seed cultures. Seed cultures were grown in the same media to approximately 1.4 10viable cells vc mL and approximately 100 mL used to inoculate approximately 1.0 L of DM204B Complete media so that the inoculation density was 1.2 10vc mL. This culture was grown for 3 days to reach 13 16 10vc mL on the day of transfection. A transfection complex was formed by mixing FIX plasmid DNA 3.2 mg with Polyethylenimine MAX PEI 20.5 mg Polysciences and diluting to 1.0 L with serum free TfMAX2 transfection medium Mediatech . This mixture was then added to the 1.0 L production culture. 1.0 L aliquots of the cells plus transfection mix were split into 2 3 L baffled Fernback Flasks and allowed to express for 4 days before harvesting the crude FIX. Culture supernatants were then harvested by filtration and FIX was purified.

Larger scale cultures of 10 L or greater were produced in WAVE bioreactors GE Healthcare . 20 L wave bags were inoculated with approximately 400 mL of seed culture grown as described above with 4.6 L of DM204B Complete media to a seeding density of 1.2 10vc mL. The WAVE bioreactor was set to a rocking angle of 6 degrees rocking rate of 24 rpm at 37.1 C. in order to allow the cells to reach a cell density of 13 16 10vc mL 3 days later. 16 mg of FIX plasmid DNA and 102.5 mg of PEI were combined to form a transfection complex which was diluted in 5.0 L of TfMAX2 prior to addition to the culture on the WAVE bioreactor 3 days after the initial seeding. While the Transfection complex plus TfMAX media was added to the wave bag the rocking angle of the WAVE Bioreactor was set to 8 degrees and the temperature to 33 C. while the other settings remained the same. The culture was allowed to express for 4 days before harvesting the crude FIX. The contents of the wave bags were allowed to settle for 3 hrs at 4 C. prior to harvesting the culture supernatant through a CUNO depth filter and then the FIX was purified.

FIX polypeptides were purified using a Capto Q column GE Healthcare to which FIX polypeptides with functional Gla domains adsorb followed by a calcium elution step. Typically EDTA 10 mM Tris 25 mM pH 8.0 and Tween 80 0.001 were added to the culture supernatant from the transfected cells. The samples were loaded onto a Capto Q column that had been pre equilibrated with Buffer B 25 mM Tris pH 8 1 M NaCl 0.001 Tween 80 followed by equilibration with Buffer A 25 mM Tris pH 8 0.15 M NaCl 0.001 Tween 80 Immediately following completion of sample loading the column was washed with 14 Buffer B 86 Buffer A for 20 column volumes. Buffer C 25 mM Tris pH 8 0.2 M NaCl 0.001 Tween 80 10 mM CaCl was then applied to the column to elute the FIX polypeptides that were collected as a pool.

The eluted pool was further purified using a Q Sepharose HP column GE Healthcare . The sample was prepared for application by diluting with 2 volumes of Buffer D 25 mM Tris pH 8 0.001 Tween 80 . The diluted sample was loaded onto a Q Sepharose HP column that had been pre equilibrated with Buffer F 25 mM Tris pH 8 1 M NaCl 2.5 mM CaCl 0.001 Tween 80 followed by Buffer E 25 mM Tris pH 8 2.5 mM CaCl 0.001 Tween 80 . After washing with 4 Buffer F 96 Buffer E a gradient from 4 40 Buffer F was applied to the column and fractions were collected. Fractions containing FIX polypeptides were then pooled.

SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Hyperglycosylation was assessed by comparison of the migration pattern of the modified FIX polypeptide with a wild type FIX Benefix Coagulation FIX. Hyperglycosylated forms of the enzyme migrated slower exhibiting a higher apparent molecular weight than the wild type polypeptide. It was observed that the polypeptides containing the E240N mutation which introduces a non native N glycosylation site at position 240 were only partially glycosylated approximately 20 glycosylation . To enrich for the hyperglycosylated form a modification of the purification process described above was performed.

The first step of purification was performed using the Capto Q column as described above. The eluted pool from this column was diluted with 2 volumes of Buffer D as above and the sample was loaded onto a Heparin Sepharose column that had been pre equilibrated with Buffer F as above followed by Buffer E as above . The column was then developed with a gradient from 0 to 70 Buffer F and fractions were collected. The hyperglycosylated form of the E410N variant eluted from the column in approximately 35 Buffer F whereas the non hyperglycosylated form eluted in approximately 50 Buffer F. Each collected pool was further purified on the Q Sepharose HP column as described above. By this method a pool containing approximately 80 hyperglycosylated form of the E410N variant was obtained. The extent of hyperglycosylation was estimated by visual inspection of SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

The concentration of Factor X FX in a stock of FX that can become catalytically active was determined. This stock of FX was then used in subsequent studies to calculate the catalytic activity of FIX variants for FX. Following activation of FX to FXa the active site titration assay was carried out essentially as described by Bock et al. 1989 273 375 388 using the fluorogenic ester substrate fluorescein mono p guanidinobenzoate FMGB with a few minor modifications. FMGB readily reacts with FXa but not FX or inactive protease to form an effectively stable acyl enzyme intermediate under conditions in which the concentration of FMGB is saturating and deacylation is especially slow and rate limiting for catalysis. Under these conditions the FXa protease undergoes a single catalytic turnover to release the fluorescein fluorophore. When the initial burst of fluorescence is calibrated to an external concentration standard curve of fluorescein fluorescence the concentration of active sites can be calculated.

The concentration of FX in a stock solution that is able to become catalytically active was determined by activation of FX samples with Russell s Viper Venom followed by titrating the active FX FXa with FMGB. FX zymogen stocks were first pre treated by the supplier with DFP diisopropylfluorophosphate and EGR cmk to reduce the background FXa activity. FXa activation reactions were prepared with a final concentration of 10 M FX based on the Aabsorbance and an extinction coefficient of 1.16 in a final volume of 50 100 L in a reaction buffer containing 100 mM Tris 50 mM NaCl 5 mM CaCl 0.1 PEG 8000 pH 8.1. Activation was initiated by the addition of Russell s Viper Venom RVV Xase Heamatologic Technologies Inc. to a final concentration of 5 g mL 5 L of a 98 g mL dilution per 100 L reaction or 2.5 L per 50 L reaction at 37 C. for 45 60 min of activation time previously determined to represent complete activation by collecting samples every 15 min and testing the increase in cleavage of Spectrafluor FXa fluorogenic substrate . Reactions were quenched with 1 10 volume of quench buffer containing 100 mM Tris 50 mM NaCl 5 mM 100 mM EDTA 0.1 PEG 8000 pH 8.1.

The active site titration assays were performed with a 1 mL reaction volume in a 0.4 cm 1 cm quartz cuvette under continuous stirring. Reactions contained 100 400 nM of the freshly activated FXa and 5 M FMGB in an assay buffer containing 30 mM Hepes 135 mM NaCl 1 mM EDTA and 0.1 PEG 8000 pH 7.4. FMGB was prepared at a stock concentration of 0.01 M in DMF based on the dry weight and the concentration confirmed by absorbance spectroscopy at 452 nm using an extinction coefficient of 19 498 Mcmin Phosphate Buffered Saline PBS pH 7.2. Assays were initiated by adding 5 L of 1 mM FMGB 5 M final concentration to 1 mL of 1 assay buffer and first measuring the background hydrolysis of FMGB for 150 200 seconds before the addition of FXa to a final concentration of 100 400 nM. The release of fluorescein fluorescence in the burst phase of the reaction was followed for an additional 3600 seconds.

The amount of fluorescein released following catalysis of FMGB by FXa was determined using a standard curve of free fluorescein. The fluorescein standard solution was freshly prepared at a stock concentration of 70 150 mM in DMF and the accurate concentration was confirmed by absorbance spectroscopy under standard conditions at 496 nm using an extinction coefficient of 89 125 Mcmin 0.1 N NaOH. A standard curve of free fluorescein was then prepared by titration of the absorbance calibrated fluorescein standard into 1 assay buffer in 20 nM steps to a final concentration of 260 300 nM.

For data analysis reaction traces were imported into the Graphpad Prism software package and the contribution of background hydrolysis was subtracted from the curve by extrapolation of the initial measured rate of spontaneous FMGB hydrolysis which was typically less than 5 of the total fluorescence burst. The corrected curve was fit to a single exponential equation with a linear component to account for the slow rate of deacylation of the form Fluorescence Amp 1 e Bt where Amp the amplitude of the burst phase under the saturating assay conditions outline above k is the observed first order rate constant for acyl enzyme formation and B is a bulk rate constant associated with complete turnover of FMGB. The concentration of active FXa protease was calculated by comparison of the fit parameter for amplitude to the fluorescein standard curve. The values from multiple assays were measured averaged and the standard deviation determined. The amount of active FXa in the preparation directly represents the concentration of FX in a stock preparation that can be activated by FIXa. This active site titrated value was employed when calculating the concentration of FX to be used in an indirect assay such as the cofactor dependent assay described in Example 4 below.

The concentration of Factor IX FIX in a stock solution of the FIX zymogen that is able to become catalytically active was determined by activation of FIX samples including FIX variants with Factor XIa FXIa Heamatologic Technologies Inc. followed by titrating the active Factor IX FIXa with 4 methylumbelliferyl p guanidinobenzoate MUGB .

Total protein concentrations in the FIX polypeptide preparations were determined by the Aabsorbance using an extinction coefficient unique for each variant i.e. number of Tyr residues 1490 number Trp residues 5500 number Cys residues 125 . Activation reactions of FIX to FIXa were prepared at a final concentration of 10 M FIX in a final volume of 200 500 L in a reaction buffer containing 100 mM Tris 50 mM NaCl 5 mM CaCl 0.1 PEG 8000 pH 8.1. Activations were initiated by the addition of FXIa or biotinylated FXIa to a final concentration of 20 nM at 37 C. for 60 min of activation time. A 60 minute activation time was previously determined to represent complete activation by collecting samples every 15 min and assaying for total cleavage by SDS PAGE.

The free FXIa or biotinylated FXIa used in the activation reaction was then removed from the samples using one of two methods that produce equivalent results each removing greater than 95 97 of the catalytic FXIa. In the first method which was used to remove free FXIa activation reactions initiated with FXIa were mixed with an anti FXIa monoclonal antibody Abcam 20377 to a final concentration of 50 nM for 60 min at 37 C. Antibody capture of free FXIa was followed by the addition of washed protein G Dynal Beads 30 mg mL Invitrogen to a final concentration of 25 vol vol for an additional 120 min at room temperature. The Dynal Beads were removed from the solution per the manufacturer s instructions. In the second method which was used to removed biotinylated FXIa activation reactions using biotinylated FXIa were mixed with Streptavidin Dynal Beads 10 mg mL Invitrogen to a final concentration of 10 vol vol for 60 min at room temperature. The Dynal Beads were then removed per the manufacturer s instructions. Following removal of the FXIa the total protein concentrations of activated FIXa samples were determined by Aabsorbance using an extinction coefficient unique for each variant as described above .

The concentration of catalytically active FIXa in an activated stock solution was determined by titrating the FIXa samples with a fluorogenic ester substrate 4 methylumbelliferyl p guanidinobenzoate MUGB . The principle titration assay was carried out essentially as described by Payne et al. 1996 35 7100 7106 with a few minor modifications to account for the slower reactivity of MUGB with FIXa. MUGB readily reacts with FIXa but not FIX or inactive protease to form an effectively stable acyl enzyme intermediate under conditions in which the concentration of MUGB is saturating and deacylation is especially slow and rate limiting for catalysis. Under these conditions the FIXa protease undergoes a single catalytic turnover to release the 4 methylumbelliferone fluorophore 4 MU . When the initial burst of fluorescence is calibrated to an external concentration standard curve of 4 MU fluorescence the concentration of active sites can be calculated.

Assays were performed with a 1 mL reaction volume in a 0.4 cm 1 cm quartz cuvette under continuous stirring with an assay buffer containing 50 mM Hepes 100 mM NaCl 5 mM CaCland 0.1 PEG 8000 pH 7.6. MUGB was prepared at a stock concentration of 0.04 M in DMSO based on the dry weight and diluted to a working concentration of 2 mM in DMSO. Titration assays were initiated by adding 4 L of 2 mM MUGB to a final concentration of 8 M in 1 assay buffer and first measuring the background hydrolysis of MUGB for 200 300 seconds before the addition of the FIXa or FIXa variant to a final concentration of 100 200 nM based on the total protein concentration determined for the activation reaction after removal of FXIa. The release of 4 MU fluorescence in the burst phase of the reaction was followed for a total of 2 hours in order to acquire sufficient data from the initial burst and subsequent steady state phases.

The amount of 4 MU released following catalysis of MUGB by FIXa was determined using a standard curve of 4 MU. A 4 MU standard solution was prepared at a stock concentration of 0.5 M in DMSO and the concentration confirmed by absorbance spectroscopy at 360 nm using an extinction coefficient of 19 000 Mcmin 50 mM Tris buffer pH 9.0. The standard curve of free 4 MU was prepared by titration of the absorbance calibrated 4 MU into 1 assay buffer in 20 nM steps to a final concentration of 260 300 nM 4 MU.

For data analysis reaction traces were imported into the Graphpad Prism software package and the contribution of background hydrolysis was subtracted from the curve by extrapolation of the initial measured rate of spontaneous MUGB hydrolysis which was typically less than 5 of the total fluorescence burst. The corrected curve was fit to a single exponential equation with a linear component to account for the slow rate of deacylation in the steady state phase of the form Fluorescence Amp 1 e Bt where Amp the amplitude of the burst phase under the saturating assay conditions outline above k is the observed first order rate constant for acyl enzyme formation and B is a bulk rate constant associated with complete turnover of MUGB. The concentration of active FIXa protease is calculated by comparison of the fit parameter for amplitude to the 4 MU standard curve. The values from multiple assays were measured averaged and the standard deviation determined. The concentration of FIX zymogen which may become activated in a stock solution was then determined by multiplying the Adetermined total concentration of the FIX zymogen by the experimentally determined fraction active value for the fully activated sample concentration of active FIXa total concentration of FIXa .

The catalytic activity of the FIXa variants for the substrate Factor X FX was assessed indirectly in a fluorogenic assay by assaying for the activity of FXa generated upon activation by FIXa on the synthetic substrate Spectrafluor FXa. A range of FX concentrations were used to calculate the kinetic rate constants where the substrate protease FX was in excess by at least a 1000 fold over the concentration of the activating protease FIXa . Briefly activated and active site titrated FIXa was incubated in a calcium containing buffer with recombinant FVIII phospholipid vesicles and alpha thrombin to activate FVIII to FVIIIa forming the tenase Xase complex. The activity of alpha thrombin was then quenched by the addition of a highly specific thrombin inhibitor hirudin prior to initiating the assay. FIXa variants as part of the Xase complex were subsequently mixed with various concentrations of FX and the fluorescent substrate Spectrafluor FXa CHSO D CHA Gly Arg AMC to initiate the assay. The release of the free fluorophore AMC 7 amino 4 methylcoumarin following catalysis of Spectrafluor FXa by FXa was then assessed continuously over a time period and the kinetic rate constants of the FIXa variants determined

For assays evaluating the kinetic rate of FX activation by FIXa in the presence of FVIIIa and phospholipids recombinant FVIII Kogenate FS Bayer healthcare was first resuspended in 5 mL of the provided diluent according to the manufacturer s instructions. The molar concentration of FVIII was then determined by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1.567 mgmL cmand a molecular weight of 163.6 kDa. The FIX variants were expressed purified activated and active site titrated as described in Examples 1 3 above. FIXa variants were then serially diluted to a concentration of 16 pM in a 200 L volume of 1 Buffer A 20 mM Hepes 150 mM NaCl 5 mM CaCl 0.1 BSA 0.1 PEG 8000 pH 7.4 . In preparation for activation of FVIII to FVIIIa in the presence of FIXa and phospholipids alpha thrombin Heamatologic Technologies Inc. and hirudin American Diagnostica were each diluted in a 1.0 mL volume of 1 Buffer A to 64 nM and 640 nM respectively. Reconstituted FVIII was further diluted to a concentration of 267 nM in a 10 mL volume of 1 Buffer A containing 267 M freshly resuspended phospholipids 75 phosphatidylcholine PC 25 phospatidylserine PS PS PC vesicles 120 nm in diameter Avanti Polar Lipids . FVIII was activated to FVIIIa by mixing 600 L of the above FVIII PC PS solution with 100 L of the 16 pM wild type FIXa or FIXa variant dilution and 50 L of the 64 nM alpha thrombin solution followed by 15 minutes of incubation at 25 C. Activation reactions were subsequently quenched by the addition of 50 L of the above 640 nM hirudin solution for 5 min at 25 C. prior to initiating the kinetic assay for FX activation. The final concentration of reagents in the 800 L Xase complex solutions was as follows 2 pM FIXa variant 200 nM FVIIIa 200 PC PS vesicles 4 nM alpha thrombin inhibited and 40 nM hirudin.

A total of 25 L of each Xase complex solution FIXa FVIIIa Phospholipids Ca was aliquoted into a 96 well half area black assay plate according to a predefined plate map 4 FIXa variants plate . A solution of 900 nM active site titrated and DFP EGR cmk treated FX see Example 2 above was prepared in 5.6 mL of 1 Buffer A containing 1.0 mM Spectrafluor Xa substrate. This represented the highest concentration of FX tested and a sufficient volume for 4 assays. The FX Spectrafluor Xa solution was then serially diluted 1.8 fold in an 8 channel deep well polypropylene plate with a final volume of 2.5 mL 1 Buffer A that contains 1.0 mM Spectrafluor Xa resulting in final dilutions of 900 nM 500 nM 277.8 nM 154.3 nM 85.7 nM 47.6 nM 25.6 nM and 0 nM FX. Alternatively in some assays the the FX Specrafluor Xa solution was then serially diluted 1.5 fold in a 12 channel deep well polypropylene plate with a final volume of 2.5 mL 1 Buffer A that contains 1.0 mM Spectrafluor Xa resulting in final dilutions of 900 nM 600 nM 400 nM 266.7 nM 177.8 nM 118.5 nM 79.0 nM 52.7 nM 35.1 nM 23.4 nM 15.6 nM and 0 nM FX. Assay reactions were typically initiated using a BioMek FX liquid handling system programmed to dispense 25 L of the FX Spectrafluor Xa dilutions into 4 assay plates containing 25 L of each FIXa variant Xase complex . The final concentrations of the reagents in the assay were as follows 1 pM FIXa 100 nM FVIIIa 100 M PC PS vesicles 0.5 mM Spectrafluor Xa 2 nM alpha thrombin inhibited 20 nM hirudin and FX dilutions of 0 nM to 450 nM. Reactions were monitored in a SpectraMax fluorescence plate reader for 30 min at 37 C. A standard curve of free AMC served as the conversion factor for RFU to M in the subsequent data analysis calculations using a dose range that covered 0 M to 100 M AMC.

All equations used to determine the steady state kinetics of the catalysis of FX by FIXa are based on those described in the reference Zymogen Activation Kinetics Modulatory effects of trans 4 aminomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylic acid and poly D lysine on plasminogen activation in Petersen et al. 1985 Biochem. J. 225 149 158. The theory for the steady state kinetics of the system described by Scheme A see below is described by the expression of equation 1 that represents a parabolic accumulation of product.

According to the mechanism of Scheme A ais the concentration of activating protease FIXa zis the concentration of zymogen FX kand Krepresent the kand Kfor the activator catalyzed conversion of zymogen to active enzyme FXa whereas kand Krepresent the kand Kfor conversion of substrate to product by FXa over a given time t 

To determine the degree of FIXa catalytic activity raw data collected with the SoftMax Pro application Molecular Devices were exported as .XML files or .TXT files. Further non linear data analyses were performed with XLfit4 a software package for automated curve fitting and statistical analysis within the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet environment IDBS Software or directly within the ActivityBase software package using the XE Runner data analysis module IDBS Software . The spreadsheet template was set up to automatically fit the parabolic reaction velocities M sec of the tested FIXa variants at each FX concentration to the function of a standard rectangular hyperbola i.e. Michaelis Menten equation given by equation 4 to yield the fit values for Vand K.

Tables 14 19 set forth the catalytic activity for each of the FIXa variants assayed. Also assayed were recombinant wild type FIXa termed Catalyst Biosciences WT generated as described above in Example 1 plasma purified FIXa Haematologic Technologies Inc. and BeneFIX Coagulation Factor IX Recombinant Wyeth . Tables 14 15 present the results expressed as the kinetic constant for catalytic activity k K Ms and also as the percentage of the activity of the wild type FIXa wherein the activity is catalytic activity k K Ms of each FIXa variant for its substrate FX. The individual rate constants kand Kare provided in Tables 16 17 and 18 19 respectively. Tables 15 17 and 19 reflect data for additional FIXa variants and provide new overall averages calculated to include additional experimental replicates n for FIXa variants in Tables 14 16 and 18. Where the activity of the FIXa variant was compared to wild type FIXa it was compared to a recombinant wild type FIXa polypeptide that was expressed and purified using the same conditions as used for the variant FIXa polypeptides to ensure that any differences in activity were the result of the mutation s and not the result of differences in for example post translational modifications associated with different expression systems. Thus the wild type FIXa polypeptide used for comparison was the recombinant wild type FIXa generated from cloning the FIX gene set forth in SEQ ID NO 1 and expressed from CHOX cells as a polypeptide with an amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 as described in Example 1 i.e. Catalyst Biosciences WT FIX polypeptide . The standard deviation S.D. coefficient of variation as a percentage CV and the number of assays performed n also are provided for each kinetic parameter.

The observed catalytic activities of the FIXa variants ranged from no detectable Xase activity in a few variants e.g. FIXa F314N H315S FIXa G317N FIXa R318N A320S and FIXa K400E R403E to a greater than 10 fold increase in k Kfor the activation of FX compared to wild type FIXa. Some of the variants displayed markedly increased catalytic activity compared to the wild type FIXa including FIXa R338E FIXa R338A FIXa T343R FIXa E410N and combinations thereof such as FIXa R318Y R338E E410N FIXa R318Y R338E R402E E410N FIXa R318Y R338E T343R R402E E410N FIXa R318Y R338E T343R E410N and FIXa R338E T343R displayed some of the greatest increases in catalytic activity. Although several FIXa variants with single or multiple additional glycosylation sites demonstrated close to wild type activity e.g. FIXa I251S FIXa D85N I251S FIXa K63N FIXa K247N N249S and FIXa K63N K247N N249S or improved activity when combined with other mutations e.g. FIXa K247N N249S R338E T343R R403E and FIXa K247N N249S R318Y R338E T343R R403E E410N others showed reduced catalytic activity. The augmented catalytic activity was due to improvements in kor Kor most often both parameters.

Inhibition of wild type FIXa or FIXa variants by the Antithrombin heparin complex AT III heparin was assessed by measuring the level of inhibition by various concentrations of AT III heparin on the catalytic activity of FIXa towards a small molecule substrate Mesyl D CHG Gly Arg AMC Pefafluor FIXa Pentapharm . A Kvalue is determined for each FIXa variant tested which corresponds to the molar concentration of AT III that was required for 50 inhibition IC of the catalytic activity of a FIXa variant under the predefined conditions of the assay Inhibition reactions were performed in the presence of low molecular weight heparin LMWH Calbiochem or full length unfractionated heparin UFH Calbiochem the latter requiring modified protocol conditions to account for an increase in the rate of inhibition. The apparent second order rate constant k for the inhibition of wild type FIXa or FIXa variants by the AT III UFH complex was also directly evaluated using a modified protocol in which the time of incubation with the AT III UFH complex was varied.

For inhibition reactions in the presence of LMWH a 200 nM solution of AT III LMWH final 2 M LMWH was prepared by dilution of a 20 M stock of plasma purified human AT III Molecular Innovations into a solution of 2 M LMWH in a 1.2 mL volume of 1 Buffer A 50 mM Tris 100 mM NaCl 10 mM CaCl 0.01 Tween 20 pH 7.4 . This solution of AT III LMWH was for use as the highest concentration in the assay. AT III LMWH solutions were incubated for at least 30 minutes at room temperature and then serially diluted 1.5 fold in a 96 deep well polypropylene plate with a final volume of 400 L 1 Buffer A that contained 2 M LMWH resulting in dilutions of 200 nM 133.3 nM 88.9 nM 59.3 nM 39.5 nM 26.3 nM 17.6 nM and 0 nM i.e. rows A H . A total of 25 L was aliquoted into their respective rows of a 96 well V bottom storage plate to fill all columns i.e. 1 12 . FIXa variants were initially diluted to 100 nM in 1 Buffer A. Subsequently 36 L of each 100 nM FIXa variant was diluted to a concentration of 1.8 nM in 2.0 mL of 1 Buffer A and then 60 L of this solution was aliquoted into a 96 well V bottom storage plate according to a predefined plate map 4 FIXa variants per plate .

Assay reactions were initiated using a BioMek FX liquid handling system programmed to dispense 25 L of the FIXa solutions into the plates containing 25 L of each dilution of AT III LMWH per well for a total of two duplicate assay plates for each FIXa variant. The final inhibition assay conditions were 0.9 nM FIXa and AT III dilutions ranging from 0 to 100 nM in 1 M LMWH Inhibition reactions were further incubated for 1 minute at room temperature 25 C. before a 25 L aliquot of the reaction was transferred by the BioMek FX to a 96 well black half area plate containing 25 L of 1.6 mM Mesyl D CHG Gly Arg AMC per well in assay Buffer B 50 mM Tris 100 mM NaCl 10 mM CaCl 0.01 Tween 20 pH 7.4 60 ethylene glycol . Polybrene hexadimethrine bromide at a final concentration of 5 mg mL was added in Buffer B to quench the AT III LMWH reaction. Residual activity of FIXa was assessed by following the initial rates of substrate cleavage for 60 minutes in a fluorescence reader set to 25 C. The final assay conditions for determination of residual activity are 0.45 nM FIXa variant 0.8 mM Mesyl D CHG Gly Arg AMC 30 ethylene glycol and 5 mg mL polybrene in 50 mM Tris 100 mM NaCl 10 mM CaCl 0.01 Tween 20 pH 7.4.

To determine the degree of inhibition by AT III LMWH for FIXa or FIXa variants raw data collected with the SoftMax Pro application Molecular Devices were exported as .XML files. Further non linear data analyses were performed with XLfit4 a software package for automated curve fitting and statistical analysis within the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet environment IDBS Software or directly within the ActivityBase software package using the XE Runner data analysis module IDBS Software . The template was used to calculate the AT III dilution series ratio of AT III to FIXa and the Vi Vo ratios for each FIXa replicate at each experimental AT III concentration. The spreadsheet template was used to calculate the AT III dilution series ratio of AT III to FIXa and the Vi Vo ratios for each FIXa replicate at each experimental AT III concentration. Non linear regression analyses of residual FIXa activity expressed as Vi Vo versus AT III concentration was processed using XLfit4 and a hyperbolic inhibition equation of the form C Amp 1 X K X where C the offset fixed at 0 to permit extrapolation of data sets that did not reach 100 inhibition during the course of the assay Amp the amplitude of the fit and K which corresponds to the concentration of AT III required for half maximal inhibition under the assay conditions. For several FIXa variants AT III LMWH inhibited less than 10 15 of the total protease activity at the highest tested concentration of AT III representing an upper limit of detection for the assay under standard screening conditions. Variants with less than 10 maximal inhibition were therefore assigned a lower limit Kvalue of 999 nM and in most cases are expected to have AT III resistances much greater than the reported value.

Table 20 provides the results of the assays that were performed using AT III LMWH. The results are presented both as the fitted Kparameter and as a representation of the extent of AT III resistance for each variant compared to the wild type FIXa expressed as a ratio of their fitted Kvalues Kvariant Kwild type . Where the Kparameter of the FIXa variant was compared to wild type FIXa it was compared to a recombinant wild type FIXa polypeptide that was expressed and purified using the same conditions as used for the variant FIXa polypeptides to ensure that any differences in activity were the result of the mutation s and not the result of differences in for example post translational modifications associated with different expression systems. Thus the wild type FIXa polypeptide used for comparison was the recombinant wild type FIXa generated from cloning the FIX gene set forth in SEQ ID NO 1 and expressed from CHOX cells as a polypeptide with an amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 as described in Example 1 i.e. Catalyst Biosciences WT FIX polypeptide . Several FIXa variants exhibited greater than 20 fold increased resistance to AT III compared to wild type FIXa Catalyst Biosciences WT FIXa . For example FIXa R318A R403A FIXa R318E R340E FIXa R318A FIXa R318E FIXa K400E FIXa R338E R403E and FIXa K400A R403A are among the group that exhibited significant resistance to AT III.

Additional experiments were performed to assess the inhibition of FIXa variants by AT III UFH unfractionated full length heparin using the same assay as described above with minor modifications. Full length unfractionated heparin Calbiochem was used instead of low molecular weight heparin LMWH to observe the effects of FIXa variant mutations on the increased rate of the inhibition reaction due to the templating effect provided by longer heparin chains see e.g. Olson et al. 2004 Thromb Haemost 92 5 929 939 .

For inhibition reactions in the presence of UFH a 70 nM 600 nM 2000 nM 6000 or 10000 nM solutions of AT III UFH final 1 M UFH were prepared by dilution of a 20 M stock of plasma purified human AT III Molecular Innovations into a solution of excess UFH 2 to 20 M in a 1.4 mL volume of 1 Buffer A 50 mM Tris 100 mM NaCl 10 mM CaCl 0.01 Tween 20 pH 7.4 . AT III UFH solutions were also incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature before being serially diluted 1.5 fold in a 96 deep well polypropylene plate with a final volume of 460 L 1 Buffer A containing 1 M UFH. The final dilutions of AT III for the modified assay were dependent on the starting concentration of AT III and ranged from 70 nM 0 nM 600 nM 0 nM 100 nM 0 nM or 5000 nM 0 nM i.e. rows A H . Those variants which showed increased resistance to AT III inhibition under the standard conditions were further tested using higher concentrations of AT III. A total of 35 L of each AT III dilution was aliquoted into their respective rows of a 96 well V bottom storage plate to fill all columns i.e. 1 12 . FIXa variants were initially diluted to 100 nM in 1 Buffer A. Subsequently 15 L of each 100 nM FIXa variant was diluted to a concentration of 0.6 nM in 2.0 mL of 1 Buffer A and then 70 L of this solution was aliquoted into a 96 well V bottom storage plate according to the same predefined plate map 4 FIXa variants per plate .

Assay reactions were initiated using a BioMek FX liquid handling system programmed to dispense 35 L of the FIXa solutions into the plates containing 35 L of each dilution of AT III heparin per well for a total of two duplicate assay plates for each FIXa variant. The final inhibition assay conditions were 0.3 nM FIXa and AT III dilutions ranging from 35 nM to 0 nM 300 nM to 0 nM 1000 nM to 0 nM 3000 nM to 0 nM or 5000 nM to 0 nM in UFH ranging from 1 M to 10 M depending of the highest AT III concentration so that the heparin remained in excess Inhibition reactions were further incubated for 10 seconds at room temperature 25 C. before a 40 L aliquot of the reaction was transferred by the BioMek FX to a 96 well black half area plate containing 20 L of 2.5 mM Mesyl D CHG Gly Arg AMC per well in assay Buffer C 50 mM Tris 100 mM NaCl 10 mM CaCl 0.01 Tween 20 pH 7.4 82 ethylene glycol and 5 mg mL polybrene . Polybrene hexadimethrine bromide at a final concentration of 5 mg mL was added to Buffer C to quench the AT III UFH reaction. Residual activity of FIXa was assessed by following the initial rates of substrate cleavage for 60 minutes in a fluorescence reader set to 25 C. The final assay conditions for determination of residual activity were 0.2 nM FIXa variant 0.83 mM Mesyl D CHG Gly Arg AMC 30 ethylene glycol and 5 mg mL polybrene in 50 mM Tris 100 mM NaCl 10 mM CaCl 0.01 Tween 20 pH 7.4. Data analyses were performed as described above for AT III LMWH inhibition assays.

As found with LMWH AT III UFH inhibited less than 10 15 of the of the total protease activity for a number of FIXa variants at the highest tested concentrations of AT III thus representing an upper limit of detection for the assay under standard screening conditions. These variants with less than 10 maximal inhibition were therefore assigned a lower limit Kvalue of 999 nM and in most cases are expected to have AT III resistances much greater than the reported value. Several FIXa variants that were initially given a Kvalue of 999 nM were retested at higher AT III concentrations expanding the sensitivity of the assay and providing clear levels of AT III resistance. If these variants still maintained less than 10 maximal inhibition at the highest test AT III concentrations 1000 nM to 5000 nM a lower limit Kvalue of 9999 nM was assigned thus these variants are expected to have AT III resistances much greater than the reported value.

Tables 21 22 provide the results of the assays that were performed using AT III UFH. Table 22 reflects data for additional FIXa variants and provides new overall averages calculated to include additional experimental replicates n for FIXa variants in Table 21. The results are presented both as the fitted Kparameter and as a representation of the extent of AT III resistance for each variant compared to the wild type FIXa expressed as a ratio of their fitted Kvalues Kvariant Kwild type . Several FIXa variants exhibited greater than 100 to 500 fold increased resistance to AT III compared to wild type FIXa. For example FIXa R318A R403A FIXa R318A FIXa R318Y FIXa R338A R403A FIXa D203N F205T R318Y FIXa R318Y R338E R403E FIXa R318Y R338E R403E FIXa R318Y R338E E410N R318Y R338E T343R N346Y R403E E410N and FIXa R318Y R403E E410N are among this group which exhibited significant resistance to AT III.

Additional experiments were performed to measure the second order rate constant for inhibition k of FIXa variants by AT III UFH using the same assay as described above in Example 5B with minor modifications. This method is more amenable to evaluating the second order rate constants for multiple variants concurrently than the traditional competitive kinetic or discontinuous methods see e.g. Olson et al. 2004 92 5 929 939 .

For inhibition reactions in the presence of UFH a 1000 nM solution of AT III UFH were prepared by dilution of a 20 M stock of plasma purified human AT III Molecular Innovations into a solution of excess UFH 2 M in a 1.0 mL volume of 1 Buffer A 50 mM Tris 100 mM NaCl 10 mM CaCl 0.01 Tween 20 pH 7.4 . AT III UFH solutions were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature prior to being serially diluted 2.0 fold in a 96 deep well polypropylene plate with a final volume of 500 L 1 Buffer A containing 2 M UFH. The final dilutions of AT III for the modified kassay ranged from 500 nM 0 nM i.e. rows A H . A total of 35 L of each AT III dilution was aliquoted into their respective rows of a 96 well V bottom storage plate to fill all columns i.e. 1 12 . FIXa variants were initially diluted to 100 nM in 1 Buffer A. Subsequently 50 L of each 100 nM FIXa variant was diluted to a concentration of 2.0 nM in 2.5 mL of 1 Buffer A and then 70 L of this solution was aliquoted into a 96 well V bottom storage plate according to the same predefined plate map as above 4 FIXa variants per plate .

Assay reactions were initiated using a BioMek FX liquid handling system programmed to dispense 35 L of the FIXa solutions into the plates containing 35 L of each dilution of AT III UFH per well for a total of two duplicate assay plates for each FIXa variant. The final inhibition assay conditions were 1.0 nM FIXa and AT III dilutions ranging from 500 nM to 0 nM in 1 M UFH so that the heparin remained in excess Inhibition reactions were further incubated for various times at room temperature 25 C. depending on the expected inhibition rate constant and adjusted so that 90 inhibition could be reached at the highest concentration of AT III in the assay 500 nM . Typical incubation times were determined specifically for each variant or class of variants but generally followed the incubation times outlined in Table 23.

Following the desired incubation time a 40 L aliquot of the reaction was transferred by the BioMek FX to a 96 well black half area plate containing 20 L of 2.5 mM Mesyl D CHG Gly Arg AMC per well in assay Buffer C 50 mM Tris 100 mM NaCl 10 mM CaCl 0.01 Tween 20 pH 7.4 82 ethylene glycol and 5 mg mL polybrene . Polybrene hexadimethrine bromide at a final concentration of 5 mg mL was added to Buffer C to quench the AT III UFH reaction. Residual activity of FIXa was assessed by following the initial rates of substrate cleavage for 60 minutes in a fluorescence reader set to 25 C. The final assay conditions for determination of residual activity were 0.67 nM FIXa variant 0.83 mM Mesyl D CHG Gly Arg AMC 30 ethylene glycol and 5 mg mL polybrene in 50 mM Tris 100 mM NaCl 10 mM CaCl 0.01 Tween 20 pH 7.4. Data analyses to calculate the Kvalue were performed in a similar manner as that described above for AT III UFH inhibition assays in Example B using the ActivityBase software package and the XE Runner data analysis module IDBS Software . Using the assay set up outlined in Example 5B under psuedo 1st order conditions and testing various incubation times it is thus possible to calculate the apparent second order rate constant for inhibition by AT III k using the following equations 

Given that the fit value for K AT III at t defined by the time of the assay all the necessary values are available to calculate kand thus the kfor inhibition of a given FIXa variant by AT III. The calculated kvalue does not take into account any potential effects of changes in the stoichiometry of inhibition S.I. which is given a constant value of 1.2 in the present calculations as this value reflects what is typically reported in the literature see e.g. Olson et al. 2004 92 5 929 939 .

Table 24 provides the results of the second order rate assays that were performed using AT III UFH. The results are presented both as the fitted kparameter and as a representation of the extent of AT III resistance for each variant compared to the wild type FIXa expressed as a ratio of their fitted kvalues kwild type kvariant . Several FIXa variants exhibited greater than 10 000 20 000 fold increased resistance to AT III compared to wild type FIXa. For example FIXa R318A FIXa R318Y FIXa R338A R403A FIXa R318Y R338E R403E FIXa R318Y R338E R403E FIXa K247N N249S R318Y R338E R403E FIXa R318Y R338E R403E FIXa K228N I251S R318Y R338E R403E E410N FIXa R318Y R338E E410N and FIXa R318Y R338E R403E E410N are among this group which exhibited significant resistance to AT III.

The pharmacokinetic PK and pharmacodynamic PD properties of the FIXa variant polypeptides were assessed by measuring the amount of variant FIX in mouse plasma at various timepoints following intravenous administration. Two assays were used to quantify FIXa in plasma. An ELISA was used to quantify total FIX protein in mouse plasma to assess the pharmacokinetic properties and a FIX dependant clotting assay activated partial thromboplastin time aPTT assay using FIX depleted plasma was used to quantify the coagulant activity of the FIX polypeptides in plasma thus assessing the pharmacodynamic properties.

Male CD 1 mice 30 40 gm supplied by Charles River Laboratories Hollister Calif. were quarantined for at least 3 days before treatment. For serial PK studies male CD 1 mice 30 37 gm were fitted with an indwelling jugular vein cannula. Filtered tap water and food was available ad libitum prior to use in PD or PK experiments.

Mice N 3 per time point were administered the FIX polypeptides intravenously 1.4 mg kg for PK studies and 400 IU kg for PD studies dose volume 2 ml kg via the tail vein. At the appropriate time after dosing animals were anesthetized and blood was drawn 0.5 1 mL using terminal cardiac puncture into syringes containing citrate. In some experiments where insufficient amount of protein was available a total of only 4 6 animals were used for serial bleeding at staggered time points two mice were used for each full time course in order to collect all time points without removing excess blood volume. Blood was sampled in restrained conscious animals by first removing a small amount of blood into a 0.1 mL syringe containing 0.9 saline. A syringe containing 4.5 l of 0.1M sodium citrate was then attached and 0.05 mL blood was withdrawn into the syringe and the blood was transferred to a 1.5 mL tube. The initial syringe was reattached and 0.07 mL of saline pushed back through the cannula. The cannula was capped until the next time point when the process was repeated. For all studies blood samples were centrifuged within 15 minutes of collection 9000 rpm 8 minutes 4 C. and the plasma removed and immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored frozen 70 C. pending analysis.

Citrated blood samples were collected at various times up to 1440 min post dose i.e. Predose 2 4 10 30 60 120 240 360 480 960 and 1440 min by cardiac puncture for terminal experiments or indwelling catheter for serial experiments. Plasma concentrations of rFIX were determined using a factor IX specific ELISA utilizing a matched pair of detection and capture antibodies FIX EIA Affinity Biologicals Ancaster ON . Briefly an affinity purified polyclonal antibody to FIX is coated onto the wells of a plate. The plates are washed and plasma samples containing FIX are applied. Plasma samples are diluted 1 750 and 1 1500 on the plate. After washing the plate to remove unbound material a peroxidase conjugated detection antibody to FIX is added to the plate to bind to the captured FIX. After washing the plate to remove unbound conjugated antibody the peroxidase activity is expressed by incubation with chemiluminescent substrate and read at 425 nM on an EnVision plate reader. The standard curve is linear over the entire concentration range and spans the concentrations of 0.82 pg ml to 30 ng ml. The FIX variant itself is used for the standard curve to eliminate differences in the antibody affinity. Each sample is measured on two separate assay plates and those measurements within the range of the standard curve are used to calculate the concentration of FIX variants in the plasma sample.

The plasma pharmacodynamic activity of rFIX was quantified using an activated partial thromboplastin time aPTT assay and FIX deficient human plasma STACLOT C.K. PREST kit Diagnostica Stago Asnieres France per the manufacturer s instructions. Briefly the aPTT assay involves the recalcification of plasma in the presence of cephalin platelet substitute and activator koalin . Using FIX deficient human plasma the aPTT assay is specific for FIX. The aPTT assay was performed as described in the manufacturers product insert. Briefly citrated blood samples were collected at the same time points described for PK assessment. Plasma samples were diluted 1 100 in Tris buffered saline containing 0.1 bovine serum albumin Probumin Millipore Billerica Mass. . Diluted plasma or standard was combined with FIX deficient human plasma and cephalin kaolin reagent and incubated for 180 seconds. Coagulation was initiated by the addition of calcium CaCl . Coagulation time in seconds was measured using an STArt4 instrument Diagnostica Stago Asni res France . Using a standard curve made from known concentrations of rFIX plasma FIX concentrations were interpolated from the log concentration VS. log time standard curve plot and then background FIX activity from pre dose animals was subtracted. The lower limit of quantification for factor IX activity was 10 ng mL.

PD aPTT and PK ELISA parameters from mouse studies with rFIX variants were calculated using non compartmental analysis in WinNonLin v5.1 Pharsight Corp. Mountain View Calif. . Both the PD and PK of rFIX variants followed apparent biexponential plasma decay. Select parameters for each variant tested are provided in Table 25 for PD using the aPTT assay and Tables 26 27 for PK using the ELISA assay . Table 26 reflects data for additional FIXa variants and provide new overall averages calculated to include additional experimental replicates n for FIXa variants in Table 26. The PD parameters included half life terminal min MRT MRT min Area under the curve AUC 0 last min g mL Dose mg kg Maximal concentration C g mL Dose g kg Vd mL kg and Clearance Cl mL min kg .

Mouse models of hemophilia B using mice deficient in FIX FIXmice were established to assess the procoagulant activity of FIX polypeptides. The mice were treated with FIX polypeptide and the amount of blood lost in 20 minutes was measured to determine the procoagulant activity of the FIX polypeptides.

Male FIXmice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal administration of a ketamine xylazine cocktail 45 mg ml and 3.6 mg ml in saline and placed on a heated platform 39 C. to ensure there was no drop in body temperature. The procedure room was kept at a temperature of 82 F. Ten minutes prior to tail cut the tail was immersed in 10 mL of pre warmed PBS 15 mL centrifuge tube 39 C. . Seven to fifteen mice were injected with recombinant human FIX Benefix Coagulation Factor IX Recombinant Wyeth or modified FIX polypeptides diluted in a buffer that was the same as that of Benefix Coagulation Factor IX Recombinant 0.234 sodium chloride 8 mM L histidine 0.8 sucrose 208 mM glycine 0.004 polysorbate 80 via the tail vein in a single injection. A negative control group of mice received buffer only. In instances where the injection was missed the animal was excluded from the study.

Injection with FIX polypeptide or buffer was made 5 minutes prior to tail cut. The tail cut was made using a razor blade 5 mm from the end of the tail and blood was collected into PBS for a period of 20 minutes. At the end of the collection period total blood loss was assessed. The collection tubes were mixed and a 1 ml aliquot of each sample was taken and assayed for hemoglobin content. Triton X 100 was diluted 1 in 4 in sterile water and 100 L was added to the 1 mL samples to cause hemolysis. The absorbance of the samples was then measured at a wavelength of 546 nm To calculate the amount of blood lost the absorbance was read against a standard curve generated by measuring the absorbance at 546 nm of known volumes of murine blood diluted in PBS and hemolyzed as above with Triton X 100. Values are expressed as Mean SEM.

Dose response studies to assess the coagulant activity of Benefix Coagulation Factor IX Recombinant at 0.03 0.1 0.3 and 1 mg kg in FIX mice were performed. In this experiment the blood loss in the buffer only group was 835.42 24.55 l which was significantly reduced by Benefix Coagulation Factor IX Recombinant treatment at 0.1 0.3 and 1 mg kg to 558.59 56.63 L 415.81 66.72 L and 270.75 57.48 L p

Dose response studies were conducted in which the coagulant activity of FIXa R318Y R338E R403E E410N R150Y R170E R233E E240N by chymotrypsin numbering FIXa R318Y R338E E410N R150Y R170E E240N by chymotrypsin numbering and FIXa Y155F K247N N249S R318Y R338E R403E E410N Y 155 F K82N N84S R150Y R170E R233E E240N by chymotrypsin numbering at different doses were assessed.

Treatment with FIXa R318Y R338E R403E E410N resulted in significant inhibition of blood loss at 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 and 1 mg kg 434.65 73.75 L 497.28 50.92 L 230.81 39.67 L 261.94 58.79 L and 251.56 41.81 L respectively compared to the buffer only control 811.45 26.63 L p

Treatment with FIXa R318Y R338E E410N also resulted in significant inhibition of blood loss at 0.03 0.1 0.3 and 1 mg kg 571.67 50.45 L 425.42 43.65 L 263.47 42.66 L and 78.19 13.42 L respectively compared to the buffer only control 845.14 23.63 L p

Treatment with FIXa Y155F K247N N249S R318Y R338E R403E E410N resulted in the most significant inhibition of blood loss of the mutants tested 460.03 74.60 L 393.48 75.16 L and 157.28 28.89 L at 0.01 0.03 and 0.1 mg kg respectively compared to the buffer only control 851.38 44.25 L p

Studies were performed to assess the duration of effect of Benefix Coagulation Factor IX Recombinant at 0.5 mg kg in FIXmice. Mice were dosed intravenously at 48 hr 24 hr 16 hr 8 hr 4 hr 2 hr 30 min and 5 min prior to tail cut. In this experiment inhibition from the control group was determined where the control group was set at 0 inhibition. Inhibition of blood loss was 59.7 11.9 48.25 12.84 57.74 9.10 56.04 8.46 32.09 7.92 12.94 7.33 38.75 11.47 and 0.64 11.3 at 5 min 30 min 2 4 8 16 24 and 48 hr respectively from vehicle control Mean and SEM n 8 33 mice from 3 experiments .

Studies were performed to assess the duration of effect of FIXa R318Y R338E R403E E410N at 0.5 mg kg in FIXmice. Mice were dosed i.v. at 96 hr 72 hr 48 hr 32 hr 24 hr 16 hr 8 hr 4 hr 2 hr 30 min and 5 min prior to tail cut. In this experiment inhibition from the control group was determined where the control group was set at 0 inhibition. Inhibition of blood loss was 93.26 2.04 96.30 3.70 85.86 6.52 69.4 9.92 89.05 3.69 78.48 8.71 63.33 6.70 47.97 10.07 3.1 8.22 13.52 10.59 and 12.82 7.31 at 5 min 30 min 2 4 8 16 24 32 48 72 and 96 hr respectively from vehicle control Mean and SEM n 8 45 mice from 4 experiments .

The FIX knockout colony of mice was generated by in vitro fertilization using cryo preserved sperm from male FIX knock out mice. All offspring were genotyped using PCR based protocols to select those animals that contained a FIX knock out allele. Further crossings of these animals and their offspring after PCR based genotyping produced FIX knock out animals i.e. hemizygous males and homozygous females because the FIX gene is on the X chromosome as confirmed by PCR. After PCR confirmation of the genotype of all members of this initial FIX colony PCR confirmation of all colony offspring was ceased since legitimate knock out animals can only produce knock out offspring. Retired breeders from the colony were however genotyped on several occasions. Approximately 7 months after genotyping of all colony offspring was ceased genotyping of retired breeders clearly indicated the presence of non knock out or wild type animals in the colony. Based on this result all members of the knock out colony were genotyped and any non knock out animals were identified and eliminated from the colony. The results of the colony genotyping indicated that 19 of the male mice were wild type and 4 of the male animals were ambiguous due to poor DNA preparations. Both the wild type and ambiguous males and females were eliminated from the colony.

Thus the FIX knockout colony was contaminated at some point with one or more non knock out animals and therefore contained a small fraction of non knock out animals that increased over time until between 19 23 of the males in the colony contained a wild type FIX gene in vivo experiments use male mice only . With respect to the FIX data generated and reported in this application all of the in vitro data is unaffected. With respect to in vivo data it is assumed and expected that the contamination affected all compounds similarly and therefore does not affect either the rank order of variants or their comparison to BeneFIX. Since the contaminating animals already had endogenous FIX they would lose much less blood in the efficacy and duration experiments than true hemophilic animals and would benefit much less from administration of exogenous FIX therefore increasing the spread or variability of data for all compounds. The contamination also could make all the compounds appear slightly less potent than they actually are but their ratio to BeneFIX should not be altered i.e. the potency and duration advantage of our lead molecules should be unaffected .

The data described below comes from a new colony rebuilt from the confirmed FIX mice described above. Mice were double confirmed by genotyping before being used as breeders. All data described below comes from mice born from breeding units where parents have been double confirmed. All replacement breeders are also double confirmed as FIX prior to initiation of new breeding units.

Male FIXmice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal administration of a ketamine xylazine cocktail 45 mg ml and 3.6 mg ml in saline and placed on a heated platform 39 C. to ensure there was no drop in body temperature. The procedure room was kept at a temperature of 82 F. Ten minutes prior to tail cut the tail was immersed in 10 mL of pre warmed PBS 15 mL centrifuge tube 39 C. . Seven to fifteen mice were injected with recombinant human FIX Benefix Coagulation Factor IX Recombinant Wyeth or modified FIX polypeptides diluted in a buffer that was the same as that of Benefix Coagulation Factor IX Recombinant 0.234 sodium chloride 8 mM L histidine 0.8 sucrose 208 mM glycine 0.004 polysorbate 80 via the tail vein in a single injection. A negative control group of mice received buffer only. In instances where the injection was missed the animal was excluded from the study.

Injection with FIX polypeptide or buffer was made 5 minutes prior to tail cut. The tail cut was made using a razor blade 5 mm from the end of the tail and blood was collected into PBS for a period of 20 minutes. At the end of the collection period total blood loss was assessed. The collection tubes were mixed and a 1 ml aliquot of each sample was taken and assayed for hemoglobin content. Triton X 100 was diluted 1 in 4 in sterile water and 100 L was added to the 1 mL samples to cause hemolysis. The absorbance of the samples was then measured at a wavelength of 546 nm To calculate the amount of blood lost the absorbance was read against a standard curve generated by measuring the absorbance at 546 nm of known volumes of murine blood diluted in PBS and hemolyzed as above with Triton X 100. Values are expressed as Mean SEM.

Dose response studies to assess the coagulant activity of Benefix Coagulation Factor IX Recombinant and FIX polypeptides at varying doses in FIXmice were performed. In these experiments EDvalues were calculated using non linear regression and are shown in Table 29 below.

Studies were performed to assess the duration of effect of Benefix Coagulation Factor IX Recombinant at 0.5 mg kg in FIXmice.

The functional cofactor binding K of the FIXa variants for the cofactor Factor VIIIa FVIIIa in the presence or saturating substrate Factor X FX was assessed indirectly in a fluorogenic assay by assaying for the activity of FXa generated upon activation by FIXa on the synthetic substrate Spectrafluor FXa. A range of FVIIIa concentrations were used to calculate the apparent kinetic rate constant K where the cofactor FVIIIa was in excess by at least a 1000 fold over the concentration of the activating protease FIXa . The experiment was designed to be a variation of the assay described in Example 4 Determination of the Catalytic Activity of FIXa for its Substrate Factor X where the cofactor FVIIIa at various concentrations is preincubated with FIXa in the presence of phospholipid vesicles forming the tenase Xase complex prior to assessing the catalytic activity with saturating levels of the substrate FX. Briefly activated and active site titrated FIXa was incubated in a calcium containing buffer with phospholipid vesicles while separately recombinant FVIII is activated to FVIIIa with alpha thrombin. The activity of alpha thrombin was then quenched by the addition of a highly specific thrombin inhibitor hirudin prior to initiating the assay. FIXa variants were then mixed with various concentrations of FVIIIa to form the Xase complex and subsequently mixed with saturating concentrations of FX and the fluorescent substrate Spectrafluor FXa CHSO D CHA Gly Arg AMC to initiate the assay. The release of the free fluorophore AMC 7 amino 4 methylcoumarin following catalysis of Spectrafluor FXa by FXa was then assessed continuously over a time period and the kinetic rate constants of the FIXa variants determined

For assays evaluating the kinetic rate of FX activation by FIXa in the presence of various FVIIIa concentrations and phospholipids recombinant FVIII Kogenate FS Bayer healthcare was first resuspended in 1 mL of the provided diluent. The molar concentration of FVIII was then determined by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1.567 mgmL cmand a molecular weight of 163.6 kDa. The FIX variants were expressed purified activated and active site titrated as described in Examples 1 3 above. FIXa variants were then serially diluted to a concentration of 8 pM 4 in a 1 mL volume of 1 Buffer A 20 mM Hepes 150 mM NaCl 5 mM CaCl 0.1 BSA 0.1 PEG 8000 pH 7.4 . In preparation for activation of FVIII to FVIIIa in the presence phospholipids alpha thrombin Heamatologic Technologies Inc. and hirudin American Diagnostica were each diluted from the manufacturer s stock concentrations 1 100 in 1 Buffer A. Reconstituted FVIII was further diluted to a concentration of 1600 nM 4 of the top dose in a 1.6 mL volume of 1 Buffer A containing 400 M freshly resuspended phospholipids 75 phosphatidylcholine PC 25 phospatidylserine PS PS PC vesicles 120 nm in diameter Avanti Polar Lipids . FVIII was activated to FVIIIa by mixing the above FVIII PC PS solution with a final concentration of 15 nM alpha thrombin solutions followed by 15 minutes of incubation at 25 C. Activation reactions were subsequently quenched by the addition of hirudin to a final concentration of 150 nM for 5 min at 25 C. prior to initiating a dilution series of 1.5 fold in a 12 channel deep well polypropylene plate with a final volume of 0.5 mL of the activated FVIIIa into 1 Buffer A containing 400 M PC PS vesicles. The final concentrations of FVIIIa 4 were 1600 nM 1066.7 nM 711.1 nM 474.1 nM 316.1 nM 210.7 nM 140.5 nM 93.6 nM 62.43 nM 41.6 nM. 27.8 nM and 0 nM for a 12 point assay or for an alternative 8 point assay with a 2 fold dilution series 1600 nM 600 nM 400 nM 200 nM 100 nM 50 nM 25 nM and 0 nM. The dilution series of FVIIIa was subsequently mixed 1 1 with the 4 FIXa dilutions 12.5 L each in a 96 well half area black assay plate according to a predefined plate map 4 FIXa variants plate and preincubated 15 min at 25 C. to form Xase complexes with varied concentrations of FVIIIa. Final 2 solutions 25 L were as follows 4 pM FIXa variant 1600 0 nM FVIIIa 200 M PC PS vesicles 7.5 nM alpha thrombin inhibited and 75 nM hirudin.

A solution of 1000 nM 2 active site titrated and DFP EGR cmk treated FX see Example 2 above was prepared in 20 mL of 1 Buffer A containing 1.0 mM Spectrafluor Xa substrate providing a sufficient volume for 4 assays. This represented a 2 saturating concentration of FX that would be at least 5 20 fold above the Kvalues reported in Example 4 Table 16. Assay reactions were typically initiated using a BioMek FX liquid handling system programmed to dispense 25 L of the FX Spectrafluor Xa dilutions into 4 assay plates containing 25 L of each FIXa variant and FVIIIa dilution Xase complexes . The final concentrations of the reagents in the assay were as follows 2 pM FIXa 400 0 nM FVIIIa 100 M PC PS vesicles 0.5 mM Spectrafluor Xa 3.8 nM alpha thrombin inhibited 38 nM hirudin and FX at 500 nM. Reactions were monitored in a SpectraMax fluorescence plate reader for 30 min at 37 C. A standard curve of free AMC served as the conversion factor for RFU to M in the subsequent data analysis calculations using a dose range that covered 0 to 100 M AMC.

To determine functional affinity of FIXa variants for FVIIIa based on their catalytic activity raw data collected with the SoftMax Pro application Molecular Devices were exported as .TXT files. Further non linear data analyses were performed directly within the ActivityBase software package using the XE Runner data analysis module IDBS Software . Data analyses were essentially as described in Example 4B with minor modifications. The Abase template was set up to automatically fit the parabolic reaction velocities M sec of the tested FIXa variants at each FVIIIa concentration to the function of a standard rectangular hyperbola i.e. Michaelis Menten equation given by equation 1 to yield the fit values for Vand K.

Table 31 sets forth the functional affinity K for each of the FIXa variants assayed. Also assayed were recombinant wild type FIXa termed Catalyst Biosciences WT generated as described above in Example 1 plasma purified FIXa Haematologic Technologies Inc. and BeneFIX Coagulation Factor IX Recombinant Wyeth . Table XX presents the results expressed as the kinetic constant for affinity K nM and also as ratio of the functional affinity of the wild type FIXa compared to that of the FIXa variant wherein the functional affinity of each FIXa variant is defined by the K nM value for activation of the substrate FX. Where the activity of the FIXa variant was compared to wild type FIXa it was compared to a recombinant wild type FIXa polypeptide that was expressed and purified using the same conditions as used for the variant FIXa polypeptides to ensure that any differences in activity were the result of the mutation s and not the result of differences in for example post translational modifications associated with different expression systems. Thus the wild type FIXa polypeptide used for comparison was the recombinant wild type FIXa generated from cloning the FIX gene set forth in SEQ ID NO 1 and expressed from CHOX cells as a polypeptide with an amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 as described in Example 1 i.e. Catalyst Biosciences WT FIX polypeptide . The standard deviation S.D. coefficient of variation as a percentage CV and the number of assays performed n also are provided.

While some variants showed similar to wild type affinities or nominal increases in K e.g. FIXa R318Y R338E and FIXa R318Y R338E R403E E410N several variants showed marked increases in functional affinity with greater than 6 10 fold increases in KVariants with combinations of the R338E T343R and E410N mutations showed the greatest improvements in functional affinity. For instance FIXa R338E T343R FIXa R318Y R338E T343R E410N FIXa R318Y R338E E410N FIXa Y155F K247N N249S R318Y R338E T343R R403E E410N FIXa R338E E410N and FIXa K228N 247N N249S R318Y R338E T343R E410N are among this group.

Clotting activities for FIX variants were determine by an activated partial thromboplastin time aPTT assay in human hemophilia B plasma from a single donor with 

Table 32 sets forth the clotting activities for each of the FIX variants assayed. Also assayed were recombinant wild type FIX termed Catalyst Biosciences WT generated as described above in Example 1 and BeneFIX Coagulation Factor IX Recombinant Wyeth . Table XX presents the results expressed as the time to clot at each of the three tested FIX concentrations 100 nM 10 nM and 1 nM wherein each FIX concentration represents 100 10 and 1 of the normal concentration of FIX in pooled normal plasma PNP . Under identical assay conditions 100 PNP shows a clotting time of 31.3 2.0 seconds whereas clotting times for 10 and 1 dilutions of PNP in hemophilia B plasma are 42.7 1.7 and 55.0 4.7 seconds respectively n 4 . The time to clot for the hemophilia B plasma used in these analyses was evaluated 83.2 9.2 seconds n 5 . A number of tested variants demonstrated clotting times similar to or slightly prolonged compared to the wild type FIXa where wild type FIXa polypeptide used for comparison was the recombinant wild type FIXa expressed from CHOX cells as a polypeptide with an amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO 3 as described in Example 1 i.e. Catalyst Biosciences WT FIX polypeptide . On the other hand several variants showed significantly shortened clotting times. Among this group of variants are FIXa R318Y R338E T343R FIXa R318Y R338E E410N FIXa R338E T343R E410N FIXa R318Y R338E T343R E410N FIXa K247N N249S R338E T343R E410N and FIXa K228N 247N N249S R318Y R338E T343R E410N.
