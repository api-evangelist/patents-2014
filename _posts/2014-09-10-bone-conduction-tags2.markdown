As will be described in greater detail herein one aspect of the concepts and technologies disclosed herein is the use of a bone conduction tag that includes different alternating surfaces and or materials to encode data. The data can be transmitted through one or more bones of a user via a vibration signal to a device such as a mobile device or a wearable device or other system in response to the user moving his or her finger s across the bone conduction tag.

Moreover those skilled in the art will appreciate that the subject matter described herein may be practiced with other computer systems including hand held devices mobile devices wireless devices multiprocessor systems distributed computing systems microprocessor based or programmable consumer electronics minicomputers mainframe computers routers switches other computing devices described herein and the like.

In the following detailed description references are made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments or examples. Referring now to the drawings in which like numerals represent like elements throughout the several figures example aspects of bone conduction tags will be presented.

Referring now to aspects of an operating environment in which various embodiments presented herein may be implemented will be described according to an illustrative embodiment. The illustrated operating environment includes a user s hand with a first finger of the user s hand shown in contact with a bone conduction tag A. The bone conduction tag A can encode data using physical variations in height of a substrate . The physical variations are referred to hereinafter as elevations E . The bone conduction tag A can encode the data additionally using physical differences in a width W of one or more of the elevations E . The bone conduction tag A can encode the data additionally using spaces S between the elevations .

The substrate of the bone conduction tag A can be formed at least in part from any material or combination of materials some examples of which include plastic composite metal paper cardboard ceramic and wood. In some embodiments the bone conduction tag A can be a standalone tag. In some other embodiments the bone conduction tag A can be built in to or attached to any other object. By way of example and not limitation the other object may be a package a device a furniture piece an appliance a vehicle a tool a wall a door or a building structure. The bone conduction tag A may be attached to a person such as the user. In some embodiments the bone conduction tag A incorporates Braille to aid a sight impaired individual.

The bone conduction tag A and other bone conduction tags described herein see can enable manufacturers and retailers to replace NFC tags QR codes RFID tags and or other similar tagging technologies with bone conduction tags. Bone conduction tags can be incorporated into products and or product packaging and can provide a more natural customer interaction with products and or product packaging. Bone conduction tags can be stamped into the packaging during the manufacturing process resulting in a cost reduction relative to RFID and NFC tags as well as eliminating the power requirements of RFID and NFC tags. Bone conduction tags can be incorporated into 3D printed objects to uniquely identify the machine that created the tag the owner of the tag and or other data. Bone conduction tags can be incorporated into objects to provide usage information and or to trigger events thereby adding another dimension to the interaction a user has with objects. The bone conduction tags can be incorporated into the surface of the object itself during the manufacturing process. Bone conduction tags can be created or customized by a user and placed on different objects or surfaces e.g. with an adhesive and can be used to trigger events and or actions. Bone conduction tags can eliminate the need for scanners at retail establishments. Retail associates in one implementation could utilize a mobile device and bone conduction tags on products to checkout a customer.

Turning now to the operating environment introduced in is again shown. The bone conduction tag A has been replaced by another bone conduction tag B. The bone conduction tag B can encode data using different materials as an alternative to the elevations of the bone conduction tag A described above with reference to . The bone conduction tag B can be formed from two or more materials selected to provide detectable variations in a vibration signal B.

The bone conduction tag A described above in view of utilizes binary encoding. The bone conduction tag B can use binary encoding but alternatively can use three or more states to encode data.
