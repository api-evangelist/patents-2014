This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from corresponding Japanese Patent Application No. 2013 016693 filed in the Japan Patent Office on Jan. 31 2013 the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

Unless otherwise indicated herein the description in this field section or the background section is not prior art to the claims in this application and is not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section. The present disclosure relates to an image transmission system including an image transmission apparatus that transmits an image.

In a first typical image transmission apparatus an address which is a destination of the image transmission is directly inputted by a user via an input device. However in this image transmission apparatus an address has to be directly inputted from the input device each time an image is to be transmitted which is troublesome for a user. Furthermore an error is likely to occur when an address is an input device with a small screen.

A second typical image transmission apparatus that addresses the foregoing issue manages an address book using an internal unit and transmits an image to the address that has been selected via an input device from among a plurality of addresses included in the address book.

A typical image transmission system includes an image transmission apparatus and a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol LDAP server that manages an address book. The image transmission apparatus transmits an image to the address that has been selected via an input device of the image transmission apparatus from among a plurality of addresses included in the address book managed by the LDAP server.

In the second typical image transmission apparatus or in the typical image transmission system addresses have to be registered in an address book in advance.

However in the second typical image transmission apparatus or in the typical image transmission system in the case where an address is registered in an address book via a network for example a user has to know in advance the information for accessing the image transmission apparatus over a network such as the Internet Protocol IP address of the image transmission apparatus or the LDAP server. Accordingly it is not easy for a user to register an address in an address book.

Furthermore an address book managed by the second typical image transmission apparatus or by the LDAP server of the typical image transmission system can generally only be edited by a specified administrator having authority due to security. Accordingly it is difficult for a user to register an address.

The present disclosure relates to an image transmission system that facilitates registration of an address in address information used by an image transmission apparatus.

According to the present disclosure an image transmission system includes an image transmission apparatus that transmits an image via a network and a client apparatus that performs an address information management service as an application for managing address information including information on a transmission destination of the image and is connected to the image transmission apparatus via the network.

The image transmission apparatus includes an operation unit a display unit a search message distribution device an address information request device an address display device and an image transmission device. The search message distribution device distributes via the network a search message for searching for the client apparatus in accordance with an instruction inputted via the operation unit. The address information request device transmits a request of the address information to the client apparatus that has transmitted a reply message for replying to the search message. The address display device causes the display unit to display one or more addresses included in the address information that has been transmitted from the client apparatus. The image transmission device transmits the image to the address that has been selected in accordance with the instruction inputted via the operation unit among the one or more addresses displayed on the display unit.

The client apparatus includes an address information management device a reply message returning device and an address information transmission device. The address information management device manages the address information. The reply message returning device transmits the reply message to the image transmission apparatus that has transmitted the search message. The address information transmission device transmits to the image transmission apparatus that has requested the address information the address information managed by the address information management device.

The control unit includes a CPU a ROM that stores a program and data of various types in advance and a RAM used as a work space of the CPU for example. The CPU is configured to execute the program stored in the ROM or in the storage unit .

The control unit functions as an address information management service which manages the address information by executing the address information management service program stored in the storage unit . The address information management service includes an address information management system a search service an address information service and a shared folder management service The address information management system manages the address information . The search service is a reply message returning device that returns a reply message to the MFP that has transmitted a search message. The address information service transmits to the MFP that has requested address information the address information managed by the address information management system . The shared folder management service generates a shared folder as an address to be included in the address information managed by the address information management system

First operations performed in the case where the PC automatically registers a shared folder of its own in the address information as an address are described.

The control unit of the PC performs the operations illustrated in on a regular basis while the address information management service is being activated.

As illustrated in the address information management system automatically detects a shared folder of the PC S .

Next the address information management system determines whether or not a shared folder has been detected in S S .

If the address information management system determines in S that a shared folder has not been detected the address information management system ends the operations illustrated in .

On the other hand if the address information management system determines in S that a shared folder has been detected the address information management system puts the shared folder detected in S in the address information as an address S and ends the operations illustrated in .

As illustrated in the address information management system of the PC makes the display unit display one or more addresses included in the address information based on an instruction given by a user via the operation unit S .

In addresses include an email address a shared folder a facsimile number and the like. Note that a shared folder is not limited to a folder in the PC and may be a folder in a PC other than the PC the PC being included in the image transmission system . In a screen illustrated in check boxes each associated with an address and used for releasing the address a button for adding changing or deleting an address and a button for ending editing of an address are included.

In the screen illustrated in a user is able to specify an address by checking a corresponding check box via the operation unit of the PC . Then the address information management system accepts specification of an address that is to be transmitted by the address information service among one or more addresses included in the address information

Furthermore in the screen illustrated in a user is able to add change or delete an address by pressing the button via the operation unit of the PC . In other words the address information management system is able to register an address in the address information based on an instruction given by a user via the operation unit .

Furthermore in the screen illustrated in a user is able to end editing of an address by pressing the button via the operation unit of the PC .

As illustrated in the address information management system edits the address information based on an instruction given by a user via the operation unit S . More specifically the address information management system edits the address information in response to operations performed on the check boxes and the button in the screen illustrated in . When the button in the screen illustrated in is pressed by a user the address information management system ends the operations illustrated in .

As illustrated in the shared folder management service sets based on an instruction given by a user via the operation unit the folder specified in the instruction as a shared folder S and thereafter makes the address information management system register the folder in the address information as an address S . Note that as a method of generating a shared folder in S a method of generating a new shared folder in the PC may be adopted in addition to a method of generating a shared folder by setting a folder that is already present in the PC as a shared folder.

Next the shared folder management service repeatedly determines whether or not an instruction for ending the address information management service is inputted via the operation unit until it is determined that an instruction for ending the address information management service has been inputted via the operation unit S .

If the shared folder management service determines that an instruction for ending the address information management service has been inputted to the operation unit in S the shared folder management service cancels a shared state of the folder S makes the address information management system delete the folder registered as an address from the address information S and ends the operations illustrated in . In other words the shared folder management service cancels the shared state of a shared folder generated in S before the address information management service ends.

Next operations of the image transmission system when an image is transmitted by the MFP are described.

A user having authority to operate the PC inputs via the operation unit of the PC an operation making the PC activate the address information management service . Then as illustrated in the control unit of the PC activates the address information management service based on the input made by the user via the operation unit S .

Next the user moves to a place where the MFP is located from a place where the PC is located and inputs via the operation unit of the MFP an operation of pressing an address selection button not illustrated displayed on the display unit of the MFP . Then the search message distribution device of the control unit of the MFP distributes a search message used to search for the PC throughout the network via the network communication unit S . For example the search message distribution device transmits a Probe message as a search message used to search for the PC by using Web Services Dynamic Discovery WS Discovery . More specifically the search message distribution device transmits a Probe message used to search for the PC in which the address information management service is being activated by using User Datagram Protocol UDP multicast for searching for the PC in which the address information management service is being activated.

When the search service of the address information management service of the PC receives the search message distributed in S via the network communication unit when the content of the search message corresponds to the search service that has received the search message the search service returns a reply message to the MFP that has transmitted the search message via the network communication unit S . For example when the search message distributed in S is a Probe message based on WS Discovery the search service returns a Probe Match message based on WS Discovery as a reply message. The MFP is thus able to recognize the location of the PC .

When the address information request device of the control unit of the MFP receives via the network communication unit the reply message returned in S the address information request device requests via the network communication unit address information from the PC that has transmitted the reply message S .

When the address information service of the address information management service of the PC receives via the network communication unit the request for address information made in S the address information service transmits via the network communication unit address information based on the address information managed by the address information management system to the MFP that has requested address information in S S . Here the address information management system passes to the address information service only the address among one or more addresses included in the address information specification of which has been accepted using a corresponding checkbox in the screen illustrated in as an address to be transmitted by the address information service . Therefore the address information service transmits in S address information only including the address that has been passed by the address information management system

When the address display device of the control unit of the MFP receives the address information transmitted in S via the network communication unit the address display device makes the display unit display the address included in the address information S .

In addresses include an email address a shared folder a facsimile number and the like. Note that a shared folder is not limited to a folder in the PC and may be a folder in a PC other than the PC the PC being included in the image transmission system . In the screen illustrated in check boxes each associated with an address and used for selecting the address a button for transmitting an image to an address selected using a corresponding checkbox and a button for canceling transmission of an image are included.

A user selects an address by checking a corresponding checkbox via the operation unit of the MFP and thereafter presses the button via the operation unit thereby being able to instruct the MFP to transmit an image.

When a user selects an address displayed on the display unit in S and instructs the MFP to transmit an image the image transmission device of the control unit of the MFP transmits the image to the address that has been selected in accordance with the instruction inputted via the operation unit among the addresses displayed on the display unit as illustrated in S . Here if the address is an email address the image transmission device transmits the image to the email address via the network communication unit by email. If the address is a shared folder the image transmission device writes the image in the shared folder via the network communication unit . If the address is a facsimile number the image transmission device transmits by facsimile the image to the facsimile number via the facsimile communication unit .

Note that as a communication system between the MFP and the PC various systems such as a Web service or Representational State Transfer REST are capable of being adopted.

As described above in the image transmission system the MFP is able to locate the PC in which the address information management service is being activated by using a search message and a reply message S to S and therefore the user does not have to know in advance information such as the IP address of the PC for accessing the PC from the MFP over the network . Accordingly the image transmission system easily makes the address information managed by the PC available to the MFP . Furthermore in the image transmission system as long as the PC is configured to activate the address information management service the MFP transmits the image S to an address selected by a user among one or more addresses included in the address information managed by the PC even if the PC is easily operated by a user. Therefore it is possible to facilitate registration of an address in address information used by the MFP .

In the image transmission system when the PC is used by a single user for example it is possible to make the display unit of the MFP display only one or more addresses included in the address information managed by the PC . Therefore it is possible to increase convenience compared with a configuration when a user has to find an address necessary for the user by performing every operation such as sorting or retrieving from among thousands of addresses included in address information most of which are addresses irrelevant to the user such as address information shared by multiple users for example.

In the image transmission system only an address specified by the user S among one or more addresses included in the address information is displayed S on the display unit of the MFP . Therefore it is possible to increase security compared with a configuration in which all addresses included in the address information are constantly displayed on the display unit of the MFP .

Note that the image transmission system may be configured such that all addresses included in the address information are constantly displayed on the display unit of the MFP .

In the image transmission system a shared folder of the PC in which the address information management service is being activated is automatically include in the address information as an address S . Therefore it is possible that an image is transmitted by the MFP to a shared folder of the PC in which the address information management service is being activated.

In the image transmission system a shared folder is generated in the PC S as an address to which an image is to be transmitted by the MFP . Therefore it is possible that an image is transmitted by the MFP to the shared folder.

In the image transmission system the shared state of a shared folder that has been generated by the PC performing the address information management service is canceled S before the address information management service ends. Therefore it is possible to temporarily generate a shared folder in the PC to which an image is capable of being transmitted by the MFP .

Note that the image transmission system does not have to be configured such that the shared state of a shared folder that has been generated by the PC performing the address information management service is cancelled before the address information management service ends.

In the image transmission system as long as the address information management service is being activated in a PC it is possible to make the display unit of the MFP display one or more addresses included in address information managed by the PC even if the PC is other than the PC . In other words in the image transmission system it is possible to make the display unit of the MFP simultaneously display addresses included in pieces of address information respectively managed by a plurality of PCs.

On the other hand it is assumed that the image transmission system is configured such that identification information of the search service is put in a search message distributed by the MFP in S and the search service that has received the search message returns a reply message to the MFP that has transmitted the search message including identification information of the search service S . Then it is possible to make the display unit of the MFP display only one or more addresses included in the address information managed by the PC that is identified using identification information included in a search message among PCs in which the address information management service is being activated. In other words in the image transmission system it is possible to facilitate selection of an address made by the user compared with a configuration in which one or more addresses included in address information managed by any PC in which the address information management service is being activated are displayed on the display unit of the MFP .

Note that the identification information may be identification information of the PC such as an IP address or a serial number. Furthermore the identification information may be an identifier ID and a password of the user that are used when the user logs in to the MFP from the PC for example. In the case where the MFP encrypts the ID and password by using a specific law when the MFP puts the ID and password in a search message it is possible to increase security when the identification information is distributed throughout the network . The search service is able to recognize the ID and password by decoding the ID and password using the law after receiving the identification information.

In the image transmission system it is possible to make display units of a plurality of MFPs simultaneously display one or more addresses included in the address information managed by the PC in which the address information management service is being activated.

The image transmission apparatus of the present disclosure is an MFP in an embodiment however the image transmission apparatus may be an image transmission apparatus other than an MFP such as a dedicated facsimile machine.

It should be understood that various changes and modifications to the embodiments described herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present subject matter and without diminishing its intended advantages. It is therefore intended that such changes and modifications be covered by the appended claims.
