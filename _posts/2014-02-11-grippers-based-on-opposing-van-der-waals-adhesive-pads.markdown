title: Grippers based on opposing van der Waals adhesive pads
abstract: Novel gripping structures based on van der Waals adhesive forces are disclosed. Pads covered with fibers can be activated in pairs by opposite forces, thereby enabling control of the adhesive force in an ON or OFF state. Pads can be used in groups, each comprising a group of opposite pads. The adhesive structures enable anchoring forces that can resist adverse forces from different directions. The adhesive structures can be used to enable the operation of robots on surfaces of space vehicles.

The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Nos. 61 764 814 filed on Feb. 14 2013 and 61 913 540 filed on Dec. 9 2013 the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

The invention described herein was made in the performance of work under a NASA contract and is subject to the provisions of Public Law 96 517 35 USC 202 in which the Contractor has elected to retain title.

The present disclosure relates to adhesive structures. More particularly it relates to grippers based on opposing van der Waals adhesive pads.

In a first aspect of the disclosure a structure is described the structure comprising at least two pads each having a first surface and a second surface wherein the at least two pads are spaced apart the same distance from a center of symmetry of the structure a plurality of fibers attached to the first surface of each pad wherein the fibers substantially extend longitudinally in a direction away from the first surface connecting elements attached to the second surface of each pad the connecting elements forming a mechanical supporting structure linking together the at least two pads actuating elements attached to the second surface of each pad the actuating elements forming an actuating link between the at least two pads wherein during operation the at least two pads are pulled in a tensing direction by the actuating elements the tensing direction being towards or away from the center of symmetry wherein a bending direction of the plurality of fibers of each pad is substantially opposite to the tensing direction and wherein the plurality of fibers is configured to bend and compress against a surface external to the structure to enable adhesion through van der Waals forces.

The present disclosure describes structures which allow adhesion to surfaces through the van der Waals forces acting on pads covered with numerous fibers. Mechanical forces are applied between pads in order to enhance the operation of pads and overall adhesion of a structure as well as allowing control of the adhesive force ON OFF activation of the adhesive force In some embodiments pads may operate in pairs and a mechanical force may be applied to push apart the pair of pads or to pull them together. In other embodiments pads may operate not in pairs but with a common center of symmetry for the mechanical forces applied to them. For example three pads may be spaced at 120 degrees in a symmetrical pattern with a mechanical force applied to each pad along the direction from the pad to the center of symmetry of the pattern. The mechanical force may allow control of the adhesion for the pads for example enabling adhesion or detachment as desired. The mechanical force may be applied through several ways for example through a spring or a wire under tension.

In some embodiments a spring is held in an extended state away from equilibrium by a mechanical stop mechanism. When a pad is attached to a surface a mechanical element may trigger and release the mechanical stop that is holding the spring extended away from equilibrium. As a consequence the spring will expend the stored elastic potential energy applying a mechanical force that pushes the pads towards each other in a direction parallel to the surface to which the pads are attached. Through this mechanical force the pads are held under tension in a direction going from each pad to the other pad in a pair of pads thereby enhancing the contact of the pads fibers to the surface to which the pads are attached. Without such force the pads fibers may have a decreased area of contact with the surface they adhere to.

In other embodiments the direction of the mechanical force may be opposite to the embodiments above where each pad is pulled away from the other of a corresponding pair. These embodiments may be useful for example to grip flexible surfaces such as sheets of materials like a sheet of paper or plastic . One reason is that if the pads were pushed towards each other the surface being flexible would likely crumple with a possible loss of adhesion for both pads. By pushing the pads away from each other the flexible surface is instead put under tension avoiding any disruptive crumpling.

The fibers in a pad as understood by a person skilled in the art would normally be flexed in the same direction as the other fibers within each pad. The direction of the fibers in a pad is correlated to the direction of the mechanical force used to control the adhesion of the pads. For example if the pads are pushed towards each other the longitudinal axis of the fibers should point away from the opposite pad. In such a way as the pads are pulled towards the other the fibers bend and compress against the surface they are adhering too enhancing the van der Waals forces. In other words the direction toward which the fibers bend is opposite the direction that the pad is pushed or pulled in. The mechanical force applied to the pad may not involve any actual movement but rather be a tension without a movement as understood by the person skilled in the art.

In other embodiments when the pads are pushed away from each other the longitudinal axis of the fibers should bend and point towards the opposite pad. In such away again the fibers are pushed and compressed towards the surface they are adhering too as the tension applied to the pads keeps them pushed away from each other. The fibers therefore are compressed towards the surface they adhere to in order to control the van der Waals forces.

The mechanical force applied to the pads allows an increase in and a higher degree of control over the adhesion of the pads. The adhesion is based on the van der Waals forces acting between fibers and a surface in a manner similar to geckos. Geckos have toes covered in microscopic fibers. Thousands of these fibers each of them contributing a small amount of adhesion through van der Waals forces together form a link strong enough to permit a gecko to climb a vertical wall or plant. Geckos stick and unstick their toes to a surface through a specific movement of each toe such as by controlling the angle of the toe to the surface. Similarly the adhesion of the pads of the structures of the present disclosure can be controlled by pushing or pulling the pads away from each other or towards each others.

A similar mode of operation as that described above for opposing pads can also be applied with little modifications for the embodiments where the pads are not exactly opposite each others but are rather organized in groups such as groups of three pads wherein all the pads in a group are pushed or pulled away or towards the center of symmetry of the group.

The structures described in the present disclosure may have a variety of applications such as the fabrication of anchors which can adhere to surfaces in vacuum for example on the international space station ISS . Such anchors may be used to attach computers in place or other tools during activities in space both inside a vehicle or outside a vehicle. The structures described in the present disclosure may also be used for example to fabricate adhesively anchored mobile robots. For example such robots may be dedicated to extra vehicular spacecraft inspections in space and contain a variety of instruments such as cameras lasers and sensors. Such robots may for example be able to move along the outer surface of a space craft in space vacuum and carry out maintenance repairs and structural integrity inspections.

The structures described in the present disclosure have the particular advantage of being able to control the adhesion as an ON or OFF state. As described in the present disclosure gecko adhesive pads or van der Waals pads can be used in opposition to one another to create omnidirectional anchors. In other words the anchors of the present disclosure can provide an anchoring force against a force applied to the anchor from different directions.

Multiple sets of opposed pads in combination for example four sets of counterbalanced pairs can be used to control and scale the adhesive anchoring force depending on the surface area and application. The displacement and load of the pads or grippers can be balanced relative to one another in order to accommodate any misalignment.

A variety of mechanisms may be used to control the pads for example cables linear rails ball screws or other linear actuators as well as spherical pivots.

In other embodiments omni directional grippers may be fabricated with counter rotating rings of adhesive fibers. Counter rotating rings may have one ring with adhesive pads pointing in a clockwise direction and another ring with adhesive pads pointing in a counter clockwise direction. A rotation or tension without rotation can be placed between the two rings so as to move them in opposite directions. This can be done for example with a spring cable motor or other methods as understood by the person skilled in the art. In other embodiments more than two counter rotating rings may be used together in unison or independently. For example there may be two clockwise rings and two anticlockwise or one clockwise and two counterclockwise. The rings may have different widths.

In some embodiments adhesive forces up to 75 kPa or more can be possible with the structures of the present disclosure.

The fibers in the grippers of the present disclosure are activated through a shear motion as understood by the person skilled in the art. The fibers may have a variety of shapes from simple slender cone like structures similar to a real gecko lamellae to more complicated shapes designed to increase the contact area between the fibers and the surface they are adhering to. Both the force normal to the surface and the shear force parallel to the surface may be used to control the adhesion of a gripper. The structures described in the present disclosure allow the control of the ratio of shear to normal forces native tackiness and other parameters through control of the geometry and shape of the fibers.

In some embodiments the fibers are fabricated through technique that will be known to the person skilled in the art for example by photolithography using SU 8 resist. The fibers may be fabricated with polymers using a mold. An exemplary set of dimensions for conical fibers may be a base of 20 micrometers and a height of 65 micrometers.

Because the fibers operate based on van der Waals forces adhesion is operative in a wide range of physical conditions such as temperature and pressure.

In some embodiments when the shear force is zero the pads can be easily released. In some embodiments the angle between the pads and the surface they adhere to can be controlled in order to control the force of adhesion and obtain an ON OFF behavior for adhesion.

An advantage of the structures described in the present disclosure is the ability for an anchor or gripping apparatus comprising the gripping pads with fibers to resist forces acting on the structures from multiple directions. In such a way the structures can retain their adhesion without being involuntarily released. In other words the anchors are omni directional.

The structure herein described can also allow adhesion to curved or non flat surfaces. The structures of the present disclosure oppose a preferred direction of multiple pads around a central housing. As understood by the person skilled in the art the preferred direction of a pad is that direction which enables the greater force of adhesion thanks to the orientation of its fibers when compressed against a surface. In such a way the anchors can resist any force applied along any vector away from the surface the anchor is adhering too. In some embodiments compliance flexure joints can be used to relieve any moments applied to the anchor.

The adhesive structures of the present disclosure comprise connecting elements that form a mechanical supporting structure linking the pads. For example as visible in the connecting elements may comprise a top plate a bottom plate and further structural elements . The adhesive structures of the present disclosure comprise also actuating elements that form an actuating link between the pads. For example as visible in the actuating elements may comprise a middle plate and constant force springs which act on the pads .

In the embodiment of in the OFF state the middle plate is lowered and the springs are relaxed. As shown in the ON state the middle plate is pulled away from pads e.g. pairs of gecko adhesive pads thereby extending springs applying a force to the pads . The pads are the pulled toward each other in pairs as described above in the present disclosure. The constant force springs allow an even distribution of forced among the pads . The middle plate can be moved up and down between top and lower plate by for example a screw mechanism .

In some embodiments at least two pads can form a group which operates based on the principle of opposing forces as described above in the present disclosure. The groups may comprise two or three pads or more. The actuating elements of each group may operate independently of the other groups or the actuating elements may operate in a dependent way for example in unison. For example all actuating elements may be operated by a single trigger or activating mechanism.
