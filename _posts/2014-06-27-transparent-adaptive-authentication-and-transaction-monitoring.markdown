title: Transparent adaptive authentication and transaction monitoring
abstract: Enhanced security processes are integrated into online service provider workflow activities in a transparent fashion with little or no impact on the servers. Enhanced security processes may include adaptive authentication and transaction monitoring. The enhanced security processes are partially implemented in a network device, such as a network communication device, a firewall, or a load balancing system, or a separate security device, rather than being implemented in the server systems hosting on-line websites. With such an arrangement, server software is minimally modified or rewritten, and third party software, such as security applications, remains in operation.

On line service providers for example a banking website may need to properly identify on line customers and clients to prevent fraudulent transactions. In some situations the use of a registered username and a password associated with the username may provide sufficient security for an on line transaction to proceed. In other situations an on line service provider may need additional identification information to safely permit an on line transaction to continue. For example a bank website may employ a risk engine of a risk based authentication system to assign risk scores to banking transactions where higher risk scores indicate higher risk. The bank may use an adaptive authentication engine to determine if a step up authentication process is needed in order to safely approve a particular transaction having a higher risk score.

A step up authentication process may include requesting more identifying information from the on line customer in addition to the registered username and the password associated with the username or may include contacting the on line customer via an out of band communication method. As an example the on line service provider may text the client using a registered cell phone number. An on line service provider may choose to use a step up authentication process if something about a transaction indicates that the transaction is not as expected. For example the amount of the transaction may be larger than any previous transaction executed by that particular customer or the time of the transaction may not be typical or the location of the transaction may be from a different continent than a transaction by the same customer on the previous day. A step up authentication may be done by software code installed on a server hosting the on line service.

It may be desirable to incorporate security functions such as adaptive authentication and transaction monitoring into existing service provider systems executing service applications that are not designed to include such functions. For such a system it is typically necessary to modify the service application to incorporate the new security functions being added. For example a service application may employ a simple login processing workflow requiring only that a valid user password be presented to authenticate a user. In order to incorporate new security features the login processing workflow must be modified to accommodate the new features. For example the processing workflow improvements may include steps such as collecting additional user information making calls to additional services using new logic to accommodate different conditions and results etc.

Unfortunately there are deficiencies with the above described conventional authentication and transaction monitoring methods. For example integrating step up security systems running in line with already existing security systems in an on line service provider involves rewriting the software code used in the server that hosts the service provider s website. The rewritten code must be designed implemented and tested to determine complete functionality and remove code errors or code incompatibilities. Additional work on integrating the increased security process for on line service providers may include obtaining approval for potentially risky software changes and lost production time for the server being upgraded. There may also be costs for re allocating engineering resources building web page GUIs to display the request for additional information from the customer and changing the operating logic of the website to accommodate the challenging allowing and denying access steps to customers of the website resource.

Another disadvantage to conventional methods is the difficulty in integrating increased security into third party software such as web applications. Additionally in situations having multiple server systems operating a large series of websites the conventional methods of upgrading security involve software changes in each of the servers. Integrating conventional authentication upgrades involves changes that are not transparent to the service provider.

In contrast to conventional integration methods for increased security methods in on line service providers an improved technique is transparent to the servers and reduces the effort involved in implementing increased security for example in legacy systems. The improved technique intercepts and re routes communications between a server and a client. The re routed communication is redirected to a device which may be referred to as a challenger where it is stored in memory and where increased security procedures are performed. The increased security may include contacting the client for additional security information adaptive authentication and transactional monitoring. The improved technique involves little or no change to the server software code and is essentially transparent to the server.

One embodiment of the improved technique is directed to a method for adding increased security to communications exchanged between a server and a client device. The improved technique includes receiving an intercepted and re routed communication between the server and the client device storing the re routed communication in a memory and communicating with the client device for example requesting additional security information. The technique includes performing a security operation including the additional security information and generating a security decision. The technique includes sending the stored communication to the intended recipient when the security decision indicates that it is safe to continue and preventing the stored communication from being sent when the security decision indicates that it is not safe to continue.

The technique further includes determining whether the re routed communication requires increased security and transmitting a call to a security analysis device for generating a step up security decision including information related to the intercepted communication. The technique includes transmitting a challenge to the client when the step up security decision indicates that a step up security procedure is indicated and performing the security operation using security information that includes the additional security information. The technique includes receiving a response to the challenge from the client and comparing the response to information in the memory to determine confirmation.

In one embodiment the improved method is implemented using a computer program product having a non transitory computer readable storage medium which stores code including instructions for adding increased security to communications exchanged between a server and a client device.

Another embodiment of the improved technique is directed to a system for integrating security operations into a server workflow transparently to the server. The system includes a controller a memory device a local area network communicatively coupled to an external client by at least one network gateway device at least one server hosting a resource communicatively coupled to the local network a challenger communicatively coupled to the at least one network gateway device and communicatively coupled to a security analysis device. The challenger maybe a separate physical device or software implemented in another device of the system. The network gateway device is constructed and arranged to intercept and redirect communications between the server and the external client to the challenger. The challenger is constructed and arranged to store information from the redirected communication in the memory transmit a call containing security information from the redirected communication to the security analysis device and receive a security analysis from the security analysis device. The system can transmit a challenge to the client receive a response to the challenge from the client and compare the response from the client to information in the memory. The system will then generate a decision on continuing the communication when the comparison to the information in the memory indicates a valid response.

Using the improved methods and systems allows integrating improved security operations into a server workflow where the server is using older security systems with the increased security processes added transparently to the server.

An improved technique integrates enhanced security processes such as adaptive authentication and transaction monitoring into online service provider transactions in a transparent fashion with little or no impact on the servers. The enhanced security processes are implemented as part of a network rather than as part of the server systems hosting on line websites. Network devices that may be utilized in part of the improved technique may include communication devices such as a network gateway a firewall or a load balancing system and separate security devices such as an adaptive authentication device or a challenger.

In this described embodiment the client is an external client customer who is not part of the private network but the system is not so limited. In the case of an external client the communication may be a login logon request a transaction request or other interaction between electronic systems. The gateway may be directly connected to the internet by the communication channel as shown. The gateway may be a communication device a firewall device a load balancer device as a proxy device or other devices used in communicating between portions of private network and external devices such as client . The gateway is shown as including communication channels from servers and but the system is not so limited. There may be any number of servers connected to the gateway and there may be any number of gateways which may act in parallel.

The gateway is connected to a challenger such that a message directed toward client may be intercepted and re routed for increase security procedures for example an adaptive authentication process for a logon request. The challenger may be a separate device as shown or it may be a portion of the gateway or other device. The challenger is connected via channel to a security analysis device . Channel is shown as being a separate communications channel to a device that is outside the private network but the apparatus is not so limited. The challenger channel may use the gateway and the internet to connect to security analysis device . Alternatively security analysis device may be a part of private network and communicate using internal network channels.

The challenger may optionally communicate with server either via the gateway or via a separate internal communication channel . The challenger may communicate via channel with the client . The challenger may include a non transitory computer readable storage medium for programing actions of the device.

Security analysis device may include an adaptive authentication system a transaction monitoring system or other security devices. The security analysis device may be a separate device located outside the private network as shown but the system is not so limited. Security analysis device may be a part of the challenger or part of the gateway . The security analysis device may be external to the private network as shown and connected to the challenger by a separate communication channel or via the internet or it may be a separate device contained within the private network and communicate with the challenger by internal communication channels.

At the challenger stores the message in a memory location until the increased security process is completed. In some embodiments the challenger determines that the message is a logon request that logon requests are of a type of message that should undergo increase security checking and the challenger sends a call containing details regarding the message to the security analysis device at . If the message is determined to not undergo increased security then the challenger sends the stored message back to the gateway which at resumes sending the message to the client which was the message s initial destination.

Security analysis device performs an increased level of security screening on message . For example if message is a logon request security analysis device may be an adaptive authentication process looking at a transaction history current geographical location time of day a device fingerprint or other adaptive authentication factors for client to determine a risk of fraud in the logon request for access to a resource.

If the risk of fraud is found to be low at security analysis device will transmit an accept to challenger which will send the stored message back to the gateway which at resumes sending the message to the client the initial destination of the message.

If the risk of fraud is high at security analysis device will transmit an deny message to challenger which does not send the stored message to the gateway and the message at is not sent to the client . At the gateway may send a notice of the deny decision to the server . Alternately in some embodiments the gateway may send a notice of the deny decision to the client where the notice may be in the form of a redirection command to a failure to authorize webpage. In other embodiments the server at may send a failure to authorize message to a memory device to a database to an action center and or to the client .

If the risk of fraud is moderate at security analysis device will send a challenge message to the challenger . The challenge message may contain information for the challenge to the client in some embodiments or the challenger may formulate and transmit a challenge question to the client at in other embodiments. The challenge question may be a series of questions including more detail than the username and password or it may be an out of band communication to the client for example a text message to the client s cell phone including a code that the client may use to prove possession of an item known to belong to the client. Possession of the client s cell phone as well as knowing the username and password may provide sufficient authentication of the client device . Other enhanced security measures may also be used and several iterations of challenge question and reply may be needed to obtain proper security levels. In some embodiments the challenger may transmit another call to the security analysis device including the client challenge response for additional analysis.

The client at provides a response to the challenge question to the challenger . The response may include further information such as the client s mother s maiden name or it may be a code sent to the client by text message or other forms of increased security response.

Challenger compares the challenge response to values stored in a memory and if the response fails to match the stored values at the challenger transmits a deny message to the gateway and server at and the message is not transmitted to the client . In some embodiments the gateway or the server transmit a redirect to a failure to authorize page to the client .

When the challenge response matches the stored values the challenger at which will send the stored message to the gateway which at resumes sending the stored message to the client .

In the described embodiment the gateway intercepts the transaction at and redirects it to the challenger using for example an interface service such as ICAP or other anti virus or malware filtering protocols but the improvement is not limited to these methods. The described communications between the challenger and the security analysis device may use a protocol such as SOAP XML API simple object access protocol extensible markup language application programming interface or REST API for the communication. Any computer language or protocol may be used such as Java. Other languages and protocols may be used.

The validation from the server returns at to the challenger which transmits security information regarding the transaction to the security analysis device at . When the security analysis device indicates a low fraud risk at the security analysis device transmits an accept message to the challenger which at transmits the stored transaction to the server via the gateway .

When the security analysis indicates a high fraud risk at the security analysis device transmits a deny message at to the challenger which is transmitted to the server via the gateway at . The server may send a message including a redirection to a failure to authorize page to the client or send a message about the failure to authorize to an action center or a blacklist.

When the security analysis indicates a moderate fraud risk at the security analysis device transmits a challenge message to the challenger . In some embodiments the challenger sends a redirection request to the client via either the gateway or via the direct communication channel shown in . In other embodiments the redirection request is transmitted to the server and then to the client via the gateway . The redirection request is sent at to the client directing the client to communicate with the challenger for example using the bidirectional communication channel shown in . The alternative paths in the two embodiments are shown using the dotted arrows in . The redirection request may include unique identifiers in order to reconstruct the original intercepted transaction .

At the client has contacted the challenger the challenger has transmitted a challenge question to the client the client has provided a response to the challenge question and the challenger has confirmed whether the response is correct. Thus at the client has completed a step up authentication process involving challenge questions or out of band contacts which may either result in a deny message not permitting the transaction to continue at or an accept message which permits transmission of the stored transaction to continue at from the challenger to the server .

If the transaction is denied at the server may store information about the transaction such as the identification of the client or adaptive information such as GPS location website identification protocols used in the transaction or other information useful in future authentication attempts for transactions with the client .

The improved techniques move the step up security integration point to the system network layer rather than adding increase security processes to a production server. Modifications to production servers may increase lost business activity and may increase risk of a service provider s website being down and out of operation. A down website may adversely affect a service provider s reputation and business. The improved method includes a device or an application known as the challenger which handles the step up security process transparently and reduces risk for the service provider.

Another benefit of the improved method is allowing step up security integration for systems that include third party application and software. For example financial institutions may use third parties to provide specific parts of their web sites such as a bank having a third party mortgage web page as part of the main web site. This may be a problem since many third party application developers do not allow access to their code which then may not be possible to integrate into the increase security protocol process.

Yet another benefit of the improved technique is that every logon or transaction may be checked and an immediate step up challenge may be presented whenever the specific logon or transaction merits increased security. This may be accomplished with the improved technique without having to reprogram parts of many of the electronic devices involved with a transaction.

While various embodiments of the invention have been particularly shown and described it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
