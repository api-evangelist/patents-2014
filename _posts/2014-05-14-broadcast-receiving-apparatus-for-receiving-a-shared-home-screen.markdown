Besides screen display setting information set by the mobile device may be received at least one of luminance brightness and contrast of a displayed screen may be set according to the received screen display setting information and thus screen display settings desired by the user may be easily achieved.

In addition home screen information set on a home edit screen may be transmitted to the server and thus the home screen information set by the broadcast receiving apparatus may also be used by the mobile device.

When a shared home screen is displayed inexecutable items may be displayed distinguishably from other items and thus the user may easily check the inexecutable items.

Furthermore when the shared home screen is displayed the inexecutable items may be replaced with the same or similar execution items and thus user convenience may be improved.

A broadcast receiving apparatus and a method for operating the same according to the present invention are not restricted to the exemplary embodiments set forth herein. Therefore variations and combinations of the exemplary embodiments may fall within the scope of the present invention.

A method for operating a broadcast receiving apparatus according to the present invention can also be embodied as processor readable code on a processor readable recording medium.
