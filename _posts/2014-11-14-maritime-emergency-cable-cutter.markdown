The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy and thus the invention herein may be manufactured used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The invention relates generally to maritime cable cutting under emergency conditions. In particular the invention relates to a mechanism to expeditiously and reliably sever a heavy duty cable used between ships for supply operations.

Naval ship replenishment at sea also known as an undersea replenishment UNREP operation involves rendezvous of approach and control ships on parallel courses followed by connection of ships by a span cable. For liquid supplies e.g. fuel the delivering ship extends a hose along the cable to the receiving ship for connection to the appropriate receptacle. Other supplies such as weapon stores can also be exchanged via cable suspension.

In the event of an emergency replenishment termination the cable is severed manually. This process is described in section 2.2.11 of Underway Replenishment especially pp. 2 11 through 2 15 issued as NWP 4 01.4 under the Chief of Naval Operations and available at http www.hnsa.org doc pdf unrepnwp04 01.pdf. shows a perspective view of the inboard ship with its span wire . A manual cable cutter is positioned on the span wire by an assigned operator to sever the cable when authorized during an emergency and abort the inter ship delivery operations.

Conventional emergency severance devices for marine cables yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular various exemplary embodiments provide a marine cable cutter for wirelessly severing wire responsive to an electromagnetic command signal. The cutter includes an explosive package for wrapping around the wire and a clamshell case for containing the package around the wire.

In exemplary embodiments the package includes a wireless receiver to receive the command signal an electric pulse generator triggered by the receiver an explosive initiated by the generator and a platform for containing the receiver generator and explosive. In further exemplary embodiments the clamshell case includes a pair of envelopes connected along mutual first edges by a hinge and mutual second edges by respective clamps. The envelopes pivot on the hinge to open and receive the package with disposal of the wire therein and subsequently to close and secure by the clamps. The envelopes can be composed of sheet metal with the clamps being flanges with aligned holes for receiving bolt fasteners.

In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized and logical mechanical and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.

In accordance with a presently preferred embodiment of the present invention the components process steps and or data structures may be implemented using various types of operating systems computing platforms computer programs and or general purpose machines. In addition those of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that devices of a less general purpose nature such as hardwired devices or the like may also be used without departing from the scope and spirit of the inventive concepts disclosed herewith. General purpose machines include devices that execute instruction code. A hardwired device may constitute an application specific integrated circuit ASIC or a field programmable gate array FPGA or other related component.

Upon initiation the caps explode with the resulting shock transmitted via corresponding blast igniters to respective linear shaped charges that direct their explosive forces to the span wire for severance on command from a wirelessly transmitted signal. Example charges can be commercially available Semtex RAZOR flexible explosives. shows a perspective view of the exemplary package showing the configuration of the shaped charges as a right angle to direct their blasts upward relative to the block orientation.

The timer circuit also connects to capacitors and and to resistors and . Output pin connects via the resistor to an NPN transistor in parallel with a rectifier diode which together with the battery connect to input terminals of a voltage transformer . The output terminals of the transformer provide the high voltage pulse to the caps .

Preferably the switch diode can for example be either 1N914 or 1N4148. The capacitor is 0.1 F or 0.47 F while the capacitor is 0.01 F. The resistors and are 1 k each the resistor is 47 . The transistor is a TIP31 bipolar junction transistor with current flowing from collector C to emitter E when base B has higher voltage than emitter E . The transformer constitutes a miniature audio transformer receives input voltage from the battery on the 1 kct one thousand loop center tap left side and supplies output voltage to the caps from the 200 k 0.2 million loop right side.

The portions and pivot along a laterally disposed axis along a common hinge secured by a rod . The portions and also join together laterally opposite the hinge by respective flanges and that face each other. Each flange and has aligning through holes that to receive appropriate fasteners when they face each other along a common flat joint interface . The housing encloses an interior in which the package can wrap around the span wire .

In third elevation view the upper portion pivots on the hinge to close the case and bolt fasteners insert into the aligned through holes of the flanges and facing each other. The flanges and with the fasteners constitute clamps for securing the case upon closure and alternative configurations can be contemplated without departing from the inventive scope. The completed and installed assembly can operate to sever the span wire on command. Upon receiving an electromagnetic commanding signal from a ship board transmitter the trigger switch can initiate a pulse from the oscillator for discharging the caps to detonate their charges .

The afore described embodiments provide a mechanism to safely and reliably cut heavy braided steel span wires in the event of an emergency during heavy underway replenishment operations. The objective is to fabricate an emergency use explosive cable cutter as in view which is safe reliable and can meet safety certifications necessary for shipboard use. Flexible linear shaped charges represent an exemplary reliable method for cutting the braided steel span wire typically 1 in diameter . Shipboard applications would enable minimization of fragmentation and blast effects from any explosive cable cutting system while still ensuring effective use.

The exemplary embodiments provide a two part modular assembly first a heavy blast resistant clamshell case designed to easily clamp around and fasten onto the braided steel cable and second a flexible conformal cutting charge package which readily inserts into the case . This package contains the secure wireless remote detonation switch a voltage multiplier charge capacitor pulse generator a long life battery two strips of flexible linear shaped charge with industry standard igniters and blasting caps . In the event of an emergency such as the fouling of cables interconnecting two ships and during UNREP in heavy seas the UNREP supervisor could press a button to remotely trigger the explosive cable cutting device and sever the fouled span wire or other similar cable.

Within the United States joint and international military community such a device would have general applicability to combat engineering brigades and potentially for purpose applications faced by special operations forces. Building demolition companies could employ such a device for dismantling bridges and other structures with steel reinforcement bar of significant dimensions.

Conventional explosive cable cutters are not approved for shipboard operation due to blast and fragmentation considerations. Mechanical cutting systems e.g. electric drive or hydraulic drive are relatively slow and require unacceptably many seconds or minutes to sever a heavy braided steel cable. Further these systems require support systems such as electricity wiring hydraulics and hydraulic lines. Reliability and maintenance of these electrical and hydraulic systems over the long haul are perceived to be cost prohibitive as well as creating additional ship modifications. The described exemplary designs provide an effective alternative for such emergency cable severing operations.

While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein many modifications substitutions changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art. It is therefore to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the embodiments.
