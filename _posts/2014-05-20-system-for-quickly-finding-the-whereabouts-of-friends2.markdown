This patent application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application 61 849 834 filed May 17 2013 entitled System for Quickly Finding the Whereabouts of Friends. 

This invention relates to the field of data communications and more particularly to a system for finding the location and or status of other individuals.

There are a wide range of instances where a group of individuals are coordinated for an event. Examples of such events can include but are not limited to birthday parties weddings christenings funerals school trips concerts business meetings conferences charity events and reunions. Today in order to set up such events a range of options exist with respect to communication tools including for example Simple Messaging Service SMS telephone social media such as Facebook messaging services such as Twitter email and web based services such as Google Events.

In the majority of instances these events are based at a particular location e.g. an office church restaurant concert hall etc. although in other instances these may be a range of locations e.g. a charity run requiring volunteers at the start finish and runner registration . When one or more of those invited or expected at a location does not appear then others must text email or call trying to find out where they are. However in many instances the missing individual s are currently travelling to that particular location and may for example when driving not be able to receive or reply to a telephone call text or email. At the same time they may not be familiar with the particular location the neighbourhood or area around the particular location etc. and hence actually find it difficult even when they are able to reply to provide an estimate of their arrival time or time to arrival.

Within the prior art there are smartphone applications that allow a user to track their friends. These include 

However in all of these prior art applications it is a requirement that the user and the individual have not only a prior association within one another but that the individual has authorised the application to disclose their location. In the majority of these prior art applications it is also a requirement that the user and the individual are using the same application. In the majority of instances where the user and individual are not family or close friends then the individual does not wish to have the user know their location. In other instances such as the Toronto Waterfront Marathon where there is a small organizing team and approximately 3 000 volunteers then ensuring all the volunteers have downloaded the application of choice of the event is an overhead the event can ill afford and then tracking a small number of volunteers within this larger number a significant issue as these prior art applications are primarily intended for tracking a small number of user s. Scrolling a list of 3 000 volunteers to enable for example the 10 missing volunteers to be located would take a user a significant period of time. Partitioning the list between multiple users only succeeds in creating additional management overhead and communications issues within the event organizers.

Accordingly it would be beneficial to provide individuals enterprises organizers etc. with the ability to establish allocation of an individual or group of individuals rapidly with low complexity and management overhead and without requiring that the two parties exploit the same software application or establish a relationship akin to friends within these prior art applications.

Other aspects and features of the present invention will become apparent to those ordinarily skilled in the art upon review of the following description of specific embodiments of the invention in conjunction with the accompanying figures.

The system s and or application s described below in respect of embodiments of the invention may be employed in a standalone manner or they may alternatively be a feature of or be used as part of a larger system for creating managing running and or coordinating an event. Within the embodiments of the invention described below these are described with respect to friend connections FCs . However it would be understood by one of skill in the art that this may be generalised to the context of user connections wherein no formal relationship exists between the two users other than they are associated with at least a single event.

Referring to there is depicted an example of an architecture for implementing a system according to embodiments of the invention. Accordingly there is a FC server which is connected to the cloud i.e. the Internet which is responsible for communications between all the Friend Connection Applications FCAPs . FCAPs can reside on PEDs and or FEDs. To do this the FC server communicates with various platforms for example Apple push notification service when communicating with Apple PEDs and or FEDs a Microsoft push notification service when communicating with Microsoft PEDs and or FEDs Google cloud messaging when communicating with Android PEDs and or FEDs and a Blackberry push notification service when communicating with Blackberry PEDs and or FEDs. All of these push notification services are standard and exist today. There are specific Representational State Transfer REST application programming interface API endpoints for the push notification service of each of these platforms. Users have an FCAP downloaded onto their devices. The FCAPs interact with the device s display and location services. Within an embodiment of the invention there is a different variant of the FCAP for each of the different types of device Apple Android Blackberry and Microsoft. Each device type provides a standard API to retrieve location data. Whilst the push notification services are described as communicating with PEDs and or FEDs it is generally expected that embodiments of the invention will be exploited primarily with PEDs although they may be exploited with FEDs.

Now referring to there is depicted an exemplary user interface for the FCAPs within a system according to an embodiment of the invention. User has a list of friends that they are currently interested in. This may be for example a complete list of all the user s friends or it may alternatively be a list derived from a pre setup event or outing. In this example User Jane Doe wishes to find the whereabouts of Terra Billings e.g. User . They tap the Where Are You button next to Terra Billings . This triggers a push notification to be sent to User Terra Billings device and a notification to appear upon their device. The notification includes the name of the person Jane Doe that wishes to know where User Terra Billings is. All User Terra Billings has to then do is to tap the I m Here button on the device. This causes the location of User Terra Billings to be sent back to User Jane Doe and when it is received it pops up a map showing the location of user Terra Billings . Neither of users or has to type anything or make a call. They just have to tap a button once. Further user and user do not need to have any formal association. It is merely sufficient that user has contact details relating to user which may for example have been provided by user to user or to an enterprise associated with user . For example a volunteer registering to an event may provide their email address allowing them to not only receive communications in respect of the event but also for them to receive such communications through their FCAP.

Referring to there is depicted a message sequence chart according to an embodiment of the invention of the messages that go between the FCAP the FC server the push notification services and the FCAP . FCAP sends a Where Are You message which includes the identity of User and User to the FC server . The FC server then looks up the type of device that User has and chooses the appropriate push notification service or . It then sends the message to the push notification service with the recipient being user s device. The push notification service then sends the notification onto the User device. When the User presses the I m Here button which is received by FCAP FCAP causes a message to be sent 303 to the FC server which includes the identity of User and User and the location data of User device. The FC server then looks up the type of device that User has and chooses the appropriate push notification service or . It then sends the message to the push notification service with the recipient being user s device. The push notification service then sends the notification on to the user device. The FCAP sees this notification and pops up a map showing the location of User .

Now referring to there are depicted details of FCAP and FCAP according to an embodiment of the invention wherein both have FC server interfaces . This software is responsible for sending messages to the FC server via the cloud . They also have push notification reception software which is responsible for handling the receipt of push notifications from push notification services and . The display interfaces with each of FCAP and FCAP are responsible for displaying the correct images on the device. The list of friends is data that the display interface uses to display the list of friends to the user in selecting the user to whom to send the request. Location data retrieval software is responsible for retrieving location data from the device such as for example by accessing GPS data with the device accessing triangulation data of wireless transmitters associated with a wireless receiver of the device an identity of a wireless node to which the device is connected and an identity or identities of one or more wireless beacons observable by a receiver or receivers of the device. Optionally optical and or other non wireless sources of location information may be accessed. Optionally location data may be derived from an ad hoc network to which the device is connected rather than a fixed or installed network. Each device typically has an API that is freely accessible to do this.

Now referring to there are depicted details of an FC server according to an embodiment of the invention. FCAP interface is software that receives messages from all the FCAPs via the cloud . It exploits reference to a list of subscribers wherein this data is used to verify the sender s identity and to look up the type of device that they have. It receives two types of messages Where Are You and I m Here coming from FCAPs . It looks up the device type of the user the message is being pushed to which then lets it select the correct push notification interface to use to send the Where Are You message to the recipient and the device type of the sender to send the I m Here message in response. The push notification interfaces interface with the corresponding push notification services .

Now referring to there is depicted a network environment within which embodiments of the invention may be employed supporting friend connection systems and friend connection applications platforms FCS FCAPs according to embodiments of the invention. Such FCA FCAPs for example supporting multiple device types multiple communication channels fixed content dynamic content etc. As shown first and second user groups A and B respectively interface to a telecommunications network . Within the representative telecommunication architecture a remote central exchange communicates with the remainder of a telecommunication service providers network via the network which may include for example long haul OC 48 OC 192 backbone elements an OC 48 wide area network WAN a Passive Optical Network and a Wireless Link. The central exchange is connected via the network to local regional and international exchanges not shown for clarity and therein through network to first and second cellular APs A and B respectively which provide Wi Fi cells for first and second user groups A and B respectively. Also connected to the network are first and second Wi Fi nodes A and B the latter of which being coupled to network via router . Second Wi Fi node B is associated with Enterprise e.g. Toronto Waterfront Marathon within which other first and second user groups A and B exist. Second user group B may also be connected to the network via wired interfaces including but not limited to DSL Dial Up DOCSIS Ethernet G.hn ISDN MoCA PON and Power line communication PLC which may or may not be routed through a router such as router .

Within the cell associated with first AP A the first group of users A may employ a variety of PEDs including for example laptop computer portable gaming console tablet computer smartphone cellular telephone as well as portable multimedia player . Within the cell associated with second AP B are the second group of users B which may employ a variety of FEDs including for example gaming console personal computer and wireless Internet enabled television as well as cable modem . First and second cellular APs A and B respectively provide for example cellular GSM Global System for Mobile Communications telephony services as well as 3G and 4G evolved services with enhanced data transport support. Second cellular AP B provides coverage in the exemplary embodiment to first and second user groups A and B. Alternatively the first and second user groups A and B may be geographically disparate and access the network through multiple APs not shown for clarity distributed geographically by the network operator or operators. First cellular AP A as show provides coverage to first user group A and environment which comprises second user group B as well as first user group A. Accordingly the first and second user groups A and B may according to their particular communications interfaces communicate to the network through one or more wireless communications standards such as for example IEEE 802.11 IEEE 802.15 IEEE 802.16 IEEE 802.20 UMTS GSM 850 GSM 900 GSM 1800 GSM 1900 GPRS ITU R 5.138 ITU R 5.150 ITU R 5.280 and IMT 1000. It would be evident to one skilled in the art that many portable and fixed electronic devices may support multiple wireless protocols simultaneously such that for example a user may employ GSM services such as telephony and SMS and Wi Fi WiMAX data transmission VOIP and Internet access. Accordingly portable electronic devices within first user group A may form associations either through standards such as IEEE 802.15 and Bluetooth as well in an ad hoc manner.

Also connected to the network are Social Networks SOCNETS first and second personnel providers A and B respectively e.g. Manpower and Adecco catering service provider C e.g. Daniel Daniel Toronto Canada and first to second partner enterprises A and B respectively e.g. Scotiabank and Running Room as well as first and second servers A and B which together with others not shown for clarity. First and second servers A and B may host according to embodiments of the inventions multiple services associated with a provider of FCA FCAPs a provider of a SOCNET or Social Media SOME exploiting FCA FCAP features a provider of a SOCNET and or SOME not exploiting FCA FCAP features a provider of services to PEDS and or FEDS a provider of one or more aspects of wired and or wireless communications an Enterprise exploiting FCA FCAP features license databases content databases event databases registration databases customer databases contact databases websites and software applications for download to or access by FEDs and or PEDs exploiting and or hosting FCA FCAP features. First and second primary content servers A and B may also host for example other Internet services such as a search engine financial services third party applications and other Internet based services.

Accordingly an enterprise user or individual user ENUINU may exploit a PED and or FED within an Enterprise for example and access one of the first or second primary content servers A and B respectively to perform an operation such as accessing downloading an application which provides FCA FCAP features according to embodiments of the invention execute an application already installed providing FCA FCAP features execute a web based application providing FCA FCAP features or exploit FCA FCAP features within another application. Similarly an ENUINU may undertake such actions or others exploiting embodiments of the invention exploiting a PED or FED within first and second user groups A and B respectively via one of first and second cellular APs A and B respectively and first Wi Fi nodes A.

Now referring to there is depicted an electronic device and network access point supporting FCA FCAP features according to embodiments of the invention. Electronic device may for example be a PED and or FED and may include additional elements above and beyond those described and depicted. Also depicted within the electronic device is the protocol architecture as part of a simplified functional diagram of a system that includes an electronic device such as a smartphone an access point AP such as first AP and one or more network devices such as communication servers streaming media servers and routers for example such as first and second servers A and B respectively. Network devices may be coupled to AP via any combination of networks wired wireless and or optical communication links such as discussed above in respect of as well as directly as indicated. Network devices are coupled to network and therein Social Networks SOCNETS first and second personnel providers A and B respectively e.g. Manpower and Adecco catering service provider C e.g. Daniel Daniel Toronto Canada and first to second partner enterprises A and B respectively e.g. Scotiabank and Running Room .

In accordance with an embodiment of the invention a method and or system is provided allowing a user to quickly and easily request and receive data relating to the whereabouts of other users. The system sends a request for location of a user from a PED and or FED to a user notification server containing the requesting user information and receiving user information. The user notification server receives the request retrieves the device type using the receiving user information and chooses the appropriate push notification service to use based on the device type. The user notification server then sends the request for location to the selected push notification service. This request for location information is then received by the receiving user s PED and or FED application which displays the request along with the requesting user information and a corresponding action. Upon execution of the action the user s device retrieves location data and sends a response intended for the requesting user containing the location data and receiving user information to the user notification server. The user notification server then receives the response and retrieves the device type of the requesting user and chooses the appropriate push notification service to user. The user notification server then sends the response to the selected push notification service wherein it then received by the requesting user through the appropriate PED and or FED application. The response is then received by the appropriate PED and or FED application which then displays to the requesting user the receiving user s location data.

According to an embodiment of the invention the receiving user s location data is displayed on a map to the requesting user. Within another embodiment of the invention the receiving user s location is presented on a map in association with a location of an event involving the receiving user allowing the receiving user to make a judgment with respect to the receiving user s time of arrival at the event. Within another embodiment of the invention the receiving user s location is presented on a map in association with a location associated with the requesting user allowing the requesting user to send a modified event request to the receiving user that allows the event to occur earlier and or closer to the originally intended start time.

Within another embodiment of the invention the map displayed to the requesting user is parsed from a map provider map service including information from one or more third party service providers which may be the same enterprise as the map provider map service. In this instance the requesting user is presented with additional information such as local traffic for example allowing the requesting user to make a more accurate judgment. Within another embodiment of the invention the receiving user may be presented with a map wherein the receiving user location data has been parsed by a map provider map service together with the location of an event associated with the receiving user and third party information such that the user is presented with distance time information based upon archived data and or real time conditions. Accordingly the receiving user may be provided with additional data by the requesting user such as an alternate route or alternate destination. For example rather than having a volunteer arrive late at a destination where their help may be not needed by the time they arrive e.g. all the runners have left then they may be directed to a new destination e.g. finish line hydration station changeover point etc. so that they are able to contribute to the event. In other embodiments of the invention the alternate destination is determined by the application in dependence upon current user location and the location s established within the application for the event to which the user is currently associated with.

Within the embodiments of the invention described supra the requesting user request is described as being communicated via a push notification server. Within embodiments of the invention the push notification server is selected based upon knowledge of the user s device alone or it is selected in dependence upon the user s device in combination with the communication service determined in dependence upon the receiving user s address associated by the requesting user with the request. Accordingly a phone number may cause use of a SMS service an email use of an email application a twitter handle use of Twitter a Facebook user name a post to the receiving user s Facebook wall etc. In some embodiments of the invention an application that is discrete from other receiving user software applications may be employed whilst in other embodiments of the invention the application may be triggered from within another software application based upon the receiving user performing the action. In some instances the push notification server and the notification service features may require that the message include a URL which when accessed runs code on the receiving user s PED and or FED to retrieve the location information and send this back for transmission to the requesting user.

Within other embodiments of the invention the receiving user may be able to add additional information rather than simply providing their location. Said information may for example be a limited text response e.g. 140 characters such that the additional information may be posted to a social media website application within a profile associated with the event to which the receiving user is invited and their whereabouts sought. Within another embodiment of the invention the action performed by the receiving user triggers downloading of an application to their PED and or FED wherein the application extracts the location data and transmits this.

In another implementation the sending of a request for location of a user is initiated from a list of users established in association with an event. This list may be generated by an organizer of the event or it may be created by user s registering for an event e.g. volunteers to an event users accepting a meeting request etc. Within other embodiments of the invention such a list or lists may be part of an application for creating and running an event. Optionally the list may be the contacts of a user on their PED and or FED or within an application e.g. email. In other embodiments of the invention the list may be associated with a directory e.g. an enterprise staff directory. Within another embodiment of the invention the user address may be established through the selection of a member of a SOCNET and or SOME wherein their information is provided confidentially to the requesting user rather than to all friends contacts of the receiving user and or requesting user. In another embodiment of the invention the receiving and requesting users may for example be members of a community e.g. a dating service.

Within other embodiments of the invention the action of the receiving user may be audibly activated allowing them to perform the action or deny the action through an audio command e.g. saying YES or NO etc. In this manner a hands free operation for providing a response may be provided to users who are currently driving engaged in an activity etc.

Whilst embodiments of the invention have been described with respect to the organization of an event it would be evident to one skilled in the art that the embodiments of the invention may also be employed within other settings such as for example a mother seeking to find the current location of their daughter son husband father etc. without monitoring them continuously.

Accordingly embodiments allow a user to ask for example with a single button press user selection for the location of other users. In response to the request the user can for example with a single button press user selection choose to respond to the user. The requesting user then sees the location of the other user.

Within another embodiment of the invention the PEDs and or FEDs of a group of users e.g. the organizer s and invitee s of an event may have an application in execution wherein each of the user s devices knows the IP address of all or a subset of the devices associated with the other users. Accordingly the communications may be performed peer to peer with no server in the middle for data direction. Within such an embodiment each device should acquire the other IP addresses which may for example be through an initial service running on a server that they connect with when the event is being established and they are being invited. In the context of an event when the devices running an application according to an embodiment of the invention then they may initially connect to acquire event information then they would also receive the IP addresses of all the other devices currently associated with the event which would be connected to the user list. Subsequently upon another connection of the user s device to the event server then the IP address list updated or alternatively a list of IP addresses may be sent to their IP address with event association information allowing the application to add these IP addresses in respect of the event Then when a Where are you request is sent to a user then it may be sent directly from the requester device to the IP address of the receiving user s device and the application would handle the display and response actions on both sides. Accordingly a temporary closed messaging system between devices based on their IP addresses would be established where the temporary closed messaging system is associated with an event and location information is only provided in response to a specific request that the recipient approves in a discrete process. In the case s where IP addresses are changing then a server may be employed as a relay point with the devices keeping it updated with their IP addresses. Embodiments of the invention of such a configuration would bypass the requirement for a specific push notification service to be available for each device type. As such the embodiments of the invention in this manner would means the application provides its own push notification service which would be independent of any device type s .

Also it is noted that the embodiments may be described as a process which is depicted as a flowchart a flow diagram a data flow diagram a structure diagram or a block diagram. Although a flowchart may describe the operations as a sequential process many of the operations can be performed in parallel or concurrently. In addition the order of the operations may be rearranged. A process is terminated when its operations are completed but could have additional steps not included in the figure. A process may correspond to a method a function a procedure a subroutine a subprogram etc. When a process corresponds to a function its termination corresponds to a return of the function to the calling function or the main function.

Furthermore embodiments may be implemented by hardware software scripting languages firmware middleware microcode hardware description languages and or any combination thereof. When implemented in software firmware middleware scripting language and or microcode the program code or code segments to perform the necessary tasks may be stored in a machine readable medium such as a storage medium. A code segment or machine executable instruction may represent a procedure a function a subprogram a program a routine a subroutine a module a software package a script a class or any combination of instructions data structures and or program statements. A code segment may be coupled to another code segment or a hardware circuit by passing and or receiving information data arguments parameters and or memory content. Information arguments parameters data etc. may be passed forwarded or transmitted via any suitable means including memory sharing message passing token passing network transmission etc.

For a firmware and or software implementation the methodologies may be implemented with modules e.g. procedures functions and so on that perform the functions described herein. Any machine readable medium tangibly embodying instructions may be used in implementing the methodologies described herein. For example software codes may be stored in a memory. Memory may be implemented within the processor or external to the processor and may vary in implementation where the memory is employed in storing software codes for subsequent execution to that when the memory is employed in executing the software codes. As used herein the term memory refers to any type of long term short term volatile nonvolatile or other storage medium and is not to be limited to any particular type of memory or number of memories or type of media upon which memory is stored.

Moreover as disclosed herein the term storage medium may represent one or more devices for storing data including read only memory ROM random access memory RAM magnetic RAM core memory magnetic disk storage mediums optical storage mediums flash memory devices and or other machine readable mediums for storing information. The term machine readable medium includes but is not limited to portable or fixed storage devices optical storage devices wireless channels and or various other mediums capable of storing containing or carrying instruction s and or data.

The methodologies described herein are in one or more embodiments performable by a machine which includes one or more processors that accept code segments containing instructions. For any of the methods described herein when the instructions are executed by the machine the machine performs the method. Any machine capable of executing a set of instructions sequential or otherwise that specify actions to be taken by that machine are included. Thus a typical machine may be exemplified by a typical processing system that includes one or more processors. Each processor may include one or more of a CPU a graphics processing unit and a programmable DSP unit. The processing system further may include a memory subsystem including main RAM and or a static RAM and or ROM. A bus subsystem may be included for communicating between the components. If the processing system requires a display such a display may be included e.g. a liquid crystal display LCD . If manual data entry is required the processing system also includes an input device such as one or more of an alphanumeric input unit such as a keyboard a pointing control device such as a mouse and so forth.

The memory includes machine readable code segments e.g. software or software code including instructions for performing when executed by the processing system one of more of the methods described herein. The software may reside entirely in the memory or may also reside completely or at least partially within the RAM and or within the processor during execution thereof by the computer system. Thus the memory and the processor also constitute a system comprising machine readable code.

In alternative embodiments the machine operates as a standalone device or may be connected e.g. networked to other machines in a networked deployment the machine may operate in the capacity of a server or a client machine in server client network environment or as a peer machine in a peer to peer or distributed network environment. The machine may be for example a computer a server a cluster of servers a cluster of computers a web appliance a distributed computing environment a cloud computing environment or any machine capable of executing a set of instructions sequential or otherwise that specify actions to be taken by that machine. The term machine may also be taken to include any collection of machines that individually or jointly execute a set or multiple sets of instructions to perform any one or more of the methodologies discussed herein.
