This invention was made with Government support under Contract No. N66001 11 C 4109 awarded by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA . The Government has certain rights in this invention.

The present invention relates generally to integrated circuit devices and more particularly to a piezoelectronic switch device for radio frequency RF applications.

A piezoelectronic transistor PET has been proposed as a low voltage high frequency switch in which a gate voltage expands a piezoelectric PE transducer generating a high pressure in an adjacent piezoresistive PR material which then transforms from semiconducting electrical behavior to metallic electrical behavior. The PET may be embodied as a 3 terminal device or with an intervening low permittivity dielectric layer as a 4 terminal device. The three and four terminal PETs are embedded in a material with high Young s modulus HYM to resist deformation. Logic circuits analogous to conventional complementary metal oxide semiconductor CMOS devices may be made from combinations of PETs as part of a new field of technology termed piezotronics.

In RF signal electronics at frequencies above about 1 GHz there is need for rapid switching between RF channels such as for example in applications utilizing cell phone and radar technology while switching between different antennae or tuning an antenna by switching between elements in a capacitor bank. In for example a cell phone application microelectromechanical switches MEMS take up relatively large amounts of space require high voltages e.g. 30 80 V have expensive hermetic packaging limited endurance e.g. 10 10cycles and poor frequency response e.g. 10 10Hz . Thus MEMS are not ideal for this type of application. On the other hand semiconductor switches also have certain drawbacks such as for example poor isolation in an OFF state and large insertion loss in an ON state.

In general ON OFF switches have the well known problem of upon opening of the switch such that as the circuit resistance R rapidly increases the magnetic flux trapped in the circuit by its inductance L collapses on an ever shortening time scale as the time constant L R drops to zero thus resulting in high induced voltages by Faraday s law and an undesirable RF voltage pulse spark or arc. Switches with no RF noise are useful in situations where RF quiet is required such as airplanes during takeoff and landing near sensitive radar and radio astronomical antennae and in military settings. Switches that do not spark or arc are also useful in situations where there are volatile gases that could explode if exposed to a spark or arc. Arc free switches also have greater endurance in that switch contacts are not damaged by arcing.

In an exemplary embodiment a piezoelectronic switch device for radio frequency RF applications includes a piezoelectric PE material layer and a piezoresistive PR material layer separated from one another by at least one electrode wherein an electrical resistance of the PR material layer is dependent upon an applied voltage across the PE material layer by way of an applied pressure to the PR material layer by the PE material layer and a conductive high yield material C HYM comprising a housing that surrounds the PE material layer the PR material layer and the at least one electrode the C HYM configured to mechanically transmit a displacement of the PE material layer to the PR material layer such that applied voltage across the PE material layer causes an expansion thereof and an increase the applied pressure to the PR material layer thereby causing a decrease in the electrical resistance of the PR material layer.

In another embodiment a radio frequency RF switching circuit includes an RF signal source a first piezoelectronic switch device in parallel with the RF signal source and a second piezoelectronic switch device in series with the RF signal source. The first and second piezoelectronic switch device each include a piezoelectric PE material layer and a piezoresistive PR material layer separated from one another by at least one electrode wherein an electrical resistance of the PR material layer is dependent upon an applied voltage across the PE material layer by way of an applied pressure to the PR material layer by the PE material layer and a conductive high yield material C HYM comprising a housing that surrounds the PE material layer the PR material layer and the at least one electrode the C HYM configured to mechanically transmit a displacement of the PE material layer to the PR material layer such that applied voltage across the PE material layer causes an expansion thereof and an increase the applied pressure to the PR material layer thereby causing a decrease in the electrical resistance of the PR material layer.

In another embodiment an RF switch device includes a pair of electrodes configured to be brought into contact with one another by application of a mechanical force and one of the pair of electrodes having a piezoresistive PR material layer affixed thereto such that application of pressure to the PR material layer from the pair of electrodes being brought into contact with one another causes a decrease in an electrical resistance of the PR material layer.

Disclosed herein are embodiments of a PET device for RF applications that address a problem with respect to high frequency switching of RF signals with characteristics of high longevity and small switch format and voltage. Existing approaches include semiconductor switches that have poor isolation in the OFF state and large insertion loss in the ON state as well as MEMS devices that take up more space require high voltages have expensive hermetic packaging limited endurance and poor frequency response.

The use of a PET device for RF applications addresses the above mentioned switch issues in that the device is compact does not need an isolation package is fast and has long endurance. A PET also switches on and off much more smoothly than conventional contact type RF switch designs thereby preventing high voltage surges upon switching that could otherwise lead to unwanted RF noise sparking or arcing. The smooth operation also improves the endurance of the device allowing for many more on off cycles before metal contact degeneration since it avoids the high voltage spikes that degrade the contacts in other devices. The lack of arcing also allows the switch to be used in environments with volatile gases.

The PET concept may be used to implement a switch in the foregoing applications in at least two embodiments. Overall a PET design with RF screening provides a fast high endurance switch. For certain applications one type of PET switch may not provide a desired ON OFF ratio. Thus a switch utilizing a PET together with contacts that open close has a very high ON OFF ratio while the RF pulse is remediated by the relatively slow turn off of the PR resistance which still increases the endurance through reduced contact damage.

The embodiments described herein include designs for a 3 terminal or 4 terminal piezoelectronic switch that are useful at RF frequencies as well as a mechanically activated 2 terminal piezoresistive switch that has similarly useful properties. The new PET designs are characterized by their inclusion a conducting material for the High Young s Modulus housing which may be abbreviated as a C HYM to shield out stray RF noise and a grounding of the adjacent terminals that are separated by the low permittivity dielectric layer to reduce RF interference between the two parts of the switch. In this device the switch is turned on by application of a voltage to the lower terminal causing the PE to expand and compress the PR. This compression reduces the resistance in the PR and allows the RF frequency on the connected top terminal to pass through thereby activating the RF transmission line. The switch is turned off by applying a low voltage or ground to the lower terminal which causes the PE to contract and decompress the PR. This decompression increases the resistance in the PR and stops the flow of RF current through the RF transmission line. The main characteristic of the mechanically activated 2 terminal PR switch is its ability to smoothly increase and decrease the current in a circuit as the switch turns on and off reducing or eliminating the RF pulse on turn off and the consequent contact damage.

A principal advantage of both the piezoelectronic RF switch also designated herein as a PET RF and the piezoresistive PR switch is to open and close RF circuits used in communication radar etc. without introducing stray radio emission from sparks arcs or current surges that occur in mechanical switches which open or close metal contacts in air. The PET RF and PR switches will also have much longer lifetimes number of cycles than conventional air gap RF switches because the PET RF and PR switches have no current surges through nanoscale irregularities on metallic contact points as a conventional air gap switch does. These nanoscale current surges heat the metal and cause rapid erosion in conventional air gap switches. The PET RF and PR switches on the other hand automatically modulate the current with a slow rise time or decay time upon closing or opening the switch respectively. Because there are no metallic contacts with high voltage differences that can create heat spikes in locally high current surges the PET RF and PR switches are therefore smoother operating and longer lasting than conventional air gap RF switches.

Switches with no RF noise are also useful in situations where RF quiet is required such as in airplanes during takeoff and landing near sensitive radar and radio astronomical antennae and in military settings. Switches that do not spark or arc are also useful in situations where there are volatile gases that could explode if exposed to a spark or arc.

An anticipated advantage of the PET RF is that the high figure of merit FOM which is the characteristic RC time constant of the device enables operation at higher frequencies. In particular millimeter wavelengths e.g. 30 60 GHz are an upcoming band into which applications are moving e.g. 5Gen cellphone at 30 GHz versus the current cellphone at 2 GHz . In such applications a PIN diode requires an on drive current even when not switching thus wasting power. Further semiconductor FET switches have a poor FOM. Additional information regarding the FOM of various switch technologies is presented in further detail hereinafter.

The intrinsic speed of a PET RF is determined by the longer of the sound crossing time through the PE and the RC time of the circuit. The sound crossing time enters because of the finite speed of propagation of the expansion of the PE which regulates the resistance through the PR. The RC time of the circuit may include other PET s and devices with various fan outs and fan ins. Designs that minimize sonic oscillations and their associated resistance oscillations have critical damping which for purely resistive damping means that the RC time associated with each PET circuit is comparable to the sonic time in that PET. In the case of a PET RF the characteristic timescale for opening and closing the switch can be adjusted by the increasing or decreasing the thickness of the PE this timescale can be longer than the RF cycle time for example which is another way to minimize interference between the RF signal and the operating components of the switch. The intrinsic speed of the PR switch is determined by the compression time of the PR which is the sound crossing time over the thin layer of the PR. This is generally much shorter than the sound crossing time through the thicker layer of the PE in a PET RF switch. Slow controlled switching may be achieved by increasing the rise fall time of the control voltage this enables one to control the rate of decay of the magnetic energy to minimize both the RF interference and heating of the contact.

Referring now to there is shown a cross sectional view of a 3 terminal PET RF . As is shown the 3 terminal PET RF includes a PE material layer disposed between a gate electrode and a common electrode a PR material layer disposed between the common electrode and a sense electrode and a conductive high yield Young s modulus material C HYM serving as a housing that surrounds the materials and electrodes. The common electrode is grounded to reduce RF transmission from an RF input signal which is coupled to the sense electrode at the PR material layer to the switch input On Off which is coupled to the gate electrode at the PE material layer . The gate electrode and sense electrode are separated from the C HYM by insulator layers .

The C HYM that surrounds all of the components and acts as a Faraday shield to shield out stray RF noise may be made from tungsten W or some other suitably strong conducting material. The electrode materials may be made from strontium ruthenium oxide SrRuO SRO platinum Pt W or other hard conducting materials. The PE material layer may be made from a relaxor such as PMN PT lead magnesium niobate lead titanate or PZN PT lead zinc niobate lead titanate or other PE materials typically made from perovskite titanates. Such PE materials have a large value of displacement V d e.g. d 2500 pm V support a relatively high piezoelectric strain 1 and have a relatively high endurance. The PE could also be made from PZT lead zirconate titanate . The PR material layer is a material that undergoes an insulator to metal transition under increasing pressure in a range such as 0.4 3.0 GPa. Examples of PR materials include samarium selenide SmSe thulium telluride TmTe nickel disulfide diselenide Ni SSe vanadium oxide VO doped with a small percentage of Cr and calcium ruthenium oxide CaRuO . The insulator layers may have a relatively high Young s modulus for example 60 gigapascals GPa to 250 GPa a relatively low dielectric constant e.g. about 4 12 and a high breakdown field. Suitable insulator materials include for example silicon dioxide SiO or silicon nitride SiN .

Again a PE material is a material that may either expand or contract when an electric potential is applied thereacross while a PR material in the present context is a material that changes resistivity with applied mechanical stress so as to transition from an insulator to a conductor. As further shown in a medium between the C HYM and the various electrodes insulators PE and PR material layers may remain as a void or be filled with a soft solid material or a gas e.g. air .

In operation an input voltage On Off coupled to the gate electrode with respect to the grounded common electrode is applied across the PE material layer the arrow in the figures representing the direction of the electric field when the voltage is applied which causes an expansion and displacement of the crystal material of the PE material layer that in turn acts on the PR material layer via the C HYM . That is the induced pressure from the PE material layer causes an insulator to metal transition so that the PR material layer provides a conducting path between the common electrode and the sense electrode . The C HYM ensures that the displacement of the PE material layer is transmitted to the PR material layer rather than the surrounding medium .

Before further details regarding the principles of operation of the PET RF are described additional embodiments are first presented in . In particular illustrates a cross sectional view of a 4 terminal PET RF device having a PE material layer coupled to a PR material layer according to another exemplary embodiment. For ease of illustration like elements are designated with like reference numerals in the figures. In the 4 terminal PET RF device a single common electrode is replaced with a second gate electrode with respect to the first gate electrode and a second sense electrode with respect to the first sense electrode . The second gate electrode and the second sense electrode are separated from one another by a low permittivity high yield strength insulator layer . The second gate electrode is grounded to reduce RF noise in the PE material layer .

Referring now to there is shown a cross sectional view of a 4 terminal PET RF device according to another exemplary embodiment. In contrast to the embodiment of the PET RF device includes an air gap between the movable top portion of the PE assembly and the bottom of the PR assembly. Optionally an additional electrode is formed on the bottom of the PR material layer and separated from the second sense electrode by the air gap . The air gap provides high impedance between the two terminals of the RF signal in the OFF position when the PE material layer is contracted. However when the PE material layer is expanded the air gap closes and the adjacent metal layers contact in the ON position.

A basic principle behind the operation of the PET RF such as shown in any of the embodiments of is that the capacitance C of the PR material layer which produces a capacitive reactance in the RF circuit is functionally in parallel with the resistance R of the PR material layer . The total impedance in the RF circuit is thus given by the expression 1 

The capacitance in the PR material layer may be determined as follows. Assuming a typical dielectric in the PR material layer equal to 5 4.43 10F m and further assuming a PR material layer width in a square shape is 1 micron and the height is 25 nm then C 1.77 10F or 1.77 fF. As a first example of a capacitive reactance for an RF frequency of 10 GHz then 1 C 9000 Ohms . The resistance R in the PR is the same 9000 if the resistivity is 0.36 m for the same dimensions. The impedance scales with the ratio of the PR thickness to the PR area and the product of the resistive to the capacitive reactance equals R C .

As a second example of a capacitive reactance using an RF frequency of 60 GHz for the same dimensions then 1 C 1500 . Here the resistance in the PR is the same as the capacitive reactance if the resistivity is 0.06 m. Such resistivities can be achieved with for example SmEuS compounds for x 0.5.

The PET RF switches from OFF when the impedance in the RF circuit is high to ON when the impedance is low as the resistance in the PR drops from some high value in its low pressure state to some low value in its high pressure state. If the resistance in the OFF state is comparable to the capacitive reactance then the impedance in the OFF state is 1 square root over 2 times this capacitive reactance which can be high enough to block the RF signal in the circuit. However when the resistance drops to its low value in the ON state the impedance drops also to be about equal to the low resistance. A resistance OFF ON ratio in the range from 1000 to 10000 will regulate the impedance of PET RF switch by about this same factor.

The OFF ON ratio depends on the compression in the PR which in turn depends on the expansion of the PE. The resistivity in PR materials decreases exponentially with the applied pressure P approximately as exp 4P . Thus the OFF ON ratio is exp 4P . The pressure in the PR material depends on the dimensions of the PR and PE materials where l thickness of the PR L thickness of the PE a cross sectional area of the PR A cross sectional area of the PE and the pressure also dependent on the Young s moduli Yfor the PR and Yfor the PE. The pressure in the PR is also related to the PE expansion coefficient dand voltage on the PE V as given by the expression 

For a piezoelectric material PZT with the aspect ratio assumed d 0.15 nm V and Y 100 GPa. For typical PR material Y 80 GPa. Then with l 25 nm L 1 micron m and r a A 1 25 the above equation yields P 0.2 V for P in GPa and V in Volts. In that case the OFF ON ratio is exp 0.8V which is in the above range from 1000 to 10000 when the voltage ranges from 8.6 V to 11.5 V.

In the case of the embodiment where there is an air gap between the top of the movable PE structure and the bottom of the PR structure in the OFF state the resistance in the OFF state is infinite. An advantage of this configuration is that then the resistivity of the PR in the above equations may be reduced thus allowing the ON resistance to be lower when the PE expands and the metal layers on either side of the air gap contact one other. Then the OFF ON ratio in the impedance is larger.

Another key aspect of the gap contacts in is that although they are contacts between highly conductive materials there will be no spark arc or high voltage surge at the times of contact or separation. This is because at these times the resistivity in the PR material layer is high and the current is low limiting the strength of magnetic fields generated by this current and limiting the voltage across the gap . Still another result of this smooth turn on and turn off of the current is a longer lifetime for the contacts which suffer no high temperature spikes when the voltage between them always stays low. The application of a PET RF to high current switching should however merit careful consideration of the heat dissipated in the PR material. Wider PR and PE layers will permit more current to pass for the same dissipation rate per unit area.

It will be appreciated that combination of an air gap with a PR switch device is not necessarily limited to those applications involving the use of a PE layer to provide an applied pressure to the PR material. For example is a schematic cross sectional diagram of an RF switch device featuring a pair of electrodes configured to be brought together by application of a mechanical force arrows and including a PR material layer affixed to one of the electrodes . A spring or other suitable biasing mechanism may be used to bias the electrodes apart when the switch device is in an open position so as to define an air gap between the electrodes . In addition and similar to the embodiment of another electrode layer may optionally be formed on the PR material layer so that the air gap is defined between electrode layer and electrode .

The switch device uses this smoothing principle for a PR modulated switch exclusively without a PE. This is in principle an arc free switch that utilizes only a PR material layer in series with the circuit. The embodiment of may be mechanically operated with for example one ounce of force adequate to change the PR state from insulator to conductor if the PR material layer is on the order of 10 microns in size. It is noted that pressures on the order of a GPa are required to make the PR change conductivity states. One ounce is equivalent to 0.278 Newtons and one GPa is 10N m therefore one GPa corresponds to 3.6 10ounces m. The PR cross sectional area required to convert one ounce of force into 1 GPa of pressure is thus 2.78 10m which is 16.7 m corresponding to a PR width of 16.7 m. The current density through such a tip is 3.6 10Amp mfor 1 Amp of current which is a reasonable current density for this type of material.

Referring now to there is shown is a schematic diagram of an exemplary RF switching circuit that may be formed using a 3 terminal PET RF device such as shown in and a 4 terminal PET RF device such as shown in or . As shown in the circuit includes an RF signal source a matching impedance e.g. 50 a 3 terminal PET RF device in parallel with the RF signal source and a 4 terminal PET RF device in series with the RF signal source . In operation when the circuit on the 4 terminal PET RF device is closed and 3 terminal PET RF device is open. When the switch is off as specifically illustrated in the 3 terminal PET RF device acts as a short circuit to reduce the input of incoming signal on RF signal source . This reduces undesired signal passing through the capacitance of the 4 terminal PET RF device and reduces the danger of burn out thereof by a sudden strong undesired signal.

The following Table I below compares the parameters of the PET RF switch rightmost column with other technologies. The low FOM and reasonable IP3 are evident where the IP3 is the 3order intercept point. The lower more negative the IP3 the more linear the switch which is a requirement to avoid introducing higher harmonics of the signal. It should be noted that the PIN diode requires drive current to maintain the on state not just during switching .

A simple small signal figure of merit for RF millimeter wave switches is the characteristic time constant FOM and its associated frequency F given by the expression FOM 1 2 FOM with short times and high frequency desirable. Table I below compares certain state of the art RF and millimeter wave switch technologies including their small signal FOM F and large signal IP3 figures of merit with preliminary results of the new switch concept highlighted in the rectangular boxes.

As will thus be appreciated in the context of RF applications the above described PET RF and PR switch device embodiments offer substantial improvements over other RF switching technologies such as MEMS devices by having a higher high ON OFF ratio and faster switching along with an extended lifetime in the case of due to the lack of making breaking contacts. The embodiments of have turnoff slowed by the PR material which eliminates arcing.

In addition many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the invention without departing from the essential scope thereof. Therefore it is intended that the invention not be limited to the particular embodiment disclosed as the best mode contemplated for carrying out this invention but that the invention will include all embodiments falling within the scope of the appended claims.
