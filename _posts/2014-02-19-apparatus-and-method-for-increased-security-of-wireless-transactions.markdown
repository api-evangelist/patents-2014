The present disclosure relates to wireless electronic data transfer and to circuits and methods for secure wireless information transactions.

A Smartcard is a plastic card with an embedded integrated circuit computer chip i.e. a piece of thin semiconductor material such as silicon that has been chemically processed and etched with a specific set of electrical characteristics such as circuits storage and logic elements of smartcard elements. When coupled with a Smartcard reader this combination has the processing power to perform the complex operations previously requiring a personal computer or other large logic device.

In the form of a credit card a Smartcard contains a built in semi conductor chip. The chip memory stores payment information e.g. account information similar to a magnetic stripe on the back of a credit card but may also include additional information such as issuer defined controls e.g. online authorization frequency requirements floor limits credit limit etc. . Many smartcards issued in the United States will also include an embossed sixteen digit account number in the magnetic stripe. The non chip features allow the smartcard to be used at storefronts that are not equipped to interact with smart chips. Smartcards can also be contactless or wireless meaning the smartcard transfers data to and from another Smartcard enabled device via a built in antenna without physically touching the other Smartcard enabled device.

Smartcard chips can be categorized as either intelligent chips or memory chips. Intelligent chips i.e. smart chips contain a microprocessor that has various read write capabilities e.g. EEPROM and ROM space and the smart chip interacts with a Smartcard reader using software applications stored on the chip. Conversely some Smartcard memory chips lack processing capability and do not manage files dynamically. Generally the Smartcards currently issued by bank card issuers in the United States for payment contain intelligent chips and have processing power. For example a Smartcard could contain an access control application where the smart chip authenticates the cardholder and provides the user with access to a previously locked door or computer network. Information on the smart chip is read from a Smartcard reader and the smart chip is designed so that some of the information stored in the smart chip cannot be changed.

A smart chip operates similarly to a personal computer e.g. it can control the execution of the applications and it can store information. A smart chip can also lack processing power be dumb card. The primary difference with a smart chip is that the operating system is programmed into the ROM portion of the chip at the time of the manufacture and generally cannot be altered. There exist several different smartcard operating systems. Between the operating system and the application is an application programming interface API the message management process through which the operating system and the applications interact. The operating system and breadth of applications on the smart chip are not necessarily important to the merchant and card user as long as it is an open platform that can interface with a Smartcard reader and provide payment information to the merchant s POS terminal.

Software applications on the chip are designed for security and to process transactions. Additional applications or information may be added by the issuing bank or potentially the card holder such as a loyalty program a stored value application an e ticket program or a secure access verification program. When the Smartcard is used to transact payment a point of sale POS device often requires a PIN to authenticate the user. Conventional debit and ATM networks authenticate the PIN entered by the cardholder using a back end network e.g. the POS device contacts directly or indirectly the financial network of the user that corresponds to the account number stored in the smartcard. The financial network authenticates the PIN number by comparing the account number and the PIN number associated with the account number to the PIN number entered by the user since the PIN is not stored on debit ATM cards. Unlike an ATM transaction in a Smartcard transaction a PIN entered by the user is authenticated by the security system resident on the chip which examines secure information stored in the chip and compares it to the entered PIN number.

According to ISO standards a smartcard chip operates in one of two modes either in contactless mode or in contact mode. In contactless mode a smartcard chip is enabled to send and receive wireless communications e.g. radio signals through a first data channel or data channel device . In contact mode a smartcard chip is enabled to send and receive direct contact communications e.g. electrically coupled signals through a second data channel. Generally a smartcard is pre programmed to operate in a contactless mode and contact mode in conformance with ISO standards.

For example when using a Smartcard to purchase goods the consumer will hand their Smartcard to a merchant and the Smartcard is inserted into a Smartcard reader. The chip contains certain contact points that line up with the Smartcard reader to transfer information. For cards that have both a magnetic stripe and the chip the Smartcard reader may be programmed to utilize the chip technology over the magnetic stripe since the chip is more secure. If the Smartcard contains both credit and debit applications the cardholder must first select a payment method. At this point the smart chip and record reader communicate to determine several things such as whether the terminal has on line authorization capabilities whether the card is authentic and processing restrictions e.g. expiration date.

The card communicates to the reader the type of risk management checks that the card issuer wants to be performed such as the floor limit random online processing and a velocity check that determines whether an on line authorization is necessary. Next the POS terminal requests authorization via the back end processing network that connects to the seller s financial institution home office or bank if necessary just like magnetic stripe card. Upon approval the Smartcard reader and the smart chip may exchange additional information such as reward points or e coupons for the next purchase. This information is then stored on the smart chip for future use or could be used for the current transaction.

In contactless or wireless Smartcard applications information contained on the Smartcard is transferred in one direction. Information is provided to the Smartcard reader when the Smartcard is placed in close proximity to the Smartcard reader. For example a Mobil Speedpass smartcard is waved near a gas pump containing a reader to permit the user to purchase gasoline from the pump. When the Speedpass is placed near the gas pump the user s account information is wirelessly provided to a reader in the gas pump. The account information is then used for approval of and billing of a gasoline purchase that will follow.

In some applications information is transferred between the Smartcard and the Smartcard reader. For example commuters may use a Smartcard to pay for subway or bus transit where fares are conventionally paid at the beginning or conclusion of the metro transit. The Smartcard stores an electronic cash value on the card. When entering the metro the Smartcard is placed near the smart reader on a turnstile and the reader receives payment information from the Smartcard. The user provides no additional information to the Smartcard or Smartcard reader and does not take any further action affirming the transaction. If the Smartcard has at least a predetermined amount of electronic cash then the smart reader provides a signal to the Smartcard indicating the metro entry point and provides a signal to the turnstile permitting the user to enter. If there are not sufficient electronic funds then the Smartcard reader does not provide a signal to the turnstile and therefore the user is not permitted to enter. To exit the metro at the end of the transit the user places the Smartcard near the Smartcard reader of a turnstile. The Smartcard reader determines the fare by reading the entry point from the Smartcard and deducts the fare from the value of the electronic cash stored on the card. The Smartcard reader provides a signal to the turnstile permitting the user to exit.

As described above a contactless Smartcard can be used for information transactions e.g. subway or bus fare transit . However there is little to ensure that the person using the contactless Smartcard is the same person who owns the Smartcard. As Smartcards are typically pre programmed to operate in a contactless mode the information on a smartcard is available to be read by any device capable of reading smartcards. For example a valid subway card or Speedpass may be used by anyone in possession of the transit card Speedpass respectively even though the possessor of the transit card Speedpass may not be the owner of the transit card Speedpass. Therefore it would be desirable to have a contactless system that provides an increased level of security for the information contained within the Smartcard.

The present disclosure provides methods and apparatus for wireless transactions with increased security.

In an embodiment of the disclosure a smartlink module is provided to be coupled to a mobile communication device for providing the mobile communication device with the ability to transmit and receive wireless Smartcard communications to other Smartcard enabled devices. Once initialized the mobile communication device controls the smartlink module whereby the mobile communication device selectively enables the smartlink module to transmits information. The mobile communication device requires user authentication before enabling the smartlink module. The mobile communication device also authenticates the smartlink module before enabling the module In another embodiment the mobile communication device selects the information that will be provided by the smartlink. In yet another embodiment a mobile communication device is configured to be a wireless Smartcard transceiver.

In another embodiment of the disclosure a mobile communication device facilitates information transfer. Typically a mobile communication device mediates a financial transaction whereby the mobile communication device authenticates the user prior to providing the user s information as part of the transaction. In one aspect the mobile communication device requests approval of a financial transaction and when the approval is received the mobile communication device transmits the approval to seller to complete a transaction.

In another exemplary embodiment of the disclosure a mobile communication device is used to confirm a transaction. In this embodiment when a user conducts a transaction the user s mobile communication device is used to authenticate the user and confirm that the user is interested in completing the transaction.

In another exemplary embodiment of the disclosure a smartlink module is provided which comprises a smartcard processor where the processor includes a first data channel being adapted to wirelessly communicate data between said smartcard processor and a third party terminal and a second data channel said second data channel device being adapted to electrically couple said smartcard processor with a mobile communication device.

In the following detailed description reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the disclosure may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the disclosure and it is to be understood that structural logical or procedural changes may be made to the specific embodiments disclosed without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure.

Although not intended to be limiting a smartlink system in a preferred embodiment is a system that includes a smartlink server and smartlink capable device. A smartlink server is a computer or processing system that maintains information about users of smartlink capable devices. This information may include a user s account information device information and the like. The smartlink server is capable of communicating with a user s smartlink capable device through cellular communications as is conventionally known. The smartlink server is capable of communicating with other computer servers of seller s banks and other institutions through conventional means. A smartlink capable device can be any such embodiment or aspect of the disclosure described below.

The processing chip e.g. smartchip provides processing and memory storage including but not limited to data conversion processing. One feature of processing chip is that it converts data between radio waves and digital analog signals. Typically communication between contactless Smartcard devices utilizes radio waves in the form of digital packets. In a preferred embodiment processing chip converts data received in the form of radio waves by one of the antennae to data in the form of digital analog signals that are then provided to the mobile communication device through communication path and connection pin . Further the processing chip converts from data in the form of digital analog signals that are received from the mobile communication device through communication path and connection pin to the form of radio waves provided to the antennae that will be transmitted by one of the antennae . It is known with those with skill in the art how a processing chip converts data between the form of radio waves and the form of the digital analog signals utilized by a mobile communication device or other device incorporating a smartcard transceiver. For example a mobile communication device through the smartlink module can exchange information with a POS device not shown having a smartcard reader writer e.g. a smartcard transceiver. In a preferred embodiment the processing chip is similar to a smartcard chip in a conventional smartcard that conforms with ISO standards. Although generally described with processing chip performing processing steps the disclosure is not intended to be so limited. Processing may also be performed for example by a mobile communication device coupled to the processing chip or by a server.

The processing chip is preferably preprogrammed with an initialization program which is described more fully below. Further the processing chip in each smartlink module is pre programmed with a unique identification code which is coded on each processing chip . In a preferred embodiment the hard coding of the identification code occurs during manufacture. In other aspects the hard coding of the identification code occurs after the manufacture of the chip.

Antennas provide wireless communication with another device capable of sending and or receiving Smartcard signals. In a preferred embodiment one of antennas is used for very short range communications where the distance between the antennae and an other smartcard transmitter receiver e.g. a POS unit contactless module is only a few inches. The other of the antennae is used for longer range communications where the distance between the antennae and the other transmitter receiver is several feet. In a preferred embodiment a smartlink module will use conventional contactless Smartcard radio frequencies as established by ISO standards 125 kHz and 13.56 Mhz for respectively transmitting to and receiving signals from other contactless Smartcard devices. Although the disclosure is described with a number of antennae used in particular manner and utilizing certain frequencies the disclosure is not intended to be so limited it is anticipated that any antenna configuration at any frequency can be employed.

Communication connection pins provide electronic coupling between the smartlink module and a mobile communication device. The communication connection pins are adapted to couple with communication pins or the port of a mobile communication device . The number and location of communication connection pins is dependent on the particular mobile communication device that the smartlink module is intended on being coupled with. The communication connection pins are electronically coupled to the chip by communication paths respectively. Although shown with two communication paths the number of communication paths can vary.

Mounting clips provide physical coupling between the smartlink module and a mobile communication device as seen in . The number and location of mounting clips is dependent on the particular mobile communication device that the smartlink module is intended on being coupled to. Although described as clips the disclosure is not intended to be so limited and may incorporate any appropriate method of fastening that couples the smartlink module to a mobile communication device .

The housing of a smartlink module in a preferred embodiment is one inch wide by one quarter of an inch tall by one quarter of an inch deep. However the actual dimensions of the housing can vary. The housing can be constructed of various materials however in a preferred embodiment the housing is constructed from plastic. When a user requests a smartlink module for use with the user s mobile communication device the user indicates the make and model of the user s mobile communication device to a smartlink module provider e.g. a supplier retailer wholesaler financial institution . The user is provided with a smartlink module with a housing adapted to the particular make and model of mobile communication device . Further the number and location of communication connection pins the connection clips and communication paths is dependant to the mobile communication device . In another aspect the smartlink module is universally adaptable.

In one aspect of the disclosure the mobile communication device controls the operation of the processing chip . The mobile communication device provides a signal to the processing chip indicating that the processing chip should be operating in either contactless or contact mode. In contactless mode the processing chip is enabled to send and or receive wireless signals. In contact mode the processing chip is enabled to send and or receive direct electrically coupled signals. In a preferred embodiment a mobile communication device controls the processing chip through the use of an application program that resides on the mobile communication device . For example after the mobile communication device is initialized as described below a Secure transfer program resides on the mobile communication device . The Secure transfer program resides as an executing process in the background of programs executing on the mobile communication device as a background process until activated for a transaction process at which time the Secure transfer program resides in the foreground. When a transaction process is completed the Secure transfer program again resides as a background process.

To use the smartlink module with a mobile communication device requires that the smartlink module and mobile communication device combination first be initialized. When the smartlink module is preferably provided to a user an initialization program resides in the chip . Alternatively for example a user can download the initialization program through the mobile communication device via the cellular link by dialing a designated telephone number and then receiving an initialization application downloaded to the mobile communication device. Alternatively a user may link a mobile communication device to another source that provides access to an initialization application.

Initialization occurs a first time that a smartlink module is coupled to the mobile communication device and the mobile communication device is subsequently activated. For example when the smartlink module is first coupled and the mobile communication device is activated an initialization program within the processing chip of the smartlink module is activated. The initialization program provides the processor of the mobile communication device with an application from the smartlink module that generally includes two pieces of information the address of the location from which to download information e.g. a phone number to call a link or server connected to a location and information on how to access a cellularly connected or internet connected server located at a unique mobile IP address.

The second piece of information is the unique identification of the smartlink module and possibly the user s financial transaction identification e.g. a bank account number or credit card number of the user. The initialization program on the mobile communication device initiates a call to the user s financial institution transaction company e.g. the bank or credit card company that issued the smartlink module or an institution that will be financially responsible for payments. The mobile communication device provides the bank the two pieces of information as well as the unique identification of the mobile communication device e.g. the Electronic serial number. The mobile communication device receives from the bank several pieces of data including for example the user s name address phone and other information about the user which are stored in the mobile communication device . The bank also provides to the mobile communication device an application e.g. a secure transfer program that resides in the mobile communication device and enables the use of the smartlink module with the mobile communication device as described in greater detail below.

The initialization program running on the mobile communication device prompts the user for a PIN number that is stored within the mobile communication device . The PIN number may also be provided to the bank and also stored at the bank. The PIN number is for example a series of at least four alphanumeric characters. The PIN number helps prevent undesirable access to the user s information stored in the mobile communication device . In another aspect the initialization continues to enable additional features. A user s PIN information e.g. password is different from said user s personal information e.g. financial account information credit card .

During initialization of the smartlink module and mobile communication device identifying information of the mobile communication device e.g. the ESN or manufacturer serial number is stored in the smartlink module . The identifying information of the mobile communication device can be supplied in many ways including for instance from the financial institution from the user during initial application for a smartlink or subsequently when accessed by the application. Also during initialization identifying information of the smartlink module e.g. The smartlink module identification code is stored in the mobile communication device . In a preferred embodiment this identifying information stored in the mobile communication device and smartlink module cannot be deleted or modified after it is first stored.

The mobile communication device also requires an application program for a mobile communications device to operate the smartlink module . In a preferred embodiment an application program is loaded into the mobile communication device through a cellular connection and then stored within the mobile communication device. For example during initialization a Secure transfer program is downloaded into the mobile communication device . Preferably after the Secure transfer program is downloaded to the mobile communication device the program begins execution as a back ground.

After the initialization successfully occurs and during subsequent use of the mobile communication device the smartlink module is mated to the mobile communication device . A program in the smartlink module compares the identifying information of the mobile communication device currently coupled to the smartlink module to the stored identifying information of the mobile communication device . The smartlink module is enabled to send and receive signals only if the current mobile communication device identifying information corresponds to the stored mobile communication device identifying information. Similarly during subsequent use of the mobile communication device a Secure transfer program in the mobile communication device compares the identifying information of the smartlink module currently coupled to the mobile communication device to the stored identifying information of the smartlink module . The mobile communication device is enabled to send and receive signals to the smartlink module only if the current smartlink module identifying information corresponds to the stored smartlink module identifying information. In a preferred embodiment the respective programs that compare the identification numbers are part of the circuitry of the smartlink module and mobile communication device respectively.

As seen in a smartlink module is coupled to a mobile communication device . A PO transaction device e.g. a credit card reader or a cash register is coupled to a Smartcard enabled radio transmitter receiver device e.g. a contactless Smartcard receiver transmitter. The device provides communication between the smartlink module of the mobile communication device and the PO transaction device . The POS transaction device provides data to the radio device the radio device provides the data in the form of radio transmissions to the smartlink module . The smartlink module provides radio transmissions to the radio device the transmissions received by the radio device are converted by the radio device into a form recognizable by the POS device and provided to the POS device .

In the following process the operation of the processing chip converting data from to radio waves to digital analog electrical signals takes place in the background of process although no specific process segment is specifically mentioned. as show in 

In segment S the secure transfer program waits for a signal from a mobile communication device by the user. It is assumed that before the process begins the secure transfer program is running as a process in the mobile communication device . The precursor steps to segment S are that the user begins to purchase goods in a conventional manner. The goods are processed by the sales person at their register. When the processing of goods is complete e.g. all the goods have been scanned the items are totaled. The sales person then prompts the user for the method of payment. The process continues to segment S.

In segment S the user performs a key sequence on a mobile communication device coupled with the smartlink module appropriate to activate the smart transfer program. Process continues to segment S.

In segment S the secure transfer program recognizes the key sequence and the secure transfer program become active and executes as a foreground process in the mobile communication device. Process continues to segment S.

In segment S the secure transfer program prompts the user for his PIN number. The process continues to segment S. When the user enters his PIN number. The process continues to segment S.

In segment S the secure transfer program compares the PIN number entered against the PIN number stored in the mobile communication device. If the comparison indicates that the PIN number matches then process proceeds to segment S.

In segment S the secure transfer program of the mobile communication device provides a control signal to the coupled smartlink module to enable contactless mode. With the smartlink module in contactless mode the smartlink module is enabled to transmit e.g. provide information stored in the smartlink module . The process continues to segment S.

In segment S the user places the mobile communication device near the seller s smartcard reader associated with the seller s POS device . The process continues to segment S.

In segment S the seller s smartcard reader receives information transmitted from the user s smartlink module . The process continues to segment S.

In segment S using the information received from the smartlink module the seller s device provides that information to the seller s financial institution server and traditional processing POS transaction processing begins as is conventionally known . The process continues to segment S.

In segment S the system tests whether the transaction has been approved by the buyer s financial institution server . The process continues to segment S.

In segment S in another aspect of the disclosure the buyer s and or seller s financial institution server provides an electronic receipt to the user s mobile communication device . The receipt is preferably provided in the form of a digital communication e.g. SMS that is stored in the mobile communication device . In yet another aspect of the disclosure the user can pre define the option where a digital receipt is sent via email to an email account of the user with the possibility of automatically synchronizing the information with any standard accounting software. In another aspect of this embodiment the seller s financial institution server communicates with the user s financial institution server and the user s financial institution server sends an SMS to the mobile communication device . The process then continues to segment S.

In segment S the transaction is identified by the system as being complete and the secure transfer program stops running as a process in the foreground of processes in the mobile communication device and begins running as a background process. The secure transfer program awaits another signal indicating the start of another transaction. In another aspect of the disclosure the secure transfer program ceases execution.

Thus information stored in the smartlink module is maintained more securely as the module is only in contactless mode for a short amount of time thereby minimizing the amount of time that a smartcard reader other than the intended reader can potentially access the information stored on the smartlink module. Further the smartlink module is in contactless mode only after a user has provided a correct password.

In another aspect of the disclosure the processing chip and or one or both antennae of the smartlink module are located partially or fully within the housing of a mobile communication device and additionally may not be housed in a housing . In another aspect one or both antennae are omitted and the smartlink module utilizes either of the antennae of coupled mobile communication device or a different antennae connected to the processing chip . In yet another aspect a processing chip is incorporated as part of the circuitry of a mobile communication device or the processing chip may be separate but connected to the mobile communication device for communications purposes. In still another aspect of this embodiment of the disclosure the smartlink device is coupled to a mobile communication device port where the port permits communication with the mobile communication device . Further the port is at least partially within the housing of the mobile communication device . For example the port is a spring board in a Handspring device.

In another aspect of this embodiment the processing chip is disposed in a non cellular communication device NCC device i.e. device that does not have a cellular connection. In this aspect of the disclosure the NCC device operates differently from the operation of the exemplary embodiment of the disclosure described with reference to FIGS. in that in this aspect the secure transfer program does not receive a transaction confirmation signal from the user s or seller s bank. The NCC device provides financial transaction information to the POS device through Smartcard reader and the POS device initiates the conventional back end processing of financial transactions. The POS device may provide a transaction confirmation signal to the NCC device when the transaction is successful. The operation of the confirmation process would be similar to that as described with reference to however the NCC device would not receive a signal e.g. an SMS signal providing a receipt for the transaction Segment S .

Smartlink module includes a translation circuit . Translation circuit facilitates communication between a mobile communication device and processor chip . In a preferred embodiment the translation circuit is a core logic circuit Although off the shelf core circuit can be used ASICs can also be utilized. With the use of the translation circuit the mobile communication device can write data to and read data from the smartlink module . In the embodiment of the disclosure described above a user s personal data is stored in the smartlink module . In this embodiment of the disclosure the secure transfer program of the mobile communication device provides data to the smartlink module . The secure transfer program of the mobile communication device reads data from the smartlink module . In a preferable use of this embodiment the mobile communication device provides a user s personal information to the smartlink module shortly before it is needed for use i.e. before the smartlink module provides the information. Preferably shortly after the personal information is provided the information is removed e.g. deleted from the smartlink module. Since a user s personal information is only temporarily stored in the smartlink module the user s personal information is more securely stored by remaining most of the time only in the mobile communication device . Additionally since a user s data is only temporarily maintained in the smartlink module the need to securely maintain the smartlink module is decreased. Therefore the smartlink module need not always have its contactless mode be disabled to provide additional safeguards for a user s information.

Additionally since the secure transfer program can write selected information to the smartlink module the secure transfer program and or the user can choose what information is provided to the smartlink module . For example for a financial transaction a user may have several different financial accounts that he has stored information in the mobile communication device . Therefore when making a purchase he may choose which financial account he would prefer to make his payment with e.g. American Express or VISA. Additionally in the initialization process which is similar to that described above with reference to a previous embodiment of the disclosure the smartlink module is not coded with a user s account information.

As part of the operation of the mobile communication device coupled with the smartlink module the processing chip is in conformance with the ISO standards which does not permit a Smartcard chip to operate in both contactless mode and contact mode at the same time. Consequently to transfer information from the mobile communication device to the smartlink module when the smartlink module is in contact mode the secure transfer program provides information to the smartlink module . After the secure transfer program provides a signal to the smartlink module enabling the smartlink module to operate in contactless mode the information recently provided by the secure transfer program is able to be read by a third party smartcard reader if within appropriate proximity. 

In segment S the secure transfer program awaits a signal from a device or from the mobile communication device as initiated by the user. The precursor steps are that the customer begins to purchase goods in a conventional manner. The goods are processed by the sales person at their register. When the processing of goods is complete e.g. all the goods have been scanned the items are totaled. The sales person then prompts the user for the method of payment. The process continues to segment S.

In segment S the mobile communication device with the coupled smartlink module is placed near the device . The device transmits a signal that can be received and recognized by the mobile communication device and smartlink module combination. The transmitted signal may be for example the total purchase price of the goods. The process continues to segment S.

In segment S the secure transfer program awaits a signal from the device . When a signal is received from the device then the process continues to segment S.

In segment S the secure transfer program recognizes the signal from the device and sends a handshaking signal back to the device . The device then sends a signal to the secure transfer program for additional information. For example the signal may indicate the purchase price and then the mobile communication device displays the purchase price of the goods. The secure transfer program then prompts the user to see if the user agrees with the purchase price. The process continues to segment S. Alternatively in some cases all the POS can do is simply send a command to the smartlink to give it information and that it is a proper and certified POS and then receive the encrypted or unencrypted information.

In segment S the secure transfer program requests additional information from the user. If the user agrees to the purchase price as displayed by the register of the seller the secure transfer program requests the user input her his unique PIN number. If the user agrees and enters the appropriate PIN number then the secure transfer program extracts the secure financial data information e.g. the credit card number and associated transaction information that is stored in the mobile communication device or on the smartlink module . In either process the mobile communication device can prevent the smartlink module from communicating or sending information. The secure transfer program accesses the user s information and provides it to the processing chip of the smartlink module . The secure transfer program enables contactless operating mode and the processing chip converts that information received from the secure transfer program into a radio frequency and transmits it through its associated antennae one of . The user s secure financial data information stored in the mobile communication device is not provided without a valid PIN number. The mobile communication device and smartlink module provide the user s secure financial data information to the device . The process continues to segment S.

In segment S data is received from the mobile communication device and smartlink module by the device . The device provides the user s financial data information to the POS device and the transaction approval continues in a conventional manner. The process continues to segment S.

In segment S if the transaction has been approved by the seller s financial institution the POS system sends a signal to the smartlink module requesting confirmation. The smartlink module receives the signal from the POS system converts it from a radio signal to a digital signal and provides that signal to the mobile communication device . Assuming that the secure transfer program received the converted signal the user is then requested to confirm the amount of purchase in the user interface of the mobile communication device . In an other aspect of the disclosure the user taps the mobile communication device and that completes the process. The process continues to segment S.

In segment S the user is prompted to agree and confirm the purchase on mobile communication device . If the user agrees then the process continues to segment S. If the user does not agree the process continues to segment S.

In segment S the user has declined the purchase and the order is cancelled. The process continues to segment S.

In segment S the secure transfer program receives a digital receipt from device that is stored in the mobile communication device . In another aspect the seller s financial institution sends an SMS to the mobile communication device providing a digital receipt. In yet another aspect the user receives a paper receipt from the sales person. Alternatively the user can pre define the option where a digital receipt is sent via email to an email account of the user with the possibility of automatically synchronizing the information with any standard accounting software. In another aspect of this embodiment the seller s financial institution server communicates with the user s financial institution server and the user s financial institution server sends an SMS to the mobile communication device . The financial institution or credit card company or some other third party whoever is doing the transaction in the back end and or the seller has the ability to send a confirmation message generally in the form of a digital receipt.

In segment S the transaction is complete and the secure transfer program becomes a passive background process. Alternatively the secure transfer program shuts off and waits for the user to activate the smartlink via the mobile communication device to begin communications with the reader.

Thus at the end of the exemplary process depicted in a user has more securely provided his personal information needed for a financial transaction by only having the information stored in the smartlink module for a short period of time thereby minimizing the amount of time that a smartcard reader other than the intended reader can access the information stored on the smartlink module. Although the disclosures above are generally described with respect to financial transactions the disclosure is not intended to be so limited and can be used to increase the security of any type of data that can be stored in a mobile communication device.

In another embodiment of the disclosure a processing chip as shown in and antennae of a smartlink are located within the housing of a mobile communication device. In this enablement the antennae of the smartlink may be fully or partially within the housing of the mobile communication device. The antennae of the smartlink module may also be the antennae of the phone or different antennae connected to the processing chip . This embodiment differs from the prior embodiment in that the chipset of the smartlink module is incorporated as part of the circuitry of the mobile communication device or is separate but connected to the mobile communication device for communications purposes. For example the chipset is coupled to the mobile communication device circuit board. Further an antenna of the smartlink is coupled to the mobile communication device circuit board and is used for the smartlink transactions. In another aspect of this embodiment of the disclosure the smartlink device is coupled to a mobile communication device port where the port permits communication with the mobile communication device. Further the port is at least partially within the housing of the mobile communication device. For example the port is the spring board in a Handspring device.

In another embodiment of the disclosure a mobile communication device performs the functionality of a smartlink module as described above in reference to either smartlink module or whereby the mobile communication device can function as a radio transceiver providing and receiving radio signals. In a preferred embodiment the radio signals provided by the mobile communication device are smartcard compatible signals. depicts a partial cut away view of a mobile communication device in accordance with another exemplary embodiment of the disclosure. In this embodiment the mobile communication device includes a radio conversion circuit and antennae .

The conversion circuit is electronically coupled to a communication bus or processor of the mobile communication device through communication paths . Radio conversion circuit converts electronic signals received on communication paths to radio frequencies that it provides on one or both of antennae . Radio conversion circuit converts radio frequencies received on one or both of antennae to electronic signals provided on communication paths . The two communications paths shown are intended to be representative of any number of communications paths appropriate to exchange electronic signals between the conversion circuit and other part of the mobile communication device e.g. a data path or processor . Although shown with the conversion circuit coupled to antennae the conversion circuit is coupled to and utilizes the antennae of the mobile communication device and one or both of the antennae may be eliminated. The antennae are tuned to provide signals compatible with the smartcard.

Unlike the smartlink modules described in reference to the mobile communication device does not follow conventional smartcard communication standards requiring that the a device operating in one of either contact or contactless mode at a time e.g. ISO standards 7816 and 14443 . The mobile communication device operates as a smartcard transceiver eliminating the process of switching between contact and contactless operation modes. In the current embodiment of the disclosure the mobile communication device does not need to switch between contact and contactless operation.

In another embodiment of the disclosure as seen in a smartlink capable device i.e. this can be any device described above with reference to including the mobile communication device and smartlink module the mobile communication device and the smartlink module or the mobile communication device is depicted as a digital cash register which provides communication to the financial institutions of both the user and the other party. This embodiment of the disclosure differs from the previous embodiments in that with reference to the POS device communicates with the seller s financial institution server to process the transaction and determine whether the transaction was approved. In this embodiment the smartlink capable device communicates with the user s and the seller s financial institution server to process the transaction and determine whether the transaction was approved. Further the POS device communicates to the seller s financial institution server through the user s smartlink capable device combination device. The POS device is similar to a conventional point of sale device however it uses the smartlink capable device to provide communication to the seller s financial institution server to attain approval which is subsequently provided to the seller s POS device. The seller s POS system may later communicate with the seller s financial institution.

In another aspect of the disclosure the seller s POS may have limited communication and after the user s smartlink capable device provides the transaction information and the transaction is approved the seller s POS receives a digital signal from the seller s financial institution indicating that the transaction is approved. The digital signal may be in the form of an SMS.

In a preferred embodiment the signal to contact the seller s financial institution is transmitted by the user s smartlink capable device at substantially the same time the smartlink capable device transmits a signal to contact the user s financial institution server . For example both the seller s and the user s financial institutions are contacted where the signal to contact the seller s financial institution server is piggy backed to the signal to contact the user s financial institution server .

The POS device contains a contactless relay circuit e.g. a contactless Smartcard reader writer that receives and transmits wireless signals in substantially the same frequency as conventional Smartcard systems. The relay circuit transmits a sales request signal requesting payment. In a preferred embodiment the sales request signal from the relay circuit includes transactional information e.g. the cost of the transaction the identification of the payee of the sales transaction e.g. the seller and additional identifying information of the sales device . The relay circuit may receive a sales status signal indicating the payment has been made. The relay circuit may also receive a sales status signal indicating the payment has been denied. The relay circuit continuously transmits the sales request signal. Alternatively the relay circuit can be activated by the user pressing an activation button or requesting a specific item on the vending machine. In response the vending machine will request a form of payment transmit a sales request signal and begin to look for a signal from a smartlink or the user s smartlink capable device . Further the relay circuit continuously checks if a sales status signal has been transmitted by a smartlink capable device . As indicated above since a contactless smartlink communication system typically has a short communication range in order to effectively communicate between smartlink capable device and a relay circuit the smartlink capable device and the relay are placed in close proximity.

The smartlink capable device receives the sales request information signal from the relay circuit . The smartlink capable device queries the user whether they are interested in conducting the transaction. If the user is interested then the user enters his her PIN number indicating agreement.

Using the identification of the payee received from the relay circuit as part of the sales request signal the smartlink capable device contacts the user s financial institution and sends a signal requesting funds be transferred to the payee in the amount of the cost of the transaction. For example if cash is the tender then cash is transferred from the user s bank to the payee s financial institution where the payee s financial institution is identifiable as part of the identification of the payee of the sales transaction. The user has previously established at least one financial institution and relevant account information to be used for the transfer of funds. If more than one financial institution has been established then the user determines either before or during a transaction which financial institution will serve as the user s source of payment. When the transfer of funds has been successfully completed from the user s bank to the payee s financial institution the user s bank provides a signal to the user s smartlink capable device indicating that transfer payment has been made.

The smartlink capable device also communicates with the financial institution of the payee. Similar to communicating with the user s financial institution the smartlink capable device uses payee information e.g. payee identification identification of payee s financial institution received from the sales device and initiates communication with the payee s financial institution. In this embodiment the smartlink capable device combination device provides communication to both the user s and the payee s financial institution and therefore provides the identifying address of two financial institutions to the smartlink capable device s wireless communication server. Although described with reference to communicating with two financial institutions the number of financial institutions that the smartlink capable device can communicate with depends on the implementation and can vary. This information may also be provided to a third party or a third party server which may use the transaction information for other purposes e.g. or marketing information or to schedule supply or repair information .

When the payee s financial institution receives the appropriate amount of funds from the user s financial institution the payee s financial institution provides a signal to the user s smartlink capable device indicating that the appropriate funds have been received and provide a signal indicating the approval of the sales transaction. The smartlink capable device provides a sales status signal to the relay circuit of the sales device indicating that payment has been successfully made and been approved. Therefore a smartlink capable device requests the back end processing for the POS device and the POS device receives a signal from the smartlink capable device indicating that the sales transaction has been approved by the POS s financial institution.

For example a wireless relay circuit is incorporated as part of a payment system of a soda machine where the payment for the purchase of soda is done electronically as opposed to conventional soda machines where payment is done with the use of coins and bills and the payment system is receives money provides change and enables a purchase . The user activates a secure transfer program on his smartlink capable device and places the smartlink capable device in close proximity to the relay circuit of the soda machine The relay circuit is part of the soda machine s payment mechanism which in conventional applications processes coins and bills . The smartlink capable device receives a sales request signal from the relay circuit in the soda machine. The smartlink capable device displays the cost of the transaction and queries the user for approval or simply displays the transaction and may not state the amount just the transaction. Assuming the user continues to be interested in a soda the user enters his PIN number into the smartlink capable device . The smartlink capable device communicates with the user s financial institution to transfer money for soda to the payee s e.g. the owner of the soda machine financial institution. When the transfer of finds from the user s financial institution to the payee s financial institution is complete the user s financial institution signals the user s smartlink capable device that the transaction has been successful. Confirmation of the transfer may also be sent to the user via an SMS. After the user s smartlink capable device receives a signal confirming the transfer of funds the smartlink capable device provides the sales status signal to the relay circuit in the soda machine. In a preferred embodiment the sales status signal is a digital token that allows a purchase for a specific amount of money. Generally the amount of money will be predefined. After the relay circuit receives the sales status signal confirming the transfer of funds the relay circuit of the soda machine enables the user to select a soda which will then be provided to him. In other aspects the soda machine may have different prices for each soda.

A method of use includes the user selecting access control option entering his her PIN number and pressing OK tapping the mobile communication device on reader which is located on the door and the door is enabled to open e.g. the user is permitted access .

In the context of computer access which is secured by a smartlink system when the user s logs on to a computer the computer checks that the user is permitted access to the computer and determines if the user is part of a smartlink system. If the user is part of the smartlink system then the computer sends a message to a smartlink server requesting confirmation and authentication of the user. This message includes the identification provided by the user. The smartlink server sends a message to the user via SMS or digital means requesting confirmation of access to the computer. If user confirms and sends a message to the smartlink server then the smartlink server sends a confirmation message to the computer system. When the computer system receives confirmation signal from the smartlink server then the user is granted access to the computer. Therefore the computer does not directly contact the user to confirm access. The user is contacted indirectly where the smartlink server serves as the connection between the computer and the user s smartlink capable device .

In the context of physical access to a secured area the smartlink system is used to confirm identity. When a user attempts to enter an area secured by a smartlink system the user places his smartlink capable device close to the smartcard receiver transmitter that is coupled to a computer system controlling access to the secured area. After the computer system and the user s smartlink establishes communications the user is prompted by the secure transfer program to enter his PIN. The secure transfer program unlocks secure access information stored within the smartlink capable device and provides that information to the computer system. Upon receiving and confirming the user s access information the computer system enables the user s access to the secure area.

In another embodiment of the disclosure a smartlink transaction is initiated by a third party. In this aspect there are four elements of the system utilized to complete a transaction. A smartlink device a smartlink server a financial system and the seller s system. The smartlink device which in a preferred embodiment is a cellular mobile communication device or a similar mobile communication device is used by the customer to securely purchase items from a seller at a distance. As it is known a customer seeks to purchase items from a non brick and mortar environment where the customer does not visit the seller s actual location but instead accesses the seller through a form of communication system e.g. mobile communication device or Internet. After shopping and selecting certain items the customer confirms and processes the purchases of the selected items from the seller from a distance by use of a communication device coupled with smartchip similar to that described above. The seller s system is the computer system maintained or operated by or for a seller. A financial system is a method of financial payment that is correlated to the user of the smartlink device. The financial system may be for example a credit card bank or other financial institution. The seller may be for example a retail shop an online store or other brokerage and or transaction broker.

A method of using the smartlink transaction is described with respect to . It is known for a customer to log onto the Internet and purchase items from stores on the Internet. Typically the customer pays for the selected items by the use of a credit card by entering information into a web page or pages of the seller. Adding a smartlink transaction is initiated by a third party system. The security and reliability of the transaction is increased by strengthening the likelihood that a customer who is paying for a purchase with a financial instrument e.g. a credit card is also the owner of the credit card or acting under the authority of the owner of the credit card.

As seen in there are four elements of the remote payment confirmation system. A smartlink device a smartlink server a financial system server and the seller s system server . The smartlink device which in a preferred embodiment is a smartlink capable device similar to that described above. The seller s system server is the computer system maintained or operated by or for a seller. A financial system server is associated with the user s financial institution. The financial system may be for example a credit card a bank or an other financial institution. The seller may be for example a retail shop an online store or other brokerage and or transaction broker. In this embodiment of the disclosure a remote smartlink transaction is initiated by a third system e.g. the seller s system .

A method of using the remote smartlink transaction is described with respect to . As seen in in segment S a user selects the item s that he wishes to purchase. If for example the seller is an e merchant that is accessible on line the user may select a series of items from the choices provided by the seller and places them in his shopping cart. In another aspect a user may contact and select items from a seller by mobile communication device. In segment S the user proceeds to pay for the items chosen. In segment S the selected items for purchase are totaled.

In segment S the user selects a method of payment. In an on line purchase environment for example the user will select his preferred method of payment by clicking on the icon representing the payment method or otherwise indicating his decision. In a mobile communication device purchase environment for example the user will select the payment method by telling the seller or the seller s agent his preferred method of payment. In a preferred approach the user selects smartlink Financial as the preferred method of payment. The user s selection is received by the seller s system.

In segment S the seller s system determines what method was selected or chosen by the user and communicates with the respective server of the payment method. For example if the user chose VISA the seller s system will communicate with the VISA server. If the user selected smartlink Financial as the method of payment then the process continues to segment S.

In segment S the seller s system requests identifying information from the user. The identifying information is used to associate the user with the transaction. The identifying information can be for example a smartlink account number or the user s mobile communication device number that the user desires to use for the transaction. In segment S the seller s system communicates identifying information to a smartlink server. In segment S the smartlink system a receives the identifying information and determines the associated user.

In segment S the smartlink server will send the customer to the user s mobile communication device equipped with the smartlink system a signal asking if customer had requested to purchase some items from seller and requests confirmation. In a preferred embodiment this is a digital communication mostly likely in the form of an SMS. In segment S after receiving the SMS signal the user can send a signal back to the smartlink system confirming the transaction. In one aspect each item and possibly the price is displayed on the user s mobile communication device so that the user can confirm the purchase of each item. In another aspect the seller s information is displayed and the total purchase price is presented for the approval of the user. In segment S the smartlink awaits the confirmation signal s from the user. If and when the confirmation signal is received from the user the process continues to segment S. In segment S if user has declined then the purchase is canceled.

In segment S if user has accepted then process continues to segment S. In segment S the smartlink application will then request that the user enter his PIN number. In segment S if the PIN number is accepted then the smartlink application on the mobile communication device will unencrypt the information that is not unencrypted and the information which may be encrypted or unencrypted is then sent to the financial server with acceptance certificates and the server unencrypts. The user s financial information stored in the mobile communication device and transmits it to the smartlink server. The user s information sent to the financial server will be encrypted. In general the information sent to the financial server is for example an encrypted certificate and acceptance command as well as the user s information such as address name credit card number etc. This information will typically include the user s billing and preferred shipping address as well as contact information day and evening mobile communication device numbers possibly even an email address . In this aspect the user is not required to enter this information as part of a purchase but the information is added to the purchase as part of the smartlink exchange of information with the seller s server.

In segment S the financial institution s server communicates to the seller to confirm approval or the third party server s communicates to the financial institutions server to confirm the purchase and then the financial institution s server communicates to the sellers server this assumes that the financial institution has also approved the transaction i.e. that the user has a sufficient amount of funds or line of credit available for the desired transaction. The process continues to segment S.

In segment S once the transaction confirmation and approval is provided to the seller s server the user is provided a signal preferably a digital communication in the form of an SMS reflecting that a purchase has been processed from a specific store and can include total amount items etc. The process continues to segment S.

Thus a remotely conducted financial transaction is confirmed by contacting the user associated with the payment method and receiving confirmation from him. In another aspect the financial institution and the smartlink server are part of a single system. This is depicted in as Financial smartlink server . In yet another aspect a convention mobile user interface which does not include a smartlink module or embedded smartlink is used place of a smartlink capable device in a remotely conducted financial transaction as described with respect to .

In another aspect of the disclosure the user s smartlink system initiates and facilitates the processing of a financial transaction. The process is initiated when the user with a smartlink device approaches and taps places it very close to the smartlink device to the smartlink reader. The secure transfer program recognizes the process necessary that corresponding to the reader and starts that process. The user inputs their PIN to release encrypted information. The mobile communication device sends this information to the user s bank and to the seller s bank. Once the two banks communicate and the transaction is approved one of the banks sends a signal to the user s mobile communication device with a certificate to show authenticity and an electronic token which represents a certain value . The mobile communication device is tapped on the smartcard reader and sends this information to the smartcard reader relay circuit. The smartcard reader processes the transaction if the certificate and the value are appropriate.

Many of the advantages of the present disclosure are apparent when looking at some of the many different applications of the present disclosure. Not limited to sales the methods and apparatus described above can be used for any financial or information transaction access control of systems and facilities access or remote access to information warehouses such as medical database etc. For example the methods and apparatus described above can be used to transfer money from the user s account to another party s account where the information necessary to conduct the transaction is transferred to the user s mobile communication device by placing the user s mobile communication device in close proximity to the other party s mobile communication device. Both the user s mobile communication device and the other party s mobile communication device have secure cellular network connections to the financial institution s servers. All transactions can be tracked so if a user provides another party with a balance transfer the transaction is tracked to show where the funds are transferred to. As in conventional funds transfers the user s and other party s financial institution records transactions and the records of these transactions are maintained by the respective financial institutions.

In another aspect of the disclosure the secure transfer program has more than one type of transaction that it can process. For example the secure transfer program can process POS sales and also process access control. In an aspect when the secure transfer program becomes active e.g. after receiving a signal in a smartcard frequency from a smartcard receiver transmitter the secure transfer program will prompt the user to select which type of process the user would like to conduct. Once selected the secure transfer program then executes the appropriate process.

In another aspect of the disclosure the secure transfer program will recognize the appropriate type of transaction that the user is most likely interested in conducting. In this aspect a signal from a smartcard receiver transmitter will include an identification of the context or type of transaction system that it is a part of. When the secure transfer program is not already executing a process and it receives a signal from a smartcard receiving transmitter the program will examine the signal to determine if it contains information identifying the context of the transaction. If the signal does include contextual information then the secure transfer program begins a confirmation process for that context. For example in a point of sale context the POS smartcard receiver transmitter will transmit signals that includes a signal indicating that the context is POS. If the secure transfer program identifies the context as a POS then the secure transfer program will commence the confirmation process.

While the disclosure has been described and illustrated with reference to specific exemplary embodiments it should be understood that many modifications and substitutions could be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure even though a particular embodiment is not specifically described. For example the different processing segments described above are not limited to those segments or that order of segments segments may be omitted and still maintain the spirit and scope of the disclosure. Although generally the description above refers to a processing chip it should not be so limited and can include many other implementations and instrumentalities. The chip could be for example a microprocessor an integrated circuit transceiver or module. Although the disclosures above are generally described with respect to financial transactions the disclosure is not intended to be so limited and can be used to increase the security of any type of data that can be stored in a mobile communication device. Although described as a mobile communication device and the disclosure is not so limited and can include various mobile user interfaces including cellular phones mobile communicators personal digital assistants portable processing devices keyboard keypads and biometric devices.

Additionally although several different embodiments and aspects of the disclosure are described above the methods of use are applicable to every variation of the disclosure although each embodiment may require a modification of the methods of necessary to be adapted to each disclosure. Further adaptation of the methods of use may be required for the use of the disclosure in different contexts.

Additionally although examples are described with respect to the transfer of funds the disclosure is not so limited and the implementation of the disclosure may also include acceptance of credit. For example the user s financial institution may provide the seller with a indication that maybe will be made at a future date and seller s will accept this indication and permit a transaction to continue as if the money had actually been transferred. This most likely would be occur where the user s financial institution is a credit card company the credit card company may not pay transfer funds contemporaneous with the user s purchase but instead may transfer funds at a later time. Although not expressly indicated the secure transfer program in each embodiment and or aspect of the disclosure may be different. The program may also vary depending on the type and model of mobile communication device used. Further there are different methods of confirming the processing e.g. getting approval with the use of the embodiments described above and the disclosure is not intended to be so limited. Although the embodiments are generally described with respect to a seller s computer system communicating with a financial institution the disclosure is not intended to be so limited and the seller s system can communicate with more than one financial institution.

Additionally in many of the aspects described above a non communication device can be used in place of a mobile communication device. For example a personal digital assistant can be coupled with a smartlink module. Furthermore although the above descriptions refer to confirmation authentication of an owner and or user the disclosure is not meant to be limited to the actual owner user. For example a user tells a third party his PIN number so that the third party can use the user s mobile communication device to perform a transaction. e.g. purchase a soft drink . Although some of the disclosures are described as having devices or circuit being in compliance with established standards e.g. ISO standards the disclosure is not intended on being so limited. For example a mobile communication device may communicate with a smartlink processing chip in a contact mode following ISO standard 7816. However the operating system in a mobile communication device maybe designed to communicate with the processing chip in a contact mode using any conventional communication standard.

Furthermore in the processes methods of use descriptions above separate processes segments may be combined into a single process segments therefore reducing the number distinct processes segments and visa versa process that are represented as a single segment may be broken down into a plurality of segments. When a description above refers to a transfer of money this is not meant to be limited to an actual transfer of money but may include other transfers including where the transferee may anticipate that the transfer will occur and approve the transaction before the money is transferred.

In the descriptions above a secure transfer program may be a single program or application a program application with sub programs and or sub applications or it may be many programs and or applications. A secure transfer program may have different requirements to properly execute the appropriate transaction process. For example a secure transfer program for a vending machine context is likely to be different from a secure transfer program for a point of sale scenario. Additionally the selection of the appropriate secure transfer program for a transaction context may be done manually by a user or it might be done automatically by a secure transfer program recognizing the context in which it is being used. An automatic recognition feature may be based on a secure transfer program recognizing and identifying a signal from a smartcard transceiver. For example a secure transfer program of a mobile communications device will recognize the context as a vending machine when the mobile communication device is held dose enough to the vending machine and the mobile communications device receives a signal from the vending machine and identifies that signal as coming from a vending machine.

Additionally although not necessarily expressly stated in the embodiments and aspects of the disclosure described above a smartlink system is intended to generally include a mobile communications device with a smartlink module or smartlink module functionality and a smartlink server. In the preferred embodiments the smartlink server is a computer system which stores information of a user and can communicate with the mobile communication device of the user by cellular connection or other appropriate means. The smartlink server can communicate with third party computer systems e.g. of a seller or other third party to exchange information and or to provide and or receive payment.

Accordingly the disclosure is not to be considered as limited by the foregoing description but is only limited by the scope of the claims.
